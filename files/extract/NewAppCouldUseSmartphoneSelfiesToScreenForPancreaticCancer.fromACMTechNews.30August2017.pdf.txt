Detecting pancreatic cancer without any physician to read and assist the final patient...Is this a good idea?Finally, it's more a jaundice detector than a real pancreatic cancer discriminator!!! Not exactly the same story, to say the least!!!

Very cool! Could this technology help detect other conditions that cause jaundice and high bilirubin levels, like
liver failure? Or is it only really useful for pancreatic cancer given the lag time in detecting the disease?

Great, but why can't I find the app? It doesn't show up in store. I have an Oculus Gear VR that this should
work with and a family member that died from Pancreatic cancer yet here I sit unavle to try this test, probably
because someone somewhere is either afraid of being sued, missing out on a buck, or being sued for

keeping someone else from missing out on a buck...

The app is described in a paper to be presented Sept. 13 at Ubicomp 2017, the Association for
Computing Machinery’s International Joint Conference on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing.
