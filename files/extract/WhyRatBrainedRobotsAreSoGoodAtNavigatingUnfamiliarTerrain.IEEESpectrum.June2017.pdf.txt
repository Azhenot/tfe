drivers still have to take control in heavy rain or snow,

So why can’t a robot be more like a rat?

The answer is, it can. At the , in

Brisbane, Australia,  and his

collaborators have spent the last 14 years honing a robot navigation system modeled on the brains of rats.

This biologically inspired approach, they hope, could help robots navigate dynamic environments

without requiring advanced, costly sensors and computationally intensive algorithms.

Queensland University of Technology (QUT) (https://www.qut.edu.au/)

Michael Milford (https://wiki.qut.edu.au/display/cyphy/Michael+Milford)

An earlier version of their system allowed an indoor package-delivery bot to operate autonomously for

two weeks in a lab. During that period, it made more than 1,100 mock deliveries, traveled a total of 40

kilometers, and recharged itself 23 times. Another version successfully mapped an entire suburb of

Brisbane, using only the imagery captured by the camera on a MacBook. Now Milford’s group is

translating its rat-brain algorithms into a rugged navigation system for the heavy-equipment maker

, which plans to deploy it on a fleet of underground mining

vehicles.

At the time, one of the big pushes in robotics was the “

” 

: If you take a robot and move it somewhere else, can it figure out

where it is? One way to solve the problem is SLAM, which stands for 

. While running a

SLAM algorithm, a robot can explore strange terrain, building a map of its surroundings while at the

same time positioning, or localizing, itself within that map.

Wyeth had long been interested in brain-inspired computing, starting with work on neural networks in

the late 1980s. And so he and Milford decided to work on a version of SLAM that took its cues from the

rat’s neural circuitry. They called it RatSLAM.

There already were numerous flavors of SLAM, and today they number in the dozens, each with its own

advantages and drawbacks. What they all have in common is that they rely on two separate streams of

In a two-week-long experiment, an experimental

package-delivery robot running the RatSLAM algorithm, which

mimics how a rat navigates, made more than 1,100 mock

deliveries and traveled 40 kilometers.

Deliverance: 

data. One relates to what the environment looks

like, and robots gather this kind of data using

sensors as varied as sonars, cameras, and laser

scanners. The second stream concerns the robot

itself, or more specifically, its speed and

orientation; robots derive that data from sensors

like rotary encoders on their wheels or an inertial

measurement unit (IMU) on their bodies. A SLAM

algorithm looks at the environmental data and

tries to identify notable landmarks, adding these to

its map. As the robot moves, it monitors its speed

and direction and looks for those landmarks; if the

robot recognizes a landmark, it uses the

landmark’s position to refine its own location on

the map.

But whereas most implementations of SLAM aim

for highly detailed, static maps, Milford and Wyeth

were more interested in how to navigate through an environment that’s in constant flux. Their aim wasn’t

to create maps built with costly lidars and high-powered computers—they wanted their system to make

sense of space the way animals do.

“Rats don’t build maps,” Wyeth says. “They have other ways of remembering where they are.” Those ways

include neurons called place cells and head-direction cells, which respectively let the rat identify

landmarks and gauge its direction. Like other neurons, these cells are densely interconnected and work

by adjusting their spiking patterns in response to different stimuli. To mimic this structure and behavior

in software, Milford adopted a type of artificial neural network called an attractor network. These neural

nets consist of hundreds to thousands of interconnected nodes that, like groups of neurons, respond to an

input by producing a specific spiking pattern, known as an attractor state. Computational neuroscientists

use attractor networks to study neurons associated with memory and motor behavior. Milford and Wyeth

wanted to use them to power RatSLAM.

They spent months working on the software, and then they loaded it into a Pioneer robot, a mobile

platform popular among roboticists. Their rat-brained bot was alive.

But it was a failure. When they let it run in a 2-by-2-meter arena, Milford says, “it got lost even in that

simple environment.”

 that RatSLAM didn’t have enough information with which to reduce

errors as it made its decisions. Like other SLAM algorithms, it doesn’t try to make exact, definite

calculations about where things are on the map it’s generating; instead, it relies on approximations and

probabilities as a way of incorporating uncertainties—conflicting sensor readings, for example—that

inevitably crop up. If you don’t take that into account, your robot ends up lost.

Milford and Wyeth realized

That seemed to be the problem with RatSLAM. In some cases, the robot would recognize a landmark and

be able to refine its position, but other times the data was too ambiguous. After not too long, the accrued

error was bigger than 2 meters—the robot thought it was outside the arena!

In other words, their rat-brain model was too crude. It needed better neural circuitry to be able to

abstract more information about the world.

“So we engineered a new type of neuron, which we called a ‘pose’ cell,” Milford says. The pose cell didn’t

just tell the robot its location or its orientation, it did both at the same time. Now, when the robot

identified a landmark it had seen before, it could more precisely encode its place on the map and keep

errors in check.

Again, Milford placed the robot inside the 2-by-2-meter arena. “Suddenly, our robot could navigate quite

well,” he recalls.

Interestingly, not long after the researchers devised these artificial cells, neuroscientists in Norway

announced the discovery of grid cells, which are neurons whose spiking activity forms regular geometric

patterns and tells the animal its relative position within a certain area. [For more on the neuroscience of

rats, see “

.”]

inspiration-in-rat-brains)

“Our pose cells weren’t exactly grid cells, but they had similar features,” Milford says. “That was rather

gratifying.”

Rat Race:

The robot tests moved to bigger arenas with greater complexity. “We did a whole floor, then multiple

floors in the building,” Wyeth recalls. “Then I told Michael, ‘Let’s do a whole suburb.’ I thought he would

kill me.”

Milford loaded the RatSLAM software into a MacBook and taped it on the roof of his red 1994 Mazda

Astina. To get a stream of data about the environment, he used the laptop’s camera, setting it to snap a

photo of the street ahead of the car several times per second. To get a stream of the data about the robot

itself—in this case, his car—he found a creative solution. Instead of attaching encoders to the wheels or

using an IMU or GPS, he used simple image-processing techniques. By tracking and comparing pixels on

sequences of photos from the MacBook, his SLAM algorithm could calculate the vehicle’s speed as well as

direction changes.

roads and could pinpoint exactly where the car was at any given moment. RatSLAM worked.

robotics.

But though RatSLAM created a stir, it didn’t set off a wave of research based on those same principles.

And when Milford and Wyeth approached companies about commercializing their system, they found

many keen to hear their pitch but ultimately no takers. “A colleague told me we should have called it

‘NeuroSLAM,’ ” Wyeth says. “People have bad associations with rats.”

That’s why Milford is excited about the two-year project with Caterpillar, which began in March. “I’ve

always wanted to create systems that had real-world uses,” he says. “It took a lot longer than I expected

for that to happen.”

Underground mines are among the harshest man-

made places on earth. They’re cold, dark, and

dusty, and due to the possibility of a sudden

collapse or explosion, they’re also extremely

dangerous. For companies operating in such an

extreme environment, improving their ability to

track machines and people underground is critical.

In a surface mine, you’d simply use high-precision

differential GPS, but that obviously doesn’t work

below ground. Existing indoor navigation systems,

such as laser mapping and RF networks, are

expensive and often require infrastructure that’s

difficult to deploy and maintain in the severe

conditions of a mine. For instance, when

Caterpillar engineers considered 3D lidar, like the

ones used on self-driving cars, they concluded that

“none of them can survive underground,” Smith

says.

One big reason that mine operators need to track

their vehicles is to plan how they excavate. Each

day starts with a “dig plan” that specifies the

amount of ore that will be mined in various

tunnels. At the end of the day, the operator

compares the dig plan to what was actually mined, to come up with the next day’s dig plan. “If you’re

feeding in inaccurate information, your plan is not going to be very good. You may start mining dirt

instead of ore, or the whole tunnel could cave in,” Smith explains. “It’s really important to know what

you’ve done.”

The traditional method is for the miner to jot down his movements throughout the day, but that means

he has to stop what he’s doing to fill out paperwork, and he’s often guessing what actually occurred. The

QUT navigation system will more accurately measure where and how far each vehicle travels, as well as

provide a reading of where the vehicle is at any given time. The first vehicle will drive into the mine and

map the environment using the rat-brain-inspired navigation algorithm, while also gathering images of

each tunnel with a low-cost 720p camera. The only unusual feature of the camera is its extreme

ruggedization, which Smith says goes well beyond military specifications.

Subsequent vehicles will use those results to localize themselves within the mine, comparing footage from

their own cameras with previously gathered images. The vehicles won’t be autonomous, Milford notes,

but that capability could eventually be achieved by combining the camera data with data from IMUs and

other sensors. This would add more precision to the trucks’ positioning, allowing them to drive

themselves.

The QUT team has started collecting data within actual mines, which will be merged with another large

data set from Caterpillar containing about a thousand hours of underground camera imagery. They will

then devise a preliminary algorithm, to be tested in an abandoned mine somewhere in Queensland, with

the help of Mining3, an Australian mining R&D company; the Queensland government is also a partner

on the project. The system could be useful for deep open-pit mines, where GPS tends not to work reliably.

If all goes well, Caterpillar plans to commercialize the system quickly. “We need these solutions,” Smith

says.

 relies on standard computing hardware to run its algorithms, although they

keep tabs on the latest research in neuromorphic computing. “It’s still a bit early for us to dive in,”

Will brain-inspired navigation ever go mainstream? Many developers of self-driving cars, for instance,

invest heavily in creating detailed maps of the roads where their vehicles will drive. The vehicles then use

their cameras, lidars, GPS, and other sensors to locate themselves on the maps, rather than having to

build their own.

Still, autonomous vehicles need to prove they can drive in conditions like heavy rain, snow, fog, and

darkness. They also need to better handle uncertainty in the data; images with glare, for instance, might

have contributed to a

 which rely on artificial neural networks, but it’s possible that

more brain-inspired approaches like RatSLAM could complement those systems, improving performance

in difficult or unexpected scenarios.

Carnegie Mellon’s Wettergreen offers a more tantalizing possibility: giving cars the ability to navigate to

specific locations without having to explicitly plan a trajectory on a city map. Future robots, he notes, will

have everything modeled down to the millimeter. “But I don’t,” he says, “and yet I can still find my way

around. The human brain uses different types of models and maps—some are metric, some are more

topological, and some are semantic.”

A human, he continues, can start with an idea like “Somewhere on the south side of the city, there’s a

good Mexican restaurant.” Arriving in that general area, the person can then look for clues as to where

the restaurant may be. “Even the most capable self-driving car wouldn’t know what to do with that kind

of task, but a more brain-inspired system just might.”

Some roboticists, however, are skeptical that such unconventional approaches to SLAM are going to pay

off. As sensors like lidar, IMUs, and GPS get better and cheaper, traditional SLAM algorithms will be able

to produce increasingly accurate results by combining data from multiple sources. People tend to ignore

the fact that “SLAM is really a sensor fusion problem and that we are getting better and better at doing

SLAM with lower-cost sensors,” says , CEO of 

, a company based in San Jose, Calif., that sells 

. “I

think this disregard causes people to fixate on trying to solve SLAM with one sensor, like a camera, but in

today’s low-cost sensor world that’s not really necessary.”

Even if RatSLAM doesn’t become practical for most applications, developing such brainlike algorithms

offers us a window into our own intelligence, says 

, a computer scientist at the  who

collaborates with Milford. He notes that standard computing’s von Neumann architecture, where the

processor is separated from memory and data is shuttled between them, is very inefficient.

Peter Stratton (http://researchers.uq.edu.au

/researcher/730) Queensland Brain Institute (https://qbi.uq.edu.au/)

“The brain doesn’t work anything like that. Memory and processing are both happening in the neuron.

It’s ‘computing with memories,’ ” Stratton says. A better understanding of brain activity, not only as it

relates to responses to stimuli but also in terms of its deeper internal processes—memory retrieval,

problem solving, daydreaming—is “what’s been missing from past AI attempts,” he says.

Milford notes that a lot of types of intelligence aren’t easy to study using only animals. But when you

observe how rats and robots perform the same tasks, like navigating a new environment, you can test

your theories about how the brain works. You can replay scenarios repeatedly. You can tinker and

manipulate your models and algorithms. “And unlike with an animal or an insect brain,” he says, “we can

see everything in a robot’s ‘brain.’ ”
