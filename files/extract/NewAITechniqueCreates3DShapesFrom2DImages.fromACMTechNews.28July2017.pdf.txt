AI computers may soon be able to

create new 3-D shapes just by looking

at two 2-D images, such as photos,

says Purdue University professor

Karthik Ramani, and also come up with

shapes for new images such as by

"hallucination." (Purdue University

WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. — A new

technique that uses the artificial

intelligence methods of machine learning

and deep learning is able to create 3-D

shapes from 2-D images, such as

photographs, and is even able to create

new, never-before-seen shapes.

Karthik Ramani

(https://engineering.purdue.edu

/ME/People/ptProfile?id=12331),

Purdue's Donald W. Feddersen Professor

of Mechanical Engineering, says that the

"magical" capability of AI deep learning is

that it is able to learn abstractly.

"If you show it hundreds of thousands of shapes of something such as a car, if you

then show it a 2-D image of a car, it can reconstruct that model in 3-D," he says. "It

New techniques for an old challenge!!!



Computers using a new artificial

intelligence technique developed at

Purdue University can create 3-D

shapes from 2-D images, such as these

photographs of airplanes. The

technique could help technologies such

can even take two 2-D images and create a 3-D shape between the two, which we

call 'hallucination.'"

When fully developed, this method, called SurfNet, could have significant

applications in the fields of 3-D searches on the Internet, as well as helping robotics

and autonomous vehicles better understand their surroundings.

Perhaps most exciting, however, is that the technique could be used to create 3-D

content for virtual reality and augmented reality by simply using standard 2-D

photos.

"You can imagine a movie camera that is taking pictures in 2-D, but in the virtual

reality world everything is appearing magically in 3-D," Ramani says. "Inch-by-inch

we are going there, and in the next five years something like this is going to

happen.

"Pretty soon we will be at a stage where humans will not be able to differentiate

between reality and virtual reality."

"You can imagine a movie camera that is

taking pictures in 2-D, but in the virtual

reality world everything is appearing

magically in 3-D," Ramani says. "Inch-by-

inch we are going there, and in the next

five years something like this is going to happen.

"Pretty soon we will be at a stage where humans will not be able to differentiate

between reality and virtual reality."

The computer system then learns both the 3-D image and the 2-D image in pairs,

and then is able to predict other, similar 3-D shapes from just a 2-D image.

"This is very similar to how a camera or scanner uses just three colors, red, green

and blue—known as RGB—to create a color image, except we use the XYZ

coordinates," he says.

Ramani says this technique also allows for greater accuracy and precision than

current 3-D deep learning methods that operate more using volumetric pixels (or

voxels).

"We use the surfaces instead since it fully

defines the shape. It's kind of an

interesting offshoot of this method.

Because we are working in the 2-D

domain to reconstruct the 3-D structure,

instead of doing 1,000 data points like you

would otherwise with other emerging

methods, we can do 10,000 points. We

are more efficient and compact."

One significant outcome of the research would be for robotics, object recognition

and even self-driving cars in the future; they would only need to be fitted with

standard 2-D cameras, yet still have the ability to understand the 3-D environment

around them.

Ramani says that for this research to be developed, more basic research in AI will

be needed.

"There's not a box of machine learning algorithms where we can take those and

apply them and things work magically," he says. "To move from the flatland to the

3-D world we will need much more basic research. We are pushing, but the

mathematics and computational techniques of deep learning are still being invented

and largely an unknown area in 3-D."

SurfNet: Generating 3D shape surfaces using deep residual networks

Ayan Sinha, MIT; Asim Unmesh, IIT Kanpur; Qixin Huang, University of Texas,

Austin; and Karthik Ramani, Purdue University

3D shape models are naturally parameterized using vertices and faces, i.e.,

composed of polygons forming a surface. However, current 3D learning paradigms

for predictive and generative tasks using convolutional neural networks focus on a

voxelized representation of the object. Lifting convolution operators from the

traditional 2D to 3D results in high computational overhead with little additional

benefit as most of the geometry information is contained on the surface boundary.

Here we study the problem of directly generating the 3D shape surface of rigid and

non-rigid shapes using deep convolutional neural networks. We develop a

procedure to create consistent ‘geometry images’ representing the shape surface of

a category of 3D objects. We then use this consistent representation for category-

specific shape surface generation from a parametric representation or an image by

developing novel extensions of deep residual networks for the task of geometry

image generation. Our experiments indicate that our network learns a meaningful

representation of shape surfaces allowing it to interpolate between shape

orientations and poses, invent new shape surfaces and reconstruct 3D shape

surfaces from previously unseen images.
