One way that languages are able to communicate a potentially infinite set of ideas through
a finite lexicon is by compressing emerging meanings into words, such that over time, indi-
vidual words come to express multiple, related senses of meaning. We propose that over-
arching communicative and cognitive pressures have created systematic directionality in
how new metaphorical senses have developed from existing word senses over the history
of English. Given a large set of pairs of semantic domains, we used computational models
to test which domains have been more commonly the starting points (source domains) and
which the ending points (target domains) of metaphorical mappings over the past millen-
nium. We found that a compact set of variables, including externality, embodiment, and
valence, explain directionality in the majority of about 5000 metaphorical mappings
recorded over the past 1100 years. These results provide the first large-scale historical evi-
dence that metaphorical mapping is systematic, and driven by measurable communicative
and cognitive principles.

1. Introduction

Every natural language faces the challenge of having to express a potentially infinite range of ideas through a finite set of
words (cf. von Humboldt, 1836; Chomsky, 1957; Pustejovsky, 1995). One way in which languages meet the challenge of
maintaining a compact lexicon is by compressing emerging, yet to be lexicalized ideas, into existing word forms. The most
common form of compression in the lexicon, both in English and in other languages, is polysemy: Cases where a single word
has multiple, related senses (e.g., Breal, 1897; Brugman, 1988; Geeraerts, 1997; Lakoff & Johnson, 1980; Pustejovsky, 1995;
Srinivasan & Rabagliati, 2015; Sweetser, 1991). One prominent mechanism that generates polysemy over the course of his-
tory is metaphorical mapping (e.g., Lakoff & Johnson, 1980), whereby new word meanings are created by mapping an existing
sense of a word from its own source domain to another target domain, based on structural similarities between the domains.
For example, the English word grasp originally conveyed a physical action (source), as in ‘‘grasp a fruit,” and was later
extended to express an abstract sense of understanding (target), as in ‘‘grasping an idea,” thus construing ideas as objects
that can be held and controlled. In the present study, we test whether there is systematic directionality in how newmetaphor-
ical senses have developed over the history of English. That is, given a pair of semantic domains, can we predict which

domain served historically as the source and which as the target of metaphorical mapping, based on considerations of
broader communicative and cognitive pressures?

Consistent with the idea that metaphorical sense extension is systematic, prior research (e.g., Lakoff & Johnson, 1980;
Sweetser, 1991) has suggested that mappings between semantic domains tend to be asymmetric: They occur in one direction
but not the other (e.g., for grasp, it is ‘‘action”?‘‘knowledge” but not ‘‘knowledge”?‘‘action”). However, directionality in his-
torical metaphorical mappings has not been evaluated at scale against records of historical semantic change, leaving open
whether metaphorical mappings truly reflect predictable patterns. Using an historical corpus of the English lexicon, we seek
to investigate – at a large scale – the historical directions of metaphorical mapping by testing whether some domains have
more commonly served as the starting points of historical extensions (the source domains) while others have more com-
monly served as the ending points (target domains). For example, in the case of grasp, the ‘‘physical action” sense first
appeared in English around 1300 CE, preceding the abstract sense of ‘‘understanding” that emerged around 1600 CE (Kay,
Roberts, Samuels, Wotherspoon, & Alexander, 2015a). Our analysis examines systematicity in the directionality of historical
metaphorical sense mappings in the English lexicon.

Directions of metaphorical mapping need not be systematic: Instead, the evolutionary path of meaning change could be
varied and unpredictable across words. Although some words, like grasp, may have begun with a relatively concrete sense
that was subsequently extended to a more abstract sense, other words may have been extended in the opposite direction,
from abstract to concrete senses. For instance, irritable initially conveyed an abstract sense of ‘‘anger,” as in an ‘‘irritable per-
son” (1662 CE; Kay et al., 2015a), but it was subsequently used to convey a more concrete, physical meaning, as in ‘‘irritable
skin” (1791 CE; Kay et al., 2015a). A particular word’s path could be shaped by the ever-changing cultural conditions and
resultant communicative needs that have caused words to develop new meanings across history (cf. Aitchison, 2001). The
contributing factors may be variable across words and across eras of history, resulting in little systematicity on a large scale.

However, an alternative possibility is that the direction of metaphorical sense extension is systematic, because it is
shaped by enduring functional pressures on language evolution. Recent work in computational cognitive science has sug-
gested that many aspects of language and cross-linguistic variation can be understood in terms of general design principles,
such as the need for linguistic structures to minimize cognitive effort and support informative communication and language
learning (Zipf, 1949; see also Kemp & Regier, 2012; Kirby, Tamariz, Cornish, & Smith, 2015; Piantadosi, Tily, & Gibson, 2011;
Regier, Kemp, & Kay, 2015). Applying this perspective to polysemy, systematic directionality in mappings may result from
language users minimizing the costs associated with communicating novel ideas and learning a lexicon: Mappings will tend
to be driven by their ease of construction, their effectiveness as communication devices, and/or their learnability by children.
The mappings should thus provide a cognitively economic and hence efficient device for compressing new ideas into an exist-
ing lexicon. If there is a consistent set of cognitive principles and processes underlying ease of construction, effectiveness for
communication, and/or learnability, recurring patterns of mappings should arise across domains and time.

But this perspective says little about what the underlying constraints on the directionality of metaphorical mappings
might be. An independent line of research, from cognitive psychology and linguistics, provides suggestions about the speci-
fics: Namely, that the processes that give rise to metaphorical polysemy may reflect conceptual structure (Lakoff, 1987;
Sweetser, 1991). One prominent proposal in this vein is Conceptual Metaphor Theory (CMT; Lakoff & Johnson, 1980;
Reddy, 1979), which posits that people reason about abstract concepts – such as ‘‘understanding” – via metaphorical map-
pings from knowledge domains that are more concrete and tied to bodily experience – such as ‘‘physical action.” Although
CMT is controversial as a theory of cognition, other theories also predict that concrete and embodied word senses will be
extended to more abstract senses because this type of extension may be the most useful for communication and learning
(Murphy, 1997; Srinivasan & Carey, 2010; Thibodeau & Durgin, 2008). For example, it could be easier to communicate about
something abstract – for which achieving shared reference is difficult – by analogically referring to a more concrete meaning,
for which shared reference is easier, and this advantage may apply in word learning as well as discourse processing. Further,
because concrete and embodied meanings tend to be frequent (Hanley, Hunt, Steed, & Jackman, 2013; cf. Winter, Thompson,
& Urban, 2014), they may be more readily retrieved as sources for meaning extension by speakers who need to communicate
a new idea.

Prior research has not explicitly linked the perspective of efficient language design with the study of the cognitive foun-
dations of polysemy or metaphorical mapping. We bridge this gap by analyzing directionality in a large set of metaphorical
mappings between source and target domains spanning 1100 years, dating from Old English to the present. To our knowl-
edge, this is the first large-scale study to evaluate the systematicity of the directionality in polysemous metaphorical map-
pings against the record of historical change in a lexicon. We expect that if metaphorical mapping provides an efficient
cognitive device for compressing ideas into a communicative and learnable lexicon, the historical directions of change
through which new senses are created for words should be highly systematic, and they should be explained by a compact
set of variables relevant to the cognitive processes involved in generating, learning, and using word meanings.

2. Methods

We identified six candidate variables from the literature that could explain directions of metaphorical mapping based on
communicative and cognitive considerations. We used human participants’ ratings of these variables to try to predict direc-
tions in metaphorical domain mappings recorded in the history of English. In the following, we describe: (1) each of the



Y. Xu et al. / Cognitive Psychology 96 (2017) 41–53 43
candidate variables, (2) the historical dataset of metaphorical domain mappings we used, and (3) a survey through which we
elicited ratings of the domains on each of the candidate variable dimensions.

2.1. Candidate variables

Three of the variables we considered as predictors are suggested by Conceptual Metaphor Theory (Lakoff & Johnson, 1980;
Reddy, 1979; Sweetser, 1991) and supported by other perspectives suggesting that certain types of meanings should more
commonly serve as sources of metaphorical extensions (e.g., Srinivasan & Carey, 2010, and Thibodeau & Durgin, 2008, as dis-
cussed above; see also Traugott, 1990).

1. Concrete ? Abstract. Word senses that refer to things perceived through the sensory systems should serve as a source of
metaphorical mappings, relative to ones labeling less perceptible referents.

2. Embodied ? Disembodied. Word senses that refer to things that are more directly experienced through our bodies should
serve as a source of metaphorical mappings, relative to ones that label referents that are less directly experienced.

3. External? Internal.Word senses that refer to entities in the external world should serve as a source of metaphorical map-
pings, relative to ones that label internal, mental entities, such as emotions or feelings.

An additional three variables were identified, based on the idea that metaphorical extensions tend to be communicatively
expressive:

4. Animate? Inanimate. Word senses that refer to animate entities may carry more expressive power than ones referring to
less animate entities, and may thus serve as a source of metaphorical mapping to convey salient features of target inan-
imate entities (Silverstein, 1976; Traugott, 2003).

5. Less valenced ? More valenced. If metaphorically-derived senses arise in part because of their expressive power, derived
senses should be more emotionally valenced than originating senses. This predicts that when word senses from source
domains are extended, the resulting senses in the target domain will have stronger valence (whether positive or negative;
Osgood, Suci, & Tannenbaum, 1964; Ullmann, 1957; cf. Hollis & Westbury, 2016).

6. More Intersubjective ? Less intersubjective. Intersubjectivity refers to the degree to which people experience something
the same way (Traugott, 1989, 2003). Word meanings that are more intersubjective (e.g. ‘‘wooden”) could be easier to
understand and establish shared labels for than ones that are less so (e.g., ‘‘beautiful”). They might thus serve as a source
of metaphorical mappings, relative to less intersubjective meanings.

Some of these variables are likely to be correlated, e.g., many of the same word meanings could be external, concrete,
intersubjective, and embodied. However, they are not identical. For example, ‘‘arm” and ‘‘table” are both highly concrete,
but arms are more directly and viscerally experienced than tables. Our analyses tease apart the relationships among these
variables in accounting for metaphorical mappings in the history of English.

2.2. Historical dataset of metaphorical mapping

We obtained data from the Metaphor Map of English (MME) database (Kay, Roberts, Samuels, Wotherspoon, & Alexander,
2015b), which identifies metaphorical mappings of senses classified by semantic domains over more than a millennium. The
MME database is derived from the Historical Thesaurus of English (HTE; Kay et al., 2015a), which records 793,742 word
form-sense entries as attested in the history of English. The HTE is, in turn, based on the second edition of the Oxford English
Dictionary (Simpson & Weiner, 1989).

All word senses in the MME database are classified into 415 distinct semantic domains (e.g. ‘‘textiles,” ‘‘digestive organs,”
‘‘anger,” ‘‘pride”) in rough accordance with the standard of semantic classification adopted by the HTE and Oxford English
Dictionary. All semantic domains from the database are sub-fields from three broader ontological domains: I. The external
world; II. The mental world; III. The social world. Section 1 includes semantic domains that concern readily observable phe-
nomena of the universe, such as the earth and sea. Section 2 includes domains that concern cognitive processes such as per-
ception and emotion. Section 3 includes domains that concern social systems such as the law and morality. Each specific
semantic domain defines a category of meaning that word senses can evolve from (source domain) or towards (target
domain), and a single domain can include multiple but distinct word senses. The construction of these domains has been
derived carefully from lexicographical data and gradually refined over a period of 40 years. For details of domain classifica-
tion, see work by the lexicographers of the HTE (p xviii-xx, Kay, Roberts, Samuels, & Wotherspoon, 2009).

The MME database records metaphorical mappings that have occurred between domains and provides a sample of words
that exemplify these domain mappings. Our analyses examined historical metaphorical mappings at the level of these
semantic domains – specifically between pairs of domains (and not at the level of individual words), evaluating whether
there has been systematicity in the directionality of domain-to-domain mappings. Each attested domain-to-domain map-
ping reflects the historical extension of word senses between two domains. Together, these mappings span an 1100 year per-
iod, from the Old English period around AD 800 through to the present era, around 1950 CE. Within the MME database,
metaphorical mappings are summarized separately for the Old English period (i.e., before 1100 CE), and in 50-year steps



44 Y. Xu et al. / Cognitive Psychology 96 (2017) 41–53
for the subsequent 800 years, providing 18 unique historical time points for our analysis. For further details regarding the
MME database, we refer the reader to the ‘‘About the project” page provided at http://mappingmetaphor.arts.gla.ac.uk/
about-the-project/.

Researchers of the MME database have found evidence for over 10,000 metaphorical domain mappings: Cases where
words in one domain were consistently used to describe another domain. Some of the records of domain mappings do
not contain full information about when the mappings occurred and what words were involved, and so they were eliminated
for purposes of our analyses. The final data set we used includes all of the approximately 5,500 recorded metaphorical map-
pings (downloaded as of October 21st, 2015, at http://mappingmetaphor.arts.gla.ac.uk/about-the-project/categories-com-
pleted/), among 400 semantic domains, that had complete information. See Supplemental Material for these domains.
Each entry in our data set records an attested metaphorical mapping between a pair of semantic domains that includes:
(1) source domain, (2) target domain, (3) earliest of period of extension between these domains, and (4) some sample words
that participated in this metaphorical extension.

The database indicates the historical direction of sense extension among each pair of semantic domains. Three types of
directions are recorded: (1) A? B, i.e. A is source domain and B is target domain; (2) A B, i.e. A is target and B is source; (3)
A M B, i.e. a bidirectional mapping. The bidirectional mapping constitutes only a small portion of the dataset (�7.5%), so we
focused on the directional cases (4960 unique pairs of domain-to-domain mappings) for our analyses. We examined whether
the mapping directions among semantic domains could be predicted from empirical ratings of the domains along the six can-
didate variable dimensions, based on an on-line survey that we describe next.

2.3. Survey for rating elicitation

We elicited ratings of the 400 semantic domains along the six candidate variables through an on-line survey (see Supple-
mental Material for experimental instructions). For each variable, participants rated each of the 400 domains on a seven-
point scale. Participants first read a definition of each domain (e.g., ‘‘Plant - A living thing that grows in the ground, usually
has leaves or flowers, and needs sun and water to survive”), assembled by consulting the Merriam-Webster Dictionary. Par-
ticipants then rated the domain on one of the six variables. For example, for concreteness, participants selected a number
between 1 and 7, where 1 represented ‘‘highly abstract,” 7 ‘‘highly concrete,” and 4 ‘‘intermediate.” Because of the large num-
ber of ratings we needed to elicit (400 domains x 6 variables), each participant only rated a random sample of 40 domains
along a single variable dimension.

Our research protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of California, Berkeley. Data were
collected from 1439 participants who self-reported as native English speakers, using the online Qualtrics experimental plat-
form (http://www.qualtrics.com/), disseminated via Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (https://www.mturk.com/mturk/). Follow-
ing standard protocol (Oppenheimer, Meyvis, & Davidenko, 2009), responses were excluded from participants who did
not respond correctly to three ‘‘catch” trials assessing attention to the task (n = 94). On average, we obtained 18 ratings
(SD = 2) for each of the domain-variable questions. Across all variables and domains, the mean standard deviation of ratings
was 1.6 (SD = 0.32), indicating a high level of inter-rater agreement. No substantial discrepancies in inter-rater agreement
were observed across the variables. For Animacy, the mean standard deviation across the different domain ratings was
1.8 (SD = 0.4); for Concreteness: mean = 1.6 (SD = 0.4); for Embodiment: mean = 1.9 (SD = 0.4); for Externality: mean = 1.3
(SD = 0.5); for Intersubjectivity: mean = 1.8 (SD = 0.3); for Valence: mean = 1.1 (SD = 0.3). See Supplemental Material for
the mean variable ratings for all 400 domains.

3. Computational analyses and results

To evaluate the hypothesis that the directionality of metaphorical mappings in history is systematic, we performed three
analyses: (1) We tested the extent to which directions of metaphorical extensions recorded in the historical data set are pre-
dicted by ratings along the six dimensions described above, either in isolation or in combination; (2) We then examined
whether the same ratings can be used to identify the semantic domains that have served as sources vs. targets of metaphor-
ical extensions, by collapsing data across time; (3) Finally, we examined the most dominant variable in explaining metaphor-
ical mappings across time, to assess whether its explanatory power has been consistent over the course of history. Next, we
describe the computational methods and results for each of these analyses.

3.1. Analysis I: Predicting directions of metaphorical mappings over history

In the first analysis, we examined whether rating differences along the six candidate variables might account for the
directionality of metaphorical mappings in history. That is, given a pair of domains for which metaphorical mapping has
been recorded, does knowing how each domain is rated on some variable dimension predict which domain will be the
source, and which the target? We performed this analysis by first treating each variable in isolation. We then combined
the variables to see if their combination could further account for the historical data.

To examine the explanatory power of the six candidate variables individually, we created a parameter-free model for each
of the variables that predicts the direction of metaphorical mapping between a given pair of semantic domains recorded in

HTE. This simple model calculates the difference in average ratings of a pair of domains along the variable dimension of
interest. It then makes a corresponding prediction about the direction in which meaning extension should take place in his-
tory (according to that psychological dimension), without requiring any adjustable parameter.

Apart from the valence model, the five other models predict that the domain with the higher mean rating along a certain
variable will be the source of metaphorical mapping, and the domain with the lower mean rating will be the target. For
instance, for the animacy variable, we predicted the direction of mapping to be Animate? Inanimate, such that between
any pair of domains (A,B) recorded in the historical data set, the domain that was rated as more animate on average (from
the survey described before) would more commonly serve as the source, and the domain that was rated as less animate on
average would serve as the target:
A ¼ source; B ¼ target; iff E½AnimacyðAÞ� > E½AnimacyðBÞ� ð1Þ

Similar models were constructed for the concreteness, embodiment, externality, and intersubjectivity variables. We con-

structed the valence model slightly differently because the underlying variable is polarized (i.e. a domain can be either pos-
itive or negative). Thus we instead calculated the absolute value of valence ratings. Concretely, a domain rated 7 (highly
positive) on the 7-point scale would be treated as equally-valenced as a domain rated 1 (highly negative). For this model,
we predicted the direction of mapping to be: Less valenced?More valenced, such that between any pair of domains in
the data set, the domain that was rated as more valenced on average would serve as the target, and the domain that was
rated as less valenced on average would serve as the source:
A ¼ target; B ¼ source; iff E½ValenceðAÞ� > E½ValenceðBÞ� ð2Þ

Table 1 specifies the predicted directions of each model along with example mappings from the historical database that

the models successfully accounted for.
We used 50% as the baseline representing the possibility that sources and targets are random with respect to our six vari-

ables. The results appear in Fig. 1a. Overall, all models predicted directions in historical mappings above chance. In partic-
ular, externality (accuracy = 73.9%) and concreteness (73.5%) were most accurate and roughly equivalent to one another.
These were followed by intersubjectivity (60.7%), valence (59.6%), embodiment (56.7%), and animacy (52.6%). These results
indicate that historical metaphorical mappings follow systematic and predictable directions, such that between a pair of
domains, the domain that is rated higher (or lower for the valence dimension) on these variables is more likely to be the
source, and the remaining domain is more likely to be the target.

We next examined the degree of correlations among the six variables, seeking to understand which of these variables
might be redundant with each other, and which variables might be less correlated and hence might offer complementary
explanatory power to each other. Fig. 1b shows the Pearson correlations between all pairs of variables. As can be seen, exter-
nality and concreteness were most strongly inter-correlated (r(400) = 0.84, p < 0.001). For this reason, we expected these
variables to make similar predictions about mapping directions and for one to make little independent contribution to
explaining the directionality of metaphorical mappings over the other. Intersubjectivity was most strongly correlated with
both externality (r(400) = 0.44, p < 0.001) and concreteness (r(400) = 0.47, p < 0.001) among the remaining pairwise correla-
tions. Animacy, embodiment, and valence were generally less correlated with other variables.

To take into account these patterns of inter-correlation, we investigated how well the six variables in combination predict
the historical directions of metaphorical mappings, and the extent to which each variable contributes towards these predic-
tions. We first formulated the problem using standard logistic regression. For each instance of the 4960 domain-to-domain
mappings (indexed by i) recorded in the database, we coded the direction of mapping – the observation to be predicted
(denoted by y) – between a pair of domains (A,B) as ‘0’ if the mapping was A? B (i.e. domain A serves as source) and ‘1’
if the mapping was A B (i.e. domain A serves as target). We then created a 6-dimensional predictor x from the six candi-
date variables by taking the differences in mean ratings along these variable dimensions for all corresponding instances
recorded:
x ¼ ½E½AnimacyðAÞ� � E½AnimacyðBÞ�; . . . ; E½ValenceðAÞ� � E½ValenceðBÞ�� ð3Þ

If our predictions about these variables are correct, we should expect some subset of them to account well for the histor-

ical directions of metaphorical mappings, and in ways consistent with our proposals about preferred directionality. To test
this, we regressed y against x by minimizing the standard logistic loss function:
LðbÞ ¼
X

i

logð1þ expð�bTxiyiÞÞ ð4Þ
Here b (or beta) is a vector of weights to be determined from the data. Each weight represents the relative contribution of
each of the variable dimensions in accounting for the historical data, as an assessment of the theoretical proposals formalized
in Eqs. (1) and (2). For example, if a higher mean rating along a variable dimension predicts a domain to be the source of
metaphorical mapping (e.g. in the case of externality), we would expect the corresponding weight to be positively valued
and significantly above zero if the contribution of the variable in question is substantial. In contrast, if a lower mean rating
along a variable dimension predicts a domain to be the source (e.g. valence), we would expect the corresponding weight to
be negatively valued and significantly below zero.

To assess the degree to which the variables in combination predict the data, we applied 10-fold cross validation, which is
a common technique for evaluating predictive accuracy (e.g., Kohavi, 1995). At each round, we held out 10% of the data for
the model to make predictions about, while fitting the model using the remaining 90% of the data. We repeated this proce-
dure 10 times, holding out a different set of data during each round, and computed the predictive accuracy on the held-out
sets. The mean cross-validated accuracy of the logistic model was 77.1%, indicating that there is a small advantage of pre-
dicting the historical data by allowing the variables to contribute simultaneously to explaining each mapping, as compared
to fitting the data by treating the variables in isolation (recall that in the latter single-variable method, the most accurate
model was externality, at 73.9%).

To understand the contributions of the variables in accounting for the data, we visualized the distribution of their weights
from the logistic regression analysis by fitting the data (Fig. 1c). To evaluate the significance of these weights, we performed
statistical bootstrapping by resampling the data 10,000 times and re-estimating the weights from these bootstrapped trials.
The results indicated that externality is the dominant factor underlying historical metaphorical mappings, as it received the
largest weight among the six variables (p < 0.0001, beta = 0.436, 95% CI [0.380, 0.492]). The results also revealed that
although embodiment (p < 0.0001, beta = 0.127, 95% CI [0.078, 0.176]), valence (p < 0.01, beta = �0.093, 95% CI [�0.164,
�0.023]) and concreteness (p < 0.002, beta = 0.119, 95% CI [0.047, 0.191]) received smaller weights than externality, their
contribution was nevertheless significant. Finally, animacy (p = 0.24, beta = 0.025, 95% CI [�0.016, 0.065]) and intersubjec-
tivity (p = 0.121, beta = �0.065, 95% CI [�0.147, 0.017]) did not have significant weights.

Because the standard logistic model did not incorporate variable selection, it is possible that the set of significant vari-
ables we described might contain redundancy. For example, the correlation analysis we described showed that externality
is highly correlated with concreteness. To address this issue, we performed an additional analysis by incorporating variable
selection within logistic regression, via an L1-penalized sparsity constraint. In particular, instead of minimizing the loss func-
tion in Eq. (4), we imposed a penalty term in the minimization procedure:
Fig. 2.
variable
dimens
LL1ðbÞ ¼ LðbÞ þ k
X

j

jbjj ð5Þ
Here j indexes the weights on the six variable dimensions, and by summing |bj| over these dimensions this formulation intro-
duces a sparse penalty on the L1 norm of the weights (hence this penalty will shrink variable weights towards zero if the
corresponding variables contribute trivially or redundantly towards explaining the data, effectively incorporating variable
selection in the minimization procedure). k determines the relative weighting between the original loss function L(b) and
the L1 norm and is typically a tuning parameter. To probe the key variables in a comprehensive way, we examined the full
regularization path by varying the k value systematically from 1 to 1000 in 50 equal steps in the log space.

Fig. 2 shows how the distribution of weights varied in the regularization path we probed. The result indicated the emer-
gence of three key variables – externality, embodiment, and valence – which retained their weights as the k value increased.
At the same time, other variables were either minimal (e.g., animacy contributed trivially towards explaining the data and
hence its weight was minimal) or shrunken towards zero as a result of the sparsity constraint (e.g., concreteness correlates
highly with externality and its weight tended towards zero as the k value increased). The signs of weights on the key vari-
ables were also informative and consistent with our theoretical predictions, indicating that domains receiving high ratings
along externality and embodiment dimensions have commonly served as sources of metaphorical mapping, whereas
domains receiving low ratings along valence (i.e. neutral domains) commonly served as targets of metaphorical mapping.

Taken together, these analyses indicate that externality (or concreteness, with which it is highly correlated) plays a dom-
inant role in predicting the directionality of historical metaphorical extension. Also, these analyses suggest that externality,
embodiment, and valence together define a relatively orthogonal space that helps explain the directionality of the majority
of recorded metaphorical mappings. These findings provide the first large-scale evidence for the idea that metaphorical
senses have developed across history in systematic and predictable ways, constrained by a relatively compact set of psycho-
logical dimensions.

Fig. 3 visualizes trends in the historical metaphorical mappings among the 400 semantic domains in a binary matrix. Each
non-zero entry (i.e., white dot) in the matrix records the presence of a recorded mapping between a pair of domains. To ver-
ify that variables such as externality best explain the data, we took a bottom-up, data-driven approach, and applied a prin-
cipal components analysis to this matrix and correlated the first eigenvector – the dimension that accounts for the most
variability in the data – against the domain ratings of the six variables. Our independent measures of externality (r(400)
= 0.349; p < 0.0001, Bonferroni-corrected) and concreteness (r(400) = 0.342; p < 0.0001, Bonferroni-corrected) – but not

the other variables (p > 0.05, all Bonferroni-corrected) – were significantly correlated with the first eigenvector, confirming
the dominant role of these psychological dimensions in explaining the directionality of metaphorical mappings in history.
3.2. Analysis II: Identifying the source and target domains of metaphorical mapping

Our analyses so far have focused on metaphorical mappings arising at different time points in history, but the outcome of
these diachronic changes should also be reflected in more global, time-independent asymmetries as to which domains tend
to be the sources of metaphorical extension, and which the targets. We next examined the extent to which the candidate
variable dimensions explain the source-target asymmetry of specific semantic domains, by collapsing data across time
points.

To quantify the degree of source-target asymmetry in the metaphorically mapped domains, we formally defined the
asymmetry index (AI) as the difference between two probabilities:
AI ¼ pðsourceÞ � pðtargetÞ ð6Þ
Here, p(source) is the probability of a domain (D) serving as a source of metaphorical mappings across all time points
(indexed by t) in history (i.e., a synchronic summary of ‘‘source” strength), and p(target) is the probability of a domain being
a target of metaphorical mappings across time points (a synchronic summary of ‘‘target” strength).

Y. Xu et al. / Cognitive Psychology 96 (2017) 41–53 49
We computed these probabilities on a per domain basis by summing all cases of metaphorical mapping where a domain
served as a source or target respectively as recorded in the historical data set and normalized them by the total number of
mappings:
Fig. 4.
domain
pðsourceÞ ¼
X

IðD ¼ sourceÞ= Number of mappings; ð7Þ

pðtargetÞ ¼
X

IðD ¼ targetÞ= Number of mappings ð8Þ

It follows from this measure of source-target asymmetry that a high positive value of AI should indicate a strong source

domain, whereas a low negative value of AI should indicate a weak source (or strong target) domain. Table 2 lists the stron-
gest source and target domains in the dataset based on the asymmetry index measure we described.

We then computed Pearson correlations between each domain’s asymmetry index and its mean empirical rating for each
of the variable dimensions. Fig. 4a summarizes the results. Ratings for all variable dimensions except for those of animacy (r
(400) = 0.09, p > 0.250) correlated significantly with the asymmetry indices (p < 0.01 for the five candidate variables). Specif-
ically, externality (r(400) = 0.46, p < 0.001) and concreteness (r(400) = 0.42, p < 0.001) showed the highest strengths of cor-
relation, consistent with their leading roles in predicting directions of metaphorical mappings (see Section 3.1).
Intersubjectivity (r(400) = 0.22, p < 0.001) and embodiment (r(400) = 0.13, p < 0.009) were also moderately correlated with
the asymmetry indices. These results suggest that domains that are external, concrete, embodied, and share a conceptual-
ization across people tend to serve as sources of metaphorical mappings across history. Finally, valence negatively correlated
(r(400) = �0.19, p < 0.001) with asymmetry, suggesting that more valenced domains tend to be targets of metaphorical map-
pings, also consistent with the analyses reported in Section 3.1.

Again taking into account the inter-correlated nature of the variables, we performed a multiple linear regression to esti-
mate the relative contributions of the six variables. We expected the most important (and orthogonal) predictor ratings to be
weighted the highest when regressed against the asymmetry indices. Fig. 4b shows the relative contributions of these vari-
ables as reflected by their weights. The regression fit had a Pearson r(393) = 0.42, p < 0.001. The candidate variable with the
largest absolute weight was externality (p < 0.001, beta = 0.007, 95% CI [0.0037, 0.0093]), followed by embodiment (p < 0.09,

randomly chosen reference domains, a subset of the 400 domains which are shown as gray dots projected onto a low-dimensional space via principal
components analysis using the empirical ratings for the six variables. The two principal components correspond roughly to a concrete-to-abstract
dimension (from right to left in the horizontal dimension), and an embodied-to-disembodied dimension (from top to bottom in the vertical dimension).

50 Y. Xu et al. / Cognitive Psychology 96 (2017) 41–53
beta = 0.0019, 95% CI [�0.0002, 0.0040]) and valence (p > 0.250, beta = �0.001, 95% CI [�0.0026, 0.0007]), although neither of
the latter two variables contributed significantly beyond externality. This result provides a synchronic confirmation to the
results from the analyses presented in Section 3.1, which found that the same set of variables accounted for most of the vari-
ance in explaining metaphorical mapping directions during different historical epochs.

Fig. 5 provides two concrete examples illustrating the power of the externality variable in explaining the direction of
metaphorical mappings. ‘‘Water” was rated as a highly external domain (mean externality rating = 6.2 out of 7), and as
shown, almost all metaphorical mappings involving this domain in our dataset consisted of projections from this domain
to other domains, exemplifying the principle that external domains tend to act as sources of metaphorical mappings across
history. In contrast, ‘‘Mind” was rated as a highly internal domain (mean externality rating = 1.4), and as shown, almost all
mappings involving this domain were projections from other domains to this domain, exemplifying the principle that inter-
nal domains tend to be the targets of metaphorical mappings.

Taken together, our diachronic (Section 3.1) and synchronic (Section 3.2) analyses suggest that metaphorical sense exten-
sions are highly systematic and constrained by a compact set of variables.

3.3. Analysis III: Assessing externality through time

The analyses presented in Sections 3.1 and 3.2 have indicated that externality is the strongest factor in explaining the
direction of historical metaphorical mappings. As discussed before, external domains could commonly provide a source of
metaphorical mappings if they are the most cognitively available and accessible to extend further. To further understand
if the External? Internal mapping is a privileged direction of semantic change, we tested whether external domains have
remained a strong source of metaphorical mappings throughout history. An alternative possibility is that externality is a
strong predictor only at the very earliest points in history (e.g., because external ideas tend to be lexicalized earlier), such
that external domains have only served as sources of metaphorical mappings during these periods.

To distinguish between these two possibilities, we performed a time-course analysis that examined the strength of exter-
nal domains as sources over times. Specifically, we categorized the available domains in our data set as ‘‘external” or ‘‘inter-
nal” depending on whether the ratings of externality for each domain were higher or lower than ‘‘4” (the middle scale value
between highly external ‘‘7” and highly internal ‘‘1”; Our results obtained regardless of the exact threshold used to separate
external and internal domains). Then, we computed the source probability (described in Section 3.2) for each of the two
groups of domains at each of the available historical time points provided in the corpus. If externality serves as a strong pre-
dictor for metaphorical mappings mainly due to the lexicalization of external concepts at the earliest points in history, the
source probability for external domains should on average be higher than for internal domains, but this difference should
decrease over time. On the other hand, if External? Internal is a privileged direction of semantic change, external domains
should have greater source probabilities than the internal domains across time.

Our analyses support the second possibility (see Fig. 6). Specifically, external domains had significantly higher source
probabilities than internal domains throughout the 1300-year period (joint p < 0.001, n = 18 time points with Fisher’s
method; time point with minimal p < 7.71e�011, t(396) = 6.57; time point with maximal p < 0.035, t(396) = 1.81). Also,
source probabilities for the external domains did not differ significantly between the initial and end periods (p > 0.250, t
(476) = �0.29).

Fig. 6 shows a comparison of external domains against embodied (vs. less-embodied) and valenced (vs. less-valenced)
domains, with results obtained via parallel analyses to those used for externality.1 In contrast with externality, embodied
and valenced domains did not serve as sustained sources for metaphorical mappings across time. Specifically, embodied
domains tended to be sources of metaphorical mapping only earlier in history (possibly because concepts in these domains
were lexicalized earlier in time), whereas valenced domains acted as weak sources of metaphorical mappings, but only later
in historical time. Together, these observations are consistent with the idea that External? Internal is a privileged basis for
metaphorical mapping, with concepts from more external domains providing a means for communicating about concepts from
more internal domains.

4. Discussion

The present study focused on one of the key mechanisms through which words gain new meanings: metaphorical map-
ping. By drawing on an historical record of semantic change in English, we evaluated – on a large scale – whether new
metaphorical word senses have developed in systematic directions. We discovered that a compact set of variables including
externality and embodiment account for directionality in the majority of recorded metaphorical mappings between
domains, dating back 1100 years. Specifically, we found that, given a pair of domains, the domain with the higher mean
1 We found concreteness to be highly similar to externality, and we found no statistical significance for animacy and intersubjectivity. For conciseness, we
omit presenting these results.



52 Y. Xu et al. / Cognitive Psychology 96 (2017) 41–53
rating along these variables will more commonly be the source of metaphorical mapping, and the domain with the lower
mean rating will more commonly be the target. Furthermore, we found that externality – the strongest predictor – explained
the direction of metaphorical mappings throughout the history of English, and not just for an initial period early in English
vocabulary development.

Our findings lend strong support to the idea that the evolution of metaphorical polysemy proceeds in systematic ways.
The six variables that we explored were motivated by communicative and cognitive considerations, drawing upon theories
of cognition and language. Our analyses provide evidence that the large majority of directions of metaphorical extensions
over history can be explained by a compact set of variables, which suggests that metaphor provides an efficient way of com-
pressing emerging meanings into an existing lexicon, without requiring the construction of word forms de novo. Our work
thus extends previous studies about communicative and cognitive constraints on synchronic features of language such as
word length (Piantadosi et al., 2011; Zipf, 1949) and semantic structures (Kemp & Regier, 2012; Regier et al., 2015) to explain
the evolution of metaphorical polysemy in the lexicon (cf. Blank and Koch, 1999; Geeraerts, 1997). The current work also
contributes to a comprehensive assessment of metaphorical thought by connecting previous theories of metaphor such as
the Conceptual Metaphor Theory (Lakoff & Johnson, 1980; Reddy, 1979) with historical data of language change at scale.

In many respects, our finding – that the directionality of historical metaphorical sense extensions is highly systematic – is
surprising. Due to the ever-changing cultural conditions and resultant communicative needs that have pressured words to
develop new senses (cf. Aitchison, 2001), metaphorical sense extensions could have in principle been varied and unpre-
dictable across words. It is clear that cultural conditions and communicative needs have shaped metaphorical extension
in many cases. For instance, mouse would never have been extended to a computer accessory if the invention of the com-
puter had not come about, nor would file or folder have been extended from objects held in the hand to virtual ones without
specific cultural developments. Our data demonstrate that, in spite of the effects of complex and dynamic cultural condi-
tions, there is an underlying regularity to the direction of metaphorical sense extension driven by measurable communica-
tive and cognitive principles.

Our results leave open exactly why variables such as externality were reliable predictors of directionality in metaphorical
mappings across history. On the one hand, these results could be taken to support theories emphasizing the role of metaphor
in thought including Conceptual Metaphor Theory. By these accounts, ideas tied to human experience and sensation provide
anchors for thinking about more abstract ideas. As such, more external (and embodied) word meanings are predicted to be
well understood and richly structured, and to provide a source of mappings for ideas that are more difficult to understand.
Alternatively, our results may not reveal that abstract concepts are understood in terms of external and embodied concepts,
per se, but rather, that external and embodied word meanings are easier to achieve shared reference for and to learn
(Srinivasan & Carey, 2010; Thibodeau & Durgin, 2008) because of their salience and physical availability in experience. It
is also possible that external meanings tend to be more frequent, and may thus be easier to retrieve for speakers who wish
to communicate new ideas (Hanley et al., 2013; cf. Winter et al., 2014). Relatedly, more external concepts may tend to prime
more internal concepts than vice versa, contributing to directionality in language change (e.g., Jaeger & Rosenbach, 2008).
Regardless of how these issues are resolved, our findings support the idea that metaphorical polysemy has been shaped
by cognitive and communicative pressures in ways that facilitate the efficient creation, learning, and use of newword senses.

Our work raises questions for future research in computational approaches to semantic change and polysemy. First, our
analyses examined metaphorical sense extensions at the level of semantic domains. In the future, it would be valuable to
assess the systematicity of sense extensions at the level of individual words, which would require a different source of data.
Second, although the database we examined is large, it is not an exhaustive set of metaphorical mappings in English lan-
guage history. Ultimately, it would be desirable to have a full record of mappings to assess. Third, we also note that the vari-
able ratings of the semantic domains that we used in our analyses were based on intuitions from subjects living in the
present era, as opposed to in the past. Although we see no reason for why this would be the case, in principle these semantic
domains could have been perceived differently in the eras in which metaphorical extensions were created (e.g., in terms of
their externality, embodiment, etc.). Future analyses could confirm the validity of the ratings we obtained by seeking other
converging forms of historical evidence.

More broadly, our analyses focused only on the directionality of metaphorical mappings, and whether some domains
more commonly serve as sources, and others more commonly as targets. However, our findings leave open how speakers
decide which concepts from source domains to employ when they wish to communicate about a new idea in a target domain
(e.g., Zhang, Geeraerts, & Speelman, 2015): For example, what led speakers to the choose the physical action meaning of
grasp – as opposed to some other external and embodied word meaning – to communicate about the comprehension of
ideas? Addressing this problem would presumably require in-depth knowledge about structural similarities between con-
cepts in different domains and their retrieval probabilities, to help explain which mappings are possible. Additional work
is also required to explore whether the principles that underlie metaphorical sense extension can be applied to explain other
mechanisms of word sense extension, such as metonymy and semantic chaining (e.g., Lakoff, 1987; Ramiro, Malt, &
Srinivasan, & Xu, 2017; Xu, Regier, & Malt, 2016), and whether models that are successful in predicting English data fare
as well in predicting semantic evolution in other languages. The latter is particularly important for supporting the claim
of general cognitive and communicative principles as drivers of systematic sense extension. Finally, it will also be important
to understand the socio-cultural factors that explain the rise or fall in communicative needs for different semantic domains.
The current work provides an empirical approach for further explorations into the evolution and nature of word meaning.
