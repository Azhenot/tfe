Abstract

We propose a general framework called Network Dissec-
tion for quantifying the interpretability of latent representa-
tions of CNNs by evaluating the alignment between individ-
ual hidden units and a set of semantic concepts. Given any
CNN model, the proposed method draws on a broad data
set of visual concepts to score the semantics of hidden units
at each intermediate convolutional layer. The units with
semantics are given labels across a range of objects, parts,
scenes, textures, materials, and colors. We use the proposed
method to test the hypothesis that interpretability of units
is equivalent to random linear combinations of units, then
we apply our method to compare the latent representations
of various networks when trained to solve different super-
vised and self-supervised training tasks. We further analyze
the effect of training iterations, compare networks trained
with different initializations, examine the impact of network
depth and width, and measure the effect of dropout and batch
normalization on the interpretability of deep visual represen-
tations. We demonstrate that the proposed method can shed
light on characteristics of CNN models and training methods
that go beyond measurements of their discriminative power.

1. Introduction
Observations of hidden units in large deep neural net-

works have revealed that human-interpretable concepts some-
times emerge as individual latent variables within those net-
works: for example, object detector units emerge within net-
works trained to recognize places [40]; part detectors emerge
in object classifiers [11]; and object detectors emerge in gen-
erative video networks [32] (Fig. 1). This internal structure
has appeared in situations where the networks are not con-
strained to decompose problems in any interpretable way.

The emergence of interpretable structure suggests that
deep networks may be learning disentangled representations
spontaneously. While it is commonly understood that a net-
work can learn an efficient encoding that makes economical
use of hidden variables to distinguish its states, the appear-

ance of a disentangled representation is not well-understood.
A disentangled representation aligns its variables with a
meaningful factorization of the underlying problem structure,
and encouraging disentangled representations is a significant
area of research [5]. If the internal representation of a deep
network is partly disentangled, one possible path for under-
standing its mechanisms is to detect disentangled structure,
and simply read out the separated factors.

However, this proposal raises questions which we address
in this paper:
• What is a disentangled representation, and how can its

factors be quantified and detected?
• Do interpretable hidden units reflect a special alignment

of feature space, or are interpretations a chimera?
• What conditions in state-of-the-art training lead to rep-

resentations with greater or lesser entanglement?
To examine these issues, we propose a general analytic

framework, network dissection, for interpreting deep visual
representations and quantifying their interpretability. Us-
ing Broden, a broadly and densely labeled data set, our
framework identifies hidden units’ semantics for any given
CNN, then aligns them with human-interpretable concepts.
We evaluate our method on various CNNs (AlexNet, VGG,
GoogLeNet, ResNet) trained on object and scene recognition,
and show that emergent interpretability is an axis-aligned
property of a representation that can be destroyed by rotation
without affecting discriminative power. We further examine
how interpretability is affected by training data sets, training
techniques like dropout [28] and batch normalization [13],
and supervision by different primary tasks.

1.1. Related Work

A growing number of techniques have been developed to
understand the internal representations of convolutional neu-
ral networks through visualization. The behavior of a CNN
can be visualized by sampling image patches that maximize
activation of hidden units [37, 40], or by using variants of
backpropagation to identify or generate salient image fea-
tures [17, 26, 37]. The discriminative power of hidden layers
of CNN features can also be understood by isolating por-
tions of networks, transferring them or limiting them, and
testing their capabilities on specialized problems [35, 24, 2].
Visualizations digest the mechanisms of a network down to
images which themselves must be interpreted; this motivates
our work which aims to match representations of CNNs with
labeled interpretations directly and automatically.

Most relevant to our current work are explorations of the
roles of individual units inside neural networks. In [40] hu-
man evaluation was used to determine that individual units
behave as object detectors in a network that was trained to
classify scenes. [20] automatically generated prototypical
images for individual units by learning a feature inversion
mapping; this contrasts with our approach of automatically
assigning concept labels. Recently [3] suggested an ap-
proach to testing the intermediate layers by training sim-
ple linear probes, which analyzes the information dynamics
among layers and its effect on the final prediction.

2. Network Dissection
How can we quantify the clarity of an idea? The notion of

a disentangled representation rests on the human perception
of what it means for a concept to be mixed up. Therefore
when we quantify interpretability, we define it in terms of
alignment with a set of human-interpretable concepts. Our
measurement of interpretability for deep visual representa-
tions proceeds in three steps:

1. Identify a broad set of human-labeled visual concepts.

2. Gather hidden variables’ response to known concepts.

3. Quantify alignment of hidden variable−concept pairs.

This three-step process of network dissection is reminiscent
of the procedures used by neuroscientists to understand simi-
lar representation questions in biological neurons [23]. Since
our purpose is to measure the level to which a representation
is disentangled, we focus on quantifying the correspondence
between a single latent variable and a visual concept.

In a fully interpretable local coding such as a one-hot-
encoding, each variable will match exactly with one human-
interpretable concept. Although we expect a network to learn
partially nonlocal representations in interior layers [5], and
past experience shows that an emergent concept will often
align with a combination of a several hidden units [11, 2],

Figure 2. Samples from the Broden Dataset. The ground truth for
each concept is a pixel-wise dense annotation.

our present aim is to assess how well a representation is
disentangled. Therefore we measure the alignment between
single units and single interpretable concepts. This does
not gauge the discriminative power of the representation;
rather it quantifies its disentangled interpretability. As we
will show in Sec. 3.2, it is possible for two representations
of perfectly equivalent discriminative power to have very
different levels of interpretability.

To assess the interpretability of any given CNN, we draw
concepts from a new broadly and densely labeled image data
set that unifies labeled visual concepts from a heterogeneous
collection of labeled data sources, described in Sec. 2.1. We
then measure the alignment of each hidden unit of the CNN
with each concept by evaluating the feature activation of each
individual unit as a segmentation model for each concept. To
quantify the interpretability of a layer as a whole, we count
the number of distinct visual concepts that are aligned with
a unit in the layer, as detailed in Sec. 2.2.

2.1. Broden: Broadly and Densely Labeled Dataset

To be able to ascertain alignment with both low-level
concepts such as colors and higher-level concepts such as
objects, we have assembled a new heterogeneous data set.

The Broadly and Densely Labeled Dataset (Broden) uni-
fies several densely labeled image data sets: ADE [43], Open-
Surfaces [4], Pascal-Context [19], Pascal-Part [6], and the
Describable Textures Dataset [7]. These data sets contain
examples of a broad range of objects, scenes, object parts,
textures, and materials in a variety of contexts. Most exam-
ples are segmented down to the pixel level except textures
and scenes which are given for full-images. In addition,
every image pixel in the data set is annotated with one of
the eleven common color names according to the human
perceptions classified by van de Weijer [31]. A sample of
the types of labels in the Broden dataset are shown in Fig. 2.

The purpose of Broden is to provide a ground truth set of
exemplars for a broad set of visual concepts. The concept
labels in Broden are normalized and merged from their orig-
inal data sets so that every class corresponds to an English
word. Labels are merged based on shared synonyms, disre-
garding positional distinctions such as ‘left’ and ‘top’ and

avoiding a blacklist of 29 overly general synonyms (such
as ‘machine’ for ‘car’). Multiple Broden labels can apply
to the same pixel: for example, a black pixel that has the
Pascal-Part label ‘left front cat leg’ has three labels in Bro-
den: a unified ‘cat’ label representing cats across data sets; a
similar unified ‘leg’ label; and the color label ‘black’. Only
labels with at least 10 image samples are included. Table 1
shows the average number of image samples per label class.

2.2. Scoring Unit Interpretability

The proposed network dissection method evaluates every
individual convolutional unit in a CNN as a solution to a
binary segmentation task to every visual concept in Broden
(Fig. 3). Our method can be applied to any CNN using a for-
ward pass without the need for training or backpropagation.

For every input image x in the Broden dataset, the acti-
vation map Ak(x) of every internal convolutional unit k is
collected. Then the distribution of individual unit activations
ak is computed. For each unit k, the top quantile level Tk
is determined such that P (ak > Tk) = 0.005 over every
spatial location of the activation map in the data set.

To compare a low-resolution unit’s activation map to
the input-resolution annotation mask Lc for some concept
c, the activation map is scaled up to the mask resolution
Sk(x) from Ak(x) using bilinear interpolation, anchoring
interpolants at the center of each unit’s receptive field.
Sk(x) is then thresholded into a binary segmentation:

Mk(x) ≡ Sk(x) ≥ Tk, selecting all regions for which the
activation exceeds the threshold Tk. These segmentations
are evaluated against every concept c in the data set by com-
puting intersections Mk(x) ∩ Lc(x), for every (k, c) pair.

The score of each unit k as segmentation for concept c is
reported as a data-set-wide intersection over union score

IoUk,c =

∑
|Mk(x) ∩ Lc(x)|∑
|Mk(x) ∪ Lc(x)|

, (1)

where | · | is the cardinality of a set. Because the data set
contains some types of labels which are not present on some
subsets of inputs, the sums are computed only on the subset
of images that have at least one labeled concept of the same
category as c. The value of IoUk,c is the accuracy of unit k
in detecting concept c; we consider one unit k as a detector
for concept c if IoUk,c exceeds a threshold. Our qualitative
results are insensitive to the IoU threshold: different thresh-
olds denote different numbers of units as concept detectors

across all the networks but relative orderings remain stable.
For our comparisons we report a detector if IoUk,c > 0.04.
Note that one unit might be the detector for multiple con-
cepts; for the purpose of our analysis, we choose the top
ranked label. To quantify the interpretability of a layer, we
count the number unique concepts aligned with units. We
call this the number of unique detectors.

The IoU evaluating the quality of the segmentation of a
unit is an objective confidence score for interpretability that
is comparable across networks. Thus this score enables us
to compare interpretability of different representations and
lays the basis for the experiments below. Note that network
dissection works only as well as the underlying data set: if a
unit matches a human-understandable concept that is absent
in Broden, then it will not score well for interpretability.
Future versions of Broden will be expanded to include more
kinds of visual concepts.

3. Experiments

For testing we prepare a collection of CNN models with
different network architectures and supervision of primary
tasks, as listed in Table 2. The network architectures include
AlexNet [15], GoogLeNet [29], VGG [27], and ResNet [12].
For supervised training, the models are trained from scratch
(i.e., not pretrained) on ImageNet [25], Places205 [42], and
Places365 [41]. ImageNet is an object-centric data set, which
contains 1.2 million images from 1000 classes. Places205
and Places365 are two subsets of the Places Database, which
is a scene-centric data set with categories such as kitchen,
living room, and coast. Places205 contains 2.4 million im-
ages from 205 scene categories, while Places365 contains
1.6 million images from 365 scene categories. “Hybrid”
refers to a combination of ImageNet and Places365. For
self-supervised training tasks, we select several recent mod-
els trained on predicting context (context) [9], solving puz-
zles (puzzle) [21], predicting ego-motion (egomotion) [14],
learning by moving (moving) [1], predicting video frame
order (videoorder) [18] or tracking (tracking) [33], detect-
ing object-centric alignment (objectcentric) [10], coloriz-
ing images (colorization) [38], predicting cross-channel
(crosschannel) [39], and predicting ambient sound from
frames (audio) [22]. The self-supervised models we ana-
lyze are comparable to each other in that they all use AlexNet

or an AlexNet-derived architecture.
In the following experiments, we begin by validating our

method using human evaluation. Then, we use random uni-
tary rotations of a learned representation to test whether
interpretability of CNNs is an axis-independent property;
we find that it is not, and we conclude that interpretability
is not an inevitable result of the discriminative power of a
representation. Next, we analyze all the convolutional layers
of AlexNet as trained on ImageNet [15] and as trained on
Places [42], and confirm that our method reveals detectors
for higher-level concepts at higher layers and lower-level con-
cepts at lower layers; and that more detectors for higher-level
concepts emerge under scene training. Then, we show that
different network architectures such as AlexNet, VGG, and
ResNet yield different interpretability, while differently su-
pervised training tasks and self-supervised training tasks also
yield a variety of levels of interpretability. Finally we show
the impact of different training conditions, examine the rela-
tionship between discriminative power and interpretability,
and investigate a possible way to improve the interpretability
of CNNs by increasing their width.

3.1. Human Evaluation of Interpretations

We evaluate the quality of the unit interpretations found
by our method using Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT).
Raters were shown 15 images with highlighted patches
showing the most highly-activating regions for each unit in
AlexNet trained on Places205, and asked to decide (yes/no)
whether a given phrase describes most of the image patches.

Table 3 summarizes the results. First, we determined
the set of interpretable units as those units for which raters
agreed with ground-truth interpretations from [40]. Over this
set of units, we report the portion of interpretations generated
by our method that were rated as descriptive. Within this
set we also compare to the portion of ground-truth labels
that were found to be descriptive by a second group of raters.
The proposed method can find semantic labels for units that
are comparable to descriptions written by human annotators
at the highest layer. At the lowest layer, the low-level color
and texture concepts available in Broden are only sufficient

Table 3. Human evaluation of our Network Dissection approach.
Interpretable units are those where raters agreed with ground-truth
interpretations. Within this set we report the portion of interpreta-
tions assigned by our method that were rated as descriptive. Human
consistency is based on a second evaluation of ground-truth labels.

to match good interpretations for a minority of units. Human
consistency is also highest at conv5, which suggests that
humans are better at recognizing and agreeing upon high-
level visual concepts such as objects and parts, rather than
the shapes and textures that emerge at lower layers.

3.2. Measurement of Axis-Aligned Interpretability

We conduct an experiment to determine whether it is
meaningful to assign an interpretable concept to an individ-
ual unit. Two possible hypotheses can explain the emergence
of interpretability in individual hidden layer units:

Hypothesis 1. Interpretable units emerge because inter-
pretable concepts appear in most directions in repre-
sentation space. If the representation localizes related
concepts in an axis-independent way, projecting to any
direction could reveal an interpretable concept, and in-
terpretations of single units in the natural basis may not
be a meaningful way to understand a representation.

Hypothesis 2. Interpretable alignments are unusual, and in-
terpretable units emerge because learning converges to
a special basis that aligns explanatory factors with indi-
vidual units. In this model, the natural basis represents
a meaningful decomposition learned by the network.

Hypothesis 1 is the default assumption: in the past it has
been found [30] that with respect to interpretability “there
is no distinction between individual high level units and
random linear combinations of high level units.”

Network dissection allows us to re-evaluate this hypothe-
sis. We apply random changes in basis to a representation

learned by AlexNet. Under hypothesis 1, the overall level
of interpretability should not be affected by a change in ba-
sis, even as rotations cause the specific set of represented
concepts to change. Under hypothesis 2, the overall level of
interpretability is expected to drop under a change in basis.

We begin with the representation of the 256 convolu-
tional units of AlexNet conv5 trained on Places205 and
examine the effect of a change in basis. To avoid any is-
sues of conditioning or degeneracy, we change basis us-
ing a random orthogonal transformation Q. The rotation
Q is drawn uniformly from SO(256) by applying Gram-
Schmidt on a normally-distributed QR = A ∈ R2562 with
positive-diagonal right-triangular R, as described by [8]. In-
terpretability is summarized as the number of unique visual
concepts aligned with units, as defined in Sec. 2.2.

Denoting AlexNet conv5 as f(x), we find that the num-
ber of unique detectors in Qf(x) is 80% fewer than the
number of unique detectors in f(x). Our finding is inconsis-
tent with hypothesis 1 and consistent with hypothesis 2.

We also test smaller perturbations of basis using Qα for
0 ≤ α ≤ 1, where the fractional powers Qα ∈ SO(256) are
chosen to form a minimal geodesic gradually rotating from
I to Q; these intermediate rotations are computed using a
Schur decomposition. Fig. 4 shows that interpretability of
Qαf(x) decreases as larger rotations are applied.

Each rotated representation has exactly the same discrim-
inative power as the original layer. Writing the original net-
work as g(f(x)), note that g′(r) ≡ g(QT r) defines a neural
network that processes the rotated representation r = Qf(x)
exactly as the original g operates on f(x). We conclude that
interpretability is neither an inevitable result of discrimina-
tive power, nor is it a prerequisite to discriminative power.
Instead, we find that interpretability is a different quality that
must be measured separately to be understood.

3.3. Disentangled Concepts by Layer

Using network dissection, we analyze and compare the
interpretability of units within all the convolutional layers
of Places-AlexNet and ImageNet-AlexNet. Places-AlexNet
is trained for scene classification on Places205 [42], while
ImageNet-AlexNet is the identical architecture trained for
object classification on ImageNet [15].

The results are summarized in Fig. 5. A sample of units
are shown together with both automatically inferred inter-
pretations and manually assigned interpretations taken from
[40]. We can see that the predicted labels match the human
annotation well, though sometimes they capture a differ-
ent description of a visual concept, such as the ‘crosswalk’
predicted by the algorithm compared to ‘horizontal lines’
given by the human for the third unit in conv4 of Places-
AlexNet in Fig. 5. Confirming intuition, color and texture
concepts dominate at lower layers conv1 and conv2 while
more object and part detectors emerge in conv5.

3.4. Network Architectures and Supervisions

How do different network architectures and training su-
pervisions affect disentangled interpretability of the learned
representations? We apply network dissection to evaluate a
range of network architectures and supervisions. For simplic-
ity, the following experiments focus on the last convolutional
layer of each CNN, where semantic detectors emerge most.

Results showing the number of unique detectors that
emerge from various network architectures trained on Ima-
geNet and Places are plotted in Fig. 7, with examples shown
in Fig. 6. In terms of network architecture, we find that in-
terpretability of ResNet > VGG > GoogLeNet > AlexNet.
Deeper architectures appear to allow greater interpretability.
Comparing training data sets, we find Places > ImageNet.
As discussed in [40], one scene is composed of multiple
objects, so it may be beneficial for more object detectors to
emerge in CNNs trained to recognize scenes.

Results from networks trained on various supervised and
self-supervised tasks are shown in Fig. 8. Here the network
architecture is AlexNet for each model, We observe that
training on Places365 creates the largest number of unique
detectors. Self-supervised models create many texture de-
tectors but relatively few object detectors; apparently, su-
pervision from a self-taught primary task is much weaker
at inferring interpretable concepts than supervised training
on a large annotated data set. The form of self-supervision
makes a difference: for example, the colorization model is
trained on colorless images, and almost no color detection
units emerge. We hypothesize that emergent units represent
concepts required to solve the primary task.

Fig. 9 shows some typical visual detectors identified in
the self-supervised CNN models. For the models audio and
puzzle, some object and part detectors emerge. Those de-
tectors may be useful for CNNs to solve the primary tasks:

the audio model is trained to associate objects with a sound
source, so it may be useful to recognize people and cars;
while the puzzle model is trained to align the different parts
of objects and scenes in an image. For colorization and
tracking, recognizing textures might be good enough for
the CNN to solve primary tasks such as colorizing a desatu-
rated natural image; thus it is unsurprising that the texture
detectors dominate.

3.5. Training Conditions vs. Interpretability

Training conditions such as the number of training iter-
ations, dropout [28], batch normalization [13], and random
initialization [16], are known to affect the representation
learning of neural networks. To analyze the effect of train-
ing conditions on interpretability, we take the Places205-
AlexNet as the baseline model and prepare several variants
of it, all using the same AlexNet architecture. For the vari-

Figure 11. Effect of regularizations on the interpretability of CNNs.

ants Repeat1, Repeat2 and Repeat3, we randomly initialize
the weights and train them with the same number of itera-
tions. For the variant NoDropout, we remove the dropout in
the FC layers of the baseline model. For the variant Batch-
Norm, we apply batch normalization at each convolutional
layers of the baseline model. Repeat1, Repeat2, Repeat3 all
have nearly the same top-1 accuracy 50.0% on the validation
set. The variant without dropout has top-1 accuracy 49.2%.
The variant with batch norm has top-1 accuracy 50.5%.

In Fig. 10 we plot the interpretability of snapshots of the
baseline model at different training iterations. We can see
that object detectors and part detectors begin emerging at
about 10,000 iterations (each iteration processes a batch of
256 images). We do not find evidence of transitions across
different concept categories during training. For example,
units in conv5 do not turn into texture or material detectors
before becoming object or part detectors.

Fig. 11 shows the interpretability of units in the CNNs
over different training conditions. We find several effects:
1) Comparing different random initializations, the models
converge to similar levels of interpretability, both in terms
of the unique detector number and the total detector number;
this matches observations of convergent learning discussed
in [16]. 2) For the network without dropout, more texture
detectors emerge but fewer object detectors. 3) Batch nor-
malization seems to decrease interpretability significantly.

The batch normalization result serves as a caution that
discriminative power is not the only property of a represen-
tation that should be measured. Our intuition for the loss of
interpretability under batch normalization is that the batch
normalization ‘whitens’ the activation at each layer, which
smooths out scaling issues and allows a network to easily
rotate axes of intermediate representations during training.
While whitening apparently speeds training, it may also have
an effect similar to random rotations analyzed in Sec. 3.2
which destroy interpretability. As discussed in Sec. 3.2, how-
ever, interpretability is neither a prerequisite nor an obstacle
to discriminative power. Finding ways to capture the benefits
of batch normalization without destroying interpretability is
an important area for future work.

3.6. Discrimination vs. Interpretability

Activations from the higher layers of CNNs are often
used as generic visual features, showing great discrimination

and generalization ability [42, 24]. Here we benchmark deep
features from several networks trained on several standard
image classification data sets for their discrimination abil-
ity on a new task. For each trained model, we extract the
representation at the highest convolutional layer, and train a
linear SVM withC = 0.001 on the training data for action40
action recognition task [34]. We compute the classification
accuracy averaged across classes on the test split.

Fig. 12 plots the number of the unique object detectors
for each representation, compared to that representation’s
classification accuracy on the action40 test set. We can see
there is positive correlation between them. Thus the super-
vision tasks that encourage the emergence of more concept
detectors may also improve the discrimination ability of
deep features. Interestingly, the best discriminative repre-
sentation for action40 is the representation from ResNet152-
ImageNet, which has fewer unique object detectors com-
pared to ResNet152-Places365. We hypothesize that the
accuracy on a representation when applied to a task is de-
pendent not only on the number of concept detectors in the
representation, but on the suitability of the set of represented
concepts to the transfer task.

3.7. Layer Width vs. Interpretability

From AlexNet to ResNet, CNNs for visual recognition
have grown deeper in the quest for higher classification
accuracy. Depth has been shown to be important to high
discrimination ability, and we have seen in Sec. 3.4 that
interpretability can increase with depth as well. However,
the width of layers (the number of units per layer) has been
less explored. One reason is that increasing the number of
convolutional units at a layer significantly increases compu-
tational cost while yielding only marginal improvements in
classification accuracy. Nevertheless, some recent work [36]
shows that a carefully designed wide residual network can
achieve classification accuracy superior to the commonly
used thin and deep counterparts.

To explore how the width of layers affects interpretability
of CNNs, we do a preliminary experiment to test how width

AlexNet AlexNet-GAP-WideAlexNetAlexNet-GAP-Wide

Figure 13. Comparison between standard AlexNet and AlexNet-

affects emergence of interpretable detectors: we remove the
FC layers of the AlexNet, then triple the number of units
at the conv5, i.e., from 256 units to 768 units. Finally we
put a global average pooling layer after conv5 and fully
connect the pooled 768-feature activations to the final class
prediction. We call this model AlexNet-GAP-Wide.

After training on Places365, the AlexNet-GAP-Wide ob-
tains similar classification accuracy on the validation set as
the standard AlexNet ( 0.5% top1 accuracy lower), but it has
many more emergent concept detectors, both in terms of the
number of unique detectors and the number of detector units
at conv5, as shown in Fig. 13. We have also increased the
number of units to 1024 and 2048 at conv5, but the number
of unique concepts does not significantly increase further.
This may indicate a limit on the capacity of AlexNet to sep-
arate explanatory factors; or it may indicate that a limit on
the number of disentangled concepts that are helpful to solve
the primary task of scene classification.

4. Conclusion
This paper proposed a general framework, network dis-

section, for quantifying interpretability of CNNs. We applied
network dissection to measure whether interpretability is an
axis-independent phenomenon, and we found that it is not.
This is consistent with the hypothesis that interpretable units
indicate a partially disentangled representation. We applied
network dissection to investigate the effects on interpretabil-
ity of state-of-the art CNN training techniques. We have
confirmed that representations at different layers disentangle
different categories of meaning; and that different training
techniques can have a significant effect on the interpretability
of the representation learned by hidden units.
