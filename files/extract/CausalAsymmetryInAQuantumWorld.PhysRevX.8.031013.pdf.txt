Causal asymmetry is one of the great surprises in predictive modeling: The memory required to predict the
future differs from the memory required to retrodict the past. There is a privileged temporal direction for
modeling a stochastic process wherememory costs areminimal.Models operating in the other direction incur
an unavoidable memory overhead. Here, we show that this overhead can vanish when quantum models are
allowed. Quantum models forced to run in the less-natural temporal direction not only surpass their optimal
classical counterparts but also any classical model running in reverse time. This holds even when the memory
overhead is unbounded, resulting in quantum models with unbounded memory advantage.

I. INTRODUCTION

How can we observe an asymmetry in the temporal order
of events when physics at the quantum level is time
symmetric? The source of time’s barbed arrow is a long-
standing puzzle in foundational science [1–4]. Causal
asymmetry offers a provocative perspective [5]. It asks
how Occam’s razor—the principle of assuming no more
causes of natural things than are both true and sufficient to
explain their appearances—can privilege one particular
temporal direction over another. In other words, if we want
to model a process causally—such that the model makes
statistically correct future predictions based only on infor-
mation from the past—what is theminimumpast information
wemust store? Are we forced to store more data if we model
events in one particular temporal order over the other
(see Fig. 1)?

Consider a cannonball in free fall. To model its future
trajectory,weneed only its current position andvelocity. This
remains true even when we view the process in reverse time.

order to generate a statistically accurate retrodiction of the past
PðX⃖jX⃗ ¼ x⃗Þ. Causal asymmetry implies a nonzero gap between
the minimum memory required by any causal model Cþ and its
retrocausal counterpart C−.

This exemplifies causal symmetry. There is no difference in
the amount of information we must track for prediction
versus retrodiction. However, this is not as obvious for more
complex processes. Take a glass shattering upon impact with
the floor. In one temporal direction, the future distribution of
shards depends only on the glass’s current position, velocity,
and orientation. In the opposite direction, we may need to
track relevant information regarding each glass shard to infer
the glass’s prior trajectory. Does this require more or less
information? This potential divergence is quantified in the
theory of computational mechanics [6]. It is not only
generally nonzero, but it can also be unbounded. This
phenomenon implies that a simulator operating in the
“less-natural” temporal direction is penalized with poten-
tially unbounded memory overhead and is cited as a
candidate source of time’s barbed arrow [5].
These studies assumed that all models are implemented

using classical physics. Could the observed causal asym-
metry be a consequence of this classicality constraint? Here,
we first consider a particular stochastic process that is
causally asymmetric. We determine the minimal information
needed to model the same process in forward versus reverse
time using quantum physics, and we prove that these
quantities exactly coincide. More generally, we present
systematic methods to model any causally asymmetric
stochastic process quantum mechanically. Critically, the
resulting quantum models not only use less information
than any classical counterpart but also than any classical
model of the time-reversed process. Thus, quantum models
can field a memory advantage that always exceeds the
memory overhead incurred by causal asymmetry. Our work
indicates that this overhead can emerge when imposing
classical causal explanations. These results remain true even
in cases where causal asymmetry becomes unbounded.

II. BACKGROUND

A. Framework

Consider a system that emits an output xt governed by
some random variable Xt at each discrete point in time t.
This behavior can be described by a stochastic process
P—a joint probability distribution PðX⃖; X⃗Þ that correlates
past behavior, X⃖ ¼ …X−2X−1, with future expectations,
X⃗ ¼ X0X1…. Each instance of the past x⃖ ¼ …x−2x−1
exhibits a conditional future x⃗ ¼ x0x1… with probabil-
ity PðX⃗ ¼ x⃗jX⃖ ¼ x⃖Þ.
Suppose that a model for this system can replicate this

future statistical behavior using onlyH bits of past informa-
tion. Then, thismodel can be executed by encoding the past x⃖
into a state sðx⃖Þ ∈ S of a physical system Ξ of entropy H,
such that repeated application of a systematic actionM onΞ
sequentially generates x0; x1… governed by the conditional
future PðX⃗jX⃖ ¼ x⃖Þ. The model is causal if, at each instance
of time, all the informationΞ contains about the future can be

obtained from the past [7]. Implementing it on a computer
thengives us a statistically faithful simulationof theprocess’s
realizations.The simplest causalmodel for a processPðX⃖; X⃗Þ
is the model that minimizes H.
The statistical complexity Cþ is defined as the entropyH

of this simplest model—it is the minimal amount of past
information needed to make statistically correct future
predictions [13,14]. This measure is used to quantify
structure in diverse settings [15–17], including hidden
variable models emulating quantum contextuality [18].
Here, Cþ also fields thermodynamic significance, having
been linked to the minimal heat dissipation in stochastic
simulation and the minimal structure a device needs to fully
extract free energy from nonequilibrium environments
[19–22].
Causal asymmetry captures the discrepancy in statistical

complexity when a process is viewed in forward versus
reverse time [23]. Consider an observer that encountersXtþ1
before Xt. Their observations are characterized by the time-
reversed stochastic process P− ¼ P−ðY⃖; Y⃗Þ where past and
future are interchanged, such that Y⃖ ¼ … X1X0, while Y⃗ ¼
X−1X−2… and Yt ¼ X−ðtþ1Þ. A causal model for the time-
reversed process then corresponds to a retrocausal model for
the forward process PðX⃖; X⃗Þ. It generates a statistically
accurate retrodiction of the conditional past PðX⃖jX⃗ ¼ x⃗Þ,
using only information contained in the future x⃗. The
statistical complexity of this time-reversed process C−

(referred to as the retrodictive statistical complexity
for P) quantifies the minimal amount of causal information
we must assign to model PðX⃖; X⃗Þ in order of decreasing t.
Causal asymmetry captures the divergence ΔC ¼
jC− − Cþj. When ΔC > 0, a particular temporal direction
is privileged, such that modeling the process in the other
temporal direction incurs a memory overhead of ΔC.
Note that the definitions above are entropic measures and

thus take operational meaning at the i.i.d. limit—i.e.,
modelingN instances of a stochastic process with statistical
complexity Cþ requires NCþ bits of past information, in
the limit of large N. While this is the most commonly
adopted measure in computational mechanics, single-shot
variants do exist. The topological state complexity Dþ is
particularly noteworthy [13]. It captures the minimum
number of dimensions (max entropy) Ξ must have to
generate future statistics. A single-shot variant of causal
asymmetry can thus be defined by the difference ΔD ¼
jD− −Dþj between the topological state complexities of
Pþ and P−. Here, we focus on statistical complexity for
clarity. However, many of our results also hold in this
single-shot regime. We return to this when relevant.

B. Classical models

Prior studies of causal asymmetry assumed all models
were classical. In this context, causal asymmetry can be
explicitly demonstrated using ε-machines, the provably

optimal classical causal models [13,14]. This involves
dividing the set of pasts into equivalence classes, such that
two pasts, x⃖ and x⃖0, lie in the same class if and only if they
have coinciding future behavior, i.e., PðX⃗jX⃖ ¼ x⃖Þ ¼
PðX⃗jX⃖ ¼ x⃖0Þ. Instead of recording the entire past, an
ε-machine records only which equivalence class x⃖ lies
within—inducing an encoding function ε∶χ⃖ → S from the
space of pasts χ⃖ onto the space of equivalence classes
S ¼ fsig, known as causal states. At each time step, the
machine operates according to a collection of transition
probabilitiesTxij: the probability that an ε-machine initially in
si will transition to sj while emitting output x. The classical
statistical complexity thus coincides with the amount of
information needed to store the current causal state

Cþμ ¼ −
X
i

πi log πi; ð1Þ

where πi is the probability the past lies within si. Note that ε-
machines are also optimal with respect to the max entropy
[24], such that the topological state complexity Dμ of a
process is the logarithm of the number of causal states [13].
Despite their provable optimality, ε-machines still appear to
wastememory. The amount of past information they demand
typically exceeds the amount the past contains about the
future—the mutual information E ¼ IðX⃖; X⃗Þ. Observing an
ε-machine’s entire future is insufficient for deducing its
initial state. Some of the information it stores in the present is
never reflected in future statistics and is thus effectively
erased during operation. In general, this waste differs
betweenprediction and retrodiction, inducingnonzero causal
asymmetry.

C. Examples

We illustrate this by examples, starting with the per-
turbed coin. Consider a box containing a single biased coin.
At each time step, the box is perturbed, causing the coin to
flip with probability p if it is in heads (0) and q if it is in
tails (1). The coin’s state is then emitted as output. This
describes a stochastic process Pþ0 . As only the last output is
necessary for generating correct future statistics, Pþ0 has

two causal states, corresponding to the states of the coin.
The statistical complexity hðπþ1 Þ thus represents the
entropy of the biased coin, where πþ1 ¼ ½p=ðpþ qÞ� is
the probability the coin is in heads and hðxÞ ¼ −x log x −
ð1 − xÞ logð1 − xÞ is the binary entropy. Furthermore, Pþ0
is clearly symmetric under time reversal (i.e., Pþ0 ¼ P−0 )
and thus trivially causally symmetric.
Suppose we postprocess the output of the perturbed coin,

replacing the first 0 of each consecutive substring of 0s
with a 2 (for example, …1000110100… becomes
…1200112120…). This results in a new stochastic process,
Pþh ðX⃖; X⃗Þ, called the heralding coinPhþ, which also has two
causal states, sþ1 ¼ fx⃖jx−1 ¼ 1g and sþ0 ¼ fx⃖jx−1 ≠ 1g. In
fact, one can model Pþh ðX⃖; X⃗Þ by perturbing the same biased
coin in a box and modifying it to output 2—instead of 0—
when it transitions from heads to tails (see Fig. 2). Thus, the
heralding coin also has classical statistical complex-
ity Cþμ ¼ hðπþ1 Þ.
Its retrodictive statistical complexity, however, is higher.

The time-reversed process P−h ðY⃖; Y⃗Þ represents an alter-
native postprocessing of the perturbed coin—replacing the
last 0 in each consecutive substring of 0s with a 2. Now,
0 can be followed by 0 or 2, while 1 can be followed by
anything, and 2 can only be followed by 1, inducing three
causal states s−j ¼ fy⃖jy−1 ¼ jg (see Fig. 2). This immedi-
ately establishes a difference in the number of distinct
configurations needed for causal versus retrocausal model-
ing. Indeed, Phþ fields causal asymmetry,

ΔCμ ¼ C−μ − Cþμ ¼ ð1 − π−1 ÞhðγÞ; ð2Þ
where γ ¼ π−2 =ð1 − π−1 Þ and π−j ¼ P−h ðy⃖ ∈ s−j Þ. To under-
stand this asymmetry, note that when modeling Phþ, we
need only know if the previous output was 1 (i.e., current
state of the coin) to decide whether a 0 should be replaced
by a 2. To model Ph−, however, one cannot simply look
into the “future” to see if the system will output 1 next.
Causal asymmetry thus captures the overhead required to
accommodate this restriction.
In general, causal asymmetry can be unbounded. In

Appendix D, we describe the class of n-m flower processes,

where Cþμ scales as OðlognÞ while C−μ scales as OðlogmÞ.
Note that n and m can be adjusted independently, allowing
construction of processes where ΔCμ > K for any given
constantK. Settingm ¼ 2, for example, can yield a process
where Cþμ can be made arbitrarily high, while C−μ ≤ log 3.
When this occurs, the memory overhead incurred for
modeling the process in the less-natural direction scales
towards infinity.

D. Quantum models

A quantum causal model is described formally by an
ordered tuple Q ¼ ðf;Ω;MÞ, where Ω is a set of quantum
states; f∶χ⃖ → Ω defines how each past x⃖ is encoded into a
state fðx⃖Þ ¼ jsx⃖i of a physical system Ξ; and M is a
quantum measurement process. To model PðX⃖; X⃗Þ,
repeated applications of M on Ξ must generate correct
conditional future behavior. In other words, application of
M on a system Ξ in state jsx⃖i must (i) generate an output x
with probability PðX0 ¼ xjX⃖ ¼ x⃖Þ and (ii) transition Ξ into
a new state fðx⃖0Þ ¼ jsx⃖0 i, where x⃖0 ¼ x⃖x, such that
L-repeated applications of M will generate x0;…; xL−1
with correct probability PðX0∶LjX⃖ ¼ x⃖Þ for any desired
L ∈ Zþ [25]. The entropy of a model Q is given by
the von Neumann entropy SðρÞ ¼ −Trðρ log ρÞ, where
ρ ¼ PPðX⃖ ¼ x⃖Þjsx⃖ihsx⃖j. Thus, the quantum statistical
complexity Cþq of a process can be computed by minimiz-
ing SðρÞ over all valid models [26].
This optimization is highly nontrivial. There exists no

systematic techniques for constructing optimal quantum
models or for proving the optimality of a given candidate
model. To date, Cþq has only been evaluated for the Ising
chain [25]. However, this process is symmetric under time
reversal, implying that ΔCμ is trivially zero. Nevertheless,
recent advances show multiple settings where quantum
models outperform optimal classical counterparts [27–31].
In fact, for every stochastic process where the optimal
classical models are wasteful (i.e., Cþμ > E), it is always
possible to design a simpler quantum model [27]. Indeed,
sometimes the quantum memory advantage Cþμ − Cþq can
be unbounded [32]. Could quantum models mitigate the
memory overhead induced by causal asymmetry?

III. RESULTS

We study this question via two complementary
approaches. The first is a case study of the heralding
coin—the aforementioned process that exhibits causal
asymmetry. We pioneer methods to establish its provably
optimal quantum causal and retrocausal models and thus
produce a precise picture of how quantum mechanics
mitigates all present causal asymmetry. The second case
studies quantum modeling of arbitrary processes with
causal asymmetry. Here, Cþq and C−q cannot be directly
evaluated but can nevertheless be bounded. In doing so, we

show that when forced to model such a process in the less-
natural direction, the quantum advantage always exceeds
the memory overhead ΔCμ.

A. The heralding coin

Let Phþ denote the heralding coin process. Here, we first
state the optimal quantummodels ofPhþ andPh−. We then
outline how their optimality is established, leaving details
of the formal proof to Appendix B. The optimal causal
model Qþ has two internal states:

with associated encoding function ϵþq ðx⃖Þ ¼ jsþi i if and only
if x⃖ ∈ sþi . Given a qubit in state ϵþq ðx⃖Þ, Fig. 3 establishes the
sequential procedure that replicates expected future behav-
ior, i.e., samples Pþh ðX⃗jX⃖ ¼ x⃖Þ.

simultaneously collapses the bottom qubit into the causal state for
the next time step. (b) To simulate P−h ðY⃖; Y⃗Þ, we prepare state

the first two qubits yields yt (provided we identify measurement
outcome 00 → yt ¼ 0, 10 → yt ¼ 1, and 01 → yt ¼ 2) and col-
lapses the remaining qubit into the quantum causal state for the next
time step. In either circuit, retaining only the state ofΞ (green circle)
at each time step is sufficient for generating statistically correct
predictions or retrodictions.

Meanwhile, the optimal quantum retrocausal model Q−

has encoding function ϵ−q ðy⃖Þ ¼ js−i i if and only if y⃖ ∈ s−i ,
where

js−0 i ¼ j0i;

js−2 i ¼ j1i: ð4Þ

The associated procedure for sequential generation of y⃗ as
governed by P−h ðY⃗jY⃖ ¼ y⃖Þ is outlined in Fig. 3.
To establish optimality, we first invoke the causal-state

correspondence: For any stochastic process with causal
states fsig that occur with probability πi, there exists an
optimal model Q ¼ ðϵq;Ω;MÞ, where the elements of Ω
are in one-to-one correspondence with fsig (see Lemma 1
of Appendix A). Since the heralding coin process has two
forward causal states, we can restrict our computation of
Cþq to quantum models where Ω ¼ fjψþ0 i; jψþ1 ig.
Moreover, we can show that the data-processing inequality
implies jhψþ0 jψþ1 ij ≤

ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi
pð1 − qÞp ≡ F (see Lemma 2 of

Appendix A). The monotonicity between jhψþ0 jψþ1 ij and
the entropy of the resulting model, together with the
observation that jhsþ0 jsþ1 ij ¼ F, then implies optimality
ofQþ (see Theorem 1 in Appendix). This result establishes
Cþq ¼ SðρþÞ for ρþ ¼

P
iπ

þ
i jsþi ihsþi j.

Proving the optimality of Q− is more involved. First,
note that the causal-state correspondence allows us to
consider only candidate models Q ¼ ðf;Ω;MÞ, where
Ω ¼ fjψ−k igk¼0.::2 has three elements. The data processing
inequality can then be used to establish the fidelity

constraints jhψ−j jψ−k ij ≤ jhs−j js−k ij (see Lemma 2 of
Appendix A). Let σ ¼ P π−k jψ−k ihψ−k j, with eigenvalues
λk, and ρ− ¼

P
π−k js−k ihs−k j, with eigenvalues λ−k . In

Lemma 4 of Appendix B, we prove that for all choices
of jψ−k i satisfying the fidelity constraint, λ−k majorizes λk.
Thus, ρ− has minimal entropy among all valid retrocausal
quantum models.
Note that Qþ and Q− exhibit different encoding func-

tions (one maps onto two code words, the other onto three)
and invoke seemingly unrelated quantum circuits for
generating future statistics (see Fig. 3). Nevertheless, direct
computation yields

where c¼(p2ð1þ4ð1−qÞqÞ−2pqþq2)=ðpþqÞ2 and hð·Þ
is the binary entropy. Thus, ΔCq ¼ 0 for all values of
p and q. This establishes our first result:
Result 1. There exists stochastic processes that are

causally asymmetric (Cþμ ≠ C−μ ) but exhibit no such asym-
metry when modeled quantum mechanically (Cþq ¼ C−q ).
This vanishing of causal asymmetry at the quantum level

is not simply the result of saturating the bound given by E.
Figure 4 shows that E < Cþq ¼ C−q < Cþμ < C−μ for almost
all values of p and q. While both quantum causal and
retrocausal models reduce memory resources beyond
classical limits [i.e., Cþq < Cþμ and C−q < C−μ—see
Figs. 4(f) and 4(g)], they each still store some unnecessary
information [Cþq ; C−q > E—see Fig. 4(i)].
Our results persist when consideringminimal dimensions,

rather than minimal entropy required for causal modeling.

Cþq ¼ C−q and thus ΔCq ¼ 0.

Here, Phþ requires only two causal states and thus can be
modeled using a two-level system (Dþμ ¼ log 2). However,
Ph− has three causal states.Modeling it thus requires a three-
level system (D−μ ¼ log 3). In contrast, the three quantum
causal states of Ph− can be embedded within a single qubit;
thus, the dynamics of the heralding coin can be modeled
using a single qubit in either temporal direction. Therefore,
this vanishing of causal asymmetry also applies in single-
shot settings.

B. General processes

We now study quantum mitigation of causal asymmetry
for general stochastic processes by bounding Cþq and C−q
from above. Let Cminμ ¼ minðCþμ ; C−μ Þ represent the mini-
mum amount of information we need to classically model
PðX⃖; X⃗Þ when allowed to optimize over the temporal
direction. Meanwhile, let Cmaxq ¼ maxðCþq ; C−q Þ be the
minimal memory a quantum system needs when forced
to model the process in the least favorable temporal
direction. In Appendix C, we establish the following:
Result 2. For any stochastic process P,

maxðCþq ; C−q Þ ≤ minðCþμ ; C−μ Þ: ð6Þ

Equality occurs only if Cþμ ¼ C−μ ¼ E, such that P is
causally symmetric.
Consider any causally asymmetric process P, such that

modeling it in the less-favorable temporal direction incurs
memory overhead ΔCμ. Result 2 implies that this overhead
can be entirely mitigated by quantum models. There exists
a quantum model that is not only provably simpler than its
optimal classical counterpart but is also simpler than any
classical model of the time-reversed process P−. In Lemma
7 (see Appendix C), we show that such models can be
systematically constructed and aligned with the simplest,
currently known, quantum models—q-machines [33,34].
As a corollary, causal asymmetry guarantees both Cþq <
Cþμ and C−q < C−μ ; i.e., a nonzero quantum advantage exists
when modeling in either causal direction.
A variant of these results also applies to topological state

complexity. Suppose the number of causal states for P and
its time reversal P− differ, such that Dþμ ≠ D−μ . Let Dþq and
D−q , respectively, be the logarithm of the minimal dimen-
sions needed to model P and P− quantum mechanically.
Appendix C also establishes the following result.
Result 3. For any stochastic process P,

maxðDþq ; D−q Þ ≤ minðDþμ ; D−μ Þ: ð7Þ

Given that there exists stochastic processes where
predictive and retrodictive topological complexities differ
(e.g., the heralding coin), this immediately implies the
following corollary.

Result 4. The quantum topological complexity Dq can
be strictly less than the classical topological complexityDμ.
This solves an open question in quantum modeling—

whether quantum mechanics allows for models that sim-
ulate stochastic processes using not only reduced memory
but also reduced dimensions.
These results have a particular impact when ΔCμ is

exceedingly large. Recall that in the case of the n − 2
flower process, Cminμ ≤ log 3, while Cþμ scales as Oðlog nÞ.
Our theorem then implies that C�q ≤ Cminμ ≤ log 3. Thus,
we immediately identify a class of processes whose optimal
classical models require a memory that scales as Oðlog nÞ
and yet can be modeled quantum mechanically using a
single qutrit.

IV. FUTURE DIRECTIONS

There are a number of potential relations between causal
asymmetry and innovations on the arrow of time and
retrodictive quantum theory. In this section, we survey
some of these connections and highlight promising future
research directions.

A. Retrodictive quantum mechanics

Consider the evolution of an open quantum system that is
monitored continuously in time. Standard quantum trajec-
tory theory describes how the system’s internal state ρðtÞ
evolves, encapsulating how our expectations of future
measurement outcomes are updated based on past obser-
vations. Retrodictive quantum mechanics introduces the
effect matrix EðtÞ—a time-reversed analogue of the density
matrix ρðtÞ [35–37]. Note that EðtÞ propagates backwards
through time, representing how our expectations of the past
change as we scan future measurement outcomes in time-
reversed order. The original motivation was that ρðtÞ and
EðtÞ combined yield a more accurate estimate of the
measurement statistics at time t than ρðtÞ alone, allowing
improved smoothing procedures [38–41].
While this framework and causal asymmetry differ in

motivation and details (e.g., monitoring is done in con-
tinuous time, whereas we have so far only considered
discrete time), there are also notable coinciding concepts.
The standard propagation equation for ρðtÞ parallels a
causal model for observed measurement statistics, while its
time-reversed counterpart governing EðtÞ parallels a cor-
responding retrocausal model. It would certainly be inter-
esting to see if such systems exhibit either classical or
quantum causal asymmetry. For example, does the resource
cost of tracking EðtÞ differ from that of ρðtÞ under some
appropriate measure [42]?
Answering these questions will likely involve significant

extensions of current results. Our framework presently
assumes that the process evolves autonomously and that
time is divided into discrete steps. These restrictions will
need to be lifted by combining present results with recent

generalizations of classical and quantum computational
mechanics to continuum time [43,44] and input-dependent
regimes [21,45,46]. More generally, such developments
will enable a formal study of causal asymmetry in the
quantum-trajectory formulation of open quantum systems.

B. Arrow of time in quantum measurement

Related to such open systems are recent proposals for
inferring an arrow of time from continuous measurement
[47]. These proposals consider continuously monitoring a
quantum system initialized in state ρi, resulting in a
measurement record rðtÞ with some probability P½rðtÞjρi�.
Concurrently, the state of the system evolves through a
quantum trajectory ρðtÞ into some final configuration
ρðTÞ ¼ ρf. The goal is to identify an alternative sequence
of measurements, such that for at least one possible outcome
record r0ðtÞ occurring with nonzero probability P½r0ðtÞjρf�,
the trajectory rewinds. In other words, a system initially in
state ρf will evolve into ρi, passing through all intermediary
states in time-reversed order. An arrow of time emerges as
P½rðtÞjρi� and P½r0ðtÞjρf� generally differ, such that one of
the two directions occurs with greater probability. An
argument via Bayes’ theorem then assigns different prob-
abilistic likelihoods towards whether ρðtÞ occurred in
forward or reverse time.
This framework provides a complementary perspective

to our results. It aims to reverse the trajectory of the
system’s internal state ρðtÞ, placing no constraints on the
relation between the measurement statistics governing rðtÞ
and r0ðtÞ. In contrast, causal asymmetry deals with revers-
ing the observed measurement statistics (as described by
some stochastic process P) while placing no restrictions on
the internal dynamics of the causal and retrocausal models
(the two models may even field different Hilbert space
dimensions, such as in the heralding coin example).
We also observe some striking parallels. Both works start

out with some sequential data but no knowledge about
whether the sequence occurred in forward or reverse time.
Both ask the following question: Is there some sort of
asymmetry singling out one temporal direction over the
other? In the emerging arrow of time from quantum
measurement, we are given a trajectory ρðtÞ, and asym-
metry arises from the difficulty (in terms of success
probability) of realizing this trajectory in forward versus
reverse time. Meanwhile, in causal asymmetry, we are
given the observed measurement statistics, and an arrow of
time arises from the difference in resource costs needed to
realize these statistics causally in forward versus reverse
time. It would then be interesting to see if a similar
argument via Bayes’ theorem can be adapted to causal
asymmetry. If we suppose that more complex machines are
less likely to exist in nature (e.g., due to dimensional or
entropic constraints), could we then argue whether a given
stochastic process is more likely to occur in one causal
direction versus the other?

V. DISCUSSION

Causal asymmetry captures the memory overhead
incurred when modeling a stochastic process in one
temporal order versus the other. This induces a privileged
temporal direction when one seeks the simplest causal
explanation. Here, we demonstrate a process where this
overhead is nonzero when using classical models and yet
vanishes when quantum models are allowed. For arbitrary
processes exhibiting causal asymmetry, we prove that
quantum models forced to operate in a given temporal
order always require less memory than classical counter-
parts, even when the latter are permitted to operate in either
temporal direction. The former result represents a concrete
case where causal asymmetry vanishes in the quantum
regime. The latter implies that the more causally asym-
metric a process, the greater the resource advantage of
modeling it quantum mechanically.
Our results also hold when memory is quantified by max

entropy. They thus establish that quantum mechanics can
reduce the dimensionality needed to simulate a process
beyond classical limits. Indeed, our results isolate families
of processes whose statistical complexity grows without
bound but can nevertheless be modeled exactly by a
quantum system of bounded dimension. These features
make such processes ideal for demonstrating the practical
benefits of quantum models—allowing us to verify an
arbitrarily large quantum advantage in single-shot regimes
[24,48] and avoiding the need to measure von Neumann
entropy as in current state-of-the-art experiments [29].
One compelling open question is the potential thermo-

dynamic consequences of causal asymmetry. In computa-
tional mechanics,Cþμ has thermodynamical relevance in the
contexts of prediction and pattern manipulation [19–22,49].
For instance, the minimum heat one must dissipate to
generate future predictions based on only past observations
is given byWþdiss ¼ kBTðCþμ − EÞ, where kB is Boltzmann’s
constant, T is the environmental temperature, and the
excess entropy E is symmetric with respect to time reversal.
Therefore, nonzero causal asymmetry implies that flipping
the temporal order in which we ascribe predictions incurs
an energetic overhead of ΔWdiss ¼ kBTΔCμ. In processes
where ΔCμ scales without bound, this cost may become
prohibitive. Could our observation that ΔCq ≤ Cminμ imply
that such energetic penalties become strongly mitigated
when quantum simulators are taken into account?
A second direction is to isolate what properties of

quantum processing enable it to mitigate causal asymmetry.
In Appendix C, we establish that all deterministic processes
are causally symmetric, such that C�μ ¼ C�q ¼ E (see
Lemma 6 of Appendix C). Randomness is therefore
essential for causal asymmetry. Observe also that the
provably optimal quantum causal and retrocausal models
for the heralding coin both operated unitarily—such that
their dynamics are entirely deterministic (modulo

measurement of outputs). Indeed, such unitary quantum
models can always be constructed [34], and we conjecture
that this unitarity implies causal symmetry. However, it
remains an open question as to whether the optimal
quantum model is always unitary.
Insights here will ultimately help answer the big out-

standing question of whether the quantum statistical com-
plexity ever displays asymmetry under time reversal.
Identifying any process for which such asymmetry persists
implies that Occam’s preference for minimal cause can
privilege a temporal direction in a fully quantum world.
Proof that no such process exists would be equally exciting,
indicating that causal asymmetry is a consequence of
enforcing all causal explanations to be classical in a
fundamentally quantum world.

APPENDIX A: TECHNICAL DEFINITIONS

We first introduce further technical notation and back-
ground that will be used for subsequent proofs.
Definition 1 (Quantum causal model) Consider an

ordered tuple Q ¼ ðf;Ω;MÞ, where Ω is a set of quantum
states; f∶χ⃖ → Ω is an encoding function that maps each x⃖
onto a state fðx⃖Þ ¼ jsx⃖i of a physical system Ξ; andM is a
quantum process.Q is a quantum model for PðX⃖; X⃗Þ if and
only if, for any x⃖ ∈ χ⃖, whenever Ξ is prepared in fðx⃖Þ,
subsequent application ofM (i) generates an output x with
probability PðX0 ¼ xjX⃖ ¼ x⃖Þ and (ii) transitions Ξ into a
new state fðx⃖0Þ ¼ jsx⃖0 i, where x⃖0 ¼ x⃖x [25].

Condition (i) guarantees that if a quantum model is
initialized in state fðx⃖Þ, then the model’s future output
X0 ¼ x will be statistically indistinguishable from the
output of the process itself. Condition (ii) ensures that
the internal memory of the quantum model is updated to
record the event X0 ¼ x, allowing the model to stay
synchronized with the sequence of outputs it has generated
so far. Thus, a series of L repeated applications ofM acting
on Ξ generates output x0∶L ¼ x0…xL−1 with probability
PðX0∶L ¼ x0∶LjX⃖ ¼ x⃖Þ and simultaneously transitions Ξ
into the state fðx⃖x0∶LÞ. In the limit L → ∞, the model
produces a sequence of outputs x⃗ ¼ x0x1… with proba-
bility PðX⃗jX⃖ ¼ x⃖Þ.
The entropy of a quantum model Q is given by

CqðQÞ ¼ SðρÞ ¼ −Trðρ log ρÞ; ðA1Þ
where Sð·Þ is the von Neumann entropy, ρ ¼ Px⃖πx⃖ρx⃖ for
ρx⃖ ¼ jsx⃖ihsx⃖j, and πx⃖ ¼ PðX⃖ ¼ x⃖Þ.
Definition 2 Q is an optimal quantum model for a

process PðX⃖; X⃗Þ if, given any other model Q0, we
have CqðQ0Þ ≥ CqðQÞ.
Consider a stationary stochastic process PðX⃖; X⃗Þ, such

that PðX0∶LÞ ¼ PðXt∶tþLÞ for any L ∈ Zþ, t ∈ Z. Let
PðX⃖; X⃗Þ have causal states S ¼ fsig each occurring with
stationary probability πi. Define the conditional distribution
PiðX⃗Þ ¼ PðX⃗jX⃖ ¼ x⃖ ∈ siÞ as the future morph of causal
state si. We make use of the following two results derived
in Ref. [25].
Lemma 1 (Causal-state correspondence). Let PðX⃖; X⃗Þ

be a stochastic process with causal states fsig. There exists
an optimal model Q ¼ ðϵq;Ω;MÞ, where Ω ¼ fjsiig and
ϵqðx⃖Þ ¼ jsii if and only if x⃖ ∈ si.
This implies that we can limit our search for optimal

models Q ¼ ðf;Ω;MÞ to those whose internal states Ω ¼
fjψ iig are in one-to-one correspondence with the classical
causal states. In addition, it can be shown that Ω must
satisfy the following constraint:
Lemma 2 (Maximum fidelity constraint). Let PðX⃖; X⃗Þ

be a stochastic process with causal states fsig, and let
Q ¼ ðf;Ω;MÞ be a valid quantum model satisfying
fðx⃖Þ ¼ jψ ii iff x⃖ ∈ si. Then, jhψ ijψ jij ≤ Fij, where Fij ¼P

x⃗½Piðx⃗ÞPjðx⃗Þ�12 is the fidelity between the future morphs
of si and sj.
These definitions assume that all elements of Ω are pure.

This is because computational mechanics considers only
causal models—models whose internal states do not store
more information about the future than what is available
from the past. Specifically, let R be a random variable
governing the state of a model at t ¼ 0. Then, IðR; X⃗jX⃖Þ is
known as the oracular information, and it represents the
amount of extra information R contains about the future X⃗
that is not contained in the past X⃖. For causal models,

IðR; X⃗jX⃖Þ ¼ 0 [8]. In Appendix E, we show that this allows
us to assume that all elements of Ω are pure without loss of
generality.

APPENDIX B: PROOFS OF OPTIMALITY

Here, we formally prove that the quantum models for the
heralding coin given in Eqs. (3) and (4) are optimal.

1. Optimality of the causal model

Let Phþ denote the heralding coin process, with the
corresponding ε-machine depicted in Fig. 2(a).
Theorem 1. Consider Qþ ¼ ðεþq ;Ωþ;MþÞ, where

Ωþ ¼ fjsþ0 i; jsþ1 ig, and Mþ described by the quantum
circuit in Fig. 3(a). Here, Qþ is an optimal quantum model
for Phþ.
Proof.—We prove this by contradiction. Assume there

exists some Q ¼ ðf;Ω;MÞ such that CqðQÞ < CqðQþÞ.
Lemma 1 implies that we can assume Ω ¼ fjψ0i; jψ1ig for
some jψ0i and jψ1i and encoding function fðx⃖Þ ¼ jψ ii if
and only if x⃖ ∈ sþi , without loss of generality. Here, CqðQÞ,
the von Neumann entropy of the ensemble fjψ ii; πþi g, is a
monotonically decreasing function of jhψ0jψ1ij [50]. Thus,
CqðQÞ < CqðQþÞ implies that jhψ0jψ1ij > jhsþ0 jsþ1 ij ¼ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi

This is a contradiction. Thus, no such Q exists. □

2. Optimality of the retrocausal model

Let Ph− denote the time reversal of the heralding coin
process, with the corresponding ε-machine in Fig. 2(b).
Theorem 2. Define Q− ¼ ðε−q ;Ω−;M−Þ, where

ε−q ðy⃖Þ ¼ js−i i if and only if y⃖ ∈ s−i , with

Fig. 3(b). Here, Q− is an optimal quantum model for Ph−.
Below, we break down the proof of this theorem into a

series of small steps. Each step is phrased as a lemma.
Lemma 3. Let Q ¼ ðf;Ω;MÞ be a quantum model for

Ph− satisfying fðy⃗Þ ¼ jψ ii iff y⃗ ∈ s−i . Then, up to a unitary
rotation,

jψ0i ¼ j0i;

maximum fidelity constraint, jhψ ijψ jij ≤ F−ij. Thus,
hψ0jψ2i ¼ 0. Therefore, jψ0i ¼ j0i and jψ2i ¼ j1i up to
a unitary rotation. We can then write jψ1i in the form above
without loss of generality, as the coefficient of j2i can be
made real and positive by choosing a suitable definition of
basis element j2i. Meanwhile, constraints on jhψ1jψ2ij ≤ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi

Our models described in Eq. (4) can be obtained by
setting r sin θeiω ¼ ffiffiffiqp and ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi1 − r2p eiα ¼ ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi1 − qp in
Eq. (B4) (i.e., this corresponds to choosing jψ0i ¼ js−0 i,
jψ1i ¼ js−1 i, and jψ2i ¼ js−2 i). The subsequent lemma then
establishes that this is the optimal choice.
Lemma 4. For any quantum model Q ¼ ðf;Ω;MÞ of

Ph− satisfying fðy⃗Þ ¼ jψ ii if and only if y⃖ ∈ s−i ,

CqðQÞ ≥ CqðQ−Þ: ðB5Þ

In other words, Q−, as described by Eq. (4), is the lowest
entropy (optimal) model that satisfies the causal-state
correspondence.
Proof.—By definition, CqðQ−Þ ¼ Sðρ−Þ for

ρ− ¼ Piπ−i js−i ihs−i j, where π−i ¼ P−h ðy⃗ ∈ s−i Þ and the
states js−i i are given in Eq. (4). We label the eigenvalues
of this state from largest to smallest by λ−0 , λ

Meanwhile, by the above lemma, CqðQÞ ¼ Sðρψ1Þ, where

ρψ1 ¼ π−0 j0ih0j þ π−2 j1ih1j þ π−1 jψ1ihψ1j;

and jψ1i is described by Eq. (B4). We label the eigenvalues
of ρψ1 from largest to smallest by λψ10 , λ

We can assume the coefficient of j2i is real and positive

that λ−0 þ λ−1 ≥ λψ10 þ λψ11 . Together, these results imply
λ−≻λψ1 and therefore CqðQ−Þ ≤ CqðQÞ. □
By Lemma 1, Ph− has an optimal quantum model that

satisfies the causal-state correspondence. Meanwhile, by
Lemma 4, anyQ satisfying the causal-state correspondence
must have CqðQÞ ≥ CqðQ−Þ. It follows that Q− is an
optimal quantum model for Ph−.

APPENDIX C: PROOF OF RESULT 2

Here, we prove Result 2. To do this, we require some
preliminary lemmas. The first connects the capacity for
quantum models to improve upon their optimal classical
counterparts with causal asymmetry.
Lemma 5. If the classical and quantum statistical com-

plexities of a processP coincide, such thatCþq ¼ Cþμ , thenP
is causally symmetric and Cþμ ¼ C−μ ¼ E.
Proof.—We first make use of the prior results, showing

that whenever classical models waste information, more
efficient quantum models exist [27]. Specifically, Cþμ > E
if and only if Cþq < Cþμ . Thus, Cþq ¼ Cþμ implies that

Cþμ ¼ E. It is therefore sufficient to show that Cþμ ¼ E
implies C−μ ¼ E.
We prove this by contradiction. Assume Cþμ ¼ E but

C−μ > E. Now, Cþμ ¼ E implies HðS−1jX⃗Þ ¼ 0, where S−1
is the random variable governing the causal state at t ¼ −1
[14]. Thus, given x⃗, we can find a unique si such that
PðX⃖ ¼ x⃖jX⃗ ¼ x⃗Þ is only nonzero when x⃖ ∈ si. It follows
that the sets τi ¼ fx⃗jPiðX⃗ ¼ x⃗Þ ≠ 0g form a partitioning on
the space of all futures (i.e., τi ∩ τj ¼ ∅ for i ≠ j).
Furthermore, any two x⃖, x⃖0 ∈ si satisfy PðX⃗jX⃖ ¼ x⃖Þ ¼

PðX⃗jX⃖ ¼ x⃖0Þ, by definition of si. Thus, Bayes’ theorem
implies that the τi partition the future into equivalence
classes x⃗ ∼ x⃗0 if and only if PðX⃖jX⃗ ¼ x⃗Þ ¼ PðX⃖jX⃗ ¼ x⃗0Þ
[53]. Hence, fτig constitute the retrocausal states. Bayes’
theorem also yields PðX⃖ ¼ x⃖jX⃗ ¼ x⃗ ∈ τiÞ ≠ 0 only when
x⃖ ∈ si. This impliesHðS−−1jX⃖ ¼ x⃖Þ ¼ 0, where S−−1 governs
the retrocausal state at time t ¼ −1. Hence, C−μ ¼ E, which
is a contradiction. □
It follows as a direct corollary of this result that causal

asymmetry vanishes for deterministic processes [i.e., proc-
esses where HðX⃗jX⃖Þ ¼ 0].
Lemma 6. Any deterministic process PðX⃖; X⃗Þ has

ΔCμ ¼ 0.
Proof.—Any deterministic process has E ¼ Cþμ [14,54].

Since E ≤ Cþq ≤ Cþμ , it follows that E ¼ Cþμ ¼ Cþq ; thus,
according to the above lemma, ΔCμ ¼ 0. □
Our next lemma makes use of q-machines [33], the

simplest currently known quantum models. Consider a
process P ¼ PðX⃖; X⃗Þ whose classical ε-machine has a
collection of causal states S ¼ fsig and transition proba-
bilities Txij. Let k denote the cryptic order of PðX⃖; X⃗Þ,
defined as the smallest l such that HðSljX0∶∞Þ ¼ 0
[28,33,54]. The q-machine of P has internal states jSii
defined by a recursive relation

jSii ¼ jSiðl ¼ kÞi; where ðC1Þ

jSiðlÞi ¼

q
jxijSjðl − 1Þi; ðC2Þ

and jSið0Þi ¼ jii. The associated encoding function sat-
isfies fðx⃖Þ ¼ jSii whenever x⃖ ∈ si [28,33]. Let C̄q ¼ SðρÞ
be the q-machine complexity—the amount of information a
q-machine stores about the past, where ρ ¼ PiπijSiihSij.
Meanwhile, let the max entropy D̄q ¼ log tr½ρ�0 be the q-
machine state complexity—the minimum dimensionality of
any quantum system Ξ capable of storing these internal
states. Note that since q-machines are valid quantum
models, Cþq ≤ C̄þq and C−q ≤ C̄−q . Likewise, Dþq ≤ D̄þq
and D−q ≤ D̄−q . We now establish that the q-machine for
P and its time reversal P− have coinciding von Neumann
entropies and coinciding max entropies.

Lemma 7. Let PðX⃖; X⃗Þ be a stationary stochastic
process and P−ðY⃖; Y⃗Þ its time reversal, with q-machine
complexity C̄þq and C̄−q , and q-machine state complexity
D̄þq and D̄−q , respectively. Then, C̄þq ¼ C̄−q and D̄þq ¼ D̄−q .
Proof.—We first introduce some compact notation. Let

PðX⃖ ¼ x⃖; X⃗ ¼ x⃗Þ ¼ P
x
↔ and, similarly, PðX⃗ ¼ x⃗jX⃖ ¼ x⃖Þ ¼

Px⃗jx⃖, PðX⃗ ¼ x⃗jS−1 ¼ siÞ ¼ Piðx⃗Þ, as well as PðX⃖ ¼ x⃖Þ ¼
Px⃖ and Pðx⃖ ∈ siÞ ¼ πi.
Now let jSþi i denote the internal states of theq-machine for

PðX⃖; X⃗Þ, such that ρþ ¼ PiπijSþi ihSþi j and C̄þq ¼ SðρþÞ.
From existing work [28,33], we know that
liml→∞hSiðlÞjSjðlÞi ¼ hSiðkÞjSjðkÞi. Thus, let ωþðlÞ ¼P

iπijSþi ðlÞihSþi ðlÞj and ωþ ¼ liml→∞ωþðlÞ such that
C̄þq ¼ SðωþÞ. Then,

We can verify that ωþ ¼ TrX⃖½ρX⃖ X⃗� and ω− ¼ TrX⃗½ρX⃖ X⃗�.
Thus, Sðω−Þ ¼ SðωþÞ, and therefore, C̄þq ¼ C̄−q . The
q-machine complexities of the forward and backward proc-
esses thus coincide.
Note that the ranks of ωþ and ω− must also

coincide. Thus, an analogous argument establishes that

log tr½ρþ�0 ¼ log tr½ρ−�0, indicating the two models also
have the same dimensionality. Therefore, D̄þq ¼ D̄−q . □
WenowproveResult 2.Consider any stochastic processP.

First, assume P is causally asymmetric, such that ΔCμ ≠ 0.
Note that this implies Cþμ ; C−μ > E (by Lemma 5).
Meanwhile, Lemma 7 implies that C̄þq ¼ C̄−q . Thus, it is
sufficient to show that C̄þq < Cþμ and C̄−q < C−μ , whenever
Cþμ , C−μ > E.
Note that for a general process, C̄q < Cμ if and only if

the q-machine has two internal states with nonzero overlap
hSijSji > 0 [56]. It was also previously established that
whenever Cμ > E, we can find some hSið1ÞjSjð1Þi > 0
[27], as defined by Eq. (C1). It follows from the iterative
construction that hSijSji > 0, and thus C̄q < Cμ. Therefore,
Cþμ > E implies C̄þq < Cþμ and C−μ > E implies C̄−q < C−μ .
Hence, for any causally asymmetric P,

maxðCþq ; C−q Þ < minðCþμ ; C−μ Þ: ðC7Þ

Conversely, suppose maxðCþq ;C−q Þ¼minðCþμ ;C−μ Þ. Without
loss of generality, we can assume Cþμ ≤ C−μ . This implies
either (i) Cþq ¼ Cþμ or (ii) C−q ¼ Cþμ . In the case of (i), direct
application of Lemma 5 implies Cþμ ¼ C−μ ¼ E. In the case
of (ii), we have Cþμ ≥ C̄þq ¼ C̄−q ≥ C−q ¼ Cþμ , which implies
Cþμ ¼ C̄þq . In other words, q-machines are not more efficient
than ε-machines in modeling P. This is true if and only if
Cþq ¼ Cþμ [27,28]. Thus, Lemma 5 again implies Cþμ ¼
C−μ ¼ E. This completes the proof.

APPENDIX D: n-m FLOWER PROCESS

The family of n-m flower processes demonstrates how
causal asymmetry can be potentially unbounded (see
Fig. 5). The process has statistical complexity
Cþμ ¼ 1þ 12 log½n�. In contrast, the time-reversed process
will have at most mþ 1 causal states, and thus
C−μ ≤ log½mþ 1�. Meanwhile, the predictive and retrodic-
tive topological state complexities satisfy Dþμ ¼ log½nþ 1�
and D−μ ≤ log½mþ 1�. Note that n and m can be adjusted
independently. Setting m ¼ 2, and allowing n → ∞, yields
diverging Cþμ but finite C−μ . Thus, ΔCμ also diverges to
infinity. A similar divergence is witnessed for topological
state complexity.
Applying Result 2, we see that Cþq and C−q are both

bounded above by log 3. The same is also true for Dþq and
D−q . Thus, quantum models of this process can fit within a
single qutrit, whether modeling in forward or reverse time.
In the specific case of the former, Cþμ and Dþμ diverge to
infinity. Thus, we obtain a family of processes whose
quantum models field an unbounded memory advantage—
in both the entropic and single-shot sense.

APPENDIX E: EXCLUDING
MIXED-STATE MODELS

In this appendix, we consider more general causal
modelsQ ¼ ðf;Ω;MÞ, which have the freedom to encode
pasts

fðx⃖Þ ¼ ωx⃖ ¼
X
k

qkðx⃖Þjψ x⃖kihψ x⃖kj ðE1Þ

into mixed quantum states. We show that this does not
allow for models that are more optimal than those that only
encode pasts into pure quantum states.
Theorem 3. Consider a stochastic process PðX⃖; X⃗Þ,

with a causal model Q ¼ ðf;Ω;MÞ. If the internal states
of Q are mixed, such that fðx⃖Þ ¼ Piqiðx⃖Þjψ x⃖i ihψ x⃖i j, then
we can always find a causal model Q0 ¼ ðf0;Ω0;M0Þ such
that f0ðx⃖Þ ¼ jsx⃖ihsx⃖j and CqðQ0Þ ≤ CqðQÞ.
Proof.—Let PðX⃖; X⃗Þ have causal states S ¼ fsig.

Suppose Q ¼ ðf;Ω;MÞ is an optimal causal model for
PðX⃖; X⃗Þ, with mixed internal states.
It is trivial to generalize the causal-state correspondence

to mixed-state models. Thus, we can assume that Q has an
encoding function, where

fðx⃖Þ ¼ ωi ¼
X
k

qkðsiÞjψ ðiÞk ihψ ðiÞk j ðE2Þ

if and only if x⃖ ∈ si. Therefore, the internal states Ω ¼
fωig are in one-to-one correspondence with the classical
causal states.
Our proof makes use of the requirement that causal

models store no oracular information, i.e., IðR; X⃗jX⃖Þ ¼P
x⃖Pðx⃖ÞIðR; X⃗jX⃖ ¼ x⃖Þ ¼ 0, whereR is the random variable

FIG. 5. The n-m flower process, illustrated for the case m ¼ 2,
and n even. Physically, this process can be generated by a set
fd1;…; dng ofm-sided dice, where each die di is biased so that it
lands on side j ∈ f1;…; mg with probability pij (and, in general,
the bias on each die is different, such that pij ≠ pkj for i ≠ k). We
randomly select a die di, recording the choice xt ¼ i. Afterwards,
we role the die, transcribing the outcome j as xtþ1 ¼ jþ n.

governing the memory. Regrouping the pasts into causal-
state equivalence classes yields

P
si∈SπiIðR; X⃗jx⃖ ∈ siÞ ¼ 0,

where πi is the probability that the past belongs to si. Thus,
IðR; X⃗jx⃖ ∈ siÞ ¼ 0 for every si ∈ S.
We have assumed some elements of Ω are mixed. In

particular, suppose we have a specific ωi0 ¼ ω ∈ Ω with
SðωÞ > 0, which occurs with probability πi0 ¼ π. Let x⃖ be a
particular past such that fðx⃖Þ ¼ ω, and let Ψ ¼ fjψkig be a
set of pure states that form an unraveling of ω. There must
exist some qk ∈ ½0; 1� such that ω ¼

P
kqkjψkihψkj. Now,

let OM be a quantum process that maps ω to a classical
random variable X⃗ governed by probability distribution
PðX⃗jX⃖ ¼ x⃖Þ. By definition of a quantum model, this
process can always be constructed by concatenations of
M acting on a physical system Ξ.
Let A represent the state of Ξ, and let B be the random

variable that governs the resulting output of OM acting on
Ξ. Zero oracular information implies that A and B must be
uncorrelated when conditioned on observing past x⃖.
Therefore, OMðjψkihψkjÞ¼OMðjψ jihψ jjÞ¼OMðωÞ for
all jψki, jψ ji ∈ Ψ.
Now, consider the entropy of Q. By concavity of

entropy,

Without loss of generality, we can assume that this
minimum is obtained for k ¼ 0. Let Ω00 ¼ ðΩnωÞ ∪
fjψ0ihψ0jg be a set of internal states, where ω is replaced
with jψ0ihψ0j, and define the encoding function f00 such
that f00ðx⃖Þ ¼ fðx⃖Þ, except when fðx⃖Þ ¼ ω, whereby
f00ðx⃖Þ ¼ jψ0ihψ0j. Define a new quantum model
Q00 ¼ ðf00;Ω00;MÞ. Clearly, CqðQ00Þ ≤ CqðQÞ.
If any of the states in Ω00 are still mixed, then by

repeating the above procedure, we can replace them with
pure states, thereby constructing a modelQ0 ¼ ðf0;Ω0;MÞ
with pure internal states such that CqðQ0Þ ≤ CqðQÞ. □

oracular information, as it captures the amount of informa-
tion a state of the memory s stores about the future that is not
contained in the past [8,9]. Note that this notion of causal
model differs from the recent developments in quantum
causal models [10,11] and from foundation work on causal
inference [12].

memory cost of tracking either is likely to be unbounded.
Thus, one may need to modify present approaches. Existing
approaches include the use of differential entropies [43]
and studying scaling as we track the process to greater
precision [32].
