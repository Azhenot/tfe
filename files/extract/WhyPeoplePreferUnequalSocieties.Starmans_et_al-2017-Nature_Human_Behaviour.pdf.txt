PERSPECTIVE
PUBLISHED: 7 APRIL 2017 | VOLUME: 1 | ARTICLE NUMBER: 0082

We live in an age of inequality—or at least in an age of wor-rying about inequality. Pope Francis remarked that “ine-quality is the root of social evil”, while President Obama 
called economic inequality “the defining challenge of our time”. A 
recent Pew report found that Europeans and Americans judged 
inequality as posing the greatest threat to the world, beating reli-
gious and ethnic hatred, pollution, nuclear weapons, and diseases 
like AIDS. A majority of respondents in each of the 44 countries 
polled said the gap between rich and poor is a big or very big prob-
lem facing their country1. And a new report by Oxfam2 revealed that 
the wealth owned by the eight richest people in the world is equiva-
lent to the wealth owned by the poorest 50% of the world, sparking 
widespread outrage.

Academics—from philosophers, economists, and political sci-
entists to psychologists, archaeologists, and even physicists—are 
also fascinated by the causes, consequences, and extent of eco-
nomic inequality. This interest is reflected in the extent of attention 
to Thomas Piketty’s book, Capital in the Twenty-First Century3,4, 
and is grounded in a growing public and scholarly appreciation of 
the startling extent of economic inequality. Globally, the top 1% of 
the population owns 50% of the wealth, and the bottom 70% owns 
only 3% of the wealth5.

Many are particularly concerned about the level of inequality 
in the United States, which has been growing rapidly since the 
1970s6 (see Fig. 1). The Gini coefficient (a measure of inequality 
whereby 0 is perfect equality and 100 is perfect inequality, or one 
person owning all the wealth) in the United States is now 85—the 
highest of all western nations, and sixth highest worldwide among 
countries with populations over 1  million (refs  6,7). A typical 
American CEO currently makes about 354 times as much as a typi-
cal worker, while just 50 years ago the ratio was 20/18. Although 
the United States has been getting richer overall, the vast majority 
of this increase in wealth (over 95%) has gone to the top 1% of 
wealthiest Americans6.

The concern that people express about inequality is also found 
in controlled laboratory studies, which find that a desire for equal 
distributions of goods emerges early in human development and 
is apparent in many different cultures9. As such, Frans de Waal 
nicely summarizes a broad consensus across many fields when he 
writes: “Robin Hood had it right. Humanity’s deepest wish is to 
spread the wealth.”10

Why people prefer unequal societies
Christina Starmans*, Mark Sheskin and Paul Bloom

There is immense concern about economic inequality, both among the scholarly community and in the general public, and 
many insist that equality is an important social goal. However, when people are asked about the ideal distribution of wealth in 
their country, they actually prefer unequal societies. We suggest that these two phenomena can be reconciled by noticing that, 
despite appearances to the contrary, there is no evidence that people are bothered by economic inequality itself. Rather, they 
are bothered by something that is often confounded with inequality: economic unfairness. Drawing upon laboratory studies, 
cross-cultural research, and experiments with babies and young children, we argue that humans naturally favour fair distribu-
tions, not equal ones, and that when fairness and equality clash, people prefer fair inequality over unfair equality. Both psy-
chological research and decisions by policymakers would benefit from more clearly distinguishing inequality from unfairness. 

A puzzle arises, however, when we consider a largely separate 
body of research in political psychology and behavioural econom-
ics: it turns out that when people are asked about the ideal distri-
bution of wealth in their country, they actually prefer unequal 
societies11. This preference for inequality materializes in a wide 
range of countries12,13, across people on opposite sides of the politi-
cal spectrum11, and even in adolescents14. So, when people are asked 
to distribute resources among a small number of people in a lab 
study, they insist on an exactly equal distribution. But when people 
are asked to distribute resources among a large group of people in 
the actual world, they reject an equal distribution, and prefer a cer-
tain extent of inequality. How can the strong preference for equality 
found in public policy discussion and laboratory studies coincide 
with the preference for societal inequality found in political and 
behavioural economic research?

We argue here that these two sets of findings can be reconciled 
through a surprising empirical claim: when the data are examined 
closely, it turns out that there is no evidence that people are actually 
concerned with economic inequality at all. Rather, they are both-
ered by something that is often confounded with inequality: eco-
nomic unfairness.

We should stress that our argument is not that scholars and 
researchers fail to notice the distinction between inequality and

unfairness. On the contrary, the scientists we cite below are 
often careful to distinguish equality and fairness in their studies. 
However, researchers, public figures, and the media often claim 
that people are specifically concerned about inequality of outcome. 
Much political discourse frames the problem in terms of growing 
economic inequality, with no reference to fairness concerns. And, 
as we discuss immediately below, many experimental studies claim 
to have discovered ‘inequality aversion’ or ‘egalitarian motives’. 
We leave open the question of whether these researchers intend 
to claim that there is evidence for a specific aversion to inequal-
ity, above and beyond an aversion to fairness, or whether this is 
just ‘loose talk’. However, to our knowledge, none of these research-
ers have made the specific claim we wish to make here: that there 
is no empirical evidence so far that people have any aversion to 
inequality itself.

We suggest that the perception that there is a preference for 
equality arises through an undue focus on special circumstances, 
often studied in the laboratory, where inequality and unfairness 
coincide. In most situations, however, including those involving 
real-world distributions of wealth, people’s concerns about fairness 
lead them to favour unequal distributions.

An equality bias in the lab
Anyone looking for evidence that people have a natural aversion to 
inequality will find numerous laboratory studies that seemingly con-
firm their view. For example, studies have found “a universal desire 
for more equal pay”12, “egalitarian motives in humans”15, “egalitari-
anism in young children”16, and that “equality trumps reciprocity”17. 
A Google Scholar search for “inequality aversion” yields over 10,000 
papers that bear on this topic.

And, indeed, when subjects in laboratory studies are asked to 
divide resources among unrelated individuals, they tend to divide 
them equally18,19. If a previous situation has led to a pre-existing 
inequality, people will divide future resources unequally in order 
to correct or minimize the inequality between others15,17. This bias 
is so powerful that subjects sometimes prefer equal outcomes in 
which everyone gets less overall to unequal outcomes where eve-
ryone gets more overall15,20,21. The desire for equality, even at the 
expense of better average consequences, appears in non-monetary 
domains as well. For example, people object to medical interven-
tions that would save more lives overall by reducing cure rates for 
a small group of people and increasing cure rates for a larger group 
of people22.

Furthermore, people appear to view the equal distribution of 
resources as a moral good; they express anger toward those who 
benefit from unequal distributions15. This outrage is sufficiently 
strong that subjects will pay to punish unequal distributors23. One 
study examining this across 15 diverse cultures found that mem-
bers of all populations demonstrated some willingness to adminis-
ter costly third-party punishment for unequal division of resources 
(costing themselves the equivalent of a half-day’s wages in some 
cases)—although the magnitude of this punishment varied sub-
stantially across populations24,25. Moreover, people expect others to 
engage in this kind of costly third-party punishment for those that 
make unequal offers23.

Studies of children between the ages of three and eight years find 
a similar equality bias26,16. Three-year-olds divide resources equally 
among third parties27,28, and, although they are typically selfish 
when they themselves are involved in the interaction, even three-
year-olds report that they should share equally29.

Six-year-olds show an even stronger commitment to equal dis-
tribution, insisting on throwing out extra resources rather than 
allowing them to be unequally distributed between two absent third 
parties28,30. In one study, six- to eight-year-olds were tasked with 
distributing erasers to two boys who had cleaned up their room. 
When there was an odd number of erasers, children insisted that 

the experimenter should throw the extra eraser in the trash rather 
than establish an unequal division28,31. They responded this way 
even if the recipients would never know that one of them received 
less, suggesting that children weren’t worried about the recipients’ 
feelings, but were opposed to creating the inequality even if none of 
the recipients knew about it28. Even more tellingly, children are just 
as likely to reject unequal distributions when they reflect generos-
ity (the distributor gave up all her candies to the receiver) as when 
they reflect selfishness (the distributor kept all the candies for her-
self). This suggests that the rejections are specifically an aversion to 
inequality, rather than punishing selfishness30.

This bias shows up not only in children’s behaviour, but also in 
their evaluations of others. In one study, six- to eight-year-old chil-
dren were asked who they liked better: someone who split four eras-
ers equally between the participant and another child, or someone 
who gave all four erasers to the participant. Children reported liking 
the equal distributor more than someone who gave them more than 
the other child32.

Some suggestive evidence for a similar bias shows up in babies 
and toddlers. When twelve-month-old infants saw a puppet distrib-
ute two items to two other puppets, they looked at the scene longer 
when the distributor gave both toys to one puppet than when she 
gave the puppets one toy each, suggesting that they were surprised 
by the unequal distribution33–35. Infants not only expect people to 
equally distribute resources, they also actively prefer those who 
do. After watching two puppets distribute equally or unequally, 
16-month-olds preferred to approach the equal distributor34.

An inequality bias in the real world
Given these findings, one might expect that when people are asked 
to distribute resources across a real-world group of people, they 
would choose an equal distribution of resources across all segments 
of society. But they do not.

A recent study by Norton and Ariely11 received well-deserved 
media attention, as it showed that people both underestimate the 
amount of inequality in our society and prefer a more egalitar-
ian society to the one they think they live in. The authors describe 
their studies as examining “disagreements about the optimal level 
of wealth inequality”, and report the finding of “a surprising level 
of consensus: all demographic groups—even those not usually 
associated with wealth redistribution such as Republicans and the 
wealthy—desired a more equal distribution of wealth than the status 
quo”. And an article by Ariely in Atlantic was titled, “Americans want 
to live in a much more equal country (they just don’t realize it)”36.

These summaries are accurate: participants in these studies did 
prefer more equality than the current situation. But the results also 
suggest that they were not particularly worried about large inequali-
ties. Instead, these subjects claimed that, in the perfect society, indi-
viduals in the top 20% should have more than three times as much 
money as individuals in the bottom 20% (see Fig. 2). And when they 
were given a forced choice between equal and unequal distributions 
of wealth, and told to assume that they would be randomly assigned 
to be anyone from the richest to the poorest person (that is, a ‘veil of 
ignorance’37), over half of the subjects explicitly rejected the option 
of an equal distribution of wealth, preferring inequality11. Thus, 
the data suggest that when it comes to real-world distributions of 
wealth, people have a preference for a certain amount of inequality.

This preference for inequality materializes in 16 other coun-
tries12,13, across people on both the left and right of the political 
spectrum11, and in teenagers14. As Norton38 puts it, “people exhibit a 
desire for unequality—not too equal, but not too unequal”.

Indeed, these data might underestimate people’s preferences for 
unequal distributions. One follow-up study39 contrasted Norton 
and Ariely’s question about the percentage of wealth that should 
correspond to each quintile of the American population with a 
question about what the average wealth should be in each quintile.

PERSPECTIVENATURE HUMAN BEHAVIOUR

The former question resulted in an ideal ratio of poorest to wealthi-
est of about 1/4, but for the latter question the ratio jumped to 1/50. 
When the connection between the two questions was explained to 
participants, a majority chose the higher inequality ratio as reflect-
ing their actual beliefs for both measures.

Fairness in the lab
How can this preference for inequality in the real world be rec-
onciled with the strong preference for equality found in labora-
tory studies? We suggest that this discrepancy arises because the 
laboratory findings reviewed above—which report the discovery of 
egalitarian motives, a desire for more equality, or inequality aver-
sion—do not in fact provide evidence that an aversion to inequality 
is driving the preference for equal distribution. Instead, these find-
ings are all consistent with both a preference for equality and with a 
preference for fairness, because the studies are designed so that the 
equal outcome is also the fair one. This is because the recipients are 
indistinguishable with regard to considerations such as need and 
merit. Hence, whether subjects are sensitive to fairness or to equal-
ity, they will be inclined to distribute the goods equally.

This idea is supported by numerous studies, including follow-
ups of the experiments described above, by the same researchers, in 
which fairness is carefully distinguished from equality. These stud-
ies find that people choose fairness over equality. For example, in 
the study in which children had to award erasers to two boys who 
had cleaned up their room and chose to throw out the extra eraser, 
both boys were described as having done a good job. But when 
children were told that one boy did more work than the other, they 
awarded the extra eraser to the hard worker28,40. In fact, when one 
recipient has done more work, six-year-olds believe that he or she 
should receive more resources, even if equal pay is an option26,41–43. 
Likewise, although infants prefer equality in a neutral circumstance, 
they expect an experimenter to distribute rewards preferentially to 
individuals who have done more work35.

This preference for inequality is not restricted to situations where 
one person has done more work, but also extends to rewarding peo-
ple who previously acted helpfully or unhelpfully. When three-year-
olds witnessed a puppet help another puppet climb a slide or reach 
a toy, they later allocated more resources to the helpful puppet than 
to a puppet that pushed another down the slide, or hit him on the 
head with the toy44.

As a final twist, consider a situation with two individuals, identi-
cal in all relevant regards, where one gets 10 dollars and the other 
gets nothing. This is plainly unequal, but is it fair? It can be, if the 
allocation was random. Adults consider it fair to use impartial pro-
cedures such as coin flips and lotteries when distributing many 
different kinds of resources45. Children have similar views. In the 

erasers-for-room-cleaning studies described above, if children are 
given a fair ‘spinner’ to randomly choose who gets the extra eraser, 
they are happy to create inequality46. One person getting two eras-
ers and another getting one (or ten and zero for that matter) can be 
entirely fair and acceptable, although it is clearly not equal.

Fairness in the real world
It follows, then, that if one believes that (a) people in the real world 
exhibit variation in effort, ability, moral deservingness, and so on, 
and (b) a fair system takes these considerations into account, then 
a preference for fairness will dictate that one should prefer unequal 
outcomes in actual societies. The ideal distributions of wealth pro-
posed by participants in the Norton and Ariely study, then, may 
reflect how fairness preferences interact with intuitions about the 
extent to which such traits vary in the population.

Tyler47 uses a related argument to explain why there is not a 
stronger degree of public outrage in the face of economic inequality. 
He argues that Americans regard the American market system to 
be a fair procedure for wealth allocation, and, accordingly, believe 
strongly in the possibility of social mobility (see Box  1). On this 
view, then, people’s discontent about the current social situation will 
be better predicted by their beliefs about the unfairness of wealth 
allocation than by their beliefs about inequality.

We have argued that a preference for fair outcomes is early 
emerging and universal. But it is also clear that people differ in their 
intuitions as to which resources should be distributed on the basis of 
merit. Most Americans now believe that a fair system is one in which 
every adult gets a vote, but this is a relatively modern intuition. In 
our own time, there is controversy over whether fairness dictates that 
everyone should have equal access to health care and higher educa-
tion. Put differently, there is some disagreement over what should be 
a right, held equally and unchanged by any sort of variation in merit.

There are also political and cultural differences. Norton and 
Ariely11 found that women, Democrats, and the poor desired rela-
tively more equal distributions than men, Republicans, and the 
wealthy, and were also more accurate in estimating the extent of 
current inequality. Or consider that a recent survey of wealthy tech-
nology entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley found that all predicted that 
a strict meritocracy, where everyone’s income was strictly propor-
tional to their productivity, would result in an extremely unequal 
society, with the top 10% earning more than 50% of the nation’s 
wealth48. This intuition is probably considerably more extreme than 
one would find in a more typical sample. Looking outside of the 
United States and Europe, it is clear that there are wide differences 
in fairness concerns across world cultures25,49–52.

Finally, there are developmental differences. While even the 
youngest infants tested show some sensitivity to fairness over

PERSPECTIVE NATURE HUMAN BEHAVIOUR

equality35, young children may place a greater emphasis on an 
equality ‘heuristic’ than do older children53–55. Indeed, the relative 
weighting of various factors that can justify inequality—such as 
luck, effort, and skill—develops even through adolescence56.

Why fairness is central
We are hardly the first to posit a universal moral concern with 
fairness. For instance, fairness is claimed to be one of the univer-
sal foundations of morality by scholars working in moral founda-
tion theory52,57, and has been argued by many developmental and 
comparative psychologists to be a universal and unlearned human 
capacity10,58. The universality of this concern raises the question of 
its evolutionary history.

Under one analysis, a desire for fairness—such as fair distribu-
tion of food to the members of a group—can be seen as a prosocial 
motivation, evolved to constrain our natural selfishness. A propen-
sity to favour fair distributions is sometimes seen as arising because 
it benefits the group, a proposal developed in the context of cultural 
group selection59 and, more controversially, genetic group selec-
tion60,61; see refs 62,63 for critical discussions. But a sensitivity to fair-
ness might also benefit individuals, consistent with a more standard 
evolutionary approach. For example, fairness may serve as a signal 
of impartiality, avoiding the problems of signalling favouritism to 
one coalition over another64,65.

But these analyses don’t provide an explanation for why a pro-
pensity toward and sensitivity to fairness would emerge, as opposed 
to a presumably simpler equality bias. One proposal is that fairness 
intuitions are rooted in adaptations for differentially responding to 
the prosocial and antisocial actions of others. For cooperation and 

prosociality to evolve, there has to be some solution to the problem 
of free-riders, cheaters, and bad actors. The usual explanation for 
this is that we have evolved a propensity to make bad behaviour 
costly and good behaviour beneficial, through punishment and 
reward66,67. That is, we respond differently to individuals based on 
what one can see as their ‘deservingness’—responses that are pre-
sent even in infants68. It’s possible that fairness intuitions more gen-
erally develop from this moral foundation.

A related proposal focuses on shunning selfish individuals, rather 
than punishing them. When individuals can choose the people 
with whom they interact for mutually beneficial tasks, cooperative 
individuals gain benefits from being included and selfish individu-
als lose out on those benefits by being shunned69,70. But individuals 
who are too cooperative—too generous—run the risk of being taken 
advantage of by others71. So a balance must be struck. To treat every-
one equally would entail penalization of more productive individu-
als when they collaborate with less productive individuals relative 
to highly productive individuals. In contrast with equality, fairness 
allows individuals with different levels of productivity to share the 
benefits of their collaboration proportionately72. This focus on fair-
ness is particularly important for humans (compared with even our 
closest evolutionary relatives), due to the critical importance of col-
laboration in human hunting and foraging73.

Conclusions and future directions
Here we have explored the notion that, contrary to appearances, 
people are not troubled by inequality for its own sake; indeed, they 
often prefer unequal distributions, both in laboratory conditions 
and in the real world. What really troubles people about the world 

In addition to concerns about the unfairness of an equal distribu-
tion, people might have other motivations for preferring an une-
qual distribution of wealth in their society. Here we consider two 
such motivations more closely: a selfish desire to have more than 
others, and a belief that inequality is necessary to allow for mobility.

Selfishness
One consideration underlying an inequality preference has lit-
tle to do with an abstract desire for fairness, but instead reflects 
a desire to have more than others. Obviously people have selfish 
motivations, but what is interesting here is that these desires are 
not always for increasing one’s absolute amount, but are often for 
increasing one’s standing relative to others78–80. For example, stud-
ies of income and happiness have revealed that, once a basic level 
of wealth is achieved, relative wealth is more important for overall 
happiness81–83. Similarly, a vast body of research in social psychol-
ogy finds that people engage in constant comparison of themselves 
with others84,85. Knowing that one’s income is much higher (or 
lower) than that of a neighbour has a substantial impact on hap-
piness80. As Gore Vidal put it, “every time a friend succeeds I die 
a little”.

This motivation for relative advantage can motivate a desire for 
unequal distributions. Indeed, to achieve the warm glow associ-
ated with relative advantage, people are even willing to pay a cost 
themselves to reduce others’ incomes86. Even young children show 
this relative advantage-seeking behaviour. Five-year-olds often 
reject equal payouts of two prize tokens for themselves and two 
prize tokens for another child, and choose instead only one token 
for themselves, if that means that the other child will get none87. 
That is, the inequality associated with relative advantage is so 
appealing that it overrides both a desire for fairness and a desire 
for absolute gain.

Motivation and mobility
A further motivation for inequality may come from the idea that 
inequality is necessary to motivate industriousness and allow for 
social mobility. For example, Norton38 argues that people prefer 
inequality because they see it as a motivating force that leads peo-
ple to work harder and better, knowing that doing so can improve 
their station in life, and that of their children.

This belief entails a sort of meritocratic mobility, and, indeed, 
such mobility is a necessary condition for an unequal society to 
be a fair one. After all, a society lacking mobility is a society in 
which those born into poverty remain in poverty, regardless of 
their hard work and ingenuity. Hence, unless people view merit 
as being entirely heritable, fairness requires mobility. Not surpris-
ingly, then, a belief in meritocratic mobility is associated with more 
tolerance for inequality, as reflected in less discomfort with existing 
wealth inequality, less support for the redistribution of educational 
resources, and less willingness to support raising taxes on the rich88.

From this perspective, cultural differences in expectations 
about mobility may account for differences in tolerance of ine-
quality across cultures. For example, Americans might have an 
unreasonable tolerance for inequality in part because they tend to 
overestimate the extent of mobility in the United States77, which is 
in fact lower than in places like Canada and most of Europe89–92. 
One reason for this lack of mobility is that the income distribution 
in the United States—the distance between the poorest and richest 
citizens—is much greater than in rival countries. Moving from the 
tenth percentile to the ninetieth percentile in Denmark requires a 
US$45,000 increase in income, but making the same jump in the 
United States would require an increase of US$93,000 (ref. 93). And 
the situation is not improving—while 92% of American children 
born in 1940 would go on to earn more than their parents, only 
50% of children born in 1980 have done so94.

PERSPECTIVENATURE HUMAN BEHAVIOUR

we live in today are considerations that are related to inequality (see 
Box 2), such as adverse social consequences, a corrosion of demo-
cratic ideals, poverty, and, of most interest to us here, unfairness.

Indeed, we believe that there is no evidence so far that children 
or adults possess any general aversion to inequality. A related case 
against a focus on equality has been made recently by Frankfurt74, 
who argues on normative grounds that people shouldn’t care about 
reducing inequality. What really matters, he argues, is that every-
one has a sufficient amount to live a decent life. Frankfurt acknowl-
edges that a focus on improving the situation of the most needy may 
reduce inequality as a side effect, but argues that this reduction is 
not, in itself, a moral good.

Our own argument against a focus on inequality is a psychologi-
cal one. In this paper we have outlined a wealth of empirical evi-
dence suggesting that people don’t care about reducing inequality 
per se. Rather, people have an aversion toward unfairness, and under 
certain special circumstances this leads them to reject unequal dis-
tributions. In other conditions, including those involving real-world 
distributions of wealth, it leads them to favour unequal distribu-
tions. In the current economic environment in the United States and 
other wealthy nations, concerns about fairness happen to lead to 
a preference for reducing the current level of inequality. However, 
in various other societies across the world and across history (for 
example, when faced with the communist ideals of the former 
USSR), concerns about fairness lead to anger about too much equal-
ity. To understand these opposite drives, one needs to focus not on 
whether the system results in a relatively equal or unequal distribu-
tion of wealth, but whether it is viewed as fair.

Of course, it may be that there really is a preference for equal 
outcomes that exists above and beyond a preference for fair out-
comes. But to explore this, researchers need to construct studies that 
carefully distinguish equality from other related considerations. For 
example, perhaps if a procedure results in too large an inequality, 
people would be motivated to reduce that inequality, even if they 
believe the procedure to be fair and the inequality to have no other 
consequences. This is an empirical question.

Furthermore, the idea that people’s discontent with the current 
distribution of wealth has to do with fairness, rather than inequal-
ity itself, opens up a wealth of new questions about which factors 
(for example, hard work, skill, need, morality) are psychologically 
relevant for fair distributions. In particular, the developmental tra-
jectory of concerns for these different factors is largely unexplored, 
including questions relating to how children determine which fac-
tors are relevant to resource distribution (for example, effort, need, 

and so on) and which are not (for example, height). Emphasizing 
the role of fairness intuitions in population-level distribution prefer-
ences also raises some interesting and under-explored psychological 
questions relating to how people perceive the existing distribution 
of factors such as merit, skill, and deservingness in their societies.

What about practical implications? As with most psychological 
claims of this sort, our proposal has, at best, indirect implications 
for public policy. Even if the average individual desires a somewhat 
unequal society, one might argue that people are mistaken in what 
they want. Perhaps people would actually be better off in a perfectly 
equal society—they just don’t know it. Also, even if it is assumed that 
people are correct in their desires for a society with some economic 
diversity (but not as much as we currently have), this doesn’t tell us 
how to achieve such a society. It’s perfectly coherent to be in favour 
of reduced inequality, but against certain plans for redistribution75.

We do see two implications of this work, however.
First, it’s clear that many people are misinformed about how 

well their society matches their ideals. They are wrong about how 
much inequality there is, believing the current situation to be much 
more equal than it actually is11–12,39, but see ref.  76. Furthermore, 
Americans have exaggerated views about the extent of social mobil-
ity in the United States77, and thus the extent to which the current 
American market system is a fair procedure for wealth allocation. 
We have argued that views about fairness will be most predictive of 
discontent with economic inequality, and thus public education on 
the actual current rate of mobility will help to ensure that people’s

While concerns about fairness, along with other considera-
tions, may motivate a preference for inequality, there are, of 
course, various countervailing psychological forces that lead to 
an equality preference. One of these forces is a worry about the 
consequences of an unequal society. That is, even if people have 
no problem with inequality itself, it might have negative conse-
quences that people are motivated to avoid.

For one thing, as inequality increases, self-reported happiness 
diminishes, especially among the bottom 40% of income earn-
ers95. One reason for this is that relative disadvantage has a larger 
negative impact on well-being than relative advantage has a posi-
tive impact96. When people know where they stand in the overall 
income distribution, those on the lower end of the scale report 
less job satisfaction, but those on the higher end of the scale do 
not report any greater satisfaction97. This has negative effects for 
productivity too: workers who know they are on the low side of 
the distribution decrease their effort, but knowing that one is on 
the high end does not lead to an increase in effort98.

Still, as Tyler47 points out, it is not clear whether the corrosive 
effects of inequality on happiness are due to inequality per se, or 
due to the perception of unfair inequality. That is, it is an open 
question whether people who get less than others would suffer 
decreases in happiness and productivity if they believed that 
they were in a fair system, one in which increased efforts on their 
part could lead to social mobility.

Nevertheless, inequality in a society also predicts a greater 
degree of violence, obesity, teenage pregnancy, and interpersonal 
distrust99. Areas of the United States with high income inequal-
ity also tend to have higher divorce and bankruptcy rates than 
areas with more egalitarian income distributions100 and they suf-
fer from higher homicide rates101. Similar negative effects show 
up in laboratory studies with simulated public goods games in 
which the extent of inequality is set by the researchers—when 
the inequities are made salient, there is less cooperation and 
inter-connectedness102.

PERSPECTIVE NATURE HUMAN BEHAVIOUR
moral assessment of the world that they live in is grounded in the 
relevant facts.

Second, as Frankfurt74 points out, contemporary political dis-
course often blurs together various concerns that should be thought 
of as distinct. Worries about inequality are conflated with worries 
about poverty, an erosion of basic rights, and—as we have focused 
on here—unfairness. If it’s true that inequality in itself isn’t really 
what is bothering people, then we might be better off by more 
carefully pulling apart these concerns, and shifting the focus to 
the problems that matter to us more. The recognition that fairness 
and equality are different cannot merely be a footnote on empirical 
studies and cannot be a rarely invoked piece of trivia in political 
conversations that wrestle with unfairness but frame the conversa-
tion in terms of equality. Progress in the lab and in the real world 
will be facilitated by centring the discussion on exactly what peo-
ple do care about—fairness—and not on what people do not care 
about—equality.
