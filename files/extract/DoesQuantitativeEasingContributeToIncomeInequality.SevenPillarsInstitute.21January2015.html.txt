						Does Quantitative Easing Contribute to Income Inequality?

						August 26th, 2013 by Kara in Case Studies, Economics
					
					 

Background to Quantitative Easing

As Quantitative Easing (QE) lacks an extensive history, the monetary 
technique, despite recent use by numerous central banks, is fraught with
 controversy[1]. QE occurs when a central 
bank increases the money supply, often by buying government bonds 
through open market operations from companies and institutions.[2] The goal is to increase liquidity, borrowing, investments, and economic activity.[3]
 However, QE is associated with some negative side effects, making it a 
last resort strategy used after traditional methods – such as when 
official interest rates are near zero – have been exhausted. One of the 
apparent downsides is QE increases income inequality. Is this claim 
legitimate?

Income Inequality

Income Inequality (II) is defined as the unequal distribution of income within a population.[4]
 There are multiple common methods of measuring income inequality, 
including the GINI index, the generalized entropy index, and the decile 
ratio.[5] Various factors can affect the 
degree of income inequality, such as monopolistic control by leading 
families, cultural structures, legal constructs, favorable tax treatment
 for the rich, regulatory favoritism, decreasing labor union strength, 
or technological change.[6] Based on 
historical data, countries not in the Organization for Economic 
Cooperation and Development (OECD), such as China, have a larger income 
disparity than those in the OECD. Past research also indicates that 
among OECD countries, the USA and Latin America have higher levels of 
income inequality. Overall, the recent trend has been increasing income 
inequality.[7]

Using Government Yields to Measure Quantitative Easing

Government yields refer to the interest, or the amount of money made at maturity, on government bonds.[8]
 Specifically, we use US Treasury Bill yields. Due to the United States 
federal government’s credibility and low default rate, yields on 
Treasury Bills have low systematic and unsystematic risk. As a result, 
they are a better measure of QE’s impact than stocks or bonds.

QE has an inverse relationship with government yields. The more 
easing, the lower the yields because QE increases money supply, 
decreases the supply of Treasuries through purchases by the central 
bank, which in turn, decreases yields.[9]

It should be noted, as QE affects many aspects of the economy, other 
measures – such as the inflation rate – can potentially be used. 
However, we use Treasury yields because they have a more direct 
connection to QE than other measurements.

The Association Between the PE Ratio, Shiller PE Ratio, and Income Inequality

The typical Price to Earnings (PE) Ratio compares price per share to 
earnings per share. The Shiller PE Ratio, an adaptation of the typical 
PE ratio, divides the current price per share by the average 
inflation-adjusted earnings from the past 10 years.[10]
 The share price in PE Ratios is often an indication of corporate 
profits, as the ratio will be higher if earnings expectations remain 
positive.[11]

A higher ratio is directly associated with higher income inequality. 
Higher share prices often increase income inequality as the gains mainly
 go to the wealthy, who own stocks at higher rates than the poor.[12] In fact, the wealthiest 10% own 91.4% of stocks and mutual funds.

Methodology

First, we examine the correlation between quantitative easing and 
income inequality in the USA. Second, we examine the United States’ 
historical GINI index data. Third, we compare, contrast, and analyze the
 observations from the QE/II correlation and GINI index.

Establishing a Mathematical Correlation between Quantitative Easing and Income Inequality Within the USA:

To determine this result, we utilize the beginning of the year data 
for the yields of the three-month Treasury bill rates as provided by the
 Federal Reserve of St. Louis[13], and Shiller PE Ratio as provided by Robert Shiller in his book Irrational Exuberance.[14]
 Yields and PE ratios are useful measures of easing and income 
inequality, respectively. We examine data from two time periods: 
1990-2008 and 2009-2013. The results are sometimes labeled as QE/II 
correlations.

1) 1990-2008:



The first time period, from 1990-2008, is significant. During that 
time the United States did not use QE. In this period, the yield 
decreased from 7.64% to 2.75% and the PE Ratio increased from 17.05 to 
24.21. The correlation between these two variables is -0.03658. This 
inverse relationship indicates that income inequality increased during 
this period. However, based on Dancey and Reidy’s 2004 categorizations, 
this is essentially a nonexistent correlation, as it is less than -0.1.[15]

A) 1990-1999:



It is worth examining two subsections of this first time period: 
1990-1999 and 2000-2008. Between 1990-1999, the PE ratio increased while
 the yield fell. The inverse -0.23704 correlation suggests income 
inequality increased. However, the QE/II correlation remains weak during
 this period.

B) 2000-2008:



 

The 2000-2008 period witnessed a positive correlation of 0.617692 
where both the PE Ratio and Treasury yields fell. Unlike the 1990 to 
1999 time frame, this correlation is generally considered to be 
relatively strong, indicating that income inequality decreased in the 
absence of QE. We investigate the reasons for the difference between 
these two subsections in a later section.

2) 2009-2013:



Next, we examine the 2009 to 2013 period, during which time the 
United States enacted quantitative easing policies. Quite unlike the 
2000-2008 period, there is a weak inverse correlation at -0.22582. We 
examine why this increase in income inequality may have occurred due to 
quantitative easing and determine why this is a stronger inverse 
correlation than the simple correlation between PE Ratios and 
quantitative easing suggests.

Facts About the USA’s GINI Index:

We can measure the actual income inequality that occurred within the 
USA at different time periods using the GINI index. The GINI Index 
measures income inequality through the Lorenz Curve, which shows the 
cumulative income earned within the population starting from the lowest 
earners to the highest. A GINI coefficient of 0 represents no 
inequality, while 1 means one person has all the income.[16]
 Thus, the higher the GINI coefficient, the greater the inequality. At 
the time of writing, the United States GINI coefficient is available up 
to 2011. We therefore compare the coefficient from the  1990-2008 
period to the coefficient from the 2009-2011 period.[17]

1) 1990-2008:

Between 1990 and 2008, the coefficient increased from 0.428 to 0.466,
 for a total increase of 0.038, or approximately 9%. When we divide this
 by the total number of years, we witness an average increase of 0.002 
per year, suggesting that there was an increase in income inequality 
during this period.

Although the trend from 1990-2008 overall shows worsening income 
inequality, there were multiple years where we witnessed a decline in 
income inequality: 1994-1995, 1997-1998, 2001-2002, and 2006-2007.

A) Before 2000 vs. After 2000:

A closer examination of the 1990-2008 period shows the increase 
occurred primarily before 2000. 1990-2000 accounts for 0.034 of the 
total increase of 0.038. Thus, from 2000-2008, the index increased only 
0.004, accounting for only 10.5% of the total increase during 1990-2008.
 As discussed earlier, there was a much more significant increase in 
income inequality in the former period. It is also clear despite the 
small change from 2000-2008, inequality increased nevertheless.

2) 2009-2011:

From 2009 to 2011, the coefficient grew by more than it had from 2000
 to 2008. It increased by 2%, from 0.468 to 0.477, a difference of 0.009
 in total, or 0.003 per year. There were no decreases during any of 
these years. Thus, income inequality worsened the most during this time,
 with a larger increase than that of the 1990-2008 era.

Analysis of QE/II Correlations and GINI indexes:

When comparing the results from the QE/II correlation and GINI 
coefficient data, the 1990-2008 and post 2009 periods suggest increasing
 inequality overall.

 2000-2008 Divergence of GINI and QE/II

However, when taking into account subsections of the first period, 
the QE/II correlation and GINI index do not reach the same conclusion 
for the 2000-2008 period. The GINI coefficient suggests that income 
inequality still increased from 2000 to 2008, but the QE/II correlation 
indicates otherwise.

There are several reasons for this difference. First, PE ratios are 
not necessarily indicative of corporate financial health because the 
share price also is a product of investor confidence – which was 
unusually high during the 2000-2008 period even though the underlying 
data suggested the market would eventually falter – rather than an 
objective indicator of a company’s financial health or profits.[18]
 This leads to a false positive QE/II correlation. Second, as the 
Shiller PE Ratio is based on the previous 10 years’ earnings and the 
2000-20008 period is not a 10 year block, therefore, other events and 
factors played a role.[19] For example, 
the 1998 crash most likely led to smaller earnings for that year, which 
was included when calculating the 2000-2008 Shiller PE Ratio. Such 
events can make the denominator smaller, meaning a larger PE ratio and 
an altered QE/II correlation.

Furthermore, the PE ratio does not take into account which groups are
 the key recipients of corporate profits, only the sum total of the 
profits. Thus, it fails to take into account the offshoring and job 
losses that particularly harmed certain groups of the US population. 
This is problematic as companies are increasingly operating 
internationally with success.[20] If that
 reason is taken into account, income inequality would be higher than 
the QE/II correlation suggests because international competition lowers 
household incomes. Therefore, it appears that the QE/II correlation for 
2000-2008 suggests less inequality than there is actually. Due to these 
circumstances, the GINI index may be a more holistic data point than the
 QE/II correlation for that period.

This rationale can also be applied to the 2009-2011 period to 
illustrate that the QE/II correlation suggests a weaker correlation than
 it should. With unusually low investor confidence, the price per share 
was also unusually low. Likewise, the denominator (earnings) is larger 
than it should be due to the fact that the Shiller PE ratio considers 
ten years of corporate earnings, which include earnings for the years 
when the economy grew; this masks the sharpness of the increase in 
income inequality.[21] The offshoring of 
jobs continued during this time period, another contributing factor to 
greater actual income inequality in practice than the QE/II correlation 
suggests.

Furthermore, the declines in income inequality suggested by the GINI 
index were likely caused by other factors. During 1994-1995, 1997-1998, 
and 2001-2002, the technological boom, rather than the lack of easing, 
may explain why income inequality decreased. While one may expect to see
 a decrease each year, other economic variables may have played a role 
in the years 1995-1997 and 1999-2000. Nevertheless, the boom most likely
 contributed to these reversals. Furthermore, 2006-2007 were the peak 
years of the housing bubble. The greater number of homes sold during 
this period may have resulted in a temporary, one-time increase in 
household incomes that skewed the income data to make incomes appear 
higher than they otherwise would be.

 Similar Trends of GINI and QE/II

Despite the fact there are some differences between the two, a 
general trend exists based on the comparison of the GINI coefficient and
 the QE/II correlation. Income inequality worsened more sharply after 
2009 than during other periods. In contrast, it worsened the least 
during the 2000 to 2008 period. There are logical reasons why QE 
increases income inequality, providing support for possible causation.

Reasons behind Quantitative Easing’s Association with Income Inequality

The list below is not exhaustive, and describes the most significant connections between easing and income inequality.

1) Inflation

By trying to stimulate the economy, quantitative easing attempts to 
increase spending and thus achieve a desired price level and desired 
inflation rate. However, it may lead to a higher inflation rate than 
intended.[22] This affects the value of 
wages, annuities, and pensions. People already suffering from financial 
hardship due to the weak economy will have to tighten their budgets 
further to accommodate an additional loss in their purchasing power and 
incomes.

2) Annuities

Many retirement programs contain yields, a percentage that indicates 
the annuity, or income, a person will receive during a specified time 
period. Under a QE regime, these yields are lowered.[23] Lower yields translate into lower incomes for retirees, many of whom rely on annuities for their day-to-day needs.

3) Pension Funds

Like annuities, pension funds are affected by QE in more than one 
way. Lower interest rates due to quantitative easing harm pension funds 
by increasing their liabilities, as lower interest rates result in a 
higher net present valuation for liabilities. In other words, lower 
rates result in a higher present value of future liability obligations. 
This means that corporations need to divert money from investments or 
hiring to fund their pension plans.[24] 
However, corporations may be unable to do so, leaving those who depend 
on such plans, often lower-income individuals, with reduced payments or 
nonpayment.[25]

4) Investment and Borrowing Opportunities

Decreasing interest rates, a result of QE, often lead to increased 
borrowing. However, the opportunity to borrow and invest money is 
typically limited to those who are already wealthy and have good credit 
scores.[26] When these investments bear 
fruit, the money returns to investors in the form of income. Those who 
do not have good credit scores – who are most likely to be comparatively
 poorer – miss out on these opportunities, leading to increased income 
inequality.

5) Corporate Profits Versus Worker Wages

As mentioned earlier, QE leads to lower interest rates, resulting in 
more borrowing and investment opportunities, including for corporations.
 Successful investments ultimately result in higher corporate profits. 
However, these typically go to executives and shareholders, who are 
wealthier; poorer workers do not experience similar benefits.[27]

6) Stocks and Profits Versus Worker Wages

As suggested by the correlation shown earlier, quantitative easing 
leads to increased share prices. Demand for the central bank’s bonds 
decreases due to their low rate of return. Equities offer higher returns
 and investors flock towards stocks, which raises their prices.[28]
 Second, as highlighted in (5) above, corporations are investing more 
and consequently have greater potential to make extra profits, which is 
attractive to shareholders.[29] The 
wealthiest benefit more from increased share prices and corporate 
profits. Income inequality is further exacerbated when wages for 
workers, who do not tend to own stocks, do not increase by a similar 
amount.[30]

Consequences of Quantitative Easing on Developing Countries

As nations in global economy are interconnected, changes in United 
States QE policy affects other countries, including developing nations. 
There are two primary manifestations of US quantitative easing in other 
countries: increased inflation and liquidity.[31]

The United States’ QE affects the currency exchange rates of 
developing countries. When a country like the United States utilizes 
easing to devalue its currency, other emerging economies may be 
compelled to depreciate their currencies to maintain a competitive trade
 advantage. However, further devaluation by emerging economies, 
especially a permanent one, leads to more unwanted inflationary pressure
 on emerging economies.[32] As indicated earlier, inflation can aggravate income inequality by negatively affecting purchasing power.

Additionally, QE leads to increased capital outflows to developing countries[33] through an increase in private investments. These outflows often end up in emerging economies’ portfolio investments.[34] Like the effects of increased share prices, such investments in securities and stocks often benefit the wealthy.

Ethical Implications: Distributive Justice

Distributive justice theory focuses on society’s framework for distributing benefits and burdens.[35]
 First, in some ways QE may not provide equal opportunity. Access to 
money created by QE occurs primarily through stocks. As noted earlier, 
the wealthy own the most stocks due to their ability to invest while 
still meeting their basic needs. The poor, who struggle to survive, 
cannot afford to invest in stocks. Such access is also available to 
executives who reap the benefits of corporate profits. However, the 
poor, typically retirees or low skilled workers, are not executives and 
tend not to enjoy trickle down benefits from corporate profits. They 
therefore, do not receive any financial benefits from quantitative 
easing policies.

Although the correlation within the USA is weak, it indicates that QE
 negatively affects income inequality and thus does not achieve 
distributive justice in the US. The USA’s QE also fails to help other 
countries achieve distributive justice since their income inequality is 
affected as a result. Furthermore, other indicators, such as the 
disparity between the poor and rich’s consumer sentiment, support the 
argument that QE aggravates income inequality. After QE policies were 
implemented, the rich, who gained more and lost less, had significantly 
more positive sentiments about the health of the economy and their 
personal financial prospects than the poor.

Practical Implications of Failing to Achieve Distributive Justice

Overall, in the short run, income inequality may encourage social 
unrest when the poor articulate their dissatisfaction and desire for a 
higher standard of living.[36] Examples include the 2011 London riots[37] or the Occupy Wall Street and Greek protests.[38]
 Unfortunately, these implications are not only applicable to the 
present. Income inequality also hampers countries’ economic prospects in
 the long term. It creates a permanent underclass and limits 
intergenerational economic mobility.[39] 
This occurs because poorer children grow up in an environment where they
 receive a worse education, harming their future livelihoods. 
Furthermore, the poor are prompted to borrow more than they should in 
order to meet their needs[40], increasing
 the risk of a financial crisis. As the poor have low incomes, they 
cannot help drive economic activity, rely on welfare, consequently 
further harming a country’s long term economic potential.

We analyze the short and long term implications of income inequality 
in more depth by organizing countries into two categories: developed and
 developing nations. These countries have different social, political, 
and economic characteristics and thus face different specific risks from
 income inequality.[41]

As developed countries have more stable political, legal, social, and
 economic systems, their economies are likely to experience some 
positive benefits of quantitative easing without being destabilized from
 social unrest. Even so, they might experience unrest to some degree. 
The complications associated with small-scale protests and unrest may 
still harm the prospects of other, potentially better, solutions and 
require a short-term response. Additionally, as these countries are not 
growing or reorganizing their economies, income inequality becomes 
ingrained, creating a long-term problem.[42]

In contrast, developing countries are less established and stable, 
heightening the short-term risks of income inequality. Adding extra 
instability may in fact plunge such countries into violence or internal 
strife, which can last for a significant amount of time and cancel out 
any short-term growth that result from QE. Furthermore, a developing 
country is likely to have unstable institutions, often riddled with 
corruption, and lacking institutional power.  This factor puts the 
country’s future at risk if the institutions make unwise decisions, 
creating the conditions for financial bubbles. The run up to the 1997 
Asian financial crisis is one example.[43] However, unlike a developed country, a developing country’s growth allows it a chance to reduce income inequality.[44]

The failure of QE in providing distributive justice potentially risks the wellbeing of both developed and developing countries.

An Alternative Proposition

As QE is not effective in reducing income inequality, an alternative 
tool may help the economy and be more effective at combating income 
inequality.

Implementing a direct jobs program may resolve the problem posed by 
QE, especially if the program strengthens infrastructure, enhancing a 
country’s growth prospects.[45] This 
would naturally help businesses grow as well as bolster the incomes of 
workers, so long as they earn more than unemployment benefits gives 
them. Furthermore, such a program trains workers, helping their long 
term earning potential, and decreasing income inequality.

Some may argue this was attempted in the 1930’s and was not 
successful. The attempt by Roosevelt before the war was unprecedented 
for its time, but not large enough to reverse the Depression. However, 
the economy revived with World War II, which was essentially a jobs 
program. This does not necessarily mean we should enter more wars; this 
simply suggests a jobs program can work. The mathematical correlations 
from 1934 to 1941, before the US entered the war, and from 1941-1955, 
which includes the war and some time after the war, support this 
proposition. The correlation between the Shiller PE Ratio and Treasury 
Yields from 1934 to 1941 is -0.23445, whereas it is 0.222655 in the 
later period. While the correlation is weak, it seems to indicate that 
the war reversed the trend from increasing inequality to decreasing 
inequality and does a better job than QE.

 



 



Furthermore, some may claim that such a program is difficult to 
implement as it must pass the legislature. If the government needs to 
act quickly, then it should consider doing both a quantitative easing 
program and a direct jobs program simultaneously. QE can be enacted 
easily by the Federal Reserve and bring positive benefits in the short 
term. The direct jobs program, which can be executed in a decent time 
frame, given pressure from a public that understands the benefits of a 
jobs program, can limit or reverse the income inequality caused by 
quantitative easing policies. However, it should be emphasized that a 
purely jobs-centric approach is probably the best way to tackle 
long-term economic problem of economic disparity.

		  The real inequality of the QE’s has been the reduction in 
interest rates which directly impacts all non-borrowers. It exemplifies 
the Robin Hood approach, take from those who have, and give to those who
 don’t. I have seen first hand retiree’s who labored for years to save 
enough money to retire, yet over the past 5 years their income on such 
savings has been reduced to zero and they have been forced to eat up 
their principal rather than live off the interest income. The various 
QE’s have had little effect on job creation, it has allowed the banking 
industry to recapitalixe itself at the expense of the non-borrower. The 
rates on home loans had little impact on the housing recovery until 
recently. Corporations are sitting on record amounts of cash never 
before seen in this magnitude. Banks are awash with deposits and are 
competiting heavily on the quality loans with very thin margins. Banks 
are also extending their securities portfolios to longer and longer 
durations, which when interest rates do rise, will force banks to take 
losses on massive amounts of securities, which will wipe out much of the
 gain in capital earned by those same banks over the past 5 years. The 
FED has created the largest hedge fund in the world currently at $3.7 
Trillion. It appears when interest rates rise they will be forced to 
also take losses or hold those securities until maturity, creating 
massive losses for tax payers. The 300+ billion in profits which has 
been earned to date by the Fed on the QE’s has gone down the drain, 
rather than keep those profits to offset potential losses, the money was
 given to the Treasury to reduce the debt/spend more. Anytime the 
finaicial markets are tinkered with, bad things will eventually result. 
The QE’s are no exception. I fear the outcome of this debacle will be 
much worse and more broad than the housing crisis ever was. When will 
they ever learn?
