Do public policies on gay and lesbian rights affect the incidence of hate crimes based on
sexual orientation? We propose that legal inequalities increase hate crimes because they
provide discursive opportunities for bias, discrimination, and violence. Legal equality,
however, will reduce violence. Using annual panel data from 2000 to 2012, a period of
substantial policy change, we analyze how three state policies affect reported hate crimes:
same-sex partnerships, employment non-discrimination, and hate crime laws. Hate crime
and employment non-discrimination laws that include sexual orientation reduce hate
crime incidence. Partnership recognition increases reported hate crimes, though it may not
increase actual crime incidence. Because incidence is spatially correlated, policy changes in
one state yield spillover benefits in other states. These results provide some of the first
quantitative evidence that public policies affect hate crimes based on sexual orientation.
Findings confirm the roles of institutional heterosexism and discursive opportunities in
producing hate crimes.

American debates balancing individual liberty against majority will are as old as the formation of the country. What
started as a slow march toward equal rights for several subjugated demographic groups during the nation’s first 100 years
became substantial progress toward equality in the twentieth century. Women and racial minorities won the right to vote,
achieved greater economic empowerment, and successfully argued for integration of a host of social institutions. In stark
contrast, rights for gay and lesbian individuals have lagged behind e in some ways becoming worse toward the end of the
twentieth century. This lag has a far-reaching impact on the health and well-being on the gay and lesbian population. In fact,
following political campaigns against same-sex marriage and other anti-equality initiatives, gay and lesbian individuals and
their families report stress, anxiety, fear, and health changes (Arm et al., 2009; Rostosky et al., 2010) as well as risky sexual
behaviors, mental illness, and suicide (Amadio, 2006; Baiocco et al., 2010; Hughes and Eliason, 2002; Meyer, 2003; Ryan et al.,
2009; Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2012).

The twenty-first century, however, has seen rapid changes in gay and lesbian rights. The federal government rescinded the
Don’t Ask Don’t Tell ban on being openly gay in the military, President Obama added sexual orientation to the federal hate
crime law by signing theMatthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, and the U.S. Supreme Court recently
ruled bans on same-sexmarriages unconstitutional. At the regional and state level, since the start of 2013 over thirty states had
their bans on same-sex marriage overturned by district or circuit courts. The ability of legislatures and courts to produce

sweeping social change is the subject of a long line of sociological inquiry (e.g., Burstein, 1998; Burstein and Monaghan, 1986;
Dobbin et al., 1993; Korpi and Palme, 1998; Rosenberg, 2008). The practical consequences of these policies are clear, and gay
and lesbian individuals who live in states with pro-equality policies report fewer psychiatric disorders and lower psychiatric
comorbidity (Hatzenbuehler et al., 2009). In addition to these individual impacts, externalities have long accompanied policy
changes and other types of organized social action (Merton, 1936). For example, pro-equality policies might not only promote
equality in access to individual benefits, but they also could foster a more tolerant social climate.

One indicator of increased social tolerance would be a reduction in hate crimes. Scholarship on anti-gay and lesbian
violence identifies heterosexist ideology (Herek, 1992) and cultural stereotypes (Franklin, 1998) as potential drivers of in-
dividual biases and, in extreme cases, violence. Among these societal drivers, the law stands out as a particularly salient
institution (Herek, 2009b). As far as we are aware, however, extant sociological research has yet to investigate the effect of
public policy e or broader sociocultural environment e on hate crimes based on sexual orientation. Research on racially-
motivated hate crimes is comparatively well-developed. Blalock (1967) identifies power threat as a key driver of discrimi-
nation. Likewise, lynchings and racial hate crimesmay bemotivated by discursive opportunities (Koopmans,1996; Koopmans
and Olzak, 2004) or defense of a neighborhood against in-migration of racial minorities (Grattet, 2009; Green et al., 1998;
Lyons, 2007). We bridge the literature on cultural heterosexism and racially-motivated hate crimes to examine how
changes in public policies related to sexual orientation create or restrict discursive opportunities for hate crimes, conditions
for defended marriage, and crimes motivated by economic competition.

This article examines the relationship between laws and hate crimes by analyzing the impact of changes in a particularly
salient social policy issue: public policies related to sexual orientation. Specifically, we ask whether policy changes affect the
incidence of reported hate crimes based on sexual orientation.1 We begin by discussing the literature on anti-gay and lesbian
attitudes, the impact of attitudes and policies on hate crimes, and prominent theories of hate crimes. Next, we present the
data and our method of analysis. We leverage the recent, rapid changes in policies regarding gay and lesbian rights by using a
Prais-Winsten panel regressionmodel with state fixed effects to analyze the impact of policies on annual reported hate crimes
over a period of 13 years. This research also includes a spatially lagged dependent variable to capture the artificial nature of
state borders and diffusion of hate crime production across space. Then, we present and discuss our results, which generally
find positive externalities (reductions in reported hate crimes) from pro-equality policies. These findings, which are
consistent with theories of institutional heterosexism and the law as a driver of discursive opportunities for bias crimes,
provide some of the first quantitative evidence regarding the impact of public policies on hate crimes based on sexual
orientation and demonstrate that social externalities like hate crimes should be included in pro-equality arguments.
1. Background and literature

1.1. Policy changes

Passed in 1996, the Defense of Marriage Act is just one prominent example of a recent spate of federal and state policy-
making limiting same-sex partnerships during the late 1990s and 2000s. Over the past fifteen years, twenty-eight states have
implemented constitutional amendments restricting marriage to one man and one woman (Human Rights Campaign, 2014).
Eleven of these amendments were passed in the 2004 general election, when activists and state legislators may have placed
them on the ballots to increase conservative turnout (Smith et al., 2006). Earlier bans arose, in part, as a backlash against
progressive policy gains (Soule, 2004). Recently, however, state and federal appellate courts have overturned state bans on
same sexmarriage. Before the Supreme Court ruled state bans unconstitutional, nearly forty states plus the District of Columbia
issued same-sex marriage licenses, and several others provided recognition or rights to same-sex couples (Human Rights
Campaign, 2014). Moreover, in the 2012 general election, Maine, Maryland, and Washington became the first states to pass
(or affirm) same-sex marriage at the ballot box, and Minnesota became the first state to reject a marriage ban by popular vote.

As same-sex marriage policies have changed over time, so have policies on hate crimes based on sexual orientation. Sexual
orientation was only recently added to the federal hate crime law with the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes
Prevention Act of 2009, but states have addressed the issue for over twenty years with some passing their own laws prior to
2009. Although the federal law allows for the provision of resources to state and local authorities, 20 states do not cover
sexual orientation as part of their hate crime laws (Anti-Defamation League, 2011). Conversely, a number of states took action
before the federal policy change in 2009, with the District of Columbia passing its law in 1989, a handful of states passing laws
in the 1990s, and many states passing laws in the early 2000s (Human Rights Campaign, 2014).

Nondiscrimination policies have received less public attention recently despite some significant policy actions. A 1998
executive order signed by President Clinton prohibits federal employment discrimination based on sexual orientation in the
executive branch (Office of Personnel Management, n.d.). In addition, 21 states plus the District of Columbia prohibit
employment discrimination based on sexual orientation, with 10 states enacting their first nondiscrimination policies in the
past 10 years and an additional 5 states in the past 20 years (Human Rights Campaign, 2014).
1 Although this article focuses on gay and lesbian individuals, other populations, such as bisexual, transgender and queer individuals, are often impacted
by same-sex partnership, employment nondiscrimination, and hate crime policies. Scholars may wish to expand this research to include these additional
populations in the future.

1.2. Changes in social attitudes

As public policies have liberalized, so too have people become more accepting of homosexuality e though most of the
decline in stigmatization did not begin until the 1990s (Hicks and Lee, 2006; Keleher and Smith, 2008; Loftus, 2001). The
majority of research suggests that there is a relationship between public policy and approval of homosexuality (Andersen and
Fetner, 2008; Hooghe and Meeusen, 2013; Lewis and Oh, 2008). Nevertheless, to date there exists “no systematic analysis of
the relation between public attitudes toward homosexuality and the legal recognition of same-sex marriage and registered
partnership” (Hooghe and Meeusen, 2013, p. 258), particularly the causal direction of any relationship.

Besides public policy, other cultural and political forces are related to an individual’s odds of approving of homosexuality.
State and national ideological affiliations, especially religious and political orientations, are related to public opinion on same-
sex relationships (Adamczyk and Pitt, 2009; Lewis and Oh, 2008). Nations emphasizing self-expression over a survivalist
orientation tend to be more accepting of homosexuality (Adamczyk and Pitt, 2009). In the United States, counties with high
community cohesion are less approving of same-sex marriage bans, whereas counties with traditional values and gendered
employment patterns are more approving of a ban (McVeigh andMaria-Elena, 2009). Other factors associated with increased
tolerance over time include a reduction in right-wing authoritarianism, increased awareness of research suggesting that
homosexuality is innate, the de-linking of AIDS with sexual orientation, and increased acceptance by public, religious, and
political authorities (Altemeyer, 2001). These findings suggest that despite the need for additional research on the impact of
public policy, broad cultural and political forces are related to acceptance of homosexuality at the individual level.

A logical question follows: if public policies are related to attitudes, could they encourage or prevent hate crimes? Given
that prejudice is the “basic underlying factor” for all individuals committing hate crimes based on sexual orientation
(McDevitt et al., 2002, p. 306), societal forces also seem a likely influence on hate crime incidence. We now turn to the
literature exploring public policy and the sociocultural environment as distal causes for hate crimes.

1.3. Hate crimes based on sexual orientation

There is a dearth of theory and research as to why hate crimes based on sexual orientation occur, perhaps because most
research on hate crimes focuses on experiences of survivors (Roxell, 2011). Studies that explore the motivations behind these
hate crimes tend to examine the characteristics and attitudes of individual perpetrators. For instance, perpetrators of anti-gay
actions are more likely to be young, male, Black, religious, conservative, and heterosexual (Franklin, 2000; Jewell and
Morrison, 2010; Roxell, 2011). In addition, McDevitt et al. (2002) have developed a typology of offenders that identifies
four distinct motivations for hate crimes: thrill, defense, retaliation, and mission.

Although individual attitudes and situational contexts certainly play key roles in motivating anti-gay behaviors and hate
crimes, societal attitudes and normative ideologies are factors as well (Parrott and Peterson, 2008; Willis, 2004). This is not
surprising, considering that individuals’ attitudes are often grounded in societal norms that stigmatize gay and lesbian in-
dividuals and privilege heterosexuals (Willis, 2004). Homophobia and institutionalized heterosexism can cultivate an envi-
ronment inwhich anti-gay behaviors and hate crimes are accepted (Willis, 2004). In fact, research identifies the enforcement of
societal gender norms as motivation for anti-gay behaviors (Franklin, 1998, 2000; Jewell and Morrison, 2010) and broader
approval of hate speech and hate crimes (Cowan et al., 2005). Many perpetrators believe that violence and harassment are
necessary forms of punishment for those who do not adhere to societal gender norms (Franklin, 1998, 2000) and a way to
accentuate their ownnormative identities (Franklin, 2000; Jewell andMorrison, 2010; Parrott andPeterson, 2008; Roxell, 2011).

The inverse may be true as well; whereas heterosexist and homophobic societal norms can motivate hate crimes and anti-
gay behaviors, pro-equality norms may curb these behaviors. Individuals in Canada are less likely to engage in anti-gay
behaviors than those in the United States due to the differences in cultural norms and pressures (Jewell and Morrison,
2010). Even individuals identified as more homophobic were mindful of how others would perceive their attitudes and
behaviors, and were “motivated tomonitor their prejudicial expression to control how theywould be perceived by others” (p.
2102). In sum, socialization and cultural norms may play a role in hate crimes and anti-gay behaviors.

1.4. Theories of hate crimes

Whereas extant research suggests a link between sociocultural context and hate crimes based on sexual orientation, it has
yet to offer a guiding theory for why hate crimes occur. In this regard, research on racially-motivated hate crimes is relatively
well-developed. Specifically, when legal conflicts or discrimination become salient, they create discursive opportunities for
racially-motivated bias crimes2 (Finkelman, 1992; Koopmans, 1996; Koopmans and Olzak, 2004). Joining the institutional
heterosexism literature with research on racially-motivated hate crimes, we examine the law as a key social institution of bias
motivating violence based on sexual orientation (Herek, 2009b). In fact, research shows a moderate relationship between
2 In Europe, for instance, political tensions over immigration instigate anti-immigrant violence (Koopmans, 1996), and mass media coverage of discord
and violence raises the salience and further facilitates this process (Koopmans and Olzak, 2004). In the United States, historical examinations of lynchings
implicate the explicit or implicit approval of public officials who refused to indict lynching participants as contributors to the racist mob violence
(Finkelman, 1992).



B.L. Levy, D.L. Levy / Social Science Research 61 (2017) 142e159 145
negative stereotypes and prejudice toward gay and lesbian individuals (Simon, 1998), and “antigay violence can be seen
primarily as an extreme manifestation of pervasive cultural norms rather than as a manifestation of individual hatred”
(Franklin, 1998, p. 20). Thus, we test the following hypothesis:

H1. Constitutional amendments banning same-sex marriage will increase the incidence of sexual orientation-motivated
hate crimes over several years.

Inversely, legal policies that de-stigmatize homosexuality, such as hate crime laws and well-publicized commitment by
law enforcement to pursuing anti-gay and lesbian crimes, can be expected to reduce individual biases and the incidence of
hate crimes based on sexual orientation (Hamner, 1992).

H2. Pro-equality policies e those promoting equality e will decrease the incidence of sexual orientation-motivated hate
crimes over several years.

Along with the long-term impacts, it is important to consider short-term impacts of policy changes. Contrary to the long-
term prediction in H2, there are two reasons why one might expect a short-term increase in hate crimes following pro-
equality policies: 1) increased incidence due to perceived threat and 2) increased reporting. Research on racially-
motivated hate crimes informs our expectations regarding short-term increases in incidence. The defended neighborhoods
model of racially-motivated hate crimes posits that (primarily white) residents of racially homogenous neighborhoods that
experience greater in-migration of racially diverse individuals will commit more hate crimes as they perceive an increased
threat to their neighborhood (Grattet, 2009; Green et al., 1998; Lyons, 2007). Similarly, historical research on lynchings finds a
positive relationship between the percentage of black residents in a location and the number of lynchings (Beck and Tolnay,
1990; Corzine et al., 1983; Reed, 1972; Soule, 1992; Tolnay et al., 1989). Blalock’s (1967) work developing a theory of majority/
minority relations highlights threat to power as a primary explanations for increased violence. Pro-equality policies represent
a clear threat to institutional heterosexism and heterosexist power. In fact, homophobic individuals might commit hate
crimes to defend their marriage or the institution of marriage (a defendedmarriagemodel). Although a short-term increase in
hate crimes could accompany any pro-equality policy, partnership recognition seems as especially likely candidate. Glaser
et al. (2002) find that although employment competition and neighborhood in-migration of racial minorities produces lit-
tle change in violent discourse of white racists in internet chat rooms, interracial marriage prompts significant increases in
support for racially-motivated violence.

In addition to increased incidence due to perceived threat, pro-equality policies might lead victims of hate crimes to report
those crimes at increased rates because they perceive greater social acceptance ewithout any increase in actual hate crimes.
In her study of sexual orientation-based hate crimes on college campuses, Stotzer (2010) found that schools with pro-equality
policies at the state and campus level reported higher rates of hate crimes. However, when compared to the low number of
crimes reported to the FBI in the same locales, Stotzer concluded that higher rates of reporting on campuses were due to the
supportive environment rather than higher incidence of crime.

Some pro-equality policy victories are associated with an increase in social movement organizations (Kane, 2010),
themselves associated with greater rates of reporting (McVeigh et al., 2003). Such changes in reporting would yield a sta-
tistical increase in incidence when an actual increase may not exist. We consider both increased incidence and increased
reporting in our third hypothesis:

H3. The introduction of pro-equality policies, especially partnership recognition, may produce a short-term increase in hate
crime incidence via greater violence or increased reporting.
1.5. Impact of changing public policies

Existing research on other topics highlights the impact of policies and laws by state. For instance, in Maurelli and Ronan’s
(2013) analysis of sex offender notification laws and sex crime data between 1960 and 2008, they found that 17 of 50 states
had a significant reduction in forcible rapes following the passing of sex offender notification laws. On the other hand, 32
other states had no significant changes following laws. In addition to sex offender notification laws, state regulation of
firearms impacts crime rates. Research on state firearm legislation found that stricter laws were associated with fewer sui-
cides, homicides, and non-fatal injuries using firearms (Anestis et al., 2015; Irvin et al., 2014; Simonetti et al., 2015).

Despite the number of studies on state laws and crime rates, there is scant research investigating the link between public
policies and hate crimes. The effect of hate crime reforms has not been evaluated (Shively, 2005), and in most states, part-
nership recognition policies have not been in place long enough to allow for evaluation. Evidence fromMassachusetts, where
the state’s Supreme Judicial Court legalized same-sex marriage, suggests that there may be a relationship between same-sex
marriage legalization and reductions in hate crimes. In 2003, when the Court legalized same-sex marriage, reported hate
crimes dropped by roughly thirty percent (Bantley, 2008). Similarly, in 1996 when the Defense of Marriage Act was passed,
hate crimes in Massachusetts were rising. These statistics are hardly definitive, and additional investigation using more
rigorous analysis is necessary. Still, the suggestion that “actions or inactions by the government have had a tremendous
impact on this group of citizens” is worth exploring (Bantley, 2008, p. 564).

Among the most severe stressors that are prevalent in the gay and lesbian community are violence, harassment, and fear
for safety (Berrill, 1992). Research suggests that roughly 20 percent of gay and lesbian adults experience crimes based on their



B.L. Levy, D.L. Levy / Social Science Research 61 (2017) 142e159146
sexual orientation (Herek, 2009a), and over half experience some form of harassment or victimization e a rate that is
moderately higher than their heterosexual counterparts (Katz-Wise and Hyde, 2012). Moreover, 8 out of 10 gay, lesbian,
bisexual, and transgender individuals between the ages of 13 and 20 experience harassment at school, including verbal
harassment (81.9%) and physical harassment (38.3%) (Gay, Lesbian & Straight Education Network (GLSEN) 2011). Victimi-
zation of gay and lesbian youth and adults tends to occur in public with perpetrators who are strangers (Herek et al., 2002)
and is related to increased absenteeism, academic difficulties, problems functioning, depression, low self-esteem, stress,
anger, and crime-related fears (Dunbar, 2006; GLSEN, 2011; Herek et al., 1999). Ultimately, the prevalence of violence and
harassment against gay and lesbian individuals coupled with the observed impacts of policies on other measures of well-
being suggests that policies could affect hate crime incidence.

2. Data and methods

This research estimates a Prais-Winsten autocorrelation-coefficient-weighted first difference panel regression model with
state fixed effects (specified later) to analyze the impact of public policies regarding gay and lesbian rights on the incidence of
hate crimes based on sexual orientation. We use annual data from 49 states (including Washington, DC)3 over 13 years
(2000e2012) and rely on variation in timing of changes to state policies to identify their relationship with hate crime inci-
dence. This is a common strategy to analyze the impact of specific policies. For example, Hatzenbuehler et al. (2012) use the
“quasi-natural experiment” (p. 286) of the 2003 Massachusetts court decision to gauge the impact of same-sex marriage on
health care usage, and Dee (2008) uses variation in the timing of same-sex partnership legalization in Europe to assess its
impact on sexually transmitted infections.

2.1. Dependent variable

State-level data on sexual orientation-motivated hate crimes are available from the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s
(FBI’s) Uniform Crime Reporting Program (Federal Bureau of Investigation, 2012).4 The Hate Crime Statistics Act of 1990
mandates the collection of data on reported crimes which display manifest evidence of prejudice, including prejudice based
on sexual orientation5 even though sexual orientation is not included in hate crime laws in every state. The official reports
filed with the FBI are regarded as the “best source of national hate crime data” (McDevitt et al., 2000, p. 3), and they are used
commonly by researchers analyzing hate crimes (e.g., Alden and Parker, 2005; Grattet, 2009; Medoff, 1999). Hate crimes
include murder, non-negligent manslaughter, rape, aggravated assault, simple assault, intimidation, robbery, burglary,
larceny-theft, motor vehicle theft, arson, destruction, damage, vandalism, and crimes against society (Federal Bureau of
Investigation, 2012).

The number of reported hate crimes based on sexual orientation has remained quite steady recently, declining only
slightly from 1331 crimes in 2000 to 1302 crimes in 2012. By dividing sexual orientation motivated hate crimes by annual
state population (U.S. Census Bureau, n.d.db), we analyze the incidence of reported hate crimes in a state. Due mostly to U.S.
population growth, reported crimes declined by slightly more than one crime per two million individuals over the period. A
Dickey, Pantula (1987) test for first-, second-, and third-degree unit roots in state-level reported hate crimes barely fails to
reject the null hypothesis that a first-degree unit root may exist. Levin et al. (2002) and Harris, Tzavalis (1999) tests, however,
confirm that the dependent variable is stationary.

2.2. Focal independent variables

We will be testing the relationship between hate crimes based on sexual orientation and four different policy measures.
We operationalize state marriage policies as a series of dummy variables. Although data are available regarding the type of
same-sex partnerships and benefits offered by a state (i.e., full marriage equality for same-sex couples, a marriage-like union
that is not marriage for same-sex couples, or some spousal rights for same-sex couples), these various policies sum to be
present in a total of 90 observations e leaving insufficient cases to model the three types separately. As a result, we collapse
these into a single partnership recognition dummy variable. Another dummy variable identifies states with a constitutional
3 Hawaii is missing data for all observations, and Mississippi has missing or sporadic reports prior to 2008.
4 There are some potential limitations to using the FBI hate crime data. Like many administrative data, hate crimes data are subject to underreporting and

heterogeneity in reporting. Nevertheless, state fixed effects and first-differencing both help to account for any bias in this study. Moreover, to the extent
that pro-equality policies would be accompanied by an increase in reporting e at both the individual and jurisdictional levels e any bias in the data would
operate in the opposite direction of the hypothesized long-term relationships between policies and hate crimes. Thus, our parameter estimates could be
considered lower bounds. This research proceeds cautiously while considering the possibility of underreporting.

5 Included in this category of hate crime are crimes against individuals based on heterosexual orientations. This introduces some level of bias in the
outcome measure, but it is likely to be minimal for two reasons. First, unlike attitudes toward and hate crimes against gay and lesbian individuals, attitudes
toward and hate crimes against heterosexuals would not seem to vary across states. Second, hate crimes against heterosexuals plausibly can be expected to
be quite rare.



B.L. Levy, D.L. Levy / Social Science Research 61 (2017) 142e159 147
amendment banning same-sex marriage. These variables are mutually exclusive from each other and from the base category
of a general statewide ban on same-sex marriage with no legal recognition of spousal rights.6 Data for these variables are
available from the Human Rights Campaign’s (HRC’s) and National Gay and Lesbian Task Force’s (NFLTF’s) websites.

State hate crime policy is a dummy variable indicating whether or not a state’s hate crime law includes crimes motivated
by bias against sexual orientation. Although it is possible to further distinguish between states whose laws address gender
identity and those whose laws do not, this research does not incorporate this variation because the outcome variable
measures only hate crimes based on sexual orientation and not those based on gender identity. Finally, we operationalize
state nondiscrimination policy as a dummy variable indicating whether or not a state bans discrimination based on sexual
orientation. Data for both variables are available from the HRC’s and NGLTF’s websites. Appendix A provides a table of state-
level policies and when they were enacted.

To assess how state policies might be causally related to reported crimes over time, we test several lagging and leading
variable specifications of marriage, hate crime, and nondiscrimination policies. This follows the logic of a Granger causality
test, which suggests that if one time series is useful in forecasting future values of another time series, the former can be
considered predictively causal of the latter. The timing of these relationships is important given the possibility that increased
public tolerance might be expected to cause a reduction in hate crimes and then passage of pro-equality policies along the
lines of a dynamic representationmodel (Stimson et al., 1995). We determine the appropriate number of lags or leads for each
variable by beginning with two lags and leads, using a Wald test for groups of lags or leads, and removing the longest lags or
leads one-by-one if insignificant. Appendix B presents the progression of stepwise models using the Wald test to eliminate
lags and leads.

2.3. Control variables

This analysis includes several control variables: twomeasures of the incidence of general crime in states, threemeasures of
incidence of other reported hate crimes, citizen and state political ideology measures, two measures of state party gover-
nance, state unemployment, and state fixed effects. Crime incidence data are available from the FBI’s Uniform Crime
Reporting Program and cover both violent crime and property crime, as well as reported hate crimes based on race/ethnicity,
religion, and disability status. We calculate these general crime and hate crime incidencemeasures in the samemanner as the
dependent variable. To the extent that reported hate crime fluctuations are due to changes in state-specific general crime
trends, the general crime measures should capture that. If, on the other hand, any relationships between public policies and
hate crimes based on sexual orientation are spurious and capturing broad social trends in hate crimes, our other hate crime
measures should capture that.

We include several measures of the sociopolitical climate of a state because cultural context can foster or discourage hate
crimes based on sexual orientation (Parrott and Peterson, 2008; Willis, 2004), and conservatism is associated with antigay
behavior (Franklin, 2000; Herek, 2009b). Citizen political ideology is a measure of how liberal or conservative the state’s
electorate is in terms of its policy preferences; we use the revised 1960e2010 citizen ideology series7 first described by Berry
et al. (1998). State government ideology8 measures how liberal/conservative elected official’s policy preferences are; we use
the nominate measure of government ideology, which uses common-space congressional ideology preferences (Poole, 1998)
and has somewhat stronger validity than a similar measure (Berry et al., 2010). Citizen and state government ideology
measures range from 0 (most conservative) to 100 (most liberal). State party governance includes a dummy variable capturing
whether or not the governor is a Democrat9 and a variable averaging the shares of the state representatives and senators that
are Democrats10 (University of Kentucky Center for Poverty Research, n.d.).

We also include the unemployment rate as a control for economic conditions because although the literature is mixed,
some research finds a relationship between economic downturns and racially-motivated hate crimes (e.g., Beck and Tolnay,
1990; Hovland and Sears, 1940; Soule, 1992). The Bureau of Labor Statistics calculates state-level unemployment rates
(University of Kentucky Center for Poverty Research, n.d.). Finally, state fixed effects11 control for time-consistent omitted
variables causing across-state variation in hate crimes. For example, the share of a state’s population identifying as gay,
lesbian, bisexual, transgender, or queer might affect the incidence of hate crimes. Although there are no annual data available
to quantify this for our study window, the within-state share of the population is plausibly time-invariant and controlled
using state fixed effects. Summary statistics for our variables appear in Table 1.

After identifying the appropriate number of lags or leads for the policy variables, we test several theoretically-informed
interactions of our policy variables with social context control variables. Previous research suggests that the sociocultural
climate of a state can affect how states implement policies regarding gay, lesbian, and bisexual rights, as well as the

rights. In the few situations where this occurred, we coded the state as having the pro-equality policy and not the constitutional ban.

externalities that result (Bernstein, 2003; Eskridge, 1999). For instance, Bernstein (2003) utilizes a multidimensional
framework for understanding political movements and activists. She explains that cultural factors, defined as social norms,
behaviors, and discourse, often impact the strategies of lesbian and gay activists and the outcomes of their efforts. In the case
of sodomy laws, cultural changes often occurred even without changes in law. Further, cultural differences by state impacted
activism and policy implementation, with some efforts prominently displayed via town meetings or judicial challenges and
some occurring behind the scenes (Bernstein, 2003).

The literature on racially-motivated hate crimes also suggests economic downturns or resource deprivationmight increase
lynchings and bias crimes due to increased competition for resources (Beck and Tolnay, 1990; Green et al., 2001b; Hepworth
and West, 1988; Hovland and Sears, 1940; Soule, 1992). In other words, whites frustrated by economic hardships and lack of
resources blamed and attacked African Americans for their difficulties. Recent findings on racially-motivated hate crimes,
however, do not necessarily show such clear connections with economics (Grattet, 2009; Green et al., 1998; Lyons, 2007;
Medoff, 1999). We test interactions of unemployment with nondiscrimination laws and citizen ideology with all policy
variables, and they prove statistically and substantively insignificant. We do not discuss the results here (available upon
request).

A robust Lagrange Multiplier test (Pisati, 2001) indicates spatial autocorrelation in the dependent variable across the
states. We account for the spatial autocorrelation by including a spatial effect term. The spatial effect for a state in a given year
is theweighted average of the dependent variable for all other states in that year, where states areweighted using the number
of individuals migrating to the state for which a lag is calculated. Migration data for creating the spatial weights are average
annual migration flows between states as measured by the pooled 2005e2007 American Community Surveys (U.S. Census
Bureau, n.d.da). Thus, the spatial lag captures the impact of population flows, including the attitudes and ideologies peo-
ple carry with them, between states.

In addition, tests for serial correlation (Drukker, 2003) and heteroskedasticity indicate that both violations of linear
regression assumptions are present. Thus, we estimate a Prais-Winsten autocorrelation-coefficient-weighted first difference
model (xtpcse in Stata) with heteroskedastic panel corrected standard errors. Given the moderately large cross-sectional size,
the clustered errors are unlikely to be biased, and concerns of finite sample properties should not apply (Kezdi, 2004). The
assumption of strict exogeneity of the regressors for feasible generalized least squares should not be violated by the spatial
effect term because it excludes hate crime incidence of the estimated observation (state). The model is reflected by the
following equations:

Hate crime incidence (Y) in state s during year t is explained by k lags/leads of state policy variables (P), a weighted (w)
spatial effect term (Y�s), several controls (Z), state fixed effects (d),12 and a heteroskedastic panel corrected error (εst). We
obtain the autocorrelation coefficient (brÞ by using OLS to estimate the model without weighted differencing and regressing
the residuals on the one-year lagged residuals. By taking an autocorrelation-coefficient-weighted first difference, we remove
the portions of each year’s independent and dependent variables that are due to serial correlation. This is not the same as a
complete first difference, which would subtract the full previous year value from the present year value for all variables. As a
result, although the model is not estimating year-to-year changes, significant policy variables do have an impact both for the
year that they take place13 and in the following year(s) at a reduced rate (br). To account for missing data on the citizen and
government ideology variables, the Democratic governorship and legislature variables, we use multiple imputation with
chained equations (mi ice in Stata) and 50 imputed data sets. We calculatemean coefficients and standard errors using Rubin’s
(1987) formula. Finally, we scale all coefficients e except the spatial lag e to represent the number of additional hate crimes
per one million individuals per year that can be expected given a one-unit change in the independent variable.

This modeling strategy departs from research on hate crimes using negative binomial models for three reasons. First,
although hate crimes are relatively rare, there is not an overabundance of zeros in the present data (less than 5 percent of
observations are zero); Poisson and negative binomial models are especially superior to linear regression models when there
are a substantial number of zeros. Second, in our base Prais-Winsten model, neither the dependent variable nor the residuals
are heavily skewed, though the residuals do display significantly more kurtosis than a normal distribution. Third e and most
importantly e we anticipate that the functional form of the relationship between public policies, citizen attitudes, and hate
crimes is linear as opposed to log-linear. For example, we expect similar impacts when the liberalness of a citizenry increases
from 5 to 10 and from 10 to 15. To test the sensitivity of our results to our choice of estimator, we estimate a fixed effects
negative binomial panel regression of our preferred model, and the results are largely consistent with the present findings.14

3. Results and discussion

We begin our analysis by plotting national incidence of reported hate crimes motivated by sexual orientation against the
share of the population covered by each of the four public policies we consider from 2000 to 2012. In this section, we will
integrate these descriptive results with our multivariate models and proceed by considering each of our hypotheses in
succession.

3.1. Hypotheses 1 & 2

Our initial two hypotheses posit that pro-equality policies will be associated with reductions in incidence of reported hate
crimes, whereas anti-equality policies will be related to increased reported incidence. Fig. 1 presents trends for the shares of
the American population living in states with employment nondiscrimination laws (dashed line) and hate crime laws that
include crimesmotivated by sexual orientation (dotted line) from 2000 to 2012. These percentages change over time as states
enact new laws. We compare the trends with the annual incidence of reported hate crimes (solid line) over the same period.
The dramatic rise in the share of the population covered by hate crime laws in the early 2000s slightly precedes an equally
dramatic decline in hate crimes. In 2000, only one in six Americans lived in a state with hate crime laws including sexual
orientation; in 2005, the number had risen to seven in ten Americans. In 2000, therewere 4.8 hate crimesmotivated by sexual
orientation per million people; by 2005, that rate was cut by 27 percent to 3.5 hate crimes per million people. The time
ordering of this relationship is consistent with the implementation of hate crime laws Granger causing a drop in hate crimes,
though a definitive determination of causality would require more rigorous controls.

Similarly, the substantive, yet less dramatic, increase of employment nondiscrimination policies that include sexual
orientation in the early 2000s also coincides with the decline in reported hate crimes. In 2000, one in four Americans lived in
states with employment nondiscrimination laws; in 2005, roughly four in ten Americans lived in such a state. Rather than
preceding the drop in hate crimes by a year like the hate crime law increase, the rise in nondiscrimination laws seemed to
occur simultaneously with the decline.

Fig. 2 is analogous to Fig. 1, except that it presents trends for the share of people living in states with constitutional
amendments banning same-sex marriage (dashed line) and partnership recognition policies that offer marriage, a marriage-
like union, or some spousal rights (dotted line). As thewave of states implementing constitutional bans on same-sexmarriage
began in 2004, hate crimeswere in decline. The decline, however, reversed course after 2005 and rose to its post-2005 peak of
4.3 hate crimes per million people in 2008 e the same year that coverage of constitutional bans peaked in their coverage of

13 Or the following year(s) in the case of a lagged policy.
14 The constitutional marriage ban is statistically insignificant. One partnership recognition variable is significant and positively related to reported
crimes, and one employment nondiscrimination variable is negatively and significantly associated with reported crimes. Only the coefficient on lagged hate
crimes laws varies in its relationship, becoming statistically insignificant (but still negative) in the negative bimonial regression. The magnitudes of the
coefficients are not directly comparable because the negative binomial model takes a log-linear form. Results are not presented here but available upon
request.

the population. It is plausible, though again hardly definitive, that the discriminatory nature of constitutional bans, as well as
the heated political environment that they produced (Smith et al., 2006), broke the momentum of the decline and incited a
new wave of anti-gay and lesbian violence.

Of the four policies we examine, partnership rights is by far the last to see substantial change. Marriage and partnership
policy coverage hardly increased until 2007, and it saw only small growth until 2010. During the period of significant growth
from 26 percent coverage in 2010 to 41 percent coverage in 2012, hate crime incidence remained flat (see Fig. 3). It is possible
that the potential reductions in reported hate crimes achieved through pro-equality policies had already been realized
through hate crime and nondiscrimination laws, and partnership recognition thus did not yield the same positive externality.
Alternatively, this pattern may be confirmatory of H3 and a short-term increase in hate crime reporting that counteracts the
reduction associated with pro-equality policies, and we discuss this further in section 3.2.

Although the bivariate relationships we observe suggest an impact of public policies regarding gay and lesbian rights on
hate crime incidence, disentangling the unique effects of four policies changing at different times across different states is a
complex task. We turn to multivariate analyses to test these initial findings more rigorously. Table 2 presents the results of
Prais-Winsten fixed effects panel regression models analyzing hate crime incidence. Model 1 is our initial model, which
includes one-year lags of constitutional bans, partnership recognition laws, hate crime laws, and employment nondiscrim-
ination laws. Additionally, we include present year partnership recognition and employment nondiscrimination laws, as well
as a two-year lag of partnership recognition. Hate crime laws that include sexual orientation are negatively related to hate
crime incidence, whereas constitutional bans on same-sex marriage are positively associated with hate crimes. For example,
states instituting a constitutional ban on same-sex marriage are associated with one additional hate crime per million people
than states that have neither a ban nor partnership recognition policies in the year following enactment. These policies have
significant one-year lags, which is consistent with policy changes Granger causing changes in reported hate crimes.
Employment discrimination policies also are negatively related to reported hate crime incidence, but the parameters fail to
meet traditional thresholds for statistical significance using a joint Wald test.

Model 2 adds a spatial lag to the base model. The spatial lag misses significance thresholds, but the coefficient is positive,
substantive, and suggestive of an increase of roughly one hate crime per every three hate crimes in ‘nearby’ states. Moreover,

recall that a robust LagrangeMultiplier test indicated significant spatial autocorrelation in the dependent variable (p < 0.001).
The potential influence of nearby states is not surprising given that individuals tend to cluster geographically along di-
mensions like political ideology and values (Bishop, 2009; Tam Cho et al., 2013), and thus states where the societal forces are
more conducive to hate crimes based on sexual orientation are likely to ‘neighbor’ each other (or at least have residents that
migrate between each other). The substantive importance of neighboring states suggests that there may be spillover effectse
in the positive or negative direction depending on the policye of a state’s policies regarding gay and lesbian rights. The policy
variables significant in Model 1 remain significant at a substantively similar magnitude, indicating that the relationship
between policy changes and hate crime incidence is unlikely to be endogenous to sociopolitical changes occurring in nearby
areas.

Model 3 includes controls for general forms of crime, reported incidence of other types of hate crimes, economic condition,
citizen ideology, and political structure and ideology. Among these, only the reported incidence of hate crimes based on race/
ethnicity is significant. In addition, the liberalness of a state’s citizens barely misses the p < 0.05 threshold for significance, but
it is substantively and positively correlated with reported hate crime incidence. Although such a relationship may seem
counterintuitive, it is consistent with research reporting greater reporting of hate crimes with increases in gay movement
organizations (McVeigh et al., 2003); liberal citizenries also likely foster a social culture that encourages reporting of hate
crimes.

Hate crime laws continue to be negatively related to reported hate crime incidence, and employment nondiscrimination
laws are now significantly and negatively related to incidence. States instituting a nondiscrimination law are associated with
one fewer reported hate crime per 900 thousand people during the year the policy is adopted and an additional one fewer
reported crime per 1.2 million people in the year following enactment. Constitutional bans on same-sex marriage are no
longer related to reported hate crime incidence, indicating that the relationship between the two is correlational but not
causal. Finally, partnership recognition policies are positively related to reported hate crime incidence, and we discuss this
further in section 3.2.

Over all, our findings thus far are generally supportive of H2. We predict that pro-equality policies will reduce reported
incidence of hate crimes based on sexual orientation, and this seems to be the case with hate crime and employment
nondiscrimination laws including sexual orientation. Both policies Granger cause reductions in reported hate crimes,
indicative of potential positive externalities. In contrast, we reject H1 e at least in its causal form. Constitutional bans are
positively correlated with reported hate crimes, but this relationship is explained by the many controls we include in our
model.

3.2. Hypothesis 3

Our final hypothesis (H3) posits a short-term increase in hate crime incidence following enactment of pro-equality pol-
icies, especially partnership recognition, via greater violence or increased reporting. Recall from Fig. 2 that we observe no
change in reported hate crimes associated with the rise in partnership recognition policies nationwide. In our multivariate
models in Table 2, however, we find that state partnership recognition laws Granger increase reported hate crimes. Specif-
ically, a partnership recognition law is associated with one additional hate crime per 1.2 million people in both the imple-
mentation year and the year following implementation, as well as an additional hate crime per one million people two years
following implementation.

This finding is confirmatory of H3, but the cause of the increase remains unclear. We cannot determine definitively if the
increase in reported crimes results from an actual increase in violence or an increase in reporting only. Given the particularly
contested nature of marriage policy (Glaser et al., 2002), it is not inconceivable that partnership recognition might incite
retaliatory violence. If the increase is due to retaliatory hate crimes, wewould expect the effect to be stronger in conservative
locations given the relationship between an individual’s conservative ideology and propensity to commit a hate crime
(Franklin, 2000; Jewell and Morrison, 2010; Roxell, 2011). When testing interactions between citizen ideology and part-
nership recognition policies (despite their statistical insignificance), however, there is little difference in themarginal effect of
partnership recognition between liberal and conservative citizenries. Alternatively, because hate crime laws and employment
nondiscrimination laws tend to be adopted before partnership recognition, the former policies may yield the bulk of the gains
in hate crime reductions. Such a scenario could leave increases in reporting as the primary impact of the later-enacted
partnership recognition policies. Thus, it is possible that the time ordering of policy implementation, as opposed to the
specific type of policy, determines a policy’s impact. We address this possibility now.

3.3. Policy order effects

We re-estimate our model of hate crime incidence using timing variables and lags for pro-equality policy implementation
instead of indicator variables for specific pro-equality policies. For example, if a state implements a hate crime law including
sexual orientation in 2005 and an employment nondiscrimination law in 2008, the state would be coded as implementing
their first pro-equality policy in 2005 and their second in 2008. In this timing specification, this hypothetical state would look
exactly like a state that implemented an employment nondiscrimination law in 2005 and partnership rights in 2008 (but had
no hate crime law) from a modeling perspective. We again begin by testing two years of lags and leads for each policy timing
variable and eliminating lags or leads based on significance tests and jointWald tests. Table 3 presents the results of our policy

timing model, which includes the present value of the first pro-equality policy, a one-year lag of the second pro-equality
policy, and the present value, a one-year lag, and a two-year lag of the third pro-equality policy.

Most of the benefits of pro-equality policies appear to arise from the second policy that is implemented. The second pro-
equality policy reduces reported hate crime incidence in the year following implementation by one hate crime per 600
thousand people, again indicating Granger causality. The first pro-equality policy has a muted, statistically insignificant
negative relationshipwith hate crime incidence. It is worth noting that we are unable to capture a sizeable share of the change
in reported hate crimes that may be due to the first pro-equality policy because 12 states implemented such a policy in 2000
or beforeemeaning its impact would be captured entirely by the state fixed effects.15 As a result, wemay simply be unable to
estimate the impact of an initial policy with our data.

The third pro-equality policy is associated with an increase in reported hate crimes in the implementation year and the
two years following implementation. This result is unsurprising as, with only one exception, when a state enacts a third pro-
equality policy it is establishing some type of partnership recognition, which also is associated with an increase in reported
hate crime incidence (see Table 2). Although the results are hardly definitive, we are inclined to interpret this increase as a rise
in reporting rather than a spike in hate crimes committed by individuals retaliating against same-sex partnerships. Wewould
15 An additional 19 states had yet to institute a pro-equality policy by 2012. Thus, 12 of the 30 states (40 percent) with pro-equality policies have their first
pro-equality policy completely controlled with state fixed effects.

expect retaliatory violence to be strongest when the policy discourse is at its peak e the period surrounding implementation.
In contrast, the increase in reported crime is strongest in the two years following implementation.

Finally, we attempted to gauge the relative importance of policy type versus implementation order by pooling both sets of
variables into a single Prais-Winsten model. Unfortunately, it is difficult to distinguish which is driving the changes in hate
crimes due to the high degree of multicollinearity between the two types of variables. We then compare the explanatory
power of the base models from Tables 2 and 3 that estimate the relationships of policy type and policy order with hate crime
incidence. These models provide little evidence to adjudicate the issue as they have comparable explanatory power16 and
similar parameter estimates. Although we cannot settle the debate, it is instructive that the implementation order model
performs essentially as well as the policy type model. This indicates that at least some of the positive externalities of pro-
equality policies are due to their adoption in states that previously had one or no such policies.

Ultimately, we find significant effects of most policies despite including a strong control for across-state variance with
state fixed effects and examining only within-state, over-time variation in policies and hate crime incidence. For at least the
twelve states that had implemented their first pro-equality policy by 2000, three of which also had implemented their second
by 2000, the fixed effects completely absorb the (immediate) impact of these policies. Most likely, the fixed effects also
capture some of the additional observed variance in hate crimes that might be attributable to policy changes during the
window of analysis. Thus, we consider our estimates potential lower bounds of the true relationships.

4. Conclusion

The substantial changes in state policies on gay and lesbian rights over the past 15 years, as well as the persistent het-
erogeneity across states, have important consequences for the well-being of gays and lesbians. Already established are the
implications of public policies for mental and physical health, as well as a host of individual benefits. We examine the po-
tential for policy externalities in the form of hate crimes. Previous research on racially-motivated violence suggests perceived
threats of integration (Grattet, 2009; Green et al., 1998; Lyons, 2007) and discursive opportunities (Koopmans, 1996;
Koopmans and Olzak, 2004) are potential drivers of hate crimes. The present findings provide the first rigorous quantita-
tive evidence that public policies on gay and lesbian rights affect the incidence of hate crimes based on sexual orientation. Our
results are consistent with institutional heterosexism theory, wherein the law provides or restricts discursive opportunities
for bias-based violence.

Employment nondiscrimination and hate crime laws are associated with reduced reports of hate crimes, providing evi-
dence confirmatory of H2. Although it is unclear whether it is the implementation order or type of policy that drives changes
in incidence, these relationships are clear, in the expected direction, and consistent with policy changes Granger causing
changes in incidence. Along with potential benefits for gays and lesbians in a state implementing pro-equality policies, the
positive spatial lag term that barely misses traditional significance thresholds indicates that pro-equality policies in one state
may yield spillover benefits for individuals in other ‘nearby’ states.

Consistent with H3, partnership recognition laws yield increases in reported hate crime incidences in the implementation
year and two years following. Whether the increase is due to retaliatory violence or greater reporting cannot be determined
definitively with the present analyses, but the results are suggestive of increases in reported crimes as opposed to retaliatory
violence. Under a defendedmarriage model, wewould expect a spike in hate crimes coincident with implementation and the
strongest increase in conservative states; in contrast, we see the strongest effect two years following implementation and
roughly equivalent increases by across levels of citizen political ideology. This finding in particular would benefit from
additional exploration.

These results build on existing arguments that anti-gay and lesbian violence is an extreme manifestation of social stig-
matization and cultural norms that are fostered by social institutions, and future research should explore the potential
mediating role of stigma in the production of hate crimes. According to both Goffman’s (1963) and Link and Phelan’s (2001)
models, the process of stigmatization includes status loss and discrimination that subsequently legitimize stigma. Laws and
public policies can be key sources of social stigmatization by codifying and perpetuating differences in status and institu-
tionalizing heterosexism (Herek 2009b, 2011). Public referenda and ballot initiatives in particular may crystalize attitudes and
behaviors towards gay and lesbian individuals (VanHorn, 2008). It is through these individual attitudes and behaviors, of
course, that public policies and stigmatizationwould have an effect on hate crimes. Not only are individuals’ attitudes related
to their pro-gay and lesbian activism (Wilkinson and Sagarin, 2010), their attitudes also are associated with behavior in cases
of hate crimes (Parrott and Peterson, 2008). Accordingly, to better understand the impact of pro-equality policies on hate
crime incidence, it will be important to examine the role of stigmatization and its impact on social attitudes.

The present research also is not without its limitations. Hate crimes are notoriously difficult to count accurately (Cramer,
1999; Herek et al., 1999; Jenness and Grattet, 2005). Although the Uniform Crime Reports are commonly used (e.g., Alden and
Parker, 2005; Grattet, 2009;Medoff,1999) and regarded as the best available data source (McDevitt et al., 2000), our estimates
of hate crime incidence still likely suffer from significant undercount. In the future, representative surveys or experimentally
testing reports of hate crimes would be beneficial to better quantify the extent of the problem. Fortunately for the present
16 The model R2 statistics are less than one percentage point different. The base model in Table 2 has an R2 of 0.2852, whereas the base model in Table 3
has an R2 of 0.2926.



B.L. Levy, D.L. Levy / Social Science Research 61 (2017) 142e159 155
research, however, the various sources of hate crimes data tend to be in agreement regarding how hate crimes are distributed
across communities despite reporting different totals (Green et al., 2001a). Thus, though counts of incidence may be inac-
curate, disparities and trends between states are plausibly correct. Moreover, given that underreporting is the primary
challenge e and underreporting can be expected to decrease with the institution of pro-equality policies e the effect of
reporting biases should run counter to the expected policy effects in H1 and H2. Based on this and Stotzer’s (2010) findings,
the data challenges accompanying hate crimes research should suppress, rather than inflate, our estimated effects.

These findings add to the newly forming literature on the social production of hate crimes. The small body of quantitative
research focuses on racially-motivated bias crimes and explores economic and neighborhood transition models of causation.
We extend this literature to hate crimes committed against gays and lesbians, individuals for whom civil rights advances are
relatively recent and ongoing. Additionally, we test the applicability of the defended neighborhood and discursive oppor-
tunity models to hate crimes based on sexual orientation. We find evidence consistent with a discursive opportunity model
(Koopmans, 1996; Koopmans and Olzak, 2004) in which the law is a key social institution that induces or discourages bias-
motivated violence.

This research also has implications for current social policy. In addition to the individual-level benefits that characterize
current pro-equality arguments in the gay and lesbian rights debate, there are positive social externalities, such as a reduction
in hate crimes, associatedwith pro-equality laws. Although public opinion onmarriage equality remains fairly closely divided,
the general public is, for the most part, not divided in its opposition to hate crimes. Thus, the potential for state policies to
influence, if not serve as, societal forces in the production of hate crimes will be an important consideration for legislatures
and courts deliberating marriage equality, hate crime, and employment nondiscrimination laws.
