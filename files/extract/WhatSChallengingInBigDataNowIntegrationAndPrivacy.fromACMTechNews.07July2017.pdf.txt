What’s Challenging in Big Data Now: Integration and Privacy
Alex Woodie

It’s been said many times before, but it’s worth stating

again: big data presents large opportunities for

improving business and society, but it also involves

sizable computing challenges, as well as moral

challenges. A panel of renowned professors in the

field expounded on the obstacles blocking big data’s

path forward during a recent meeting of the

Association of Computing Machinery (ACM). Privacy

and integration issues led the way.

In celebration of the 50th anniversary of the A.M.

Turing Award, which is sometimes called the “Nobel Prize of computing,” the ACM convened a

gathering of some of the brightest minds in computing, including Michael Stonebraker, an adjunct

professor at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) and the 2014

winner of the Turing Award.

When asked what challenges big data represents in a super-connected world with 25 billion data-

generating devices, Stonebraker commented that two of the three “Vs” have basically been

solved.

“If you have a volume problem and you’re interested solely in running SQL-style business

intelligence on a lot of data, in the data warehouse market, there are at least a few dozen

production petascale warehouses that do exactly this day in and day out,” said Stonebraker, who

created the Vertica MPP database now sold by HPE. “[T]he volume problem is basically solved

and shouldn’t get much harder in the future.”

Similarly, the data velocity problem is under control. “If you

want to process a million messages a second, current stream

processing engines can do this quite easily,” he said. “I’m not

aware of anybody that wants to go faster than that….I don’t

consider the velocity issue to be all that difficult.”

But the third “V,” the one that pertains to variety, is a potential

deal-breaker, according to Stonebraker, who labeled it the

800-lb. gorilla in the corner of the room.

“As near as I can tell, [data variety] is what is causing

problems for nearly every major enterprise on the planet,” he

said. “I think what is going to kill everybody isn’t necessarily

the number of connected devices, but the variety of

independently-constructed data sources that enterprises are

going to want to put together. Whether you’re talking about

healthcare, manufacturing, or financial services, all of these

independently structured databases are going to be a killer.”

David Blei, a professor at Columbia University and a winner

of the ACM-Infosys 2013 Foundation Award, said there are

great opportunities to benefit from big data, but also some

unmet challenges.

“If you take the example of genes and diseases, it’s an important computer science and statistics

problem that’s unsolved,” Blei said.  “Data scientists are looking to answer how we take data that

we observe from the world and use it to identify causal connections between two variables.”

Dealing with the uncertainty and biases that can arise from basing conclusions around

correlations is something that all big data practitioners must tackle. It’s also something that

Daphne Koller, an adjunct professor of computer science at Stanford University and an ACM-

Infosys 2007 Foundation Award, brought up during the panel.

“Bias will always be a challenge, and there isn’t a single, magic

solution,” Koller said. “The bigger question is, How do we

disentangle correlation from causation?…I’ll turn to healthcare for

an example: the gold standard in the medical state is that of

randomized case control. In the case of web data, it’s called A/B

testing—basically tech industry jargon for the same type of

control.”

Although A/B testing is not perfect as a randomized case control,

it’s “about as good a tool as we’ve been able to develop for

addressing some of the confounders,” she continued.

“Unfortunately, this type of control is not feasible in all cases.”

Where A/B testing is not feasible, practitioners must take pains to

ensure that “processes [are] carefully scrutinized to check for

different confounders and to look for any and all correlations that

give rise to the phenomenon being viewed,” she continued. “It’s a

process that requires a lot of thought and a lot of care and cannot

be overstated in its importance.”

While there are many challenges with the data science and technical aspects of big data, there

are also moral questions, as well as questions of privacy. Vipin Kumar, the regents professor and

William Norris chair in Large Scale Computing at University of Minnesota, says these challenges

come to a head in healthcare.

“Healthcare data about the population at large can be analyzed to create individualized

concerns about possible misuse of these kinds of

information, such as discrimination in hiring or in

purchasing health insurance, if this information is not

handled properly. The healthcare community is on the

front lines in this area, but, given the complexity of

issues involved, progress in addressing these concerns

is very slow.”

Big data has the potential to help society in massive

ways, but it will require solving thorny privacy questions

that go right to the heart of the matter, Stonebraker says.

“Privacy is a really good big data question,” he says.

“Imagine this simple example: you show up at your

doctor’s office and have an x-ray done and you want the

doctor to run a query that shows who else has x-rays

that look like yours, what was their diagnosis and what

was the morbidity of the patients. That requires

integrating essentially the country’s entire online medical databases and presumably would

extend to multiple countries as well.

“While that is a daunting data integration challenge, because

every hospital chain stores its data with different formats,

different encodings for common terms, etc., the social value

gained from solving it is just huge,” Stonebraker continues.

“But that also creates an incredibly difficult privacy problem,

one that I believe is not a technical issue. Because by and

large, if you’re looking for an interesting medical query, you’re

not looking for common events; you’re looking for rare events,

and at least to my knowledge, there aren’t any technical

solutions that will allow access to rare events without indirectly

disclosing who in fact the events belong to.”

We must find the right balance between making data public

and respecting people’s privacy. It’s a question of “how public

is too public,” said Professor Blei.

“To me, we get the most bang for our buck if we make

everything public; however, that’s going to have some serious

security and morality issues with it, so we shouldn’t do that,”

the ACM Fellow said. “But making everything completely

private and not benefiting from that data also doesn’t seem

like a great option. I think this is a difficult, thorny issue. It lives

at the intersection of policy, philosophy, morality, computer

science, data science, and machine learning.”

There are no simple answers to questions like these. But considering the societal good that will

come from solving them, it’s a challenge that must be undertaken.
