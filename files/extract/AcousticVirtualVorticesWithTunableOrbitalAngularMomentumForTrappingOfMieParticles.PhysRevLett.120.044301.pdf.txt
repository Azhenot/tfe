Acoustic vortices can transfer angular momentum and trap particles. Here, we show that particles
trapped in airborne acoustic vortices orbit at high speeds, leading to dynamic instability and ejection. We
demonstrate stable trapping inside acoustic vortices by generating sequences of short-pulsed vortices of
equal helicity but opposite chirality. This produces a “virtual vortex” with an orbital angular momentum
that can be tuned independently of the trapping force. We use this method to adjust the rotational speed of
particles inside a vortex beam and, for the first time, create three-dimensional acoustics traps for particles of
wavelength order (i.e., Mie particles).

Acoustic vortices have been extensively studied for their
ability to trap particles [1–3] and transfer orbital angular
momentum (OAM) [4–13]. Acoustic vortices have been
theorized to generate negative radiation forces along the
propagation direction [1,14,15], and recently, the stable
three-dimensional trapping of Rayleigh particles (i.e.,
radius smaller than the wavelength a ≪ λ) was demon-
strated using focused acoustic vortices [16,17]. We note
that, in this context, a stable trap is one in which the forces
are convergent on the particle and that the system is
relatively insensitive to small perturbations.
Acoustic vortices are wave fields with a screw dislocation

in the phasewave front [18] and an amplitude null on the axis

pin ¼ Pðr; θÞeilφe−iωt; ð1Þ
where (r,θ) arepolarcoordinates,ω is angular frequency, and
Pðr; θÞ is an axisymmetric field, typically a first or higher
order Bessel function, that satisfies the scalar wave equation.
The phase factor expðilφÞ describes the helicoidal motion
around the propagation axis (φ refers to the azimuth angle),
and l defines the helicity (or topological charge); its sign
defines the handedness, or chirality, of the wave front
propagation.
In an acoustic vortex, both the trapping force and theOAM

are proportional to the total power of the beam [10–12],
meaning that the rotational speed cannot be controlled
independently of the trapping force. This coupling results
in dynamic instability; e.g., when high powers are needed to
create stiff traps, the by-product is high OAM, resulting in
instability and possible ejection of the levitated particles [16].

Acoustic methods have distinct advantages over other
levitation methods, for example, optical, magnetic, or
electrostatic levitation, particularly in their ability to levitate
a wider range of materials in different host fluids.
Consequently, acoustic trapping is a fundamental tool in
chemistry [19], blood analysis [20], the study of organisms in
microgravity [21,22], control of nanomaterial self-assembly
[23], and x-ray crystallography [24]. At the same time,
contactless rotation has proven invaluable for understanding
planetary formation [25] and acoustic streaming has been
used to rotate microorganisms for microscopy [26].
If the link betweenOAMand trapping force could be broken,
acoustic levitation could become an affordable and adaptable
method for contactless rotation of samples due to the variety
of supported materials and high efficiency.
It has been shown that an acoustic twin trap can be used

to rotate a levitated particle [16,27] by altering the
orientation of the high pressure “fingers.” However, this
approach required the use of asymmetric particles and the
speed of rotation was limited to the phase refresh rate of the
drive electronics and emitting devices. Acoustic vortices of
fractional order [28] and short-pulsed vortices [29] have
noninteger topological charges, but the OAM is still
coupled to the beam power and trapping force. In optics,
the polarization of the two beams that make a vortex can be
adjusted to change the amount of OAM independently from
the trapping strength [30]; however, as sound is a scalar
field, this approach cannot be used directly in acoustics.
Here, we show that rapidly time-multiplexed acoustic

vortices of opposite direction create a time-averaged vortex,
or virtual vortex, which can have trapping forces and
OAM that are independently tunable. Acoustic virtual
vortices are shown to be able to stably trap and effectively
control the rotational speeds of levitated samples.
Additionally, a virtual vortex of large aperture (i.e., high
helicity) is shown to steadily trap particles with diameters

larger than the wavelength—a result which surpasses the
classical Rayleigh scattering limit that has previously
restricted stable acoustic particle trapping.
To explore these concepts experimentally, two multiele-

ment arrays have been constructed using air-coupled
ultrasound transducers operating at 40 kHz (wavelength
λ ¼ 8.66 mm in air at 25 °C). These arrays are named the
spherical cap (SC) and open spherical sector (OSS). The SC
array has a diameter of 110 mm, geometrical focus of
70 mm, and is made of 52 air-coupled transducers (See
Supplemental Material Fig. S1 in Ref. [31]); we used
this array to trap expanded polystyrene particles (EPS),
with diameters ranging from 0.5 to 5 mm. The OSS array
has an f number (focal length to aperture) equal to 0.1,
with an outer diameter of 195 mm and an inner diameter of
120 mm. It is made of 192 transducers (Fig. S2 in
Ref. [31]); this array is used to trap EPS particles of up
to 16 mm in diameter, corresponding to ∼1.85λ.
Through a series of experiments and accompanying

numerical simulations, we now demonstrate (a) the inherent
instability of airborne acoustic vortices, (b) stabilization of
a vortex beam using the virtual vortices concept, (c) control
of rotational speeds of levitated samples, and finally,
(c) levitation of particles with diameters of wavelength
order (i.e., Mie particles).
Here, we term an acoustic vortex defined by Eq. (1) a

regular vortex (RV). Such vortices have been previously
shown to be suitable for trapping and manipulating
Rayleigh particles. However, as the particles get larger,
they start to orbit around the vortex core until being ejected

out of the trap. This dynamic behavior is observed both
in simulations and experiments, as shown in Figs. 1 and 2
as well as in the Supplemental Material (Movie S1 in
Ref. [31]). The inability of acoustic vortices to trap particles
larger than the first high-intensity ring has been hinted at
before [44], but the actual limit in air is much lower. In
principle, one might expect that a particle smaller than the
first high-intensity ring may be stably trapped (i.e., ∼6 mm
in our setup for a regular vortex with helicity l ¼ 1).
However, in experiments, even particles of 1.6 mm diam-
eter are ejected. As the particle size increases, the tangential
component of the exerted force field increases, which
causes the particle to orbit around the beam axis during
the trapping process. When the tangential force component
cannot be sufficiently damped by the air drag, the orbit
diameter increases until the particle is ejected. This leads to
a threshold in the particle sizes that can be trapped (Fig. 2).
This phenomenon has been theoretically predicted for
particles trapped in optical vortices [45–47].
To make vortices stable for a wider range of particle

sizes, we switch the emitted vortex chirality between þl
and −l at high frequencies. Experimentally, this is
achieved by switching the driver phases to make the array
emit two different pressure fields. These pressure fields will
each exert a time-averaged radiation force on the particle.
The total effect on the particle is a combination of these
different force fields. This idea builds on the concept of
mode switching for controlling the height of particles
passing through a standing wave in a microfluidic channel
[48] and, in general, emerges from the acoustic radiation

force being a time-averaged effect. Sequences of short
vortices of opposite chirality have been generated before
[49] and have been used for communications [50]. The idea
of using them to control the rotational speed of particles has
been hinted at before [51], but never modeled or realized
experimentally.

Here,F�rad andT
�
rad are the force and torque fields due to the

two component RVs. Πþð−ÞðtÞ describes a square wave of
periodTR thatmodulates the component RVs, such that only
one exists at anymoment in time. The switching point of this
square wave is defined by TNþ, where T is the period of the
sinusoidal acoustic wave (40 kHz) and Nþ is the number of
cycles of the first component. As can be seen, in general, the
resulting force is a function of time and a timing diagram can
be seen in the Supplemental Material (Fig. S3 in Ref. [31]).
However, if the switching period TR is much longer than the
period T of the acoustic wave and much shorter than the
period associated with the system’s time constant τ (see
Methods in Ref. [31]), then the particle can be thought of as
being acted on by the overall time-averaged force.
In this study, we found that the fastest switching rate for

generating a virtual vortex beam with our experimental
parameters, without altering the stiffness of the trap, was
Nþ ¼ N− ¼ 40 (Fig. S4 in Ref. [31]). This corresponds to
a constant modulation time t�M ¼ TR=2 ¼ 1 ms at 40 kHz
in air.
Figure 2 shows that VVs can trap a wider range of particle

sizes compared to RVs. Our experiments indicate that

particles with diameters of up to 4 mm can be stably trapped
in aVV1ðl ¼ �1Þ, compared to 1.6mm in aRV1.However,
this 4 mm size limit was caused by the maximum axial force
(z direction) achievable in our devices, rather than by the
underlying dynamics. If we neglect the z component, our
time domain dynamic simulations (Methods in Ref. [31])
suggest that the size stability limit for a VV1 will be≈6 mm
(Fig. S5 in Ref. [31]).
Trajectory plots for particles trapped inside a VV1 are

shown in the Supplemental Material (Fig. S6 in Ref. [31]);
it is observed that VVs reduce the particle orbiting behavior
relative to RVs and hence lead to particle dynamics as if
the azimuthal force components had been canceled.
By regulating the amount of time that each direction of

the vortex is emitted, the angular velocity of the particle can
be adjusted (Movie S2 in Ref. [31]). Figure 3(a) shows the
angular velocity of a 1.2 mm diameter particle trapped in
a VV1, as a function of the number of periods N� of
the emitted component vortices. Figure 3(b) shows that the
particle remains in a constant z position despite rotational
speed changes, thus demonstrating the OAM has been
decoupled from the trapping force. Figure 3(c) shows that
the particle angular velocity can also be adjusted by changing
the amplitude of the emitted vortices. However, in this case,
the trapping force is coupled to the OAM, as can be observed
from changes in the z position [Fig. 3(d)].
Particles with diameters significantly larger than the

wavelength have been ultrasonically manipulated in two
dimensions underwater using high f number focused
beams (so called microbeams) [52,53]. However, this
phenomenon only occurs if the particle is partially acous-
tically transparent. In practice, this principle does not work
in air, as even low-density materials (i.e., EPS) have
significantly higher acoustic impedances than the

surrounding air. Alternatively, we note that large objects
have been levitated using near field acoustic effects
[54–56]; i.e., the sources must be placed around the object
and in close proximity (on the order of a wavelength) to the
surface of the object. However, despite the above progress,
three-dimensional stable acoustic trapping of particles
inside a standing wave or single beam has been funda-
mentally limited to particles smaller than half wave-
length [57].
Controlling the aperture of the central vortex null by

increasing the helicity of the vortex (l > 1) has been
suggested as a method for trapping of Mie particles
[58]. A RVof high helicity would not be able to trap such
particles due to the previously shown instability, especially
in this case, because the OAM is proportional to the
helicity. The acoustic power of the beam can be reduced
to reduce the OAM, but this also weakens the trapping
force. However, using VVs of high helicity, wavelength-
scale particles can be trapped as shown below and in the
Supplemental Material (Movie S3 in Ref. [31]).
Here, we use the larger OSS array to generate VV3 and

VV5. A 10 mm (1.18λ) diameter EPS particle (weight
10 μg) was stably trapped using an excitation signal of
12.5� 0.1 V in a VV3 (Fig. S7 in Ref. [31]). We note that
the predictions of the axial force were 4.3% smaller than
observed in the experiments. Furthermore, a particle of
16 mm (1.88λ) diameter (weight 35 μg) was stably trapped
using an excitation signal of 15.4� 0.6 V in a VV5
(Fig. 4), and the predictions of the axial force were 56%
smaller than the experiments. The poorer experiment-to-
simulation agreement seen in the VV5 is thought to be due
to surface irregularities in the hand-carved 16 mm diameter
particle and the inaccuracies associated with dropping tests
[59]. In Supplemental Material Movie S5 [31], the device is
tilted beyond 90°, while a 10 mm (1.18λ) diameter particle
is trapped inside a VV3.
We have shown that regular airborne acoustic vortices

are inherently unstable for trapping particles, even when
they are smaller than half-wavelength diameter. This
instability originates from the OAM that is partially trans-
ferred as a tangential force component that cannot be
sufficiently damped and thus accumulates, increasing the
orbit diameter. We have created virtual vortices by rapidly
switching between component vortices of equal helicity
and opposite chirality. By varying the proportions of these
component vortices, the OAM can be tuned independently
from the total beam power and trapping force, leading to
stable trapping of wavelength order (i.e., Mie) particles.
Fine rotational velocity control was achieved, as can be
seen from the small error bars in Fig. 3(a) (1% standard
deviation over mean value).
To ensure stability of the virtual vortices, the switching

rate must be tuned considering the dynamics of the system,
which depends critically on particle size. To avoid ejection
of EPS particles of 1.6 mm diameter, the switching speed

needs to be faster than 1200 periods (30 ms), for particles of
2 mm 5000 periods (13 ms) and for particles of 3 mm 1000
periods (2ms) (Fig. S8 in Ref. [31]). Through analysis of the
particle dynamics simulations, the effect that dominated here
is that, as particle size increases, the tangential component of
the force field also increases (see force vectors in Fig. 1).
For the first time, we have achieved stable acoustic 3D

trapping of wavelength-scale particles (16 mm or 1.88λ).
Using a more powerful device, our simulations suggest
that, using virtual vortices, we could have reached particle

sizes of up to 20 mm (2.32λ) using a VV5 (Fig. S5 in
Ref. [31]). In Supplemental Material Movie S4 [31],
we show two-dimesional trapping of a particle of 5 cm
diameter (5.88λ), supported on a table, and control its
rotation with a VV12.
All the presented results are for airborne acoustic

vortices, but simulations (Fig. S9 in Ref. [31]) suggest
that the instability due to accumulation of orbital momen-
tum also affects vortices in other media, such as water or
blood. Instabilities were reported when trapping particles in
water in two dimensions using high-aperture vortices [58],
although their cause was not certain.
We anticipate that virtual vortices will allow novel

applications in particle centrifugation and manipulation
of arbitrarily sized particles. With the standard acoustic
levitation methods, numerous applications have been
developed: i.e., crystallography [24], microscopy [60],
and spectroscopy [61]. Therefore, the introduction of
virtual vortices will extend the current uses of acoustic
levitation to allow larger objects to be manipulated and
their rotation controlled. Virtual vortices can also benefit
other fields in which vortices are employed, such as
microfluidics [62,63], optics [45], and electron beams [64].
