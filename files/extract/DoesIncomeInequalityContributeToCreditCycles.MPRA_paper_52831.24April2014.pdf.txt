Abstract

Recent literature has presented arguments linking income inequality on
the financial crash of 2007 - 2009. One proposed channel is expected to work
through bank credit. We analyze the relationship between income inequality
and bank credit in panel cointegration framework, and find that they have a
long-run dependency relationship. Results show that income inequality has
contributed to the increase of bank credit in developed economies after the
Second World War.

1 Introduction

Historically the most prominent factor behind financial crises has been the ab-

normal growth of bank credit or leverage (Gorton 2012; Schularik and Taylor

2012). After the financial crisis of 2007-2009, the relation between income in-

equality and financial crises has also become under scrutiny. Rajan (2010) argues

that rising inequality in developed economies caused redistribution in the form

of subsidized housing finance, which led to a boom in mortgages and later to a

crash with known consequences. Iacoviello (2008) shows that income inequal-

ity was the main driver of increasing household debt in the United States during

the 1980s and 1990s using a simulated theoretical model. Kumhof and Rancière

(2010) argue in their theoretical model that there is a a long-run relationship be-

tween inequality and credit, where higher inequality leads to higher level of bank

loans. Inequality raises the indebtedness of middle-income and poor households

as a result of consumption smoothing. This article shows that there is a long-run

steady-state relationship between income inequality and bank loans in developed

economies, where inequality leads to higher levels of bank credit.

In a recent article, Bordo and Meissner estimate the effect of change in in-

come inequality on the growth of bank loans and find "very little evidence linking

credit booms and financial crises to rising inequality" (Bordo and Meissner 2012,

p. 2148). Atkinson and Morelli (2011) find that there seems to be only an ambigu-

ous causal relation of changes in income inequality on economic crises. Atkin-

son and Morelli (2011, p. 48) conclude that "we have not investigated whether

inequality level was relatively higher before identified macroeconomic shocks.

Therefore, the level hypothesis cannot be ruled out at this stage."

Atkinson and Morelli (2011) refer to the hypothesis, where banks take higher

risks in extent to higher income inequality through securitization. But, the level

of income inequality also plays a role in the model by Kumhof and Rancière

(2010). In the model investors (the top 5% of income earners) own the whole

stock of physical capital and derive their income from the physical capital and

from interest on loans to workers. The bargaining power between investors and

workers determines the distribution of income in the economy. In this setup, de-

2



crease in the bargaining power of workers leads to higher income inequality by

lowering the wages of workers, which induces higher lending from investors as

they have surplus funds to invest. The more the real income of the workers drops,

the more they have to borrow to maintain their level of consumption. This cre-

ates a trending relation between income inequality and bank credit, where higher

income income inequality leads to higher levels of credit. However, income in-

equality tends to grow very rapidly in the face of the decreasing bargaining power

of workers, whereas leverage, or the debt-to-real income ratio of workers tends

to grow more steadily. The process of leveraging is gradual because borrowing

matches the decreasing real income of workers as they do not increase their con-

sumption, but just try to maintain their original level consumption. That is why

short-run changes in income inequality may not have an effect on the growth of

bank credit. What matters for bank credit is the long-run, trending relationship

between credit and income inequality.1

The analysis of this possible long-run relationship is complicated by the fact

that bank loans tend to grow over time, whereas the generally used measures of

income inequality, like the top 1% income share, are bounded from above. This

creates a problem, because it is not possible for something that is not trending

to have a long-run equilibrium relation with something that is upward trending,

in the first two moments at least. There are two ways around this problem: the

trending series can be detrended or it can be bounded using some suitable trans-

formation. Detrending of the series is problematic, because it will remove the very

thing under interest, that is, the trend. Fortunately, there is a natural candidate by

which the series can be transformed. The top 1% income share measures the share

of national income concentrated on the hands of the highest percentile of income

income inequality and financial stability.

earners. As GDP is, in practice, the national income of a country, the share can

be presented as income of the top 1%GDP . Therefore, it would be natural to convert bank

loans the same way, i.e., bank loansGDP . This transformation would make the mea-

sures comparable, as both would be expressed as a percentage of total income,

or GDP, without removing the possible long-run relationship that may exist be-

tween inequality and credit. As explained above, household leverage is modeled

as workers debt-to-income ratio in the theoretical model by Kumhof and Rancière

(2010). Thus, credit-to-GDP ratio is also a more accurate statistical approxima-

tion of the measure of leverage used by Kumhof and Ranciére than the level or the

first difference of bank credit.

In this article, we test and estimate the relationship of income inequality and

credit as ratios to real GDP. We use data on the income share of top 1% income

earners and bank loans on eight developed economies. Results indicate that both

the top 1% income share and the share of credit are driven by stochastic trends.

The two series are also found to be cointegrated of order one implying that they

have a long-run equilibrium relation. The long-run elasticity of the share of bank

loans with respect to income inequality is estimated with panel DSUR and it is

found to be positive. Top 1% income share is also found to predict the share of

credit, but not the other way around, using a Granger non-causality test.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the data and

gives the results of panel unit root tests. Results of estimations, cointegration and

Granger non causality tests are reported in section 3, and section 4 concludes.

2 Data and unit root tests

The annual data on bank loans include end-of-year amount of lending by domestic

banks to domestic households and nonfinancial corporations in domestic currency

4



excluding lending within the financial system (Schularik and Taylor 2012). Banks

are defined as monetary institutions and they include savings banks, postal banks,

credit unions, mortgage associations, and building associations. The data on bank

loans comes from the dataset of Schularik and Taylor (2012).

We use the top 1% income share of the population to proxy the income in-

equality. Leigh (2007) has demonstrated that the top 1% income share series have

a high correlation with other measures of income inequality, like the Gini index,

which makes the series a comparable measure of income inequality. The data on

top income share is obtained from the World Top Income Database (Atkinson et

al. 2011). In addition to income concentration we use several macroeconomic

aggregates attributed as factors behind credit growth as control variables. These

include real GDP per capita, investments as a share of GDP, short-term interest

rates, and broad money (M2) as a share of GDP (Bordo and Meissner 2012; Borio

and White 2003; Mendoza and Terrone 2008). The data on investment as a share

of GDP, short-term interest rates, and broad money (M2) as a share of GDP is

obtained from the dataset of Schularik and Taylor (2012). The data on real GDP

is taken from the Maddison dataset of the Groningen Growth and Development

Centre.

Leverage is modeled as a debt to real income ratio in the theoretical model

by Kumhof and Rancière (2010). Thus, to test the hypotheses by Kumhof and

Ranciere, we use bank loans to real GDP as our dependent variable. Descriptive

statistics of the data are presented in Appendix I.

Due to limitations of the data on top 1% income share, we are able to construct

a balanced panel on eight countries.2 The baseline dataset spans from 1959 to

2008, whereas the dataset including short-term interest rate spans from 1972 to

2Countries included in the panel are: Australia, Canada, France, Japan, Norway, Sweden, the
United Kingdom and the United States.

pattern in all eight countries. During the period of 1959-1980 the share of income

of the top 1% decreased, but at the same time the share of bank loans increased,

although only marginally. During that period income inequality decreased the

most in Sweden and in France. After 1980 the share of income earned by the

top 1% and the share of bank loans to real GDP grew at a very similar pace in

all countries. This period after 1980 gives some evidence in favor of the level

hypothesis stating that bank credit is increased with inequality. During this period

bank loans diminished only in Japan, which suffered from a decade long recession

that began in 1991. Because of the country related heterogeneity, the best way

to analyze the possible relationship between the two variables is to test are the

different trend processes driven by the same factor(s).

The data on bank loans is extremely heterogeneous, as described by Schu-

larik and Taylor (2012). Credit, money and banking institutions differ profoundly

across countries and in some cases historical data on credit covers only commer-

cial banks. As Schularik and Taylor, we tackle the issue of heterogeneity by using

country-related constants. There are few yearly observations missing from the top

1% income share data, which we replace by averages of the values preceding and

following the missing observation.

We start by testing the time series properties of the data. As the time series

extent of the data (50 annual observations) is too short for a country related time

series testing, we use two sets of panel unit root tests to test for the possible

stochastic trends. The first two are the so called first-generation tests, by Im et al.

(2003) (IPS) and the Fisher type ADF test by Maddala and Wu (1999). These tests

assume that there is no cross-sectional correlation between the units of the panel.

The second generation panel unit root tests by Pesaran (2007) and Phillips and Sul

(2003) allow for cross-sectional correlation within the panel. In all tests the null

hypothesis is that the series is trend-stationary. A more detailed introduction on

the used tests is provided in the Appendix II. Table 1 presents the results of panel

unit root tests for the six included variables.

According to results presented in table 1, all panel unit root tests find the share

of credit to real GDP to be an unit root process, i.e., tests cannot reject the null

hypothesis of an unit root. Three out of four tests find the top 1% income share

and the share of broad money to GDP to be unit root processes. Two out of the

the four tests find the share of investments to GDP to be an unit root process.

According to all tests, the short-term interest rate is a trend-stationary process.3

3 Cointegration test and estimations

3.1 Panel cointegration testing

According to unit root tests presented in table 1, stochastic trends would drive the

time series of the top 1% income share and the share of credit to real GDP. Next we

test if the stochastic trends are linear combinations of one and another, that is, we

test are the series cointegrated. To this end, we use two panel cointegration tests

proposed by Pedroni (2004) and by Banerjee and Carrion-i-Silvestre (2011) (from

now on BC). The biggest difference between these tests is that while Pedroni’s

test assumes uncorrelated residual structure, BC’s test allows for cross-sectional

correlation through common factors and it also controls for possible structural

breaks in the cointegration relation. Appendix III gives more detailed description

of the used tests.

The model for testing for cointegration between inequality and credit is:

credit/RGDPit = αi +γitop1%it + �it, (1)

where the level of bank loans are explained by the level of inequality, and (1,−γi)

is the country-specific cointegration vector between bank loans and the top 1%

income share. Under the null hypothesis γi = 1 ∀ i implying that variables are not

cointegrated. We include individual constants due to heterogeneity of the data on

bank loans discussed in the previous section. Results of panel cointegration tests

based on the model (1) are presented in table 2.4 15 out of the 19 test statistics

in table 2 find that the series of top 1% income share and credit to real GDP are

cointegrated of order one at the 5% significance level. Results presented in the last

four rows give some indication that deterministic trends may need to be incorpo-

rated in the estimated model. Still, the overall conclusions from cointegration tests

is clear: the top 1% income share and credit to real GDP seem to be cointegrated

indicating that the two series have a long-run steady-state relation.

3.2 Estimations

First differencing of cointegrated variables removes stochastic trends and elimi-

nates the long-run dependency between the variables. What remains is a short-run

where the variables are first differenced. More precisely, we estimate a model:

where αi are individual constants and uit is the idiosyncratic error term. Explana-

tory variables are lagged with one period to control for the possible endogeneity

of regressors. Results reported in table 3 indicate that income inequality would

not have a statistically significant short-run effect on credit. In the estimation

presented in the last column, none of the parameter estimates of the explanatory

variables is statistically significant at the 5% level.

The picture somewhat changes, when the levels of credit to real GDP and top

1% income share are used. In this case, we use panel DSUR (dynamic seemingly

11



unrelated regressions) estimator by Mark et al. (2005) to estimate the cointegra-

tion coefficient of top 1% income share using a model:

credit/RGDPit = αi +γ′top1it +βpXit + θt + uit, (3)

where αi are individual constant, θt is the common time effect, (1,−γ′) is the coin-

tegrating vector between bank loans and top 1% income share, Xit is the matrix

of additional explanatory variables, and uit is the idiosyncratic error. As the panel

DSUR does not allow for cointegration between explanatory variables, all the

other explanatory variables, besides top 1% income and short term interest rates,

are first-differenced.5 The panel DSUR estimator by Mark et al. (2005) controls

for the possible endogeneity or the reverse causality of explanatory variables by

including the leads and lags of the first differences of the explanatory variables in

the estimated equation. Panel DSUR also allows for cross-sectional dependence.6

More information about the panel DSUR can be found in Appendix IV.

Table 4 presents the results of panel DSUR estimations on equation (3) using

the dataset spanning from 1959 to 2008.7 First differences of the GDP per capita

and shares of M2 and investment to GDP are included as additional explanatory

variables.

According to the results presented in table 4, the cointegration coefficient of

top 1% income share is positive and highly statistically significant.8 The value

of the cointegrating coefficient varies from around 0.12 to around 0.35. From the

control variables GDP per capita growth and change in the level of money have
5There is no need to take the first difference of the short term interest rate, as all the panel unit

root tests presented in table 1 found the series to be trend-stationary.
6In the reported panel DSUR estimates a long-run covariance matrix is used, which actually

makes panel DSUR more efficient when cross-sections are dependent.

expected positive and statistically significant signs. The coefficient of investments

as a share of GDP has an unexpected negative and statistically significant sign.

However, this may be due to the possible correlation between investments and

interest rate. Higher demand for investments may increase the short term interest

rates, but higher interest rates are likely to diminish the demand for bank loans

and investments. Therefore, the negative effect of interest rates to bank loans may

be reflected to investments.9

10This is the period that Schularik and Taylor (2012, p. 1031) describe as a "era of unprecented
leverage and risk" because the level of credit in developed economies surpassed pre-war levels
around 1970 and trended up rapidly after that.

According to the results of table 5, the cointegrating coefficient of top 1% in-

come share is positive and highly statistically significant. The first differences of

money share to GDP and the short-term interest rate have statistically significant

negative parameter estimates. The negative effect of short-term interest rate to ra-

tio of bank loans to real GDP is expected, as higher interest rates make borrowing

more expensive. The negative parameter estimate of the share of M2 to GDP, on

the other hand, is likely to result from reverse causality. That is, as bank loans

increase, money held in deposit accounts (etc.) decreases, which will decrease the

broad money in circulation.12

3.3 Granger causality tests

Roine et al. (2009) have shown that financial development, measured as the share

of bank deposits and stock market capitalization, can have an effect on the income

of the top 1%.13 If the same applies to bank credit, there would be a reverse effect

from credit to income inequality. Panel DSUR estimator by Mark et al. (2005)

controls for this possible endogeneity by including the leads and lags of the ex-

planatory variables to the estimated model. The drawback of this method is that

it is sensitive to the selection of leads and lags. If some or all of the explanatory

variables are endogenous, and if the number of leads and lags has not been suffi-

cient to eliminate the correlation between them and the error term, estimates will

not be asymptotically unbiased.

Testing for this possible bias without strictly exogenous instruments is diffi-

cult. However, Granger non-causality test can be used to assess whether income

inequality helps to forecast the share of credit and vice versa. Although this is

not an actual test for causality, it will show the direction of the flow of statistical

(predictive) information, which can be used to assess whether there are reasons to

suspect a reverse effect or causality running from bank credit to income inequality.

We use the Granger non-causality test by Emirmahmutoglu and Kose (2011)

developed for heterogeneous cointegrated panels. It conducts N separate time

series tests and then calculates Fisher test statistics by Fisher (1932) using the

obtained individual p-values. Cross-sectional correlation is controlled by using

bootstrap method for obtaining the empirical distribution of the Fisher statistic

and associated critical values. Table 6 presents results for Granger non-causality

test between the share of bank credit to RGDP and top 1% income share.14

The null hypothesis is that X does not Granger cause Y . Lag lengths were determined using
Akaike information criterion. The empirical distribution and the critical values based on the
Fisher statistics were generated using 10000 bootstrap replications.

According to the results presented in table 6, there is no information on the

share of credit to real GDP series that would help to forecast the top 1% income

share series at the 5% level of significance. However, the information contained

into the top 1% income series does help to forecast the share of credit to RGDP

with 1% level of significance. Results thus indicate that the flow of information

would run from income inequality to bank credit. This diminishes the endogeneity

problem and shows that the estimation results presented in previous section are

not driven by mere statistical correlation. That is, results indicate that income

inequality has a positive long-run effect on the share of credit to real GDP.

4 Conclusion

Schularik and Taylor (2012, p. 1031) have described the period after the Second

World War as the "age of unprecedented risk and leverage". Iacoviello (2008)

shows that income inequality has contributed to the rise of household debt in the

United States during this era. Kumhof and Rancière (2010) argue that there is

a more general, long-run relationship between these variables, where income in-

16



equality will lead to increasing leverage in the economy. In this study, we have

tested the existence of such a long-run relationship.

According to our results, there is a long-run steady-state relationship between

income inequality and bank credit in developed economies. The long-run elastic-

ity of credit with respect to income inequality was found to be positive. Income

inequality was also found to have a one-way Granger causality relationship to

bank credit. These results indicate that income inequality has contributed to the

increase of leverage in accordance with the theories by Iacoviello (2008), Kumhof

and Rancière (2010), and Rajan (2010).

Due to the pioneering nature of these findings, directions of future research are

ample. The analysis presented herein concentrated on developed economies, but

the relationship between inequality and credit may differ, for example, in develop-

ing economies. More importantly, future research should include the examination

of the effect of income inequality on the probability of financial crises.15 By dis-

entangling the effect of income inequality and credit as predictors of financial

crises, the channels through which income inequality may increase the probabil-

ity of crises would be made clearer. Future research will also define the possible

need of equalization of the distribution of income as a mean for achieving financial

stability.

APPENDIX II: Panel unit root tests

All the used tests allow for individual unit root processes. That is, they allow

the coefficient of unit root to differ across countries.

The traditional panel unit root tests, are based on the following regression:

4yit = ρiyi,t−1 +ηit +αi + θt + �it, (4)

where αi are individual constants, ηit are individual time trends, and θt are the

common time effects. The tests rely on the assumption that E[�it� js] = 0 ∀ t, s and

i , j, which is required for calculating common time effects. Thus, if the different

series are correlated, the last assumption is violated.

The second generation test is based on the regression

4yit = ρyi,t−1 +ηit +αi +δiθt + �it, (5)

where αi are the individual constants, ηit are the individual time trends, and θt is

the common time effect, whose coefficients, δi, are assumed to be non-stochastic,

21



measure the impact of the common time effects of series i, and �it is assumed to

be normally distributed with mean zero and variance of σ2 and independent of

� js and θs for all i , j and s, t. Cross-sectional dependence is allowed through

the common time effect, which generates the correlation between cross-sectional

units. The matrix δi gives the non-random factor loading coefficients that deter-

mine the extent of the cross-sectional correlation.

The null hypothesis in all tests is that ρi = 0 ∀ i, i.e. that the process in I(1)

nonstationary. The alternative hypotheses are:

H1 : ρi < 0, i = 1,2, ...,N1, ρi = 0, i = N1 + 1,N1 + 2, ...,N. (6)

For consistency of panel unit root tests it is also required that, under the alterna-

tive, the fraction of the individual processes that are stationary is non-zero, for-

mally limN→∞(N1/N) = γ, 0 < γ ≤ 1 (Im et al. 2003).

Appendix III: Panel cointegration tests

Panel cointegration test developed by Banerjee and Carrion-i-Silvestre (2011)

is based on the normalized bias and the pseudo t-ratio test statistics by Pedroni

(2004). The data generating process behind Pedroni’s test statistics is given by:

yit = fi(t) + x′it + eit,

4xit = vit,

eit = ρiei,t−1 + �itζit = (�it,vit)′,

(7)

where fi(t) includes member specific fixed effects and deterministic trends.

The data generating process is described as a partitioned vector z′it ≡ (yit, xit)

where the true process is generated as zit = zi,t−1 + ζit, ζ′it = (ζ
y
itζ

X
it ) (Pedroni 2004).

1√
T

∑[Tr]
t=1 ζit is assumed to converge to a vector Brownian motion with asymptotic

covariance of Ωi as T −→∞. The individual process is assumed to be i.i.d. so that

E[ζitζ′js] = 0 ∀s, t, i , j.

22



Let êit denote the estimated residuals of obtained from (7) and Ω̂i the consis-

tent estimator of Ωi. The two test statistics can now be defined as :

The statistics pool the between dimension of the panel and they are constructed

by computing the ratio of the corresponding conventional time series statistics

and then by computing the standardized sum of the N time series of the panel.

Pedroni (1999, 2004) shows that under the null of no cointegration the asymptotic

distributions of the two statistics presented above converge to normal distributions

with zero mean and variance of one as N and T sequentially converge to infinity.

Banerjee and Carrion-I-Silvestre (2006) extend the model by Pedroni (2004)

to include common factors:

yi,t = fi(t) + x′i,t + ui,t,

4xi,t = vi,t,

fi(t) = µi +βit

uit = F′tπi + eit,

(8)

where ei,t = ρiei,t + �i,t and F′t :s are the common factors which are used to account

for the possible cross-sectional dependence.

APPENDIX IV: Panel DSUR estimator

23



The data generation process in Mark et al. (2005) DSUR estimator is of the

form

yit = αi +λit + θt +β′xit + uit, (9)

4xit = eit (10)

where there are n cointegrating regression each with T observations, (1− β′) is

the cointegration vector between yit and xit, and xit and eit are k× 1 dimensional

vectors. Panel DSUR eliminates the possible endogeneity between explanatory

variables and the dependent variable by assuming that uit is correlated at most

with pi leads and lags of 4xit (Mark et al. 2005). The possible endogeneity can

be controlled by projecting uit onto these pi leads and lags:

uit =
pi∑

s=−pi
δ′i,s4xi,t−s + uit∗ = δ′izit + u∗it. (11)

The projection error u∗it is orthogonal to all leads and lags of 4xit and the estimated

equation becomes:

yit = αi +λit + θt +β′xit +δizit + u∗it, (12)

where δ′izit is a vector of projection dimensions. Panel DSUR estimates a long-

run covariance matrix that is used in estimation of equation (9). This makes

panel DSUR more efficient when cross-sections are dependent. The efficiency

of panel DSUR actually improves as the correlation between cross-sections in-

creases. Asymptotics properties of the estimator are based on T −→ ∞ with N

fixed.
