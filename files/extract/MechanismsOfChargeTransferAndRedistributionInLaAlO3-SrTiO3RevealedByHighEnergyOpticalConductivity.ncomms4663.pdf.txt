In condensed matter physics the quasi two-dimensional electron gas at the interface of two

different insulators, polar LaAlO3 on nonpolar SrTiO3 (LaAlO3/SrTiO3) is a spectacular and

surprising observation. This phenomenon is LaAlO3 film thickness dependent and may be

explained by the polarization catastrophe model, in which a charge transfer of 0.5e� from the

LaAlO3 film into the LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface is expected. Here we show that in conducting

samples (Z4 unit cells of LaAlO3) there is indeed a B0.5e� transfer from LaAlO3 into the

LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface by studying the optical conductivity in a broad energy range

(0.5–35 eV). Surprisingly, in insulating samples (r3 unit cells of LaAlO3) a redistribution of
charges within the polar LaAlO3 sublayers (from AlO2 to LaO) as large as B0.5e� is

observed, with no charge transfer into the interface. Hence, our results reveal the different

mechanisms for the polarization catastrophe compensation in insulating and conducting

LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interfaces.

S
ome of the most exciting condensed matter physics
problems are found at the interfaces of dissimilar materials1.
The behaviour of electrons at these interfaces would be

governed by electronic reconstruction mechanisms2 leading to a
variety of exotic quantum phenomena1. In conjunction with
X-ray and electron spectroscopy techniques3–7 with their
inherent advantages and constraints, an experimental technique
that can directly reveal hidden quantum phenomena at buried
interfaces is highly desirable. In this paper we demonstrate the
potency of high-energy optical reflectivity coupled with
spectroscopic ellipsometry and study an interface consisting of
two dissimilar insulators: polar LaAlO3 and nonpolar SrTiO3
revealing the details of the charge (electron) transfer among and
within the layers that govern the conductivity of the buried
interface.

The quasi two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) at the the
buried interface of two different insulator oxides heterostructure,
polar LaAlO3 on nonpolar SrTiO3 (LaAlO3/SrTiO3)8 has shown
many interesting phenomena ranging from metal–insulator
transition9, superconductivity10 and magnetism11–14. According
to the controversial but compelling polarization catastrophe
model, the polar sublayers of LaAlO3 ((LaO)þ and (AlO2)� )
give rise to a polarization field inside LaAlO3 that causes an
electronic potential build-up as the LaAlO3 film thickness
increases. To counter this, a charge transfer of 0.5e� per unit
cell (uc) (B3� 1014 cm� 2) from LaAlO3 into the LaAlO3/SrTiO3
interface is required15,16. Various techniques have shown a charge
transfer much less than this. For example, X-ray-based
techniques5,6 have estimated up to 1.1� 1014 cm� 2 while
transport measurements9–11 yield substantially smaller number
of carriers of B1013 cm� 2. It has been suggested that charge
localization effects might limit the number of mobile charges that
can be measured by transport7,17, and thus if a technique can
measure and quantify both the localized and delocalized charges,
one might be able to evaluate the actual charge transfer5–7.

Another unresolved important issue is the insulating case of
LaAlO3/SrTiO3 (r3 uc of LaAlO3). Transport measurements9
have shown that the conducting interface only exists above a
certain critical thickness of LaAlO3, typically Z4 uc (although
cationic stoichiometry, for example the La/Al ratio of LaAlO3
film, may also affect the interface conductivity, with conducting
LaAlO3/SrTiO3 observed to have slightly Al-rich LaAlO3 film18).
This means that the charge transfer into the interface required for
countering the polarization catastrophe does not happen when
the thickness of LaAlO3 is below 4 uc. According to the prevalent
polarization catastrophe model, this means the polarization field
should be present for r3 uc of LaAlO3. One way to verify the
model is to measure this polarization potential build-up in
insulating LaAlO3/SrTiO3, which is predicted to be 0.24 V Å� 1

(or B0.9 V per uc of LaAlO3)19. However, attempts to measure
this have not been successful using core-level X-ray
photoemission spectroscopy (XPS)20,21, in which the measured
core-level shift in LaAlO3 is only B0.1 eV per uc of LaAlO3,
much less than expected. If the changes in the band structure are
predominantly near the valence bands and the Fermi level, then
the appropriate technique should directly probe states near the
valence bands and the Fermi level.

Let us approach the problem from a different angle. Another
way to overcome the polarization potential is by charge redis-
tribution within the LaAlO3 layers. In a Gedankenexperiment, we
hypothesize an extreme case of charge redistribution of 1e�

between the AlO2 and LaO sublayers of LaAlO3, which is also
adequate to compensate the polarization potential, although the
actual amount of charge redistribution might be restricted by
electrostatics. Hence, instead of measuring the potential build-up
in the layers, one can measure the charge redistribution within

the layers directly. This can be done by measuring the optical
conductivity involving states below and above the valence bands,
the conduction bands and the Fermi level, and then use the f-sum
rule, which represents charge conservation, to quantify the charge
redistribution.

Furthermore, recent band structure calculations and surface
X-ray diffraction measurements suggest that distortions of the
LaAlO3 lattice (buckling) may partly compensate the polarization
field in insulating LaAlO3/SrTiO3 (refs 22–25). Interestingly,
when the interface becomes conducting at LaAlO3 thickness Z4
uc, this distortion decreases and ultimately vanishes24,25,
indicating that the buckling mechanism is unique to the
insulating case of LaAlO3/SrTiO3. This raises another important
question: since the buckling is a structural change, will the
electronic structure change appropriately, and manifest as a
charge redistribution within the LaAlO3 layer itself? Thus, it is
again critical to be able to measure these intralayer charge
redistributions.

As mentioned earlier, a direct way to probe the electronic band
structure and charge (localized and delocalized) redistribution
mechanisms is to measure the complex dielectric response of the
material from which the optical conductivity can be extracted in a
broad energy range26–28. Here we use a combination of
spectroscopic ellipsometry and ultraviolet–vacuum ultraviolet
(UV-VUV) reflectivity to probe the intrinsic properties of the
LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface using photon with energies between 0.5
and 35 eV. Owing to a stabilized Kramers–Kronig
transformation29,30, the strength of this experimental approach
allows one to measure the charge transfer of both delocalized and
localized charges accurately using the optical f-sum rule. Since
localized electrons are inaccessible to electrical transport
measurements, but are accessible by photons, we overcome a
severe constraint. In particular, the optical transitions involving
AlO2 sublayer of LaAlO3 is very distinct and well separated from
the ones involving LaO sublayer, so that the internal charge
redistribution within the LaAlO3 sublayers can be clearly identified.
The same is also true for the TiO2 and SrO sublayers of SrTiO3.

Here we show that in conducting LaAlO3/SrTiO3 (4 and 6 uc of
LaAlO3 film on SrTiO3), there is indeed a charge transfer from
LaAlO3 into the interface, and that the amount of charge transfer
is B0.5e� . In the insulating case (2 and 3 uc of LaAlO3 film on
SrTiO3), we surprisingly observe B0.5e� charge redistribution
from AlO2 to LaO sublayers, within the LaAlO3 layers. This
suggests that for the insulating case the polarization catastrophe
could be partly overcome by the above-mentioned charge
redistribution, which may be a consequence of the buckling of
the LaAlO3 lattice.

Results
Structural and transport measurements. LaAlO3/SrTiO3
samples were prepared by growing LaAlO3 film on top of
TiO2-terminated (001) SrTiO3 using pulsed laser deposition12.
The atomic force microscopy (AFM) topography image of the
TiO2-terminated SrTiO3 substrate in Fig. 1a clearly shows the
atomically flat surface with uc steps. Four high-quality samples
with varying thickness of 2, 3, 4 and 6 uc of LaAlO3 film were
prepared as a model interface system for the high-energy optical
studies. The growth of the films was monitored using reflective
high-energy electron diffraction (Fig. 1b). After LaAlO3
deposition, AFM topography measurements show that the
atomically flat surface with uc step and terrace structure of
SrTiO3 is preserved, with surface roughness of B1 Å (see
Fig. 1c,d). This ensures that surface roughness effects do not
adversely affect the optical measurements. Transport
measurements (Fig. 1e), which were taken before and after the

optics measurements, show consistently that 2 and 3 uc samples
are insulating with carrier density and conductivity below the
measurement limit, while 4 and 6 uc ones are conducting with
carrier density of 4–6� 1013 cm� 2 and conductivity of
4–8� 10� 5O� 1, consistent with previous transport results9–11.

The perovskite LaAlO3 uc (Fig. 1f) can be divided into two
sublayers: LaO and AlO2, in which theoretical calculations have
shown that the band structures of these discriminated sublayers
are indeed different19,22, leading to distinct optical transitions. To
accommodate the assignments of these optical transitions, we
define OLa as the O in the LaO plane and OAl as the O in the AlO2
plane. Similarly, SrTiO3 also has similar layered perovskite
structure and thus can also be divided into two sublayers: SrO
and TiO2. Then OSr is defined as O that belongs to SrO sublayer,
while OTi is defined as the one in TiO2. Similarly, the O in the
different planes of SrTiO3 can also lead to distinct optical
transitions. This discrimination is important, as discussed later,
because it can reveal the intra- and interlayer charge transfer
mechanism in LaAlO3/SrTiO3 for both the insulating and
conducting samples.

Spectroscopic ellipsometry and high-energy reflectivity. Our
main observation is the high-energy reflectivity of LaAlO3/SrTiO3
at different thicknesses of LaAlO3 as compared with bulk LaAlO3
and SrTiO3 as shown in Fig. 2a. Note that, because of the
challenge in making optical measurements over such a broad
energy range, in this study we have only measured a selected set
of samples as representative of insulating (2 and 3 uc) and
conducting (4 and 6 uc) LaAlO3/SrTiO3. Thus, further mea-
surements on a larger set of samples may be important in further
deepening our analyses. It can be seen that the reflectivity spectra
of the insulating 2 and 3 uc LaAlO3/SrTiO3 are similar, and the
same is true for the conducting 4 and 6 uc LaAlO3/SrTiO3.
Surprisingly, there are huge differences between reflectivity of
insulating and conducting samples. These differences occur more
significantly at high photon energies, particularly in the energy
ranges of 9–14 eV and 14–21 eV. In the 9–14-eV range, the
reflectivity of conducting samples is lower than insulating sam-
ples, while in the 14–21-eV range the opposite occurs. In contrast,
between 4 and 9 eV, the differences are less, and below 4 eV they
are negligible. This signifies why going beyond conventional (up

to B5 eV) spectroscopic ellipsometry is important. (Note that the
spectroscopic ellipsometry data are crucial for the normalization
of the derived dielectric functions from the reflectivity measure-
ments made up to 35 eV as shown in Supplementary Methods.)
The electronic band structures of the insulating and conducting
LaAlO3/SrTiO3 are very different at high energy, and these dif-
ferences are critical in revealing the true nature of LaAlO3/SrTiO3
interface. Furthermore, since reflectivity and spectroscopic ellip-
sometry are sensitive to unpercolated clusters of charges31, the
similarity of the reflectivity of insulating 2 and 3 uc LaAlO3/
SrTiO3 also implies that there is no evidence of precursor of
percolation effects in the insulating samples, especially the 3 uc
LaAlO3/SrTiO3 (ref. 32).

Discussion
For detailed analysis, we turn our discussion to optical
conductivity, s1, because it fulfils the optical f-sum rule, which

is related to number of charges excited by the photons. For bulk
materials like bulk LaAlO3 and bulk SrTiO3, s1 can be extracted
directly from reflectivity using the Kramers–Kronig analysis29,30.
On the other hand, LaAlO3/SrTiO3 is layered along the o0014
direction (perpendicular to the (001) surface of the sample) owing
to its heterostructure nature as well as the presence of the
conducting layer at LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface. For this reason, the
reflectivity of LaAlO3/SrTiO3 is analysed based on standard
theory of wave propagation in a stratified media33,34. The analysis
naturally leads to a three-layered structure for the conducting
LaAlO3/SrTiO3: LaAlO3 film layer on top, bulk SrTiO3 substrate
at the bottom and an interface layer sandwiched in between,
representing the 2DEG of the conducting samples.

A self-consistent iteration procedure is used to extract the
thickness and dielectric function of each layer, and as long as the
iteration is convergent, the starting assumption of these
parameters should have little effect, if any, on the final obtained
values (see Supplementary Methods for details). From the
analysis, it is found that the thickness of this interface layer is
B5 nm, consistent with previous observation using hard XPS5,
cross-sectional conducting tip AFM35 and the upper limit for the
superconducting layer thickness of LaAlO3/SrTiO3 (ref. 10). This
result also suggests that the high-energy reflectivity can be used to
measure the thickness of interface layer. For insulating LaAlO3/
SrTiO3, the analysis naturally converges into an effective two-
layered structure instead. This means for insulating LaAlO3/
SrTiO3 the s1 at interface is very similar to that of bulk SrTiO3 as
discussed later. This can be easily understood owing to the
absence of the conducting interface layer.

Now, s1 of each individual layer can be extracted separately, so
that we can analyse the concomitant evolution of each individual
layer of LaAlO3/SrTiO3 as the interface changes from insulating
to conducting. Spectra of s1 for each layer are shown in Fig. 2b,c.
It should be noted that the plots for 2 and 3 uc LaAlO3/SrTiO3 are
the same owing to the nature of the iteration process (see
Supplementary Methods), and the same is true for the 4 and 6 uc
LaAlO3/SrTiO3.

For LaAlO3, one can, based on band structure calculations36,37,
divide s1 into three main optical regions, while s1 of SrTiO3 can
be divided into five main optical regions38–40. Every transition is
unique and originates from different orbitals in each layer and
sublayer, and these are summarized in Table 1. Furthermore, the
polarization of the incident light is also taken into account in
assigning the optical transitions. Since the incident light is linearly
polarized parallel to the sample surface, the majority of the optical
transitions occur in the in-plane direction within each sublayer,
allowing us to study spectral weight transfers between the
different sublayers. For example, in A1 region of LaAlO3, the
transition is from OLa-2p to La-4d, 5f, both of which reside within
the LaO sublayer of LaAlO3. The other transitions also follow this
convention.

Figure 2b shows that s1 of LaAlO3 film of insulating and
conducting LaAlO3/SrTiO3 is dramatically different as compared
with bulk LaAlO3. Particularly, s1 in A1 region of LaAlO3 film in
the insulating samples is higher than the bulk value, while for the
conducting samples it is lower. Meanwhile, the reverse is true in
A2 region. It is very clear that there are spectral weight transfers
occurring between these three regions when the thickness of
LaAlO3 film increases and the interface goes from insulating to
conducting state.

It can be seen (Fig. 2c) that s1 of the interface layer to a
significant extent resembles s1 of the bulk SrTiO3. This indicates
that the electronic interface layer is SrTiO3-like, and that the
conducting layer mostly resides in SrTiO3 side rather than
LaAlO3. The most significant change in s1 happens at B3 region
when the interface becomes conducting. In bulk SrTiO3, that

the nature of the iteration analysis used to extract s1 from reflectivity, and
the same is true for the 4 and 6 uc LaAlO3/SrTiO3. The s1 plots are divided
into several energy regions, A1–A3 for LaAlO3 and B1–B5 for SrTiO3 and the

interface. The regions are defined based on the distinct optical transitions

associated with it, which in turn is based on theoretical calculations and

previous reflectivity and valence electron energy loss spectroscopy36–40.

region corresponds to a valley with no main optical transition.
Interestingly, for the conducting samples a completely new peak
emerges in that region. This implies that when the interface
becomes conducting, a new characteristic interface state emerges
representing the presence of the 2DEG. According to previous
reports3–7,17,19,22, the 2DEG resides in the Ti-3d-t2g state of
SrTiO3, so this new interface state should also have Ti-3d-t2g
characteristic. Thus, based on the optical selection rules, the
optical transition at B3 region may be assigned to originate from
this new interface state to unoccupied states of higher O orbitals
(see Table 1). One should note that the s1 spectra of the interface
layer of conducting LaAlO3/SrTiO3 does not show Drude
response, consistent with previous infrared spectroscopic
ellipsometry experiment41.

The s1 analysis is very important because it can be linked to
the effective number of electrons associated with a particular
optical transition, N, using partial f-sum rule,

N
V
¼ 4m

he2

Z E2
E1

s1ðEÞdE; ð1Þ

where e is the elementary charge, m is the electron mass and V is
the unit volume. The E1 and E2 indicate the energy boundaries of
that particular transition in the s1 plot. We then define neff as the
N of each layer relative to either bulk LaAlO3 (for LaAlO3 film) or
bulk SrTiO3 (for interface layer) values. The advantage of this
definition is that any changes in N in LaAlO3 film or the interface
layer can be distinguished from the bulk properties.

In LaAlO3/SrTiO3 (and thin films in general), the thickness of
the LaAlO3 film and interface layer is finite, so neff distributes
over this finite thickness. If we assume that the distribution is
uniform over each uc, the neff per uc, nuc, can be defined such that

neff ¼
Z d

0
nucdx ¼ nucd; ð2Þ

where d is the thickness in uc. In this case, the unit volume V
becomes the volume occupied by each sublayer (LaO and AlO2
for LaAlO3 and SrO and TiO2 for SrTiO3), so that the unit of nuc
is the number of charge per sublayer. Thus, neff, which is the total
amount of charge redistribution and transfer corresponding to a
particular optical transition, can be obtained by integrating nuc

over the layer thickness, as shown in Fig. 3. (The procedure to
obtain neff is further explained in Methods).

We start our discussion with insulating samples. As shown
in Fig. 3a, neff of A1 region of LaAlO3 film increases by B0.5e� ,
while for A2 region it decreases, also by B0.5e� . The net
amount of the charge transfer in LaAlO3 film is thus (þ 0.5e� )
þ (� 0.5e� )¼ 0. This indicates a redistribution of B0.5e�
from OAl-2p (AlO2 sublayer) to OLa-2p (LaO sublayer), as
shown in Table 1. On the basis of f-sum rule, this directly implies
that there is no net charge transfer into the LaAlO3/SrTiO3
interface. As a result, the LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface remains
insulating. Since the LaAlO3 film (and the system as a whole)
remains insulating, the B0.5e� charge redistribution does not
result in the creation of electrons and holes in the LaO and AlO2
sublayers but rather an increase of covalence between the LaO
and AlO2 sublayers, leading to the measured charge
redistribution.

One way to interpret these data is by considering that the
charge redistribution is uniform for all LaAlO3 layers. In this case,
the covalence of AlO2 becomes modified from � 1 to � (1� nuc)
and the covalence of LaO from þ 1 to þ (1� nuc) (Fig. 4a). The
nuc is B0.25e� � 0.3e� for the 2 uc LaAlO3/SrTiO3, and
B0.17e� � 0.2e� for the 3 uc LaAlO3/SrTiO3 (see Methods).
This charge redistribution within the LaAlO3 sublayers (electro-
nic reconstruction2) can thus help to decrease the potential build-
up in the LaAlO3 film and partially compensate the polarization
catastrophe. Combined with ionic reconstruction mechanisms
such as the buckling and ionic relaxations effects predicted22,23

LaAlO3/SrTiO3 as a characteristic of the two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG), which includes
the newly occupied Ti-3d-t2g states.

and observed earlier using surface X-ray diffraction24,25 and
second harmonic generation32, what we are measuring in terms
of charge redistribution may arise from such a mechanism.

Another possible scenario that can be considered to interpret
the data is that, instead of involving the whole LaAlO3 layers, the
charge redistribution only happens at the topmost (that is,
surface) LaAlO3 layer. In this case, the covalence of surface AlO2
becomes modified from � 1 to � 0.5 and the covalence of surface
LaO from þ 1 to þ 0.5, but the deeper LaAlO3 layer remains
unchanged, since the charge redistribution is confined only in the
surface (that is, surface reconstruction). In this scenario, the
surface charge redistribution is still able to partially compensate
the polarization catastrophe, but it is in less of an agreement with
the buckling effects, since the buckling was observed experimen-
tally, and supported by theoretical calculations22–25, to affect the
whole LaAlO3 film, and not only the surface.

On the other hand, for conducting samples we observe a
different phenomenon. The neff of both A1 and A2 regions of
LaAlO3 film decreases (Fig. 3a). For A1 region it decreases by
B0.3e� � 0.4e� , while for A2 region it decreases by B0.2e� ,
leading to an overall B0.5e� decrease of neff in the LaAlO3 film.
At the same time, for the interface layer the most significant
change that happens when LaAlO3/SrTiO3 becomes conducting is
the increase of neff of B3 region by B0.5e� (Fig. 3b). The total
charge transfer within the whole LaAlO3/SrTiO3 sample is thus
again 0, with the decrease of B0.5e� in LaAlO3 film
compensated by the increase of B0.5e� at the interface. On
the basis of f-sum rule, this clearly indicates that there is a charge
transfer of B0.5e� from the LaAlO3 film into the interface to
form the 2DEG (Fig. 4b), consistent with the polarization
catastrophe model15,16. On the basis of the definition of neff,
this B0.5e� extra charge at the interface is distributed over the
B5 nm thickness of the interface (which mostly resides in the
SrTiO3 side).

Moreover, it can be seen from Fig. 2c that the B3 peak, which
involves the transition from the new interface state that contains
this B0.5e� extra charge, is very broad (B4 eV wide), which
means that the B0.5e� is distributed over a rather wide energy
range. This may be one of the reasons why transport experiments
can only measure a fraction of this B0.5e� , since only a small
portion of the charge is delocalized and thus able to contribute to
electrical conductivity.

Furthermore, Fig. 3b also shows that the neff of B1 and B5
regions, both of which involve transitions into the unoccupied
Ti-3d-t2g states, decrease by B0.05e� (that is, B10% of 0.5e� ).
This implies that the new interface state of conducting LaAlO3/
SrTiO3 has Ti-3d-t2g characteristic3–7,17,19,22, so the extra
B0.5e� also partially fills the previously unoccupied Ti-3d-t2g
state of SrTiO3. This decrease is consistent with previous
observations using X-ray absorption spectroscopy experi-
ments3,6. In X-ray absorption spectroscopy at Ti-L3,2 edges of
conducting LaAlO3/SrTiO3, the excitation to the unoccupied
Ti-3d-t2g states also decreases compared with bulk SrTiO3.
Intriguingly, these decreases are much smaller if one assumes that
all of the B0.5e� extra charge partially fills the Ti-3d-t2g-
unoccupied density of state (DOS). This is because, based on this
assumption, one would expect to observe the decrease of
Ti-3d-t2g-unoccupied DOS (and thus the neff of B1 and B5
regions) in conducting LaAlO3/SrTiO3 also by an equivalent of
B0.5e� . However, this is not the case, which implies that the
B0.5e� extra charge contained within the new interface state
does not only reduce the number of unoccupied Ti-3d DOS, but
surprisingly also other states at even higher energies, implying the
importance of strong correlations and hybridizations effects in
explaining the interlayer charge transfer in conducting LaAlO3/
SrTiO3 (refs 26,42,43).

Another interesting observation to note is that in the
conducting samples, the neff of A3 region of LaAlO3 film also

our results it is distributed over the B5 nm thickness on the interface. To ensure charge conservation, one of the upper layers of LaAlO3 (that is, in the dot-
signed region above the depicted third layer of LaAlO3) should have AlO2 sublayer with valence state of (AlO2)

0.5� instead of (AlO2)� .

decreases by B0.2e� . The transition in this region corresponds
to O-2s state, which is strongly localized and directly corresponds
to the availability of oxygen in the LaAlO3 film. Thus, the
decrease of O-2s DOS can indicate the presence of oxygen
vacancies in the LaAlO3 film of the conducting samples. For 4 uc
LaAlO3/SrTiO3, there are 24e� in O-2s state of LaAlO3; thus,
the B0.2e� decrease is equivalent to B1% oxygen vacancy.
This is interesting because it has been suggested that the presence
of oxygen vacancies in LaAlO3 film may enhance the charge
transfer from LaAlO3 film into LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface7,44,45.
Because of the charge transfer into the interface, the LaAlO3 film
lacks B0.5e� (that is, has additional B0.5 holes), so the extra
e� created by the oxygen vacancy may partially compensate
these holes and stabilize the charge transfer. Interestingly, in
insulating LaAlO3/SrTiO3, this oxygen vacancies signature is not
observed.

It is noteworthy to reconcile our results with photoconductivity
effects observed in LaAlO3/SrTiO3. Previous transport results46,47

have shown that when LaAlO3/SrTiO3 was illuminated by
photons with energies higher than the SrTiO3 bandgap, its
conductivity could increase because of the presence of photo-
generated carriers. On the basis of hard XPS data5, the amount of
these photo-generated carriers is estimated to be 2.1� 1013 cm� 2
(B0.03e� ), which is much smaller than the number of e�

contributed to the charge transfer and charge redistributions
observed in our results (B0.5e� ). Thus, the photoconductivity
effects might only influence the estimated neff by B6%, and do
not affect our analysis adversely.

Recent observations have also indicated that the cationic
stoichiometry, for example, the La/Al ratio in LaAlO3 film, may
affect the electrical properties of LaAlO3/SrTiO3 (refs 18,48,49).
How this cationic stoichiometric effects would influence the high-
energy optical conductivity of insulating and conducting LaAlO3/
SrTiO3 is an important open question. Thus, its interplay with the
charge transfer and redistribution phenomena as observed in
high-energy optical conductivity still remains to be answered.

In summary, we have shown that high-energy reflectivity and
spectroscopic ellipsometry studies of LaAlO3/SrTiO3 have
revealed significant differences between the charge redistribution
of insulating (2 and 3 uc of LaAlO3) and charge transfer
mechanisms of conducting (4 and 6 uc of LaAlO3) LaAlO3/
SrTiO3. In insulating LaAlO3/SrTiO3, B0.5e� charge

redistribution is observed between the AlO2 and LaO sublayers
and partially compensates the polarization catastrophe. In the
conducting samples, B0.5e� is measured to be transferred from
LaAlO3 film into the interface, which is consistent with the
polarization catastrophe model. We believe that this study reveals
the nature of the intra- and interlayer charge redistributions and
charge transfers in LaAlO3/SrTiO3, and hence opens a path to
understand the various electronic reconstructions involving the
interfaces of complex oxides heterostructures. Furthermore, the
use of high-energy reflectivity coupled with spectroscopic
ellipsometry could be extended to other similar polar and
nonpolar oxide interface systems.

Methods
Sample preparation. LaAlO3/SrTiO3 samples were prepared by growing LaAlO3
film on top of (001) SrTiO3 substrates obtained from Crystec using pulsed laser
deposition12. Before the growth, the SrTiO3 substrates were treated using HF and
are annealed at 950 �C for 2 h in O2 flow to achieve the desired TiO2 surface
termination50. The AFM topography image of the TiO2-terminated SrTiO3
substrate in Fig. 1a clearly shows the atomically flat surface with uc steps. The
growth target was LaAlO3 single crystal, also obtained from Crystec. The
deposition pressure was 10� 3 Torr, with background pressure of 10� 9 Torr.
The deposition temperature was 750 �C, with cooling rate of 10 �C min� 1 at the
deposition pressure. The laser pulse frequency was 1 Hz. Four samples with varying
thickness of 2, 3, 4 and 6 uc of LaAlO3 film were made, as monitored using
reflective high-energy electron diffraction (Fig. 1b). After LaAlO3 deposition, AFM
topography measurements show that the atomically flat surface with uc step and
terrace structure of SrTiO3 is preserved, with surface roughness of B1 Å (see
Fig. 1c,d).

Optics measurements. The optical conductivity were obtained using a combi-
nation of spectroscopic ellipsometry (0.5–5.6 eV) and UV–VUV reflectivity (3.7–
35 eV) measurements26–28. The details of the optical measurements are as follow.
The spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements were performed in the spectral range
between 0.5 and 5.6 eV by using an SE 850 ellipsometer at room temperature51.
Three different incident angles of 60�, 70� and 80� from the sample normal were
used, and the incident light was 45� linearly polarized from the plane of incident.
For reflectivity measurements in the high-energy range between 3.7 and 35 eV, we
used the SUPERLUMI beamline at the DORIS storage ring of HASYLAB
(DESY)52. The incoming photon was incident at the angle of 17.5� from the sample
normal with linear polarization parallel to the sample surface. The sample chamber
was outfitted with a gold mesh to measure the incident photon flux after the slit of
the monochromator. The measurements were performed in ultrahigh vacuum
environment (chamber pressure of 5� 10� 10 mbar) at room temperature. before
these measurements, the samples were heated up to 400 K in ultrahigh vacuum to
ensure that there was no additional adsorbate layers on the surface of the samples.
The obtained UV–VUV reflectivity data were calibrated by comparing it with the

luminescence yield of sodium salicylate (NaC7H5O3) and the gold mesh current.
These as-measured UV–VUV reflectivity data were further normalized by using
the self-normalized reflectivity extracted from spectroscopic ellipsometry34,51, and
the two normalized data were appended to obtain the combined reflectivity from
0.5 to 35 eV (see Supplementary Fig. 1).

Analysis of optics data. Both the spectroscopic ellipsometry and the combined
reflectivity data were analysed using a combination of the Drude–Lorentz oscillator
multilayer fitting33,34 and self-consistent iteration method (see Supplementary
Methods). Owing to its multilayered nature, the LaAlO3/SrTiO3 samples, especially
the conducting cases, are considered to have the following three layers: the LaAlO3
film on top, the SrTiO3 substrate at the bottom and the interface layer in between
(see Supplementary Fig. 2), consistent with previous observation using cross-
sectional conducting tip AFM35. Since the spectroscopic ellipsometry data were
taken at three different incident angles of 60�, 70� and 80�, it was fitted using angle-
dependent iteration method (see Supplementary Methods), and the fitting results
are shown in Supplementary Figs 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7. Supplementary Figure 4 also
shows that the thickness of the conducting interface layer is B5 nm, consistent
with previous observations5,10,35. Furthermore, from these variable angle
spectroscopic ellipsometry results, the absence of absorbate layer and the absence
of significant anisotropy can also be inferred. On the other hand, the normalized
UV–VUV reflectivity data were fitted using thickness-dependent iteration method
(see Supplementary Methods), and the results of the fitting are shown in
Supplementary Fig. 8.

Complex dielectric function of LaAlO3/SrTiO3. From the analysis described
above, the complex dielectric function, e(o), of each layer of LaAlO3/SrTiO3 can be
extracted from the high-energy reflectivity of LaAlO3/SrTiO3 (Fig. 2a), as presented
in Fig. 5. In turn, this e(o) can be converted into optical conductivity s1 using
s1(o)¼ e0e2(o)o, as presented in Fig. 2b,c. In Fig. 5a,b, it can be seen that the e(o)
of the LaAlO3 film layer for both insulating and conducting LaAlO3/SrTiO3 is very
different than that of bulk LaAlO3, which shows that the band structure of LaAlO3
film is very different than bulk LaAlO3. Meanwhile, the e(o) at the interface of the
insulating samples (2 and 3 uc LaAlO3/SrTiO3, see Fig. 5c) is very similar to that of
bulk SrTiO3, which can be explained by the absence of the 2DEG in the insulating
samples. Interestingly, for the conducting samples (4 and 6 uc LaAlO3/SrTiO3, see
Fig. 5d) there are new features around 8–12 eV for e1 and 11–16 eV for e2, which,
on further analysis (see Discussions), are related to the presence of the conducting
interface in those sample.

Estimation of charge transfer and redistribution. From equations (1) and (2),
we can extract the nuc, which is the amount of charge redistribution and transfer
per uc associated with a particular optical transition relative to the bulk values. To
get the accurate number, we need to carefully consider within what volume V in the
uc the electrons reside. Both LaAlO3 and SrTiO3 crystal structures can be thought
of as an alternating layer structure. LaAlO3 consists of alternating polar (LaO)þ

and (AlO2)� sublayers, while SrTiO3 consists of alternating nonpolar SrO and
TiO2 sublayers (see Figs 1d and 4). Owing to this layered structure, in a first
approximation each cation (La and Al for LaAlO3, Sr and Ti for SrTiO3) only
occupies a volume of half uc (instead of the full one uc). For example, the La of
LaAlO3 has to share the space of one uc with Al (with each getting half), and
similarly the Sr of SrTiO3 has to share with Ti. Furthermore, for LaAlO3, the
valence electrons of the O atoms that belong to the two different sublayers (LaO
and AlO2) contribute to two different optical transitions in the s1 spectra (Fig. 2b

and Table 1). For simplicity, OLa is defined as the O in the LaO plane and OAl as
the O in the AlO2 plane. Thus, OLa also has to share the space of one uc with OAl,
with each getting the space of half uc. The same is true for SrTiO3, where the OSr in
the SrO plane also has to share the space of one uc with the OTi in the TiO2 plane.
This implies that the valence electrons belonging to the different ions can also be
approximated to reside in a volume of half uc. For this reason, to obtain the nuc the
volume V is chosen to be the volume of half uc of LaAlO3 (lattice constant
a0¼ 3.81 Å) or SrTiO3 (a0¼ 3.905 Å), whichever applicable. This consideration
makes the unit of nuc to be the number of charge per sublayer. The result for this
nuc estimation is shown in Fig. 6. For 2 uc LaAlO3/SrTiO3, the nuc is B0.25e�

� 0.3e� , while for 3 uc LaAlO3/SrTiO3, the nuc is B0.17e� � 0.2e� . Then, the
neff, which is the total amount of charge redistribution and transfer corresponding
to a particular optical transition can be obtained by integrating nuc over the layer
thickness, as shown in Fig. 3.

The error bars in Figs 3 and 6 are estimated as follows. It is assumed that there
are two main sources of random errors in the data: from the resolution limitation
of the optics measurements (estimated to be B2%) and from the errors introduced
in the normalization process (estimated to be B5%). These errors affect the
reflectivity data (that is, DR), and to obtain the corresponding errors for s1 (Ds)
and thus neff, the errors are propagated using

LaAlO3 band structure calculation. Unlike SrTiO3 that has been studied very
thoroughly38–40, previous reports that study the band structure and high photon-
energy properties of LaAlO3 in a detailed and comprehensive manner remain quite
scarce36,37. Because of this, we performed our own band structure calculation of
LaAlO3 to complement those previous studies. The results can be used as a tool to
determine the high photon-energy optical transition assignments of LaAlO3, as
listed in Table 1.

The details of the calculation are as follows. Cubic LaAlO3 has a space group
of Pm3m with an experimental lattice parameters of a¼ b¼ c¼ 3.8106 Å at 821 K
(ref. 53). The calculations were performed using CASTEP code54. Geometry
optimization had been carried out with local density approximation functional
using cutoff energy of 1,500 eV and a 15� 15� 15 Monkhorst–Pack grid55 that
corresponds to 120 k-points in the irreducible Brillouin zone. The cutoff energy
and k-point mesh had been tested and converged to energy differences of
1� 10� 5 and 4� 10� 5 eV per atom, respectively. Ultrasoft pseudopotentials
were generated ‘on the fly’ with valence states 4f, 5s, 5p, 5d, 6s for La, 3s, 3p for Al
and 2s, 2p for O. The electronic minimization method used for the self-consistent
field calculation was density mixing56 with a self-consistent field tolerance of
2.0� 10� 6 eV per atom. The geometry optimization was carried out by the
Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno algorithm57 with energy, force and
displacement tolerances of 5.0� 10� 6 eV per atom, 1.0� 10� 2 eV Å� 1 and
5.0� 10� 4 Å, respectively. The optimized lattice parameter was found out to be
3.73 Å. Converged DOS calculation was carried out with a k-mesh of 20� 20� 20
and consistent with previous calculations36,37. The calculation results are
displayed in Fig. 7.
