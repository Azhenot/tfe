Empirical Research Paper

Names matter. At least Demetria Guynes, Steveland Judkins, 
Archibald Leach, and Marion Morrison thought so. Readers 
of this article will probably better know them as Demi 
Moore, Stevie Wonder, Cary Grant, and John Wayne. And 
early in the year 2016, opponents of Donald Trump’s candi-
dacy for president of the United States, based on their belief 
that it would undermine his popularity, made an effort to 
publicize the original version of his surname (changed centu-
ries ago by his ancestors): “Drumpf.” Concerns with names 
and whether they should be changed are certainly not 
restricted to celebrities. In 2011, approximately 58,000 peo-
ple in the United Kingdom had their names legally changed 
(McClatchey, 2011).

Evidence for the idea that personal names matter—that is, 
that they have effects on how people are perceived and treated 
by others—is more than anecdotal (for reviews of the empiri-
cal literature, see Christopher, 1998; Joubert, 1993; Lawson, 
1984). For example, Harari and McDavid (1973) found that 
identical essays received significantly different grades from 
teachers depending on whether they were attributed to chil-
dren with what were at the time popular, evaluatively favor-
able names (e.g., “Karen,” “Lisa”), or to children with less 
desirable names (e.g., “Bertha,” “Adelle”). In a study by 
Garwood, Sulzer, Levine, Cox, and Kaplan (1983), partici-
pants’ decisions about whether people described in vignettes 
should be rewarded or punished were significantly affected 
by the desirability of those people’s names. Bruning and Husa 
(1972) found that even elementary school students had 

different behavioral expectations for people as a function of 
whether they had names with “active” (e.g., “Otto,” “Bruno”) 
or “passive” (e.g., “Alfred,” “Milton”) connotations. And 
research by Topolinski, Maschmann, Pecher, and Winkielman 
(2014) indicates that subtle differences in the movement of 
the tongue and lips as one articulates a person’s name can 
influence one’s attitude toward that person.

Names and their connotations thus matter for people in 
their daily interactions (and even long-term outcomes; see 
Anderson & Schmitt, 1990; Zwebner, Sellier, Rosenfeld, 
Goldenberg, & Mayo, 2017). But they are also an issue of 
concern for experimental psychologists. Social psycholo-
gists (and other behavioral scientists—see Evans et al., 2015; 
Hughes, 1998; O’Dell, Crafter, de Abreu, & Cline, 2012) 
often test their hypotheses by constructing vignettes (usually, 
but not always, written) depicting people possessing charac-
teristics and engaging in behavior designed to operationalize 
variables of interest to them. Very often the people described

Abstract
Psychologists often test hypotheses by constructing vignettes depicting people engaging in behavior and displaying 
characteristics designed to operationalize specific variables. People described in these vignettes are typically given names, but 
names have a variety of connotations that could lead to unwanted variance between conditions of an experiment and in other 
ways have implications for the results of a study. An up-to-date source of information to help guide the selection of names 
would be useful for researchers. Participants from four different regions of the United States rated a large sample of names in 
terms of perceived age, warmth, and competence. The full set of names is presented, along with some simple demonstration 
studies concretely illustrating the implications of name choice.

in these vignettes are given names; if the vignette involves 
more than one character, doing so is especially important so 
that research participants can more easily follow the narra-
tive. These names can be selected at random, or for idiosyn-
cratic reasons. A researcher presenting a story about a person 
engaging in a series of evaluatively ambiguous behaviors for 
the purposes of testing trait priming effects might name the 
protagonist “Donald” (Higgins, Rholes, & Jones, 1977; Srull 
& Wyer, 1979). Another researcher interested in the biasing 
effects of stereotypes on memory might give the central 
character in the vignette presented to participants the name 
“Betty” (Snyder & Uranowitz, 1978). The first author of this 
article once created a series of vignettes populated entirely 
with the names of his graduate school classmates (Newman, 
Duff, & Baumeister, 1997, Appendices A and B).

However, the specific names selected for characters in 
vignettes could have implications for the results of one’s 
studies. Researchers, of course, know this intuitively. For 
example, their vignettes rarely if ever include highly 
unusual, low frequency names. In addition, unless an inves-
tigation focuses specifically on stereotyping, prejudice, or 
discrimination, names strongly associated with specific 
national, ethnic, or racial groups (e.g., “Carlos Ramirez”—
Bodenhausen & Wyer, 1985) are also avoided. Such intu-
itions are well-founded. Perhaps the most well-known 
empirical demonstration of the consequences of name selec-
tion was Kasof’s (1993) analysis of the materials used in 
hundreds of studies of sexism. He found a tendency to select 
“male names that were more attractive, more youthful, and 
more intellectually competent in their connotations than 
were the female names with which researchers contrasted 
them” (p. 148). For example, of the 340 studies he reviewed, 
there were 204 cases in which a “younger” male name was 
paired with an “older” female name; the number of times 
that an older male name was paired with a younger female 
name was 15. In addition, these naming biases systemati-
cally covaried with the outcomes of such studies. Overall, 
the name confounds Kasof (1993) revealed threatened the 
internal validity of not just individual studies but an entire 
program of research.

Other lines of research could be prone to similar threats to 
validity, such as those consisting of correspondence audit 
studies (e.g., Bertrand & Mullainathan, 2014; Gaddis, 2015, 
2017; Pager, 2007). Such studies might involve sending 
almost-identical job applications to multiple employers, 
varying only in the name of the applicants. Manipulations of 
the names’ gender, ethnicity, and race could also be con-
founded with those names’ other connotations.

Kasof’s (1993) article included more than a critical analy-
sis of prior research. He also made a contribution to subse-
quent research by presenting a set of age-matched names 
along with data on those names’ perceived attractiveness and 
competence (see his Appendix B and Tables 4 and 5). Kasof 
suggested that researchers could consult his list of names 
when designing their own studies. By carefully selecting 

names from among those he provided, one could perhaps 
avoid the confounds that plagued sexism research.

Quite a few researchers have utilized Kasof’s name 
data—and they continue to do so (e.g., Brown & Diekman, 
2013; Gerhardstein & Anderson, 2010; Greitemeyer, 2009; 
Rosette & Tost, 2010; Ruthig & Holfeld, 2016; Schneider, 
2014; Uhlmann & Zhu, 2014; Weine, Kim, & Lincoln, 2016). 
Note, though, that Kasof’s norms were established close to 
25 years ago; he himself pointed out that “because of histori-
cal variation in forename attractiveness and connotation, the 
name pairs that survived this statistical selection will surely 
become mismatched at some future time” (p. 153). Hence, 
continued use of Kasof’s names for experimental vignettes 
would seem to be in violation of the spirit of his work. In 
fact, close inspection of the specific names and how they 
were classified reveals many of them to be quite outdated. 
The name “Linda,” for example, is said to be a “younger 
adult” name. A search of Syracuse University’s online direc-
tory (on March 2, 2017) revealed only five undergraduate 
women with that name, compared with 28 faculty and staff 
members. Similarly, only four undergraduate students had 
the first name “Gary” (also classified as “younger adult” by 
Kasof), compared with 23 faculty and staff members. By 
way of comparison, a search of the directory revealed 28 
undergraduate women with the name “Kelsey,” compared 
with one solitary staff member. And although the online 
directory revealed that there was just one faculty member at 
the institution with the first name “Dylan,” after listing 50 
Dylans from among the students, it could only display the 
following message: “The maximum number of results 
allowed has been exceeded. Please refine your search.”

It is the nature of such norms to become outdated. As just 
one more example, although Kasof (1993) identified the 
name “Anne” as being an “older adult” name, 30 years ear-
lier, most research participants in a study by Sheppard (1963) 
assumed that Anne was a young woman. Thus, the primary 
goal of this article is to provide an up to date and extensive 
database of names and their connotations. As already noted, 
Kasof (1993) focused not just on ages associated with first 
names but also on how the names were rated in terms of 
competence and attractiveness. The current investigation 
also included perceptions of competence. But given the 
major role that the dimensions of competence and warmth 
have played and continue to play in research and theory in 
the area of impression formation (see Fiske, Cuddy, & Glick, 
2007; Judd, James-Hawkins, Yzerbyt, & Kashima, 2005; 
Rosenberg, Nelson, & Vivekananthan, 1968), we measured 
perceptions of warmth rather than general attractiveness.

A strength of this study is that participants were recruited 
from four different geographical regions of the United States. 
The purpose of this data collection plan was to help ensure 
that our results would not just reflect local idiosyncrasies (cf. 
Buchanan & Bruning, 1971, who published an earlier list of 
name connotations based entirely on a sample of participants 
from Ohio).



Newman et al. 3

A second goal of the article is to provide evidence for the 
validity of the name norms by providing some simple empir-
ical demonstrations of the consequences of using names that 
vary along the measured dimensions. Study 2 provides that 
evidence.

Study 1

Method

Participants. Participants (n = 497) were recruited in late 
2015 and early 2016 from four different study sites. One 
hundred thirty-four college students were recruited from 
Syracuse University (in the Northeastern United States), 154 
from Mississippi State University (in the South), 71 from 
Dominican University (the Midwest), and 138 from Cerritos 
College (the West Coast). Students volunteered or received 
course credit for their participation at each respective site.

Materials. Names were extracted from the Social Security 
database for our use (https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/baby-
names). All the names in the database are from Social Secu-
rity card applications for births that occurred in the United 
States between 1879 and the end of February 2015 (exclud-
ing people born before 1937 who never applied for a Social 
Security card, and those who applied without indicating the 
place of birth).

For the purpose of the current research, we assembled, 
from the Social Security database, names of people born in 
the six decades between the 1950s (1950-1959) and the 
aughts (2000-2009). This range covers names of people who 
would now be as old as 67 or so years of age and as young as 
8 years old. Using the ranking information provided by the 
Social Security website,1 we identified the top 200 most pop-
ular names for each decade (the Top 200 list). Then, to select 
a manageable number of names in a systematic way (and to 
include both relatively common and relatively uncommon 
names), we identified the top 20 most common male and 
female names, and also names with position numbers 91 to 
110 and 181 to 200 in the Top 200 list for each decade. As a 
result, we were left with 120 representative names from the 
Top 200 list (60 male names and 60 female names) for each 
of the six decades.

Because the popularity of some names remained some-
what consistent across the six decades, a number of names 
overlapped across the six lists. For example, “William” was 
ranked 6, 7, 9, 15, 18, 10, respectively, in each of the six 
decades. When combining the six lists of 120 popular names, 
we retained only one copy of each name that appeared in one 
or more of our lists. This procedure yielded a list of 485 
uniquely spelled names (233 male names and 252 female 
names). In this list, there were a number of cases of alternate 
spellings of names that, in the judgment of the authors, would 
not have been considered by participants to be distinct in any 
meaningful way (e.g., “Isabel” vs. “Isabelle,” “Jeffery” vs. 

“Jeffrey,” “Nichole” vs. “Nicole”). We retained only one 
form of spelling for the study in such cases.

The final list consisted of 200 male names and 200 female 
names. To reduce the burden placed on our participants 
(while also trying to ensure that all names would be rated an 
approximately equal number of times), these names were 
then randomly divided within gender into four lists of 50 
names.2 Each participant was randomly assigned to receive 
one of the sets of 50 male names and one of the sets of 50 
female names (100 names total per participant).3

Procedure. The study was run using Qualtrics software, and 
participants completed the study online. Participants were 
asked to complete three rating tasks for the 100 names pre-
sented to them. They provided ratings of perceived age (How 
old do you think he or she is?), competence (How competent 
do you think he or she is?), and warmth (How warm do you 
think he or she is?) for those names. Participants always pro-
vided age ratings for all the names first; the order of the com-
petence and warmth ratings was then randomized between 
participants. Names for each rating task were grouped by 
gender, so that participants rated names for one gender first, 
and then for the other gender. Whether a participant received 
male or female names first was randomized.

Age rating task. Participants were asked to “Imagine that you 
are about to meet FEMALE (or MALE, for the male names) 
individuals with the following names. How old do you think 
she (or he) is when you see the name? Please rate her (or 
him) in terms of age. If you feel uncertain, please use your 
intuition and make your best guess.” For each name, partici-
pants were asked “How old do you think he or she is?” Par-
ticipants were asked to provide ratings on the following 
9-point scale: <12, 12 to 17, 18 to 24, 25 to 34, 35 to 44, 45 
to 54, 55 to 64, 65 to 74, >75. For a given participant, the 
order in which the names were presented was randomized, so 
that no one participant received the names in the same order.

Competence and warmth rating task. After participants com-
pleted the age rating task, they provided ratings of compe-
tence and warmth for the names. First, the concepts of 
“Competence” and “Warmth” were defined for them. Partici-
pants were presented with the following information:

According to research on person perception (Fiske, Cuddy, & 
Glick, 2006), when people form impressions of others, they 
usually evaluate them in terms of two fundamental dimensions: 
competence and warmth. The competence dimension includes 
traits such as clever, competent, creative, efficient, foresighted, 
ingenious, intelligent and knowledgeable. The warmth 
dimension includes traits such as popular, honest, humorous, 
fair, generous, helpful, righteous, sincere, and tolerant.

Participants then began either the competence or warmth 
task, depending on the randomized order. For the competence 
rating task, participants were asked to “Imagine that you are

about to meet FEMALE (or MALE, for the male names) indi-
viduals with the following names. How competent do you 
think she is when you see the name? Please rate her in terms of 
competence. Again, the competence dimension includes traits 
such as clever, competent, creative, efficient, foresighted, 
ingenious, intelligent, and knowledgeable. If you feel uncer-
tain, please use your intuition and make your best guess.” For 
each name, participants were asked “How competent do you 
think she or he is?” Under each question, we reminded partici-
pants of competence’s meaning by restating that “Competence 
= clever, competent, creative, efficient, foresighted, ingenious, 
intelligent, and knowledgeable.” Participants rated compe-
tence on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 = not at all to 5 = 
extremely. Like the age rating task, the order in which a given 
participant rated the names was randomized.

The procedure for the warmth rating task was identical, 
but participants were asked to “Imagine that you are about to 
meet FEMALE (or MALE) individuals with the following 
names. How warm do you think he is when you see the 
name? Please rate him in terms of warmth. Again, the warmth 
dimension includes traits such as popular, honest, humorous, 
fair, generous, helpful, righteous, sincere, and tolerant. If you 
feel uncertain, please use your intuition and make your best 
guess.” For each of the rating question, participants were 
reminded that “Warmth = popular, honest, humorous, fair, 
generous, helpful, righteous, sincere, and tolerant.”

Results and Discussion

Participants with 10 or more missing values (n = 39, less than 
8% of participants) were dropped from analyses so as to 
exclude participants who might not have been putting suffi-
cient effort into the (admittedly laborious) rating task. In 
addition, for 11 participants, there was no variance on one or 
more of the judgment tasks. They were also dropped from 
analyses, leaving a final sample of 447 participants.

Mixed-effects modeling was applied to the data using the 
PROC MIXED procedure in the SAS software package.4 The 
simultaneous nesting of age/warmth/comp (Y

ijk
) responses 

within both raters and target names results in a cross-classified 
data structure described by the following Level 1 (response-
level) equation:

Y rijk jk ijk= +β0 ,

in which rating i provided by rater j evaluating name k is 
comprised of an intercept term that varies across both raters 
and name targets, in addition to a Level 1 residual rijk . Based 
on the standard “slopes as outcomes” formulation (see 
Raudenbush & Bryk, 2001), we decomposed the Level 1 
intercept term into its constituent fixed and random compo-
nents, as described by the following Level 2 equation:

β γ γ0 00 01 0 0jk j ku u= + + +×maletarget ,

where γ
00

 is the fixed component of the intercept, which due 
to our use of an effect-coding scheme for gender (1 = female, 
–1 = male) corresponds to the grand mean rating of Y (age, 
warmth, or competence) across all observations. γ

01
 repre-

sents the average difference between male and female name 
ratings, averaging across all raters. Finally, u

0j
 and u0k repre-

sent the subject-specific random effects (deviations) for rater  
j and target k. More specifically, the u

0j
 term is rater specific, 

in the sense that every participant provided his or her own 
rating representing the participant’s deviation from the grand 
mean (in addition to the fixed-effect of target gender). For 
instance, participants with positive deviations rated all of 
their names as older, warmer, and more competent, averag-
ing across all names. On the contrary, the u

0k
 term is name 

target specific, in the sense that every name target had its 
own rating score representing its deviation from the grand 
mean. Names with positive deviations suggested that those 
names were rated older, warmer, and more competent, aver-
aging across all raters. These subject-specific deviations are 
typically summarized as variances ( τ00j

2
, τ00k
2 ), along with the 

variance of the aforementioned Level 1 residual (σ2), which 
when combined will equal (within rounding) the observed 
marginal variance of all ratings Y

ijk
.

Estimated average ratings of each name (E-B estimates) 
were then calculated based on the following equation:

EB maletarget= + +×γ γ00 01 0u k .

These estimated mean ratings (see Table 1) took into account 
the disagreement between raters (and did not differ substan-
tially from the raw mean ratings).

Reliability. The goal of the initial analyses was to determine 
whether or not participants were able to make the age, 
warmth, and competence judgments with a reasonable degree 
of reliability. Reliability in the current study takes the form 
of a consensus or agreement estimate (see Kenny, 1994, for 
a thorough discussion). According to generalizability theory 
(Cronbach, Gleser, Nanda, & Rajaratnam, 1972; see Raykov 
& Marcoulides, 2010, Chapter 9 for a parallel explanation), 
consensus (reliability of target ratings) was computed using 
the following formula:

ρ
τ

τ τ σ
=

,

which describes the proportion of total variance in ratings 
that is attributable to consensus across participant- 
raters regarding the attributes of specific name targets. In the 
present data, we found moderate consensus across raters 
regarding age, ρ  = 0.31, but lower consensus across raters 
regarding competence, ρ  = 0.05, and warmth, ρ  = 0.04.

To provide other evidence for the meaningfulness of the 
ratings, agreement across the four different data collection

sites (the Northeast, Midwest, South, and West coast) was 
assessed taking a different analytical approach. Within 
each of the four sets of names, pairwise correlations were 
computed for each of the three different ratings (with indi-
vidual names as the unit of analysis). For age ratings, these 
correlations between sites ranged from r = .80 to r = .92, 
with a mean of .88 (calculated after Fisher’s r to z transfor-
mations, and converted back to r). For competence ratings, 
the range was r = .44 to r = .75, with a mean of .58, while 
for warmth ratings, it was r = .40 to r = .69, with a mean of 
.54.5 Parallel analyses run separately for male and female 
names revealed correlations similar to those found for both 
genders combined.

In addition, to provide another estimate of reliability, 
split-half correlations were computed. Within each of the 
four sets of names, participants were randomly assigned to 
two groups, and means for the three ratings were calculated 
for each group. For the age ratings of the names, correlations 
ranged from r = .96 to r = .98. For competence ratings, the 
range was r = .71 to r = .86, while for warmth ratings, it was 
r = .73 to r = .83.

Thus, the fact that consensus on warmth and competence 
was quite limited should not undermine the ratings’ utility. 
The means presented in Table 1 can still serve as a guide to 
how different names will, on average, be perceived in terms 
of those attributes.

Gender differences. There was a slight tendency for the female 
names (M = 4.21) to be rated younger than male names  



Newman et al. 9

(M = 4.42), β = −0.10, SE = 0.05, t(623) = −1.93, p = .054. 
More pronounced was a gender difference in perceived 
warmth; the mean rating for male names was 3.00, but for 
female names, the corresponding figure was 3.12, β = 0.06, 
SE = 0.01, t(400) = 4.53, p < .001 (for a similar finding, see 
Eagly, Mladinic, & Otto, 1991). There were, however, no 
gender differences in ratings of perceived age (p = .014) or 
competence (p = .016) for the names.

Interdimension correlations. As already noted, the full list of 
names was divided into four sets, only one of which was pre-
sented to any given participant. For initial analyses assessing 
the relationships between age, warmth, and competence rat-
ings, the Set variable was dummy-coded (Cohen, Cohen, 
West, & Aiken, 2003). In none of the hierarchical regressions 
run to examine the relationships between the rating dimen-
sions (after centering the continuous variables) were there 
any interactions between predictor variables and the set of 
code variables. Thus, all names were combined into one list 

for an analysis of the interdimension correlations, with 
names as the unit of analysis.

Consistent with the halo effect (Dion, Berscheid, & 
Walster, 1972; Kaplan, 1974; Thorndike, 1920), warmth 
and competence ratings were positively correlated, r = .42, 
p < .001 (see also Suitner & Maass, 2008; Wojciszke & 
Abele, 2008; cf. Imhoff & Koch, 2017; Judd et al., 2005). 
The correlations for male names only (r = .42) and female 
names only (r = .47) were consistent with that relationship. 
Given the positive correlation between the warmth and 
competence dimensions, a number of names were evalu-
ated similarly on both of them. But as might be expected, 
given the modest size of that correlation, a number of names 
elicited relatively positive ratings on one dimension and 
negative ratings on the other. Thus, certain names, for dif-
ferent reasons, can trigger ambivalent reactions. The names 
associated with relatively extreme estimated mean ratings 
on both dimensions (identified by means of quintile splits 
of the distributions) can be found in Table 2. Consistent 
with cross-cultural gender stereotypes (Fiske, 2017), the 
“high-competence, low warmth” pattern is dominated by 
male names, while the “low-competence, high warmth” 
pattern is dominated by female names.6

Consistent with past research on ageism among college 
students (Nelson, 2005; North & Fiske, 2012), a markedly 
negative correlation between perceived age and warmth 
was found, r = –.50, p < .001. The correlations for male 
names only (r = –.54) and female names only (r = –.45) 
were quite similar. Interestingly, perceived age and compe-
tence were positively correlated, r = .28, p < .001, and a 
similar relationship was found when male (r = .30) and 
female (r = .26) names were analyzed separately. This find-
ing is arguably consistent with others in the literature 
revealing ambivalent attitudes about aging; older people 
are often perceived as being relatively wise and honest, 
despite being negatively evaluated in a more general, global 
way (e.g., Chonody, 2016; Mueller-Johnson, Toglia, 
Sweeney, & Ceci, 2007).7

Study 2

The data collected in Study 1 could potentially be of interest 
in and of themselves, but for experimental psychologists, 
they will be of value primarily to the extent that they help 
them control for unwanted variance in their dependent vari-
ables. The goal of Study 2 was to provide a few straightfor-
ward examples of how the names selected by researchers for 
the targets of people’s social judgments could meaningfully 
affect those judgments.

Method

Participants. All hypotheses were tested with t tests (with one 
exception, independent-sample tests); assuming a d = .3 
effect size (between small and medium, but closer to small),

a sample size of 352 would be adequate for .80 power with a 
p < .05 criterion for statistical significance. Three hundred 
seventy-one college students from Syracuse University par-
ticipated in Study 2 in exchange for course credit.

Materials. An online image search yielded headshot photo-
graphs of two people (one man, one woman) whose ages 
were—in the opinion of the first two authors and their 
research assistants—ambiguous (both people could have 
been anywhere from their late 20s to early 50s). We selected 
two male names that were rated in Study 1 to be among those 
associated with the oldest people (“Earl” and “Herbert”) and 
two that were at the other end of the distribution and associ-
ated with younger people (“Dylan” and “Logan”).8 The same 
procedure was followed for female names, resulting in the 
selection of two “old” names (“Maureen” and “Delores”) 
and two young ones (“Abby” and “Isabella”). The ratings for 
these eight names were, on average, 1.9 SDs above or below 
the grand mean for perceived age. The pictures were pre-
sented to participants along with a name prominently appear-
ing at the bottom of the image. To simplify the design (and to 
reduce the possibility that a participant would become suspi-
cious if presented with two names clearly associated with 
much older people), four versions of the age rating materials 
were prepared with these combinations of pictures and names 
(in all cases, one “young” and one “old”): Dylan/Maureen, 
Earl/Isabella, Herbert/Abby, and Logan/Delores. The instruc-
tions to participants were as follows: “Below are photo-
graphs of two people. Please guess how old (in years) each 
one is.” A space was provided for each guess.

The data collected in Study 1 were also used to select 
names that represented relatively extreme levels (both high 
and low) of competence and warmth. For the competence 
rating task, participants were presented with a vignette 
describing the behavior of a female protagonist that was 
written to be ambiguous with respect to the intelligence or 
competence it indicated (see the appendix). They were asked 
to provide intelligence and competence ratings for the pro-
tagonist (in that order), whose name varied. Two female 
names that were rated high on competence in Study 
1—“Elizabeth” and “Olivia”—and two that were rated 
low—“Crystal” and “Mercedes”—were selected for the 
name manipulation (ratings for these four names were, on 
average, 2.0 SDs above or below the grand mean for per-
ceived competence). Ratings were made on 5-point scales (1 
= not at all, 2 = slightly, 3 = somewhat, 4 = very, and 5 = 
extremely).

For the warmth rating task, participants were presented 
with a vignette describing the behavior of a male protagonist 
that was ambiguous with respect to the warmth or hostility it 
indicated; it was a modified version of the well-known 
“Donald” paragraph developed by Srull and Wyer (1979) 
and used by subsequent researchers (see the appendix). They 
were asked to provide warmth and hostility ratings for the 
protagonist (in that order), whose name varied. Two male 

names that were rated high in warmth in Study 1—“Charlie” 
and “Thomas”—and two that were rated low—“Dominic” 
and “Brett”—were selected for the name manipulation (rat-
ings for these four names were, on average, 1.2 SDs above or 
below the grand mean for perceived warmth). Warmth and 
hostility ratings were again made on 5-point scales ranging 
from not at all to extremely.

Procedure. Participants received a booklet that included all 
three tasks. All participants completed the age rating task 
first; whether the booklet they received presented the compe-
tence or warmth rating task next was randomized. A given 
participant’s booklet included one of the following pairs of 
names for the competence and warmth rating tasks: Mer-
cedes/Charlie, Crystal/Thomas, Elizabeth/Dominic, or 
Olivia/Brett. Thus, when a participant’s booklet included a 
name expected to elicit relatively high ratings of warmth, it 
also included a name expected to elicit relatively low ratings 
of competence. Similarly, “hostile” names were paired with 
“competent” names.

Results

Age judgments. Given the study design, each participant was 
presented with one picture of a person with an “older” name, 
and one with a “younger” name. A paired-samples t test 
revealed that people labeled with names associated with 
older people were perceived to be significantly older (39.7 
years) than people labeled with names associated with 
younger people (38.6 years), t(370) = 2.19, p = .029, 95% 
confidence interval (CI) = [0.112, 2.109], d = 0.11.9

Competence/intelligence judgments. Intelligence and compe-
tence ratings were surprisingly uncorrelated, r = .09, p = .10. 
There was also significantly more variance in competence 
(s2 = 0.71) than intelligence (s2 = 0.49) judgments, F(370, 
370) = 1.45, p < .001. Participants might have been uncer-
tain how to define “competence.” Thus, perceived intelli-
gence and perceived competence were analyzed as separate 
dependent variables.

When participants read vignettes about someone with a 
questionable level of intelligence, they were significantly 
more likely to see her as being intelligent when her name was 
one associated by Study 1 participants with intelligence (M = 
3.49) than when her name was one associated by Study 1 
participants with low levels intelligence (M = 3.31), t(369) = 
2.45, p = .013, d = 0.26, 95% CI = [0.038, 0.322]. Although 
the difference was in the same direction, the comparison for 
competence judgments did not reveal a significant difference 
(M = 2.86 vs. M = 2.79, p = .39).

Warmth/hostility judgments. Warmth and hostility ratings were 
negatively correlated, as expected (r = –.24, p < .001). Hostil-
ity ratings were reverse scored; the mean ratings for hostility 
and warmth were then averaged to yield an overall measure

of warmth. When participants read vignettes about someone 
whose behavior was ambiguous with respect to warmth/hos-
tility, they saw him as being warmer when his name was one 
associated by Study 1 participants with warmth (M = 2.57) 
than when his name was one associated by Study 1 partici-
pants with low levels of warmth (M = 2.48). However, in this 
case, the difference did not reach conventional levels of sta-
tistical significance, t(369) = 1.35, p = .18, d = 0.14, 95% CI 
= [–0.045, 0.240]. Post hoc ratings of warmth and hostility 
judgments separately also did not yield significant differences 
(p = .16 and p = .44, respectively).

Discussion

The goal of Study 2 was to provide some preliminary valida-
tion of the data collected in Study 1 by demonstrating how 
the names selected by researchers for the targets of people’s 
social judgments could be associated with variation in those 
judgments. The small sample of names used for the stimulus 
persons in Study 2 were selected simply because they were 
examples of names perceived to be associated with younger 
and older, warmer and less warm, and competent and less 
competent people.

The mean differences were in the predicted direction for 
all three judgment types (age, intelligence, and warmth) and 
were statistically significant in the case of the first two. The 
differences found were modest in magnitude, but there is no 
reason to assume that Study 2’s findings are representative 
of the effect sizes that might be associated with name differ-
ences. Those effect sizes will undoubtedly vary as a function 
of a number of factors, including the complexity and ambi-
guity of the other social information presented to research 
participants. For example, past research indicates that when 
a great deal of additional information is presented along 
with names, names are more likely to have modest effects 
on judgments (O’Sullivan, Chen, Mohapatra, Sigelman, & 
Lewis, 1988; Young, Kennedy, Newhouse, Browne, & 
Thiessen, 1993).10 This could have played a role in the non-
significant effects for warmth judgments (over and above 
the fact that the warm/cold exemplars were not as extreme 
as were those for the other two dimensions); the vignette 
presented for that purpose was over 20% longer than the 
vignette presented for intelligence/competence judgments.

General Discussion

Experimental design, at the most abstract level, is an exercise 
in variance control. Researchers seek to minimize unwanted 
variance between conditions of an experiment, and maximize 
the potential of their independent variables to account for 
variance in their dependent variables. If they are interested in 
the effects of categorizing people as males or females, they 
would like to avoid having the conclusions they reach clouded 
by the consequences of having named a particular target per-
son “Deborah” and another “Duane.” If they are interested in 
the effects on social judgment and impression formation of 

manipulating the kind of behavioral information provided to 
participants, they would prefer that the sizes of their effects 
not be constrained as a result of having named a target person 
“Marcia” or “Grace.” Kasof (1993), among others, has alerted 
experimenters to the consequences of arbitrarily naming 
one’s stimulus persons. Thus, the goal of this investigation 
was to provide researchers an extensive and up to date data-
base of personal names and their connotations.

The naming of stimulus persons could also have implica-
tions for the replicability of research findings. Van Bavel, 
Mende-Siedlecki, Brady, and Reinero (2016) found that the 
replicability of a study is dependent to an extent on the likeli-
hood that the study as it was originally run was context-
dependent—that is, whether the procedure and/or materials 
have the potential to be construed differently by different 
groups of participants as a function of time and place. One of 
the variables that might lead to changes in the construal of 
research materials could be the names of stimulus persons. 
For example, conducting an exact replication of Higgins, 
Rholes, and Jones’s (1977) and Srull and Wyer’s (1979) clas-
sic trait priming studies from the 1970s would require one to 
name the person engaging in the ambiguous behaviors pre-
sented to participants “Donald.” However, a glance at the 
data presented in Study 1 suggests that doing so today could 
be a mistake; it could lead one to find a bias toward negativ-
ity in impression formation that overshadows the priming 
effect. The results of previous research could fail to replicate, 
for reasons having nothing to do with the validity and reli-
ability of the effects in the original studies.

The data presented in this article were collected from par-
ticipants in the United States. The names in Table 1 could of 
course have different connotations elsewhere, including in 
other English speaking countries. Another limitation of this 
research is that although a person’s age, warmth, and compe-
tence are important pieces of information for social perceivers, 
other characteristics have an impact on the impressions formed 
of others, and names could signal people’s standing on some 
of those characteristics too. For example, names can signal 
socioeconomic status (Gaddis, 2015; Joubert, 1994); indeed, it 
is likely that social class inferences played a significant role in 
the competence ratings made by our participants. Slepian and 
Galinsky (2016) found that how names are pronounced—
more specifically, the vocal cord vibrations involved—has 
implications for perceptions of people’s genders. Names 
requiring more vibration of the vocal chords to pronounce are 
associated with males, but those involving unvoiced pho-
nemes (which require no vibration of the vocal chords) are 
more likely to be associated with females. Names surely signal 
other social characteristics as well.

Also unaddressed in this article is the possibility that the 
effects of having specific names could interact with other 
characteristics of the people with those names—for example, 
people’s ethnic or racial identities. There is no reason to 
assume that the consequences of assigning a given name to a 
Black, White, Asian, Latino, or any other kind of target per-
son will be identical.

Finally, the data presented here will ultimately meet the 
same fate as Kasof’s; they will become outdated. However, 
for the foreseeable future, we hope they will be of value to 
experimenters seeking both to avoid confounds in their 
experiments and to maximize the control of unwanted vari-
ance in their outcome variables.

Appendix

Vignettes, Study 2 (With Representative Names)

Ambiguously intelligent/competent. Crystal was late to the 
office yesterday because she forgot to set her alarm the night 
before. But she got right to work, and was one of the first of 
her colleagues to figure out how to use the new software that 
had been installed on everyone’s computers. Unfortunately, 
she had trouble teaching anyone else how to use the soft-
ware—they kept getting confused by her explanations.

Crystal and one of her colleagues then ate lunch together. 
They had to take an extra long lunch break, because the first 
restaurant they went to was closed; Crystal actually knew that 
the place had gone out of business, but she had forgotten. 
Because of that, she had to stay at the office extra hours last 
night to get her work completed. She got it done, though, and 
was able to hand it in to her boss just a few minutes past the 
time it was due today. Later, Crystal left work 25 min early, 
because she had an appointment to meet up with an online 
date for the first time and did not want to get stuck in traffic.

Ambiguously warm/hostile. I ran into my old acquaintance 
Brett the other day, and I decided to go over and visit him, 
since by coincidence we took our vacations at the same time. 
Soon after I arrived, a salesman knocked at the door, but 
Brett didn’t want to talk to him. He also told me that he was 
not going to pay his rent until the landlord does some repairs 
in his apartment. We talked for a while, had lunch, and then 
went out for a ride. We used my car, as Brett’s car had broken 
down that morning, and he told the garage mechanic that he 
would have to go somewhere else if he couldn’t fix his car 
that same day. We went to the park for about an hour and then 
stopped at a hardware store. I couldn’t find what I was look-
ing for, but Brett suggested we walk a few blocks to another 
store. The Red Cross had set up a stand by the door and asked 
us to donate blood. Brett hates giving blood, and he got out 
of it by claiming he had diabetes and therefore could not 
donate. By the time we got to the other store, it was closed. It 
was getting kind of late, so I took Brett to pick up his car and 
we agreed to meet again as soon as possible.

Notes

 1. See https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/babynames/decades/names1950s. 
html

 2. Some of the names—for example, “Chris,” “Robin”—are 
clearly gender neutral, but the instructions ensured that par-
ticipants knew whether any given name was being rated as a 
male or female name.

 3. Our procedure for assembling a set of names led us to come 
up with very few that would be uncommon among European 
Americans. However, seventeen names on the final list—
Aaliyah, Antonio, Cesar, Fernando, Jaden, Jaime, Jalen, Javier, 
Jermaine, Jesus, Jose, Latasha, Latoya, Miguel, Pedro, Sergio, 
and Yesenia—were strongly associated with Latin- or African 
American individuals. Researchers in the United States (for 
whom the norms presented in this article would be most rele-
vant) would be unlikely to select such names for their vignettes 
unless they were explicitly attempting to manipulate perceived 
race or ethnicity. Participant judgments about these names 
also raise very important issues that the current study was not 
designed to address; no attempt was made to systematically 
select representative sets of names associated with specific eth-
nic or racial groups. Thus, these data are not presented in the 
tables or included in the analyses reported here (although they 
are available upon request). Note that if our procedure had led 
to the selection of names such as Mingxuan, Yitzhak, Lyudmila, 
or Ahmed, the same considerations would have arisen.

 4. We are grateful for the extraordinarily generous technical 
assistance provided by Robert Wickham with the analyses 
reported in this section and their write-up.

 5. All rs were associated with p values of less than .001.
 6. Relaxing the criteria a bit (using tertiary splits) allows for 

the identification of Chase, Jesse, Justin, Logan, Riley, and 
Tyler as male names relatively low in perceived competence 
and high in perceived warmth, and Carol, Deborah, Donna, 
Margaret, Maureen, and Mildred as female names relatively 
high in perceived competence and low in perceived warmth. 
Note, however, that the male names tend to be “younger” and 
the female names “older.”

 7. Follow-up analyses revealed no evidence for a curvilinear 
trend; thus, the linear effect does not obscure any tendency 
for competence ratings to drop off for names more likely to be 
associated with the oldest people.

 8. For the ratings associated with these and all other names used 
in Study 2, see Table 1.

 9. Inspection of the means for individual names revealed that 
within gender, the names associated with older people elicited 
mean age judgments that were higher than names associated 
with younger people with one exception: Earl was seen as 
being younger than Dylan and Logan.

10. But not always—cf. Kasof (1993). It is not clear, though, 
what variables moderate the extent to which the quantity and 
complexity of social information will dampen the effects of 
names.
