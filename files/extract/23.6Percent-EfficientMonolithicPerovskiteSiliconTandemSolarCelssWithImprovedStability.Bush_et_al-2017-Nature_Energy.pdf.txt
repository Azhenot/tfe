As the record single-junction e�ciencies of perovskite solar cells now rival those of copper indium gallium selenide,
cadmium telluride and multicrystalline silicon, they are becoming increasingly attractive for use in tandem solar cells due
to their wide, tunable bandgap and solution processability. Previously, perovskite/silicon tandems were limited by significant
parasitic absorption and poor environmental stability. Here, we improve the e�ciency of monolithic, two-terminal, 1-cm2
perovskite/silicon tandems to 23.6% by combining an infrared-tuned silicon heterojunction bottom cell with the recently
developed caesium formamidinium lead halide perovskite. This more-stable perovskite tolerates deposition of a tin oxide
bu�er layer via atomic layer deposition that prevents shunts, has negligible parasitic absorption, and allows for the sputter
deposition of a transparent top electrode. Furthermore, the window layer doubles as a di�usion barrier, increasing the thermal
and environmental stability to enable perovskite devices that withstand a 1,000-hour damp heat test at 85 ◦C and 85%
relative humidity.

The rapid rise of perovskite solar cells with record single-junction efficiencies of over 22% (ref. 1) is the result of aunique combination of properties, including strong optical
absorption2, long diffusion lengths3, and solution processability
enabled by the relatively benign nature of intrinsic defects4.
Additionally, their wide, tunable bandgap5 makes perovskites highly
attractive for use in multijunction solar cells on top of narrower-
bandgap absorbers, such as silicon, copper indium gallium selenide
and Sn-containing perovskites6–18. This presents a pathway to
achieving industry goals of improving efficiencies to over 30%
(ref. 19) while maintaining low module cost20.

The first monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem was made with
a diffused silicon p–n junction, a tunnel junction made of n+
hydrogenated amorphous silicon, a titania electron transport layer,
a methylammonium lead iodide absorber, and a Spiro-OMeTAD
hole transport layer8. The power conversion efficiency (PCE)
was only 13.7% due to excessive parasitic absorption of light in
the hole transport layer, limiting the matched current density to
11.5mA cm−2. Switching to a silicon heterojunction bottom cell and
carefully tuning layer thicknesses to reduce optical losses increased
the current density to 15.9mA cm−2 and raised the PCE to a record
21.2% (ref. 15). It is clear from these reports that minimizing
parasitic absorption in the window layers is crucial to achieving
higher current densities and efficiencies in monolithic tandems.
To this end, the window layers through which light first passes
before entering the perovskite and silicon absorber materials must
be highly transparent. The front electrodemust also be conductive to
carry current laterally across the top of the device. Indium tin oxide
(ITO) is widely utilized as a transparent electrode in optoelectronic

devices such as flat-panel displays, smart windows, organic light-
emitting diodes, and solar cells due to its high conductivity and
broadband transparency21. ITO is typically deposited through
magnetron sputtering; however, the high kinetic energy of sputtered
particles can damage underlying layers22. In perovskite solar cells, a
sputter buffer layer is required to protect the perovskite and organic
carrier-extraction layers from damage during sputter deposition.
The ideal buffer layer should also be energetically well aligned so
as to act as a carrier-selective contact, have a wide bandgap to
enable high optical transmission, and have no reaction with the
halides in the perovskite. Additionally, this buffer layer should act
as a diffusion barrier layer to prevent both organic cation evolution
and moisture penetration to overcome the often-reported thermal
and environmental instability ofmetal halide perovskites23. Previous
perovskite-containing tandems utilizedmolybdenumoxide (MoOx)
as a sputter buffer layer9,11,12, but this has raised concerns over long-
term stability, as the iodide in the perovskite can chemically react
with MoOx (ref. 24).

Mixed-cation perovskite solar cells have consistently outper-
formed their single-cation counterparts. The first perovskite
device to exceed 20% PCE was fabricated with a mixture of
methylammonium and formamidinium (FA)25. Recent reports have
shown promising results with the introduction of caesiummixtures,
enabling high efficiencies with improved photo-, moisture and
thermal stability26–30. The increased moisture and thermal stability
are especially important as they broaden the parameter space for
processing on top of the perovskite, enabling the deposition of
metal oxide contacts through atomic layer deposition31,32 (ALD)
or chemical vapour deposition (CVD) that may require elevated

temperatures or water as a counter reagent. Both titanium dioxide
(TiO2) and tin oxide (SnO2) have consistently proved to be effective
electron-selective contacts for perovskite solar cells and both can be
deposited via ALD at temperatures below 150 ◦C (refs 33–35).

Here, we introduce a bilayer of SnO2 and zinc tin oxide (ZTO)
that can be deposited by either low-temperature ALD or pulsed-
CVD as a window layer with minimal parasitic absorption, efficient
electron extraction, and sufficient buffer properties to prevent the
organic and perovskite layers from damage during the subsequent
sputter deposition of a transparent ITO electrode. These layers,
when used in an excellent mixed-cation perovskite solar cell atop
a silicon heterojunction solar cell tuned to the infrared spectrum,
enable highly efficient perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells with
enhanced thermal and environmental stability.

Single-junction perovskite solar cells
We first fabricated single-junction perovskite solar cells on
ITO-coated glass to develop a transferable architecture for
monolithic tandem solar cells on silicon. We fabricated the
Cs0.17FA0.83Pb(Br0.17I0.83)3 (CsFA) perovskite top cell, with a bandgap
of 1.63 eV (Supplementary Fig. 1), in the p–i–n architecture, in
which the electron-selective contact is deposited on top of the
perovskite absorber layer and acts as a window layer. Suitable
contacts for this geometry include low work-function metal oxides
such as zinc oxide (ZnO), TiO2 and SnO2. Figure 1a displays a
schematic of the device structure. The perovskite was deposited on
top of nickel oxide (NiOx)—a hole-selective contact—to achieve
higher voltage and stability than with the traditional poly(3,4-
ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)
contact36,37. The CsFA perovskite was deposited from a stoichio-
metric solution containing CsI, formamidinium iodide, PbI2, and
PbBr2 in a mixture of dimethylformamide and dimethyl sulfoxide.
This deposition method was modified from the literature27 and the
full details of device fabrication are provided in the Methods.

To deposit an electron-selective contact, we attempted to use
phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) and aluminium-
doped zinc oxide nanoparticles, which were previously used suc-
cessfully in a methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) perovskite
solar cell38; however, the devices were largely shunted due to the high
surface roughness of the CsFA perovskite (Supplementary Fig. 2).
Spin coating on rough surfaces requires thick, planarizing layers
to be applied to prevent shunt pathways, leading to lower optical
transmission (Supplementary Fig. 2). Evaporation, ALD and CVD
enable the fabrication of uniform, conformal, thin films with high
optical transmission, regardless of surface texture. SnO2 can be dep-
osited by ALD using tetrakis(dimethylamino)tin(IV) (TDMASn)
and water at temperatures as low as 30 ◦C (ref. 39), although deposi-
tion temperature is known to affect the stoichiometry and electronic
properties of metal oxide films40. We use this ALD chemistry at
100 ◦C to deposit SnO2. Others have shown that a thin layer of
PCBM between SnO2 and the perovskite increases efficiency29. We
thermally evaporated 1 nm of LiF and 10 nm of PCBM to leverage
their good electron extraction properties (Supplementary Fig. 3),
while still achieving high optical transmission. We find that LiF acts
as a shunt-blocking layer similar to how thin, insulating, silicon
oxide layers have been employed previously in thin-film silicon solar
cells to block shunt pathways and increase fill factor (FF)41. We
believe that LiF helps enable 1-cm2-aperture-area tandems without
a loss in FF and a large spread in efficiency (see Supplementary
Fig. 9). Additionally, we note that PCBM thermally decomposes
during evaporation to a more thermally stable isomer with very
similar electronic properties42.

On top of the PCBM layer, we deposited 4 nm of SnO2 by
ALD at 100 ◦C, followed by 2 nm of ZTO. The X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy sputter depth profile of the 4 nm SnO2/2 nm ZTO
stack in Supplementary Fig. 4 shows only partial diffusion of zinc

into the SnO2 film, indicating that 4 nm of SnO2 is sufficient
to prevent detectable concentrations of zinc from reaching the
perovskite. ZTO was deposited by combining SnO2 and ZnO ALD
processes in a repeating supercycle consisting of three cycles of SnO2
followed by three cycles of ZnO (refs 43,44). The parameters for
the individual SnO2 and ZnO processes used in the ZTO supercycle
are described in Supplementary Tables 1–4. This process resulted
in an effective growth rate of 5.8 Å per supercycle, or 0.1 nmmin−1.
We investigated faster processing methods of our window layer by
reducing the purge time from 30 s to 5 s between pulses. In doing
so, the process approached the pulsed-CVD growth regime, further
increasing the deposition rate to 0.5 nmmin−1, resulting in a total
window layer deposition time of approximately 15min. Current–
voltage (J–V ) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy data in
Supplementary Figures 5 and 6 illustrate the identical performance
and stoichiometry of SnO2 and ZTO layers deposited via ALD
and pulsed-CVD. Pulsed-CVD was used in the fabrication of our
champion devices, which is noteworthy as CVD has the potential to
reduce processing time compared with ALD andminimize thermal-
induced degradation during processing.

A 150-nm-thick ITO electrode with a sheet resistance of 30
per square was sputtered on top of the cell, as in our previous
work38. Optical modelling of the device stack indicated that thicker
ITO layers introduce significant current losses through parasitic
absorption (Supplementary Fig. 7) while thinner layers reduce FF
due to high series resistance. The 2 nm of ZTO is necessary to
achieve low contact resistance with ITO and reach a high FF, as
shown in Supplementary Fig. 3. Finally, we finished the device stack
with an evaporated silver metal electrode around the perimeter of
the 1-cm2 device area to minimize series resistance and a 150-nm-
thick, thermally evaporated LiF anti-reflection coating.

Supplementary Fig. 3 displays the J–V curves of a semi-
transparent device on glass compared with a reference opaque
device, in which an aluminium electrode was evaporated onto the
SnO2/ZTO bilayer instead of sputtering an ITO electrode. The
equivalent efficiency of the semi-transparent and opaque devices
speaks to the efficacy of the SnO2/ZTO bilayer and sputtered ITO
layer as an electron-selective contact. Additionally, the high FF of
78.8% and lack of an extraction barrier, demonstrated by the J–V
curve in Fig. 1b, indicate that the bilayer is a successful sputter
buffer layer. Figure 1c shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE),
transmittance and 1−reflectance measured from the SnO2/ZTO
bilayer (front) side. The high EQE, with an integrated current
density of 18.7mA cm−2, and low parasitic losses between 400 and
750 nm, showcase the optical properties of the bilayer and sputtered
ITO. The AM1.5G-weighted average transmittance of this device
between the perovskite bandgap at 765 nm and the silicon bandgap
at 1,200 nm is 74%. Figure 1b indicates that there is still room for
open-circuit voltage (VOC) improvement, as the bandgap-voltage
offset is over 0.65V. We believe that the origin of the voltage loss is
primarily due to the difficultly in crystallizing theCsFAperovskite in
the inverted architecture on a planar surface. Supplementary Fig. 2
reveals considerable surface roughness, which may cause voids in
the LiF and PCBM layers during the evaporation.

Two-terminal tandem solar cells
To form two-terminal perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells,
perovskite cells were fabricated directly on top of complete silicon
bottom cells, as shown in Fig. 2a. The perovskite top cells, one
of which is shown in cross-section in Fig. 2c, were identical to
their single-junction predecessors, except the NiOx layer was
annealed at 190 ◦C for 10 h instead of 300 ◦C for 1 h to prevent
appreciable deterioration of the surface passivation layers in the
underlying silicon cell (Supplementary Fig. 10). We chose an
amorphous silicon/crystalline silicon heterojunction solar cell
design for the bottom cell because of its high VOC, which results

from the separation of the highly recombination-active (ohmic)
contacts from the silicon absorber bulk, and because its dominant
performance-loss mechanism under the standard solar spectrum—
parasitic absorption of blue light in the front amorphous silicon
(a-Si:H) layers—is irrelevant in tandems45.

The silicon cell fabrication process was adjusted to tune the
silicon cells to the infrared spectrum that they receive in the tandem,
as well as for compatibility with the spin-coated perovskite top
cells. In particular, the a-Si:H layers on both sides were slightly
thickened to enhance passivation and carrier collection45. A wafer
with a chemical–mechanical-polished front surface was used to
allow for top-cell spin-coating, but the rear of the wafer was
textured to form random pyramids. The pyramids scatter weakly
absorbed near-bandgap light, elongating its path length through
the wafer and enhancing the cell’s infrared EQE. An excellent rear
reflector comprising a silicon nanoparticle (SiNP)/silver stack was
also implemented. The SiNP layer, which is atypical in silicon
heterojunction solar cells, is used because of its low refractive
index—with a porosity of approximately 60%, its refractive index is
1.4—and high transparency at wavelengths longer than 1,000 nm.
More details on the use and fabrication of the rear reflector
comprising a SiNP/silver stack will be presented in a subsequent
publication. Inserting a thick, low-refractive-index layer between
the wafer and metal reflector increases the rear internal reflectance
by reducing the fraction of light that reaches the lossy metal layer46,
and a SiNP/silver reflector has a rear internal reflectance of over
99% (ref. 47). Finally, the front ITO layer was thinned to reduce
infrared parasitic absorption since it does not need to play the role of
anti-reflection coating in tandems and because, unlike in a single-
junction silicon cell, the lateral conductivity of the front electrode
need not be high.

In more detail, following the fabrication sequence, an n-type,
280-µm-thick, double-side polished, float-zone silicon wafer was
textured only on its rear side in an alkaline solution, resulting in the
formation of random pyramids. Intrinsic and p-type a-Si:H films
(7 and 15 nm thick, respectively) were first deposited by plasma-
enhanced chemical vapour deposition on the textured (rear) side of
the wafer, and intrinsic and n-type a-Si:H films (7 and 8 nm thick,
respectively) were then deposited on the polished (front) side. A
20-nm-thick, highly transparent ITO layer was next sputtered on
the front side through a shadow mask, defining 11mm × 11mm
square cells, to act as a recombination junction between the silicon
and perovskite cells. A 20-nm-thick, highly transparent ITO layer
was also deposited over the rear side through the same shadow
mask, followed by a 300-nm-thick SiNP layer spray coated through

a stainless-steel mesh to define local openings48, and finally, a
200-nm-thick silver layer. Figure 2b shows a plan-view microscope
image of the patterned SiNP layer before silver sputtering; the 5%
uncoated area allows the silver to make direct electrical contact
to the underlying ITO layer (Fig. 2d), whereas the SiNPs in the
remaining area (Fig. 2e) enhance infrared conversion efficiency.

On its own, the silicon bottom cell has an efficiency well below
10% because of low FF caused by the high sheet resistance of the
thin front ITO layer and lack of metal fingers, and because of low
short-circuit current density (JSC) caused by the high reflectance
of the planar front surface and lack of appropriate anti-reflection
coating. The best 4-cm2 silicon heterojunction solar cell fabricated
by the same laboratory with the same—but double-side-textured—
wafers, adjusted deposition processes, and screen-printed silver
fingers reached a National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)-
certified efficiency of 21.4%. A comparable 1-cm2 cell (as in the
tandem) is expected to have an efficiency approximately 0.3% lower
because of a 10mV VOC loss from increased edge recombination,
and a comparable cell with a planar front surface (as in the tandem)
is expected to reach only 19–20%.

Figure 2f displays the J–V characteristic of the champion tandem
cell, certified at NREL, with a VOC of 1.65V, JSC of 18.1mA cm−2
and FF of 79.0%, resulting in an efficiency of 23.6% with a 1-cm2
aperture area and no hysteresis, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 9.
The tandem was held at its maximum power point for over
half an hour, under constant illumination, and maintained 23.6%
efficiency. Supplementary Fig. 11 shows performance metrics for
our final batch of devices without IR reflectors (Voc = 1.64± 0.02V ,
Jsc = 17.5 ± 0.2mA cm−2, FF = 79.9 ± 1.0%, and η = 22.8 ± 0.4%)
andwith IR reflectors (Voc =1.64± 0.01V , Jsc =18.2± 0.2mA cm−2,
FF = 78.1 ± 1.0%, and η = 23.3 ± 0.4%). The high performance
and narrow statistical distribution for these 1-cm2 cells—which are
large-area amongst present perovskite devices—attests to the ability
of the pulsed-CVD process to deposit a window layer that prevents
pinholes and shunt pathways.

Figure 2g shows the measured total absorbance (1−reflectance)
andEQEof both sub-cells in the perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell.
The figure has been divided into several (coloured) regions to help
visualize the tandem response and loss mechanisms. Integrating
the EQE spectra over the AM 1.5G spectrum reveals that the
perovskite top cell and silicon bottom cell generate 18.9mA cm−2
and 18.5mA cm−2, respectively. We note that the silicon cell EQE
exceeds 90% between 800 and 875 nm, which is much higher than
the measured transmittance of the single-junction perovskite cell in
Fig. 1c. This high EQE results from a thinner ITO electrode (20 nm

between the silicon and perovskite in the tandem instead of 170 nm
between the perovskite and glass in the single-junction cell) and
reduced reflection due to the lack of an air interface in the tandem.
Supplementary Figs 9 and 11 illustrate the efficacy of the SiNP
rear reflector in increasing infrared absorption within the silicon
wafer, corresponding to an increase in JSC of about 1.5mA cm−2.
Two main current losses are front-surface reflection (area above the
total absorbance curve) and parasitic absorption (area between the
total absorbance and EQE curves), which account for 4.8mA cm−2
and 4.5mA cm−2, respectively. To further improve the JSC of the
tandem device, the easiest step would be to reduce front-surface
reflection. Were it eliminated, the summed JSC would increase by
4.2mA cm−2. (As parasitic absorption still exists, not all transmitted
photons would be converted into electron–hole pairs.) The short-
wavelength parasitic absorption loss associated with the first pass
through the layers at the front of the solar cell is 1.2mA cm−2
(0.7mA cm−2 from the ITO and 0.5mA cm−2 from the PCBM and
SnO2/ZTO bilayer, according to our optical simulations) would be
gained as current in the top cell if the parasitic absorption were
eliminated. The infrared parasitic absorption, which may occur in
any layer in the tandem, appears to be large at 3.3mA cm−2, but this
‘loss’ is misleading because not all of this current is available to be
gained. Eliminating infrared parasitic absorption will result in a JSC
gain (in the bottom cell) of less than half that value because—even

assuming Lambertian light trapping—much of the light will escape
out the front of the cell and contribute to the measured reflectance.

Improved stability of perovskite solar cells
In addition to acting as a highly transparent and conductive
electrode, ITO—by virtue of its behaviour as a diffusion barrier—
can significantly increase the thermal and environmental stability
of a perovskite solar cell by trapping the volatile methylammonium
cation38,49. The increased thermal stability of the thermodynamically
favourable27 mixed CsFA perovskite compared with the pure
methylammonium perovskite26, along with the dense, pinhole-free
ALD SnO2/ZTO bilayer, should result in perovskite solar cells
with even greater stability than previously reported. We tested
the stability of single-junction CsFA mixed perovskite solar cells
by operating 0.48-cm2-aperture-area devices at the maximum
power point without additional encapsulation under continuous,
one-sun-equivalent, visible illumination with a sulfur plasma lamp.
The test was performed in ambient conditions with an average room
humidity of around 40% and the lamp heating the samples to 35 ◦C.
Remarkably, the devices operated with minimal degradation in
performance for over 1,000 h of testing, as shown in Fig. 3a. In our
previous study, small dust particles in the perovskite resulted in pin-
holes in the ITO encapsulation, creating a pathway for methylam-
monium evolution and causing eventual efficiency degradation38.

Figure 3 | Stability of perovskite top cell. a, E�ciency (black), JMPP (red), and VMPP (blue) of a single-junction perovskite device with no additional
encapsulation during 1,000 h of continuous maximum-power-point tracking. b, E�ciency (black), JMPP (red), and VMPP (blue) of a single-junction
perovskite device packaged with EVA, glass, and a butyl rubber edge seal during damp heat testing.

In the present CsFA devices, however, no such pinhole-based
degradation was apparent after 1,000 h of operation, speaking to the
efficacy of the conformal ALD process to prevent pinhole formation
and to the overall increased stability of the CsFA perovskite.

Although the cell in Fig. 3a had the same efficiency after
1,000 h as at the start of the test, this efficiency was not constant
over the testing period. As can be seen in Fig. 3a, the rise in
efficiency during the first 400 h corresponds to an increase in
voltage (VMPP), suggesting an improvement of the NiO/perovskite
interface or increased perovskite crystallinity. VMPP started at only
a modest value but the lack of VMPP decay during the test is
noteworthy. Falling current density (JMPP) is the culprit for the
decrease in efficiency over the last 600 h of the test. The exact
cause of this decrease in JMPP is currently being studied, but
potential causes are the lack of an edge seal or pinholes in the
ITO layer caused by dust particles; either case would lead to
evolution of the organic cation. However, both of these potential
issues can be solved through proper device encapsulation. The
vast majority of commercial silicon solar modules are encapsulated
with the elastomeric polymer ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) and a
glass cover sheet to prevent oxidation and moisture ingress, and
thus to enable>25-year lifetimes. Lamination of EVA is typically
performed at 110–150 ◦C for 30min under mild vacuum. The
increased thermal stability38 of our perovskite devices with the
sputtered ITO electrode enables us to compare the stability of our
devices directly with conventional silicon modules by packaging
our devices using this industry-standard encapsulation process. We
laminated single-junction perovskite devices between two sheets of
glass with EVA at a curing temperature of 140 ◦C for 20min. A butyl
rubber edge seal was used to prevent moisture ingress.

To test the efficacy of this packaging, we performed the
damp heat test described in the International Electrotechnical
Commission (IEC) design qualification testing protocol 61215 for
‘Crystalline Silicon Terrestrial Photovoltaic (PV) Modules’. These
are accelerated lifetime tests with the goal of rigorously testing
modules for the same failure mechanisms observed in the field in
a much shorter time. The damp heat test requires that the module
withstand 85 ◦C and 85% relative humidity for 1,000 h with nomore
than 10% degradation in performance. We performed this damp
heat test on two packaged perovskite devices over the course of
6 weeks (1,008 h). The devices were taken out of the dark damp
heat chamber once a week and measured with a maximum-power-
tracking program until the efficiency stabilized. Figure 3b shows
the voltage, current and efficiency at maximum power each week.
Not only do the devices pass the damp heat test, they improve over
the course of the test. While the efficiency of the devices is initially

limited by poor FF, VMPP increases throughout the test, similar to
under continuous illumination (Fig. 3a). However, unlike in the
continuous-illumination study, JMPP remains constant throughout
the course of the damp heat test, indicating that the packaging
successfully addressed potential problems such as pinholes in the
ITO and an improper edge seal.

Conclusions
An ALD- or pulsed-CVD-processed SnO2/ZTO window layer has
enabled the successful fabrication of perovskite solar cells with high
efficiency and improved stability. These vapour processes produce
a compact, conformal, uniform and highly transparent SnO2/ZTO
bilayer with efficient hole-blocking ability and sputter buffer layer
properties, allowing for 1-cm2 devices with no pinholes. These
devices have the thermal and ambient stability to be further sealed
with industry-standard encapsulation such as EVA and glass. In
addition to being made as single-junction devices on glass, the
same devices were fabricated on silicon solar cells with planar
front surfaces to form two-terminal tandems. When the perovskite
cells were coupled with silicon heterojunction bottom cells with
an excellent rear reflector and a-Si:H and ITO layers adjusted for
the exclusively infrared spectrum, the resulting tandem reached
an efficiency of 23.6% with no hysteresis and stable maximum
power over more than 30min under illumination. This efficiency
is well beyond that of both sub-cells, beyond that of the record
single-junction perovskite cell, and approaching that of the record
single-junction silicon cell. Performance-loss simulations suggest
that the efficiency can be increased further by widening the
bandgap of the perovskite and reducing front-surface reflection,
which will enable both higher matched current densities and higher
voltage. Perovskite/silicon tandemswith anALD SnO2/ZTO-bilayer
layer present a promising method to achieving industry-standard
operational lifetimes with pathways to raising efficiencies over
30% (ref. 19).

Methods
Perovskite device fabrication. Semi-transparent perovskite devices were
fabricated on patterned, 10 per square glass from Xin Yan Technology. After
cleaning with Extran, acetone and isopropanol, the ITO glass was UV ozone
cleaned for 15min. A 1M solution of nickel nitrate hexahydrate (Sigma-Aldrich,
puriss) and ethylenediamine (Sigma-Aldrich) in anhydrous ethylene glycol
(Sigma-Aldrich) was spun on ITO-coated glass at 5,000 r.p.m. for 50 s and
annealed at 300 ◦C for 1 h. The NiOx films were quickly taken into a dry air box
where the CsFA perovskite was deposited from a stoichiometric solution
containing CsI (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.99% trace metals), formamidinium iodide
(Dyesol), PbI2 (TCI) and PbBr2 (Sigma-Aldrich, 96%) in a mixture of
N ,N -dimethylformamide (Sigma-Aldrich) and dimethyl sulfoxide

(Sigma-Aldrich). The solution was deposited through a 0.2 µm PTFE filter and
spun at 1,000 r.p.m. for 11 s, followed by 6,000 r.p.m. for 30 s. During
spin-coating, chlorobenzene was quickly dispensed 5 s prior to the end of the spin
process as an antisolvent to assist perovskite crystallization. The films were
annealed on a hot plate at 50 ◦C for 1min and then annealed at 100 ◦C for
30min. This deposition method was adapted from the literature27. Next, we
thermally evaporated 1 nm of LiF and a thin 10 nm layer of PCBM. Then, we
deposited 4 nm of stoichiometric SnO2 with pulsed-CVD at 100 ◦C on top of the
PCBM, followed by 2 nm of zinc tin oxide. Tin oxide and zinc oxide pulsed-CVD
processes were developed on an Arradiance GEMStar-6 ALD system at 100 ◦C.
The SnO2 pulsed-CVD cycle consisted of the processing sequence: 5 s purge
(30 sccm N2), 1.5 s TDMASn pulse (30 sccm N2), 5 s purge (90 sccm N2), 1 s
deionized water pulse (90 sccm N2) and 5 s of purging (90 sccm N2)
(5 s/1.5 s/5 s/1 s/5 s). The door and body temperature was maintained at 100 ◦C
for the hot-wall reactor while the manifold temperature was 115 ◦C with a
precursor temperature of 60 ◦C. Pulsed-CVD of zinc oxide was grown at 100 ◦C
using diethyl zinc and water with the processing sequence: 100ms/5 s/1 s/5 s with
a constant 90 sccm N2 flow. The reactor temperatures were the same as the tin
oxide process, but the diethyl zinc precursor was unheated. Note that ALD can be
performed instead of pulsed-CVD above. See Supplementary Tables 1–4 for
details of the ALD and pulsed-CVD process parameters. For the semi-transparent
and monolithic tandem devices, 150 nm of ITO was deposited through d.c.
sputtering. The sputter deposition of ITO films in the work was performed as
previously described38. An ITO witness sample on glass has a mobility of
43 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a carrier concentration of 3.5 × 1020 cm−3. We finished the
device stack with an evaporated or sputtered silver metal electrode around the
perimeter of the 1 cm2 device area to minimize series resistance and subsequently
evaporated 150 nm of LiF as a second anti-reflection coating. For the damp heat
stability testing, the single-junction solar cells were packaged between top and
bottom EVA encapsulants and two sheets of 3-mm-thick glass. The butyl rubber
edge seal was placed as a frame on the outer edge of the glass during assembly.
The package got pressed with 1,000mbar pressure at 140 ◦C for 20min for the
edge seal to soften and the encapsulant to cure.

Silicon device fabrication. An n-type, 280-µm-thick, double-side polished,
float-zone wafer was used as the starting substrate. A 250-nm-thick silicon
nitride layer was deposited by plasma-enhanced CVD in an AMAT P5000 tool on
one side of the wafer as a protective coating, and the wafer was then textured on
the uncoated side in potassium hydroxide to reveal random pyramids. After
removing the nitride coating in diluted hydrofluoric acid, the wafer was cleaned
in piranha and RCA-B solutions, and the oxide was removed in buffered oxide
etchant prior to deposition of amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) layers. Intrinsic and
p-type a-Si:H films (7 and 15 nm thick, respectively) were first deposited by
plasma-enhanced CVD on the textured (rear) side of the wafer, and intrinsic and
n-type a-Si:H films (7 and 8 nm thick, respectively) were then deposited on the
polished (front) side. A 20-nm-thick indium tin oxide (ITO) layer was sputtered
from a 90/10 In2O3/SnO2 in an MRC 944 tool on the polished side of the wafer
through a shadow mask to define square cells 11mm on a side. A 20-nm-thick
ITO layer was also sputtered over the textured surface through the same shadow
mask. The front ITO layer was deposited using a 2.3:100 oxygen/argon mixture,
which results in films with electron densities and mobilities of approximately
5 × 1020 cm−3 and 25 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively after annealing at 200 ◦C; in
contrast, the rear ITO layer was deposited using a 4.1:100 oxygen/argon mixture,
which results in films with electron densities and mobilities of approximately
2 × 1020 cm−3 and 25 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, after annealing at 200 ◦C. The
textured surface was subsequently coated with a 300-nm-thick silicon
nanoparticle layer that was spray-coated through a stainless-steel mesh (in
contact with the wafer) to define local openings occupying approximately 5% of
the total area. The nanoparticles were synthesized and deposited in a custom tool
that uses a flow-through plasma process to nucleate nanoparticles from silane gas
and deposit them via acceleration through a nozzle toward a substrate. The wafer
was next annealed at 200 ◦C for 20min to partially oxidize the nanoparticles, and
a 200-nm-thick silver layer was sputtered through the shadow mask to cover the
textured surface, finishing the cell.

Device characterization. Current–voltage measurements were performed using a
Keithley model 2400 digital source meter. A 300W xenon lamp (Oriel) solar
simulator was used to irradiate semi-transparent devices from the bottom glass
side. To irradiate tandems and semi-transparent devices from the top, an Oriel
Sol3A solar simulator was used. To negate spectral mismatch between our
reference KG5 diode and the response of the perovskite and silicon solar cells, the
lamp was calibrated to match the integrated photocurrent calculated by EQE. For
the semi-transparent devices, the J–V curves were measured from forward to
reverse bias with a 0.1V s−1 scan rate. The semi-transparent devices were initially
tested using a maximum-power-tracking program that is a perturb-and-measure
program with voltage steps of 5mV. Once the device efficiency has stabilized for
at least 10min, a J–V scan is taken. For the monolithic tandem devices, both

forward-to-reverse and reverse-to-forward scans were measured at a rate of
0.12V s−1. Reported values for efficiency were all evaluated on the basis of steady
maximum-power-point operation for a minimum of a minute. The opaque cells
and semi-transparent cells were illuminated through 0.12 and 0.39 cm2 aperture
areas, respectively. The perovskite/silicon tandems all had an aperture area of
1 cm2. The EQE was recorded as a function of the wavelength using a Keithley
model 236. A 100W tungsten lamp (Newport) was used as the excitation source
and focused through a Princeton Instruments SpectraPro 150 monochromator.
The monochromatic light was chopped at around 73Hz and Stanford Research
Systems SR830 model lock-ins were used to monitor the perovskite signal at the
chopping frequency. Data were averaged for 5 s at each wavelength. Each
individual sub-cell in the tandem must be electrically isolated to obtain an EQE
spectrum. We light-biased the silicon sub-cell with a 980 nm laser diode from
ThorLabs and the perovskite sub-cell with a white-light LED array to measure the
EQE of the perovskite and silicon sub-cells, respectively. No white-light bias was
used during the EQE measurement of the single-junction perovskite devices. To
measure the unpackaged stability under continuous illumination, devices were
tested under a sulfur plasma lamp from LG (6,000K blackbody). The device is
monitored at maximum power point using electronics from Science Wares Inc.
The surface temperature of the devices during the test is 35 ◦C, as measured with
a temperature probe. The damp heat devices were placed in an 85 ◦C and 85%
relative humidity chamber and were taken out every week for performance
measurements taken at room temperature. These devices were tested under one
sun on an Oriel Sol3A solar simulator. A maximum power point tracking
program was written in LABVIEW to measure stable device performance.
