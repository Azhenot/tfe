Levitating glass particles are fastest spinning objects ever

TINY glass particles spun by a laser are the fastest spinning objects we have ever seen.

Two teams have used circularly polarised light to set charged particles in motion. As this light travels, it spins
and can impart rotational energy to matter.

René Reimann at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich and team trapped a silicon dioxide
particle in a polarised laser. Drag from air particles was removed by lowering the pressure, letting the silicon
dioxide spin more than 1 billion times a second (arxiv.org/abs/1803.11160).

Tongcang Li at Purdue University, Indiana, led another team doing similar work. They also used glass
nanoparticles, but two stuck together for strength. He and his team measured them rotating at 1.3 gigahertz,
or 1.3 billion times a second (arxiv.org/abs/1804.06570).

These rotating particles may help us detect quantum friction – drag created by photons blinking in and out of
existence – and tell us more about the origin of the cosmos: spinning particles may be the source of gigahertz
signals in the cosmic microwave background left by the big bang.
