Being able to match voters with their records in ID databases using just a few

basic details might help dispel some myths about whom laws do and don’t

hurt.

After announcing the closure of his short-lived commission to end voter

fraud, President Trump made it clear Thursday that he wants more

states to require identification at the ballot box to prevent what he

believes is rampant—but still unproven—election rigging.

Ever since the Supreme Court struck down a key part of the Voting

Rights Act in 2013, laws requiring voters to show identification when

they vote have speckled the nation, popping up in states from Rhode

Island to Arizona. Almost as quickly, voting rights advocates have taken

states like Texas and Alabama to court, arguing that these laws

intentionally discriminate against minority voters. Just last summer, a

federal judge tossed out Texas’s voter ID law, in a case that’s now being

revisited by an appeals court. But proving exactly how discriminatory

these laws are requires far more complexity than it might seem.

Sure, there are endless anecdotes of well-meaning, well-prepared

citizens being turned away on election day, but anecdotes are not data.

There are ample surveys asking voters whether these laws came

between them and the ballot box, but people can always misrepresent

themselves on surveys, and courts tend to dismiss them, anyway. Seven

states include Social Security numbers in voter files and driver's license

records, but across the rest of the country, determining whether a single

individual voter is also listed in any number of identification databases

has become a complex and nettlesome problem for voting access

advocates and statistics researchers alike.

Recently, however, researchers at Tufts University and Harvard

University demonstrated that it's possible to match individuals across

government databases with nearly perfect accuracy, using just a few

basic identifiers like a person’s name, date of birth, and address. They

developed the algorithm while working as expert witnesses in the

Department of Justice's case against Texas. Now, in a newly published

paper, researchers Stephen Ansolabehere of Harvard and Eitan Hersh

of Tufts have explained the underlying methodology. Their goal,

according to Hersh, is to create a system courts can easily understand,

which can not only be used in future voter ID law cases, but can also

help dispel some myths about who those laws do and don’t hurt.

“The more we can agree on methods that are easy to explain, the better

off we are,” says Hersh.

A Better Model

If all data were clean and complete, it wouldn’t be so hard to figure out

if a voter named, say, John Smith, was the same John Smith listed in

the federal driver’s license database. According to Hersh and

Ansolabehere’s research, only 1 in 2.7 billion individuals have the same

zip code, gender, date of birth, and last name, making those four details

combined a fairly spot-on indicator of a person’s identity. But often,

government records contain typos, incomplete fields, nicknames, or

outdated addresses. To link databases, researchers often need to make

do with less information.

They also need to be able to show their work in a way that lawyers and

judges can understand. So many algorithms that purport to match

people across databases run up against the so-called black box problem.

They may be able to make statistically sound decisions, but they can't

easily explain how they made them. In a recent Supreme Court hearing

over partisan gerrymandering in Wisconsin, Chief Justice John Roberts

dismissed research-backed methods to measure gerrymandering as

"sociological gobbledygook." Hersh and Ansolabehere wanted to

develop a tool that could be easily understood.

'The more we can agree on methods that are easy to explain, the better

off we are.'

Eitan Hersh, Tufts University

So, working with the Department of Justice, the researchers set out to

determine whether they could match voters on the voter roll with their

corresponding records in ID databases using just a few basic details. To

do that, they developed an algorithm that scanned the state of Texas’s

voter rolls and compared it to the federal list of driver licenses, state

IDs, and concealed handgun permits, among other forms of acceptable

identification. It scanned each record by address, date of birth, gender,

and name, to see if, for instance, a combination of address, gender, and

name would be as accurate a predictor as a combination of date of birth,

gender, and name.

To check their results, the researchers relied on a subset of the voter

data that contained Social Security numbers. Those records effectively

served as the algorithm’s answer key. They ultimately found that 98

percent of the records that could be matched using Social Security

numbers could also be matched using any three of the four key

identifiers—address, date of birth, gender, and name.

“This combination is as good as a Social Security number,” Hersh says.

That high accuracy rate is essential in court, says Charles Stewart III, a

political scientist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who has

served as an expert witness in a case against South Carolina's voter ID

law. Most database-matching algorithms are used in low-risk scenarios,

he explains, like advertising, where companies want to target customers

across a range of platforms. If they target the wrong customer, at worst,

they've lost a marginal amount of money. In court, it could mean losing

the case altogether. "There is really no room for error," Stewart says,

citing the risk of having to demonstrate an algorithm's chops before the

bench. "If the judge doesn't get matched properly, for instance, you

might as well have not done anything."

Deep Impact

Once Hersh and Ansolabehere were confident they had properly

matched registered voters to their ID records, they used a commercial

tool called Catalist to predict each voter's race. That tool analyzes names

to determine how likely a given name is to be associated with one race

or another. It also accounts for the demographics of the Census block

where a given voter lives. Using this tool, the researchers confirmed

what voting rights advocates already know to be true—that black voters

are more likely to lack adequate identification under voter ID laws.

According to the study, 3.6 percent of registered white voters had no

match in any state or federal ID database. By contrast, 7.5 percent of

black registered voters were missing from those databases.

The algorithm shows a clear and disturbing racial disparity on voting

rights. But Hersh says that it also shows that voter ID laws affect a

relatively small percentage of the population. Across all registered

voters in Texas, the researchers found 4.5 percent lack proper

identification. For registered voters who actually showed up at the polls

in 2012, it's 1.5 percent.

"You're down to a small percentage of the population that doesn't have

an ID," says Hersh. That's one reason why, despite Alabama's restrictive

voter ID law, black turnout in the recent Senate election still exceeded

expectations. Still, while the percentages may sound small, that 4.5

percent still represents 608,470 Texas citizens who could potentially be

disenfranchised.

Hersh says he agrees the public ought to be outraged by racially

motivated attempts to suppress the vote, and that courts ought to crack

down on the practice. But he cautions against Democrats artificially

inflating the impact of voter ID laws in their messaging. Shortly after

the 2016 election, Democratic Senator Tammy Baldwin attributed the

entire dropoff in voter turnout in Wisconsin to the state's new voter ID

law. Hersh points to plenty of other reasons why voter turnout may

have been down in Wisconsin in 2016, including the simple fact that

Hillary Clinton didn't campaign in Wisconsin.

"It ... can be dangerous to sow doubt in the integrity of the election

system with these big claims," Hersh says. Besides, the raw data is bad

enough.

And Hersh's findings are limited to Texas. In other states with less of a

car culture and more densely populated cities, the number of people

who lack ID may be as high as 10 percent, MIT's Stewart explains. And

because this study only looks at voters who are currently registered,

Stewart says, it doesn't take into account the discouraging effects that

voter ID laws may have on people attempting to register in the first

place.

"Whether it’s intended to harm 600,000 African American and Latino

voters or 2 million, our concern is people are passing these laws with

the intent to discriminate or the effect of discriminating," says Deuel

Ross, a civil rights attorney for the Legal Defense Fund.

Now, science is bringing people like Ross that much closer to proving it.
