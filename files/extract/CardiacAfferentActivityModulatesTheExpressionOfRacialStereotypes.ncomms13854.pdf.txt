Cardiac afferent activity modulates the
expression of racial stereotypes
Ruben T. Azevedo1,2, Sarah N. Garfinkel3,4, Hugo D. Critchley3,4 & Manos Tsakiris1,2

Negative racial stereotypes tend to associate Black people with threat. This often leads to the

misidentification of harmless objects as weapons held by a Black individual. Yet, little is

known about how bodily states impact the expression of racial stereotyping. By tapping into

the phasic activation of arterial baroreceptors, known to be associated with changes in the

neural processing of fearful stimuli, we show activation of race-threat stereotypes synchro-

nized with the cardiovascular cycle. Across two established tasks, stimuli depicting Black or

White individuals were presented to coincide with either the cardiac systole or diastole.

Results show increased race-driven misidentification of weapons during systole, when bar-

oreceptor afferent firing is maximal, relative to diastole. Importantly, a third study examining

the positive Black-athletic stereotypical association fails to demonstrate similar modulations

by cardiac cycle. We identify a body–brain interaction wherein interoceptive cues can mod-

ulate threat appraisal and racially biased behaviour in context-dependent ways.

We seem more 'racist' when exposed to alarming picture during active part of heartbeat cycle... OK and then :)



R
ecent statistics from USA reveal that Black Americans are
more than twice as likely to be unarmed when killed during
encounters with police as White people1. This is a striking

example of how implicit stereotypes in physiologically arousing
contexts may influence behaviour even among those who do not
consciously endorse them. Notably, laboratory research has
replicated this pattern among university students2 and police
officers3,4, demonstrating that people are more likely to
misidentify harmless objects as weapons when associated with a
Black individual5 and are more prone to ‘shoot’ unarmed Black
targets2–4.

At the neural level, research has shown that the mere
perception of Black individuals may trigger a pattern of neuro-
physiological responses consistent with rapid activation of the
threat-signalling system, such as increased activity in the
amygdala6 and enhanced startle potentiation6,7. Of interest, two
studies have explored the effects of anxiety in the expression of
Black-threat associations and found that high cortisol reactivity to
stress may exacerbate vigilance for racial threat cues8 and reduce
the ability to control stereotypic behaviour9. These studies hint to
an influence of altered states of psycho-physiological arousal
on racially biased behaviour, especially in relation to anxiety
and altered patterns of physiological responses (for example,
refs 10–12). However, the physiological afferent mechanisms that
underpin the feedback of physiological states to the brain are
typically overlooked. One contributing factor to this oversight is
the relative difficulty in characterizing the mechanisms through
which bodily states interact with perception and cognition,
because it is methodologically challenging to disentangle afferent
‘body-to-brain’ effects from efferent ‘brain-to-body’ responses or
arousal-related mental states13,14.

One prominent channel of body and brain communication is
that conveyed by baroreceptors, pressure and stretch-sensitive
receptors within the heart and surrounding arteries. Within each
cardiac cycle, bursts of baroreceptor afferent activity encoding the
strength and timing of each heartbeat are carried via the vagus
and glossopharyngeal nerve afferents to the nucleus of the solitary
tract15. This represents the major mechanism for fast and short-
term regulation of blood pressure, through which increases in
blood pressure trigger a parasympathetic-mediated reflex slowing
of the following heartbeat and inducing sympatho-inhibitory
peripheral vasodilatation13,15,16. Importantly, this is also the
principal route that communicates to the brain the dynamic state
of the heart, enabling the representation of cardiovascular arousal
within viscerosensory brain regions, and influence ascending
neuromodulator systems implicated in emotional and
motivational behaviour17. Because arterial baroreceptors are
activated by the arterial pulse pressure wave, their phasic
discharge is maximal during and immediately after the cardiac
systole, that is, when the blood is ejected from the heart, and
minimal during cardiac diastole, that is, between heartbeats18,19.
Capitalizing on this, recently developed experimental paradigms
propose that it is possible to explore the impact of this
interoceptive signal on psychological processes by timing the
brief presentation of stimuli to the different phases of the cardiac
cycle. In particular, it was observed that when certain categories
of stimuli are presented during systole versus diastole, stimulus
processing is enhanced or attenuated. This is typically taken as
evidence that concurrent baroreceptor firing modulates brain–
body interactions across a variety of psychological domains,
including the processing of sensory20,21 and painful18,22 stimuli,
and cognitive processes such as short-term23 and long-term24

memory. Of particular interest for the present study, previous
research using this experimental approach found that the neural
representation of certain emotional stimuli, such as fearful facial
expressions, are co-modulated with baroreceptor signals25,26. In

particular, the detection and appraisal of fearful faces is enhanced
at systole and diminished at diastole, when the central repre-
sentation of cardiovascular arousal is, respectively, maximal and
minimal. At the neural level, these baroreceptor-related effects in
the processing of threat stimuli are thought to be associated with
changes in the engagement of brain systems involved in
emotional processing and autonomic regulation including the
amygdala and the insula19,26,27.

Thus, this experimental approach allows the presentation
of stimuli in discrete yet short-term physiological contexts
(baroreceptor activation or quiescence) to individuate the pote-
ntial influence that heart-to-brain signals have on cognition and
behaviour without inducing the subjective experience of altered
cardiovascular arousal17. Here, we applied this strategy to
investigate how the cardiac cycle modulates the processing
(Study 1) and behavioural expression (Study 2) of racial
stereotypes. On the basis of the known effects of cardiac cycle
in fear processing17,26, we expected that racial stimuli presented
at systole, compared with those presented at diastole, would be
associated with greater racial bias when activating threat-related
stereotypes (Studies 1 and 2) but not when associated with
positive racial stereotypes (Study 3).

Results
Cardiac effects in weapons identification task. In Study 1, we
used the weapons identification task (WIT)5, a task designed to
assess the implicit stereotypes of Black individuals as dangerous.
Participants were required to make fast discriminations between
images of handguns or tools primed with pictures of Black or
White individuals’ faces (Fig. 1). Because face perception acti-
vates semantic knowledge associated with each group category
(for example, Black-threat), the presence of racial bias is typically
reflected by improved identification of handguns and reduced
identification of tools when preceded by Black primes compared
with White primes5,9. We timed the presentation of the primes to
coincide with the systolic (that is, B300 ms after the R-wave) or
diastolic (that is, B500 ms after the R-wave) phases of the cardiac
cycle. This showed that afferent cardiac activity influences
the expression of racial bias, as demonstrated by the signi-
ficant three-way interaction prime (Black/White)� object
(tool/weapon)� cardiac cycle (systole/diastole) on a repeated
measures ANOVA (n¼ 30) on accuracy rates, F(1,29)¼ 36.58,
Po0.001, Z2¼ 0.56. The interaction prime� object was also
significant, F(1,29)¼ 24.69, Po0.001, Z2¼ 0.46, replicating the
overall racial bias pattern typically observed in this task. Breaking
down the interaction according to object type confirmed this
effect in the identification of both tools (F(1,29)¼ 19.36,
Po0.001, Z2¼ 0.40) and weapons (F(1,29)¼ 14.13, P¼ 0.001,
Z2¼ 0.32). Planned comparisons, using two-tailed paired t-tests
(n¼ 30), revealed better identification of weapons (t(1,29)¼ 5.06,
Po0.001, Cohen’s d¼ 0.92) after Black (versus White) primes
and tools (t(1,29)¼ 8.44, Po0.001, Cohen’s d¼ 1.54) after White
(versus Black) primes at systole but not at diastole (tso0.71,
Ps40.45, Cohen’s dso0.13; Fig. 1). In other words, the
processing of racial cues when the central signalling of cardiac
activity was maximal (at systole), compared with when it was
minimal (at diastole), resulted in an increase in stereotypic errors.
Importantly, the cardiac cycle modulation of prime effects was
dependent on semantic associations between the prime and the
object, since Black faces presented at systole diminished the
identification of tools yet improved the identification of weapons.
We also carried out analyses on accuracy according to the signal
detection theory (SDT)28 to explore how the ability to discri-
minate between tools and weapons (d0) and biases in response
tendencies (C) varied according to prime type and cardiac cycle.

For that, we calculated separate d0 and C indices as a function of
prime and cardiac cycle and entered them into separate prime
(Black/White)� cardiac cycle (systole/diastole) repeated meas-
ures ANOVAs (n¼ 30). Analyses on d0 indices revealed that
neither the interaction nor the main effects were significant
(Fs(1,29)o0.93, Ps40.34, Zs2o0.031). Conversely, both the
interaction prime� cardiac cycle (F(1,29)¼ 42.01, Po0.001,
Z2¼ 0.59) and main effect of race (F(1,29)¼ 20.25, Po0.001,
Z2¼ 0.41), but not the main effect of cardiac cycle (F(1,29)¼ 0.06,
P¼ 0.82, Z2o0.01), were found to have significant effects in
C. Together, SDT results confirm that cardiac cycle did not
influence object discrimination per se (d0) but enhanced the
response bias (C) as a function of prime type.

According to theories of implicit cognition29,30, performance
in this task is a product of different sub-processes that can be
categorized as automatic, that is, the activation of racial asso-
ciations, and controlled, that is, the ability to detect a correct
response and overcome automatic associations. Using the perfor-
mance dissociation procedure (PDP)5,30, we were able to compute
independent estimates of these sub-processes and explore the
effect of cardiac cycle in each of them. For that, indices of
automatic and controlled processing were entered into separate
repeated measures ANOVAs (n¼ 30) with prime (Black/White)
and cardiac cycle (systole/diastole) as within-subject factors.
Interestingly, an effect of cardiac cycle was observed in automatic
(F(1,29)¼ 28.13, Po0.001, Z2¼ 0.49) but not in contro-
lled processes (F(1,29)¼ 0.91, P¼ 0.35, Z2¼ 0.03), such that

presenting primes at systole led to enhanced activation of racial
stereotypes. In other words, as controlled behaviour failed due to
the need to provide time-constrained decisions, automatic
associations influenced behaviour, particularly when primes
were presented at systole. Conversely, neither the interactions
of prime� cardiac cycle (automatic: F(1,29)¼ 0.35, P¼ 0.56,
Z2¼ 0.01; controlled: F(1,29)¼ 2.0, P¼ 0.17, Z2¼ 0.06) nor the
main effects of prime (automatic: F(1,29)¼ 2.29, P¼ 0.14,
Z2¼ 0.07; controlled: F(1,29)¼ 1.16, P¼ 0.29, Z2¼ 0.04) were
significant, suggesting a similar influence of cardiac cycle on the
automatic processing of Black-weapons and White-tools associa-
tions. It should be noted that the seemingly unexpected associa-
tion White-tools is in fact a consequence of contextual contrast
effects typically observed in evaluative priming tasks31. That is,
given the predominant association Black-threat in this task, non-
threatening objects are, by contextual contrast, associated with
White faces leading to a response pattern reflecting the
association White-thus-safety-thus-tool.

Cardiac effects in first person shooter task. In Study 1 we
investigated, for the first time, of how incoming afferent physio-
logical signals may impact the modulation of racially biased
behaviour. In Study 2, we extended these findings to situations
requiring threat-related decision-making in complex scenarios. The
first person shooter task (FPST)2 was designed to recreate the
real-life scenario in which a police officer needs to make the

Figure 1 | Study 1. (a) Graphical representation of the experimental procedure. In this adaptation of the WIT5, participants (n¼ 30) had to discriminate
between pictures (targets) of tools and weapons that were preceded by pictures (primes) of a White or a Black male face. Prime onset was synchronized

with different phases of the cardiac cycle—systole or diastole—to investigate the modulatory role of cardiac afferent signalling on the expression of this

stereotype. (b) Cumulative frequencies of stimuli onset (ms) relative to the R-wave peak for each cardiac cycle condition. Trials were then re-coded

a-posteriori according to their onset time—stimuli presented between 200–400 ms were defined as systole and those between 450–800 ms defined as

diastole. Excluded time intervals are displayed in faded colour. (c) Average accuracy rates (and standard errors) as a function of object type, prime and

baroreceptor activity (at systole) compared with reduced bias when it was minimal (at diastole).

split-second decision of whether to shoot or not a pote-
ntially armed individual. In each trial, participants are presented
with a photo of a White or Black male holding either a gun
or a harmless object in his hand. Participants are required to make
the time-constrained decision to ‘shoot’ or ‘not to shoot’ based
on whether the person is holding a gun or another object, respec-
tively. Typically, participants are more likely to shoot unarmed
Black individuals than unarmed White individuals2–4. By timing
the onset of stimulus presentation to coincide with cardiac systole
or diastole, we tested the influence of afferent cardiovasc-
ular information on the expression of racial bias (Fig. 2).
Similarly to Study 1, the three-way interaction object (weapon/no
weapon)� race (Black/White)� cardiac cycle (systole/diastole) on
the repeated measures ANOVA (n¼ 30) on accuracy rates was
found to be significant, F(1,29)¼ 5.40, P¼ 0.027, Z2¼ 0.16,
confirming the effect of cardiac cycle on racially biased decision-
making. The prime� object interaction, F(1,29)¼ 4.38, P¼ 0.045,
Z2¼ 0.13, was also significant, replicating the overall racial bias
pattern typically observed in this task. Separate analysis on the
cardiac cycle� race interactions for each object type revealed that
the phase of the cardiac cycle modulated racially biased responses
to unarmed targets, F(1,29)¼ 6.24, P¼ 0.018, Z2¼ 0.18 (main
effect of race: F(1,29)¼ 5.21, P¼ 0.030, Z2¼ 0.15; main effect of
cardiac cycle: F(1,29)o0.01, P¼ 0.98, Z2o0.01). Planned compa-
risons, using two-tailed paired t-tests (n¼ 30), further revealed that
participants ‘shot’ more often unarmed Black targets than White
targets when the stimuli were presented at systole, t(1,29)¼ 3.02,

P¼ 0.015, Cohen’s d¼ 0.55, but not at diastole, t(1,29)¼ � 0.46,
P¼ 0.71, Cohen’s d¼ 0.08 (Fig. 2). Thus, in line with Study 1,
presenting stimuli during periods of enhanced representation of
cardiac activity was associated with increased salience of racial cues,
leading to an increased likelihood of shooting ‘unarmed’ Black
individuals. However, cardiac cycle did not modulate racial bias on
armed trials, F(1,29)¼ 1.08, P¼ 0.31, Z2¼ 0.04 (main effect of race:
F(1,29)¼ 0.80, P¼ 0.38, Z2¼ 0.03; main effect of cardiac cycle:
F(1,29)¼ 0.02, P¼ 0.88, Z2o0.01). While we had predicted cardiac
cycle to modulate behavioural responses to armed targets as well,
these results are not surprising as this task may be less sensitive to
the detection of cardiac cycle effects over racial cues in the ‘armed’
conditions for at least two reasons: (i) task instructions encourage
participants to provide a ‘shoot’ response (see ‘Methods’ section)
leading to generalized higher accuracy in ‘armed’ trials. Cardiac
cycle effects may be less likely to be observed when performance
approaches celling levels; (ii) in these trials an objectively
threatening stimulus is present independently of the target’s race
which may further hinder the observation of the expected biases in
activation of racial threat stereotypes by cardiac cycle.

We also carried out SDT analyses by submitting d0 and C
indices to separate race (Black/White)� cardiac cycle (systole/
diastole) repeated measures ANOVAs (n¼ 30). Results on d0
indices revealed that while neither race nor cardiac cycle
influenced object discrimination (Fs(1,29)o1.03, Ps40.32,
Zs2o0.034), the interaction was significant (Fs(1,29)¼ 4.72,
Ps¼ 0.038, Zs2o0.14), suggesting different ability to discriminate

for a brief period (200 ms) with pictures of a White or Black male holding either a weapon or a harmless object (for example, phone, wallet) in his hand,

and had to make the split-second decision of whether to ‘shoot’ or ‘don’t shoot’ him, respectively. Crucially, we time-locked the presentation of the target to

objects held by a Black or White persons as a function of cardiac
cycle. However, post hoc analyses, using two-tailed paired t-tests
(n¼ 30), failed to identify differences between conditions
(ts(1,29)o2.04, Ps40.11, Cohen’s dso0.38) and therefore these
results should be interpreted with caution. No significant
interaction nor main effects in response criteria as a function
of race and cardiac cycle (Fs(1,29)o3.02, Ps40.093, Zs2o0.10)
was found. The apparent contrasting results between ‘C’ and
main analyses in accuracy rates should be explained by the fact
that, as discussed above, performance approached celling levels in
the ‘armed’ conditions. That is, while d0 and C indices
simultaneously considers decisions in both ‘armed’ and ‘unarmed’
conditions, baroreceptor effects were only found to modulate race
bias in ‘unarmed’ trials.

In conditions of relative ambiguity and/or when acting under
pressure, such as when a police officer needs to make a split-
second decision of whether to shoot or not, contextual cues may
have a strong influence on judgments and behaviour. Although
seemingly irrelevant for the discrimination between a weapon
and a harmless object, social (for example, Black versus White
individuals) and contextual (for example, dark alley versus rich
neighbourhood) cues may shift perceptual judgments and
increase the probability of perceiving the situation as threating32.
Likewise, emotional states of anger33, anxiety and sustained states
of psycho-physiological arousal enhance vigilance to threat-
related stimuli34 and influence racially biased behaviour8,9. We
extend these observations by demonstrating the discrete power of
fine-grained dynamic communication of cardiovascular arousal
wherein preconscious fluctuations in interoceptive afferent
activity amplify the impact of racial cues in biasing threat-
related behaviour. Importantly, our results identify for the first
time, bottom-up body-to-brain correlates for racially biased
behaviour. This represents a clear departure from the traditional
approaches that do not differentiate afferent from efferent effects.
That is, past studies measured physiological responses to racial
stimuli or used anxiety enhancing techniques that, although
eliciting states of bodily arousal8,9, do not disentangle the discrete
modulatory effects of afferent bodily signals from that of anxiety-
related cognitive processing. In contrast, our approach in which
the critical physiological conditions are likely to reflect rapid
neurally signalled cardiovascular states, allowed us to observe
within-participant fluctuations in the expression of racial bias and
explore the influence that body-to-brain signals may have on
social threat processing and intergroup biases.

Cardiac effects in sport-fruits identification task. However,
racial bias toward Black individuals is not uniformly negative
(for example, associated with threat). Depending on the context,
different stereotypes may be activated. In Study 3, we investigated
if the reported effects of cardiovascular interoceptive signals can
be generalized to positive racial associations portraying Black
individuals as athletic35,36. The sport-fruits identification task35 is
a modified version of the WIT in which participants were
required to discriminate between pictures of fruits and sport-
objects preceded by pictures of White or Black faces. Once more,
we timed the presentation of primes to coincide with the systolic
or diastolic phases of the cardiac cycle (Fig. 3). While the three-
way interaction prime (Black/White)� object (fruits/sport-
objects)� cardiac cycle (systole/diastole) of the repeated
measures ANOVA (n¼ 30) was not significant (F(1,29)¼ 0.30,
P¼ 0.59, Z2¼ 0.01), the two-way prime� object was significant
(F(1,29)¼ 11.36, P¼ 0.002, Z2¼ 0.28), replicating the typically
observed bias in object identification by racial primes. Breaking
down the interaction according to object type confirmed
improved identification of sport-objects (F(1,29)¼ 6.26,

P¼ 0.018, Z2¼ 0.18) preceded by Black (versus White) faces
and increased accuracy in the discrimination of fruits
(F(1,29)¼ 8.24, P¼ 0.008, Z2¼ 0.22) preceded by White (versus
Black) faces. However, cardiac cycle did not modulate this bias in
either case (Fs(1,29)o1.05, Ps40.31, Zsso0.035; Fig. 3).
Analyses of d0 revealed that neither the cardiac cycle� prime
interaction (repeated measures ANOVA, n¼ 30) nor the main
effects were significant (Fs(1,29)o0.51, Ps40.48, Zs2o0.02).
Conversely, an effect of prime (F(1,29)¼ 9.38, P¼ 0.005,
Z2¼ 0.24) could be observed in response bias, showing that
Black primes induced a greater tendency to provide the sport-
object response. Neither the main effect of cardiac cycle
(F(1,29)¼ 2.1, P¼ 0.149, Z2¼ 0.07) nor the interaction were
significant (F(1,29)¼ 1.18, P¼ 0.29, Z2¼ 0.04), confirming that
cardiac cycle did not modulate racial bias. Thus, together these
studies show that cardiac cycle effects on the expression of
implicit racial bias is not the same across all social stereotypes (see
Supplementary Note 1 for a statistical comparison between Study
1 and Study 3). Importantly, the fact that primes in Study 3
induced a robust behavioural bias confirms that the results
reported in Studies 1 and 2 do not reflect a general baroreceptor
effect over pure perceptual or inhibitory processes37,38 but instead
depend on the contextual and semantic content of the activated
associations.

Black-threat and Black-athletic stereotypes differ in several
ways, but perhaps, most significantly they differ in terms of
valence and salience of the associated emotions. This might be the
key for the different results observed. The impact of incoming
interoceptive information on the activation of semantic and
affective reactions should depend on the relevance that bodily
states of arousal have in the expression of the associated emotion
and contingent behavioural response. In conditions of high vigil-
ance, such as when discriminating between a weapon and a
harmless object, the feedback of bodily states may be particularly
informative in guiding behaviour. Conversely the positive, and
presumably motivationally less relevant, stereotype Black-athletic
may rely to a lesser extent on bodily information. This is in line
with previous research showing preferential baroreceptor-related
modulation in the processing of certain emotional categories,
notably fear17,26. We suggest that those forms of bias associated
with strong emotional, or motivational, content may be parti-
cularly sensitive to feedback of cardiovascular arousal, as revealed
by the potentiation of effects within the cardiac cycle.

Discussion
There is a growing consensus that the continuous dynamic
cortical representation of internal bodily states, such as the ones
conveyed by cardiac afferent signals, shape emotions and set the
foundations for a sense of self as the basis for subjective
experience13,14,39–43. It is also believed that preconscious short-
term fluctuations in baroreceptor activity provide the physio-
logical context through which body–brain effects can modulate
the processing of, and subsequent neurophysiological responses
to, sensory18,20–22 and emotional25,26 stimuli. Here, by synchro-
nizing stimuli presentation to this signal we were able to
investigate, without inducing sustained states of psycho-
physiological arousal, how the processing of complex social
stimuli and associated behavioural consequences may change in
conditions in which the representation of cardiac activity in the
brain is maximal compared with when it is minimal17. Although
causal relationships between baroreceptor firing and racially
biased behaviour are difficult to confirm empirically, our results
suggest that this interoceptive mechanism may constitute a
channel for body-to-brain influences in the processing of
motivationally salient social stimuli. In particular, we propose

that, in the context of alertness to threat-signalling stimuli,
heightened representation of cardiac signals in the brain may
enhance the salience of social cues and promote the expression of
negative racial stereotypes.

Arterial baroreceptors signals are carried by cranial nerves
X and XI directly to the nucleus of the solitary tract, which in turn
has proximate connections with regions such as the thalamus and
the amygdala. The observation of the enhanced activation
of a negative racial stereotype by cardiac afferent information
is likely to be underpinned by functional changes in these regions
and in particular within the amygdala, a centre already implicated
in baroreceptor effects on the processing of salient19 and
fear stimuli17,26. Moreover, specific amygdala nuclei play central
roles in coding the salience and associative relevance of
perceptual stimuli44–46, particularly in the context of threat
processing, including the modulation of attention to fear-relevant
stimuli, fear conditioning and regulation of autonomic states
of fear and anxiety47,48. Amygdala nuclei are also engaged in
out-group face perception, threat detection and learning of social
fears49,50. Interestingly however, amygdala activity to racial
out-group stimuli is modulated by the social-cognitive goals and
the presence of threat-related cues51,52. Thus, the observed
exaggeration of racial biases in a highly salient, threat-related

context is likely to be mediated through modulation of amygdala
responsiveness by interoceptive signalling originating in phasic
arterial baroreceptor activity. In other words, in the context of
alertness to threat-signalling stimuli, amygdala responses to
relevant environmental cues may be modulated by the strength
and quality of the cardiac signals.

Another possible parallel mechanism relates to the known inhi-
bitory effect of cardiovascular baroreceptor firing on activity
within higher order cortical regions including dorsolateral pref-
rontal cortex, via influences on thalamocortical gating, reducing
the ability to inhibit prepotent responses38. The implication
would be that baroreceptor activity would increase the expression
of racial stereotypes by compromising the ability to overcome
undesirable automatic responses. While these mechanisms are
not mutually exclusive, two pieces of evidence favour the tentative
explanation of enhanced activation of semantic associations
mediated by amygdala. First, our PDP analyses pinpoint an effect
over automatic but not controlled processes. Second, Black-
athletic stereotypes also activated prepotent responses but these
were not modulated by cardiac timing. Future studies may help to
elucidate this further.

It could be tempting to interpret the pattern of results obse-
rved in studies 1 and 2 as evidence for extinguished bias at

Figure 3 | Study 3. (a) Graphical representation of the experimental procedure. The sport-fruit identification task (SFIT)34 is a modified version of the

experimental paradigm used in Study 1 in which participants (n¼ 30) need to discriminate between pictures (targets) of fruits and sport-objects that are
preceded by pictures (primes) of a White or a Black male face. As in Study 1, we synchronized prime onset to coincide with the cardiac systole or diastole.

(b) Cumulative frequencies of stimuli onset (ms) relative to the R-wave peak for each cardiac cycle condition. Trials were then re-coded a-posteriori

according to their onset time—stimuli presented between 200–400 ms were defined as systole and those between 450–800 ms defined as diastole.

Excluded time intervals are displayed in lighter shades. (c) Average accuracy rates (and standard errors) as a function of object type, race and cardiac cycle.

Primes successfully induced response bias as reflected by the prime� object interaction. In particular, we observed greater accuracy in the identification of
sport-objects preceded by Black (versus White) faces and improved identification of fruits preceded by White (versus Black) faces. However, in contrast

with Study 1, this effect was not modulated by cardiac cycle. Together with the results from Study 1, Study 3 shows that cardiac cycle effects in the

processing of racial cues are context dependent, such that the salient negative association Black-threat, but not the positive Black-athletic stereotype, is

modulated by baroreceptor-mediated effects of interoceptive feedback.

diastole but such interpretation should be done with caution. The
experimental approach used here compares relative contributions
of the central representation of cardiovascular arousal in the
processing of certain social stimuli by tapping into the extremes
of ongoing fluctuations of baroreceptor activity which co-vary
with the cardiac cycle. Past research on cardiac timing argues for
the relative nature of baroreceptor effects (for example,
refs 26,38), that is, a relative enhancement of fear processing at
systole and an inhibition at diastole26. Garfinkel et al.26 also
showed that the relative inhibition of fear processing at diastole
was particularly evident among low anxiety individuals, and
suggested that the diminished inhibition of threat processing in
anxious individuals may reflect a mechanism contributing to the
exacerbation of fear signals in anxiety. While we have not
measured anxiety levels among our participants, we speculate that
a similar mechanism may be at play here. Inhibition of racial bias
at diastole may reflect a mechanism through which the signalling
of threat by members of a social group is attenuated. It is known
that anxiety and sustained states of arousal impact and exacerbate
intergroup biases10–12. Without inhibitory mechanisms such as
the one proposed here racial associations would be more likely to
escalate over time, promoting anxiety and reducing the ability to
control racial bias. This account is consistent with current
amygdala-centred models of learning and expression of aversive
social associations49,50, according to which the amygdala nuclei
serve two main functions: (i) form and store associations between
somatosensory states and representations of particular stimuli
(for example, Black individuals); (ii) and mediate the physio-
logical responses to the associated stimuli. Our results build up on
this by suggesting the influence of the relative strength or
weakness of afferent cardiac sensations in the flexible enhan-
cement and suppression of amygdala responsiveness to conditio-
ned stimuli. However, further research is needed to determine
how interoceptive signals contribute to the promotion of anxiety
in intergroup interactions.

Lastly, while the present research focused on threat-related
processes, we have no reason to believe that these associations
between cardiac cycle and the potentiation of social associations
are specific to race or fear processing. Indeed, we predict the
extension of these effects to other social groups/stereotypes
associated with substantial affective or motivational relevance.
We suggest this may be an important body-to-brain mechanism
affecting the processing of salient social signals and subsequent
actions accordingly. In line with current accounts highlighting the
predictive inferential nature of the brain, the (mis)perception of a
gun or an object is a consequence of prediction-based perception
shaped by previous social associations and concurrent bodily
signals (53). Future research should investigate the neural
underpinnings of these effects, as well as the functional correlates
and the apparent inhibition of negative racial bias in conditions of
quiescent baroreceptor firing. To the extent that this body-to-
brain mechanism can be used as an intervention to accelerate
unlearning of fear or threat-related stimuli, our results may have a
substantial impact in the development of training interventions in
professional settings where negative stereotypes may play a
crucial role.

Methods
Participants. In Study 1, data was collected from 32 (24 females; mean age¼ 21.8,
s.d.¼ 4.4) White healthy volunteers. Data from two participants was excluded from
analyses due to incorrect use of response keys or noisy electrocardiogram (ECG)
signal. Thus, the final sample comprised 30 (22 females; mean age¼ 22, s.d.¼ 4.5)
participants. In Study 2, data was collected from 35 (26 females; mean age¼ 22.0,
s.d.¼ 4.6) non overlapping White healthy volunteers. Data from five participants
was excluded due to reported difficulties in discriminating the different types of
stimuli (see Supplementary Methods 1). The final data set comprised 30 (21
females; mean age¼ 22.2, s.d.¼ 3.6) participants. In Study 3, the sample comprised
30 new healthy volunteers (67% White; 30% Asian; 7% mix White-Asian; 25

females; mean age¼ 21.6, s.d.¼ 3.7; see Supplementary Fig. 1 for control analyses
related to participants’ race). Data from one additional participant (White female)
was excluded from analyses due to suspicion of incorrect use of the response keys
(accuracy rates between 9 and 49%). All participants gave written informed
consent. All studies were approved by the Departmental Ethics Committee,
Department of Psychology, Royal Holloway University of London.

ECG recording. Three disposable ECG electrodes were placed in a modified lead I
chest configuration: two electrodes were positioned underneath the left and right
collarbone and another on the participant’s lower back on the left side. The
ECG signal was recorded with a Powerlab 8/35 (Powerlab, ADInstruments,
http://www.adinstruments.com/) using LAbchart 8 Pro software. The sampling rate
was 1,000 Hz and a hardware band-pass filter (Bio Amp 132) between 0.3 and
1,000 Hz was applied. Heartbeats were detected online with a hardware based
function (fast output response), which identifies the ECG R-wave with a delay
smaller than 1 ms (www.adinstruments.com/) by detecting when the amplitude
exceeds an individually defined threshold. Internal lab reports using this method
confirm that the software presenting the stimuli receives the transistor-transistor
logic (TTL) pulse signalling a heartbeat and is able to process it within o2 ms.

Because our designs included the presentation of a mask/background image up
to 600 ms before the prime/target picture onset, and therefore previous to the
reference R-wave, the timings of occurrence of the reference heartbeat had to be
predicted. This was achieved with a custom-made software, implemented in Matlab
(Matworks, http://uk.mathworks.com/), based on the timing of the three preceding
R-waves. The reliability of this predictive method was tested by measuring
a-posteriori the time distance between stimuli onset and the previous R-wave. The
histograms of cumulative frequencies of stimuli onset (ms) relative to the R-wave
peak for each cardiac cycle condition are displayed in Figs 1–3b. Despite the high
predictive power of our method, some overlap between systolic and diastolic trials
was present. To address this issue, trials were re-coded according to the actual
stimulus onset. Following previous literature, the systolic period was defined as
200–400 ms after the R-wave (for example, refs 18,26,54), which is the period of
maximal representation of baroreceptor afferent activity and when cardiac cycles
effects are typically observed. Diastole, the remaining period of the cardiac cycle,
was defined as 450–800 ms after the R-wave. Stimuli presented between 400 and
450 ms were excluded as the 400–450 ms window represent a challenge for the
accurate classification of systole/diastole. For example, physiologically, the
presentation of a stimulus at 395 ms should not be too different from another
presented at 405 ms but with this classification method they are expected to have
opposite effects. Trials in which stimulus was presented after 800 ms or between
0–200 ms after the R-wave were also excluded to avoid the possibility that target
onset (which follows immediately primes) partially overlapped with the systolic
period. Across the three studies percentages of excluded stimuli were smaller than
10.5%.

Study 1. Weapons identification task. Stimuli consisted of black and white photos
adapted from5,55. Primes were photos of a Black or White male face with neutral
expression55. Twelve Black and 12 White models were used. Target stimuli
consisted of a photo of a handgun or a tool (for example, wrench, pliers). Six
different tools and handguns were used. Presentation timings were adapted to
allow synchronization with the cardiac cycle. The prime was presented for 200 ms
with the onset timed to coincide either with the end of the systolic phase (that is,
B300 ms after the R-wave) or during the diastolic period (that is, B500 ms after
the R-wave). Immediately after, the target was presented for 150 ms. These
presentation timings were adopted so that primes were presented at systole or
diastole and targets onsets occurred outside the critical systolic period. This allowed
us to investigate the effects of baroreceptor activity in the activation of racial
stereotypes and not in the processing or response to threat-related objects. Before
the prime and after the target a mask was presented for 600 and 300 ms,
respectively, independently of cardiac cycle condition. A fixation cross in the centre
of the screen was displayed between trials. inter-trial intervals consisted in the
(variable) time period necessary to detect four heartbeats and predict the timing of
the subsequent cardiac cycle during which the stimuli would be presented.
Participants’ task was to press the ‘i’ key, with their right hand, if the target was a
weapon and the ‘e’ key, with their left hand, if the target was a tool. They were
instructed to be as fast and accurate as possible and were told that failures to
provide an answer within 500 ms would lead to a feedback warning ‘Please try to be
quicker’. Nevertheless, to allow reaction times analyses, response latencies up to
650 ms were collected. Response keys associated with weapons and tools were not
counterbalanced across participants. This may not be ideal, as it may lead to an
unbalanced use of the dominant hand to identify one of the targets and influence
the ability to quickly respond to weapons versus tools. Nevertheless, given the
within-participant-and-target nature of our effects of interest, it should have no
influence on the observed behavioural patterns related to cardiac cycle effects.
A total of 264 trials, 33 per condition, were presented in a fully randomize order.
Half-way through the task, participants were asked to rest for at least two minutes.
In order to familiarize participants with the stimuli and task procedures, two
practice blocks were administered. In the first practice block, comprised of 12 trials,
no primes were presented and no time limit was given for target identification. The

second practice block consisted of 12 trials in which primes and the response time
limit were introduced.

Accuracy rates (that is, on-time correct responses divided by the number of
trials) were analysed both through standard analyses of variance, that is, prime
(Black/White)� object (tool/weapon)� cardiac cycle (systole/diastole) ANOVA,
and according to SDT. In the SDT analyses, separate d0 and C indices were
estimated as a function of prime and cardiac cycle and entered into separate prime
(Black/White)� cardiac cycle (systole/diastole) ANOVAs. ‘Hit rates’ were defined
as the percentage of correct responses to weapons and ‘false alarms’ as the
percentage of incorrect responses to tools.

We have also used the PDP to estimate the contribution of automatic
(PDP-automatic) and controlled (PDP-control) processes to performance in this
task. PDP-control indices were estimated separately for Black and White prime
conditions by subtracting error rates on stereotype incongruent trials (Black-Tool
and White-Weapon, respectively) from accuracy on stereotype congruent trials
(Black-Weapons and White-Tool, respectively). PDP-automatic indices were
computed by dividing error rates on stereotype incongruent trials by the respective
reciprocal of PD-control scores5. Cardiac cycle effects were explored by estimating
these indices separately for trials at systole and diastole.

All P values from post hoc comparisons were corrected using the Newman–
Keuls method. Analyses of reaction times revealed equivalent results
(Supplementary Fig. 2). Please refer to online Supplementary Information for:
(i) analyses referring to participant’s individual interoceptive accuracy56

(Supplementary Note 2) and (ii) a Figure showing the distribution of stereotypic
errors across participants at the different phases of the cardiac cycle
(Supplementary Fig. 3a).

Study 2. First person shooter task. Stimuli consisted of pictures taken from2,3
depicting White and Black male individuals holding a handgun or another object
(for example, mobile phone, wallet). Participants were instructed to act as a police
officer and ‘shoot’ the target by pressing the key ‘i’, with their right hand, if he had
a gun and ‘not to shoot’ him by pressing the ‘e’ key, with their left hand, if he did
not have a gun. Response keys associated with weapons and tools were not
counterbalanced across participants. Each trial began with the presentation of a
background image (for example, a street, a park) for 400–500 ms after which the
target image was superimposed for 200 ms. The presentation of the target was time-
locked to coincide with systole (that is, B300 ms after the R-wave) or diastole
(that is, B500 ms after the R-wave). Unlike previous research with this task, we did
not present a random number of backgrounds before the target onset due to time
constrains linked with the synchronization with heart timings. A fixation cross was
present on the centre of the screen for the entire inter-trial-interval. The task
comprised a total of 180 trials (23 per condition) but only 148 different pictures
were used, meaning that 32 pictures, randomly selected for each participant, were
presented twice. Stimuli to be presented at systole and diastole were also randomly
selected for each participant. Half-way through the task, participants were asked to
rest for at least two minutes. The task included two blocks of practice trials,
comprised by 12 trials each. The images presented were different from those used
in the experimental task. No time limit was given for responses in the first practice
block. In the second block the response time limit was introduced.

Participants were told that if they failed to make a key press within 650 ms they
would receive the feedback ‘Please try to be quicker’. Nonetheless, to allow reaction
times analyses, responses up to 1,000 ms after target onset were collected.
Participants were awarded and deducted points on the basis of their performance
(shooting armed targets: þ 10 points; not shooting unarmed targets: þ 5 points;
shooting unarmed targets: � 20 points; not shooting armed targets: � 40 points;
failing to give an answer within 650 ms: � 10 points). These payoffs are
implemented to partially simulate the payoff matrix experienced by police officers
on the street2. They were also told that the 3 best players from the entire pool of
participants would be awarded a reward (d20–first place; d10–second place;
d5–third place). Accuracy feedback and updated total of points was provided after
each trial (see Supplementary Methods 1 for further details).

Accuracy rates (that is, the ratio between on-time correct responses and the
number of valid trials) were analysed both through standard analyses of variance
and according to SDT. Here, ‘hit rates’ were defined as the percentage of correct
responses in the ‘shoot’ condition and ‘false alarms’ as the percentage of errors in
the ‘don’t shoot’ condition. P values from post hoc comparisons were corrected
using the Newman–Keuls method.

Participants also carried out the Implicit Association Test55 to measure how
performance in the FPST relates to general implicit attitudes towards Black
individuals (See Supplementary Note 3). Please refer to online Supplementary
Information for: (i) analyses of reaction times (Supplementary Fig. 4) and
(ii) a Figure showing the distribution of stereotypic errors across participants at
the different phases of the cardiac cycle (Supplementary Fig. 3B)

Study 3. Sport-fruits identification task. Procedures and experimental design were
equivalent to that of Study 1 with the exception of the target stimuli used. Here,
participants had to discriminate between pictures of fruits (for example, apple,
grapes, cherries) and sport-objects (for example, basketball ball, weights, skate-
board)35. This task taps into the stereotype of Black individuals as athletic35,36. Ten

black and white pictures of each stimuli category were used. The ‘e’ and ‘i’ keys
were assigned to fruits and sport-related objects, respectively.

As in Study 1, accuracy rates (that is, on-time correct responses divided by the
number of trials) were analysed both through standard analyses of variance and
according to SDT. In the SDT analyses, ‘hit rates’ were defined as the percentage of
correct responses to sport-objects and ‘false alarms’ as the percentage of incorrect
responses to fruits.

Analyses of reaction times revealed equivalent results (Supplementary Fig. 5).
Please refer to online Supplementary Information for a Figure showing the
distribution of stereotypic errors across participants at the different phases of the
cardiac cycle (Supplementary Fig. 3C).
