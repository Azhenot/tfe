Several animal species demonstrate remarkable locomotive capabilities on land, on water,

and under water. A hybrid terrestrial-aquatic robot with similar capabilities requires multi-

modal locomotive strategies that reconcile the constraints imposed by the different envir-

onments. Here we report the development of a 1.6 g quadrupedal microrobot that can walk on

land, swim on water, and transition between the two. This robot utilizes a combination of

surface tension and buoyancy to support its weight and generates differential drag using

passive flaps to swim forward and turn. Electrowetting is used to break the water surface and

transition into water by reducing the contact angle, and subsequently inducing spontaneous

wetting. Finally, several design modifications help the robot overcome surface tension and

climb a modest incline to transition back onto land. Our results show that microrobots can

demonstrate unique locomotive capabilities by leveraging their small size, mesoscale

fabrication methods, and surface effects.

Many animal species
1–5 exhibit multimodal locomotive

capabilities in terrestrial and aquatic environments to
evade predators or search for prey. A few arachnids3

and insects4 can move on the surface of water by exploiting static
surface tension. The surface tension force significantly exceeds
(over 10 times) their body weight, enabling rapid locomotion and
even jumping without breaking the water surface6. Remarkably
some insects, such as diving flies4 and diving beetles7,8, can also
generate enough force to spontaneously break the water surface to
swim, feed, and lay eggs underwater. The ability to move on the
water surface, controllably transition into water, and swim
underwater enable these creatures to live in complex environ-
ments (e.g., high salinity environment such as the Mono Lake4)
that most animals cannot survive.

Robots that can traverse complex terrains, such as hybrid
terrestrial-aquatic environments, are suitable for diverse
applications in environmental monitoring and the exploration
of confined spaces. Taking inspiration from nature, many
robotic prototypes9–12 have been developed for terrestrial-aquatic
locomotion. Most of these amphibious robots, however, weigh
over 100 g and cannot move on the water surface due to their
large weight-to-size ratio9–12. Microrobots (mass<20 g,
length<15 cm) have a smaller weight-to-size ratio, and they can
leverage surface effects, such as electrostatics or surface tension,
to perch on compliant surfaces13 or move on the surface of
water14–19. This confers several potential advantages; for example,
microrobots can avoid submerged obstacles by returning to the
water surface. Furthermore, microrobots experience smaller drag
on the water surface due to reduced wetted area, which leads to
higher locomotion speed compared to swimming underwater.
These hybrid locomotion capabilities could potentially allow
microrobots to explore diverse environments that are inaccessible
to larger robots.

Previous work14–20 on water strider-inspired microrobots
leveraged insights from studies of biological water striders21.
These robots weigh 6–20 g, are 8–15 cm long, and use hydro-
phobic wires for support on the water surface. These devices were
used to investigate the biomechanics of water striders22,23, study
the associated fluid mechanics21, and enable microrobot loco-
motion on the water surface. Actual water striders are ~1 cm long
and weigh 4.5 mg, and they are over 10 times smaller and
1000 times lighter than these microrobots. Since the surface
tension force scales linearly with the leg contact length and mass
scales with length cubed, these robots need to use supporting legs
that are substantially longer than their bodies. These supporting
legs create challenges for locomotion in other environments, such
as on land or underwater.

In this study, we develop a 1.6 g quadrupedal microrobot that
is capable of walking on land, moving on the surface of water, and
transitioning between land, the water surface, and aquatic
environments (Supplementary Movie 1). We address two chal-
lenges that are unexamined in previous studies: gait design for
multimodal locomotion24 in terrestrial and aquatic environments,
and strategies for transitions between these environments. First,
we develop gaits for locomotion on land and the water surface
utilizing a quadrupedal robot with two independently controlled
degrees-of-freedom (DOFs) in each leg. Second, we design “feet”
that utilize both surface tension and surface tension induced
buoyancy to generate the necessary supporting force without
inhibiting terrestrial locomotion. The “feet” utilize electrowet-
ting25–27 to break the water surface. Electrowetting refers to the
changing of the liquid to solid surface contact angle in response to
an applied voltage, and it is commonly found in microfluidics
or electronic paper display applications26. We further examine
the influence of surface tension on the robot during underwater-
to-land transitions. Design changes to the robot’s legs and

transmission (compared to a previous version28) allow it to
overcome a force that is twice its body weight and break the water
surface to transition back onto land.

In summary, this work develops multimodal strategies for
locomotion in terrestrial and aquatic environments, describes
novel mesoscale devices for water surface to underwater transi-
tions, and analyzes the influence of surface tension on microrobot
aquatic to terrestrial transitions. These studies culminate in the
first terrestrial-aquatic microrobot that adapts to complex
environments, representing advances in mesoscale fabrication
and microrobot locomotive capabilities.

Results
Robot design and demonstration. We base our robot design
on the Harvard Ambulatory MicroRobot (HAMR), which is a
1.43 g quadrupedal robot with eight independently actuated
DOFs29. Two piezoelectric actuators control the swing (fore/aft)
and lift (vertical) motion of each leg. The robot is fabricated based
on the PC-MEMS process28,30 and the robot transmissions are
made of compliant 25 µm polyimide flexures (Kapton, Dupont).
In previous studies28,29, a number of walking gaits such as the
trot, pronk, and jump are shown to be capable of high speed
locomotion on land.

Several design modifications are implemented (Fig. 1a) to
enable locomotion on the water surface, controllable sinking, and
transitions from underwater to land. The legs are equipped with
passive, unidirectional flaps to facilitate swimming (Fig. 1b), and
with electrowetting pads (EWP-Fig. 1c) to generate surface
tension and buoyant forces to support the robot’s weight on
the water surface. To break the water surface and transition into
water, the EWPs utilize electrowetting to modify surface
wettability. In addition, design modifications are made to the
robot’s chassis and circuit boards to reduce the volume of air
trapped during sinking. To avoid shorting underwater, the
circuitry is coated in ~10 µm of Parylene C. Finally, the robot
transmissions are manually stiffened approximately two times to
improve vehicle payload, which allows a submerged robot to
break the water surface and transition back to land.

This robot can walk on level ground, transition from ground
onto the water surface, swim on the water surface to evade
underwater obstacles, sink into water by actuating its EWPs,
walk underwater, and transition back onto land by climbing an
incline (Fig. 2a, and Supplementary Movie 1). Figure 2b shows
a corresponding experimental demonstration of robot locomo-
tion. The robot moves at a speed of 7 cm s−1 using a 10 Hz trot
gait on level ground. To walk from land onto the water surface
(Fig. 2c, and Supplementary Movie 2), the robot walks down a
7° incline using a trot gait with a 1 Hz stride frequency to avoid
breaking the water surface in this process. Once the robot is
afloat, it swims (Fig. 2d, and Supplementary Movie 3) at a
speed of 2.8 cm s−1 using a 5 Hz swimming gait. To dive into
water, the actuators are switched off and a 600 V signal is
applied to the EWPs. The locally induced electric field modifies
the surface wettability, reduces the surface tension force, and
causes the robot to sink into water (Supplementary Movie 4).
Once the robot sinks to the bottom, it can walk underwater
(Fig. 2e, Supplementary Movie 5) using a trot gait at stride
frequencies up to 4 Hz. To transition back onto land, the robot
climbs an incline of up to 6° and gradually moves through the
water-air interface (Fig. 2f, g, and Supplementary Movie 6).
Further, the robot can demonstrate turning on land, on the
water surface, and underwater to avoid obstacles. In the
following sections, we describe detailed results on robot
swimming and transition between land, the water surface, and
underwater environments.

Floating and controllable sinking through electrowetting. One
of the major challenges in developing a robot capable of moving
on the water surface is to support the robot’s weight. Previously
developed water strider-inspired robots5,16,18 are 10 times larger
and 100–1000 times heavier than natural water striders, and they
rely on multiple, non-moving legs to support themselves on the
water surface. Such a design limits these robots’ ability to move
through cluttered environments and to traverse other types of
terrains. Here, we develop a novel design that substantially
reduces leg length, enables controllable sinking through electro-
wetting, and allows for multimodal locomotion on land, on the
water surface, and underwater.

An EWP (Fig. 3a) is installed on each leg of HAMR. The EWP
is ~1 cm in diameter, and it is made of a folded 5 µm thick copper
sheet coated by 15 µm Parylene (see Methods). This hydrophobic,
dielectric coating insulates the copper from water. Unlike
previous water surface supporting devices that only utilize surface
tension, our device relies on surface tension and surface tension
induced buoyancy. The maximum net upward force generated by
our device is given by:

F ¼ �γL cos θ þ ρwgAhw ð1Þ

where γ is the water surface tension coefficient, L is the net
contact length, θ is the contact angle between Parylene C and
water, ρW is the water density, g is the gravity, A is the EWP’s flat
area, and hw is the maximum deformation of the water surface
before breaking. The value of hw relates to the contact
angle between the EWP and the water surface, and consequently
the buoyancy term is dependent on the surface tension. The
dependence of hw on contact angle will be specified in equation
(4), and the values of the constants are given in Supplementary
Table 1. For our EWP design, equation (1) estimates that surface
tension contributes ~25% of the net upward force, and surface
tension induced buoyancy force accounts for the rest.
We note that the buoyancy contribution becomes even more
important than surface tension in heavier (>1 g) water striding
robots because contact area grows faster than contact length as
robot size increases. Our robot weighs 1.65 gram, and it can carry
1.44 gram of additional payload on the water surface. This
additional payload allows the robot to paddle its legs (up to 10

Hz) without breaking the water surface (Supplementary Movie 4),
which is crucial for robot locomotion.

This device further enables controllable and repeatable
transitions through the water surface. We define transition
controllability as the robot’s ability to dive into water at a desired
location and time. This form of controllability is absent in a
previous study24 that demonstrates transition by coating a
microrobot with a surfactant. Furthermore, we are only
concerned with sinking in shallow (<15 cm) and undisturbed
water. Under these conditions and without control of the robot’s
pose during sinking, the robot always lands on its feet because
its center of mass is lower than its geometric center. The EWPs
initiate sinking with the electrowetting process—the modification
of a surface’s wetting properties under an applied electric field.
When a voltage is applied to a conductive surface coated with a
dielectric layer, there is a reduction of the contact angle between
an electrolyte and the solid surface. This reduction of contact
angle leads to two effects that enable sinking: surface tension
reduction and spontaneous wetting.

First, the electrowetting process reduces surface tension by
reducing the contact angle between the EWP’s vertical walls and
the meniscus surface (Fig. 3b). When a 600 V signal is sent to the
EWP, an electric field perpendicular to the meniscus surface
(parallel to the free water surface) is generated and it leads to a
change of the contact angle governed by:

cos θ ¼ cos θN þ
ϵ0ϵl
2γdH

V2: ð2Þ

Here ϵ0 is the permittivity of free space, ϵl is the relative
permittivity, dH is the dielectric coating thickness, θN is the
nominal contact angle, and V is the applied voltage. This
reduction of contact angle reduces the upward surface tension
force governed by the first term of equation (1). According to
equation (2), a hydrophobic coating (θN > 90°) can become
hydrophilic (θ < 90°) under a large voltage input, which changes
the weight-bearing surface tension force to a downward pulling
force.

The EWP’s vertical walls are important for reducing surface
tension because they lower the required operating voltage and
mitigate the problem of dielectric breakdown. Without the

vertical walls, the fringing electric fields generated by the EWP’s
horizontal surface are much weaker. This requires a higher
input voltage to achieve a similar reduction in contact angle,
and can potentially cause dielectric breakdown of the insulating
Parylene coating. Compared to a flat foot pad, the EWP’s
vertical walls strengthen the electric field between the device
and the water surface meniscus (Fig. 3b) under the same input
voltage. The conflicting relationship between contact angle
reduction and dielectric breakdown is illustrated in Supple-
mentary Figure 1a. The quadratic curve shows the required
voltage that achieves a 100° contact angle reduction as a
function of coating thickness, and the straight line shows the
maximum EWP operating voltage before dielectric breakdown.
The intersection of these lines predicts the minimum required
coating thickness. To account for coating inhomogeneity of the
fabrication process and the contact angle saturation effect,

we choose a coating thickness of 15 µm and an operating
voltage of 600 V.

The height of the EWP’s vertical sidewalls can be determined
by analyzing the water meniscus profile31. The meniscus height
(Fig. 3b) near the vertical sidewalls relates to the local contact
angle:

hv ¼

p
k�1; ð3Þ

where k�1 ¼ ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiγ=ρgp and it is defined as the characteristic length.
This formula predicts the meniscus height to be ~3 mm. To
ensure the local electric field is approximately perpendicular to
the water meniscus, we set the EWP’s sidewalls to be 4 mm tall,
which is slightly larger than the meniscus height.

Following the reduction of surface tension, the buoyancy force
also decreases due to change of hw, which leads to spontaneous

wetting on the EWP’s horizontal surface. Recall that hw is the
maximum height difference between a static meniscus and a flat
surface before the liquid spontaneously spreads on the surface
(Fig. 3c). The relationship between hw and the surface contact
angle is given by:

hw ¼ 2k�1 sin
θ

2
: ð4Þ

For the EWP design, hw reduces from 5mm to 2 mm when the
input voltage increases from 0 V to 600 V, which implies that the
surface tension induced buoyancy force is reduced (second term
of equation 1). Consequently, both surface tension and buoyancy
force reduce and cause the robot to sink into water (Fig. 3d).
Supplementary Figure 1b and Supplementary Movie 4 illustrate
the spontaneous wetting process on a flat copper sheet coated
with 15 µm of Parylene. In summary, charging the EWP’s
sidewalls reduces the surface tension force, and charging the
EWP’s horizontal surface lowers the buoyancy force.

We characterize the EWP performance by measuring the
maximum surface tension force at different input voltages

(see Methods for experimental setup). Figure 3e compares the
experimental measurement with the predicted values from
equations (1), (2), and (4). The model shows good agreement
with experiments for input voltages smaller than 400 V. The
model underestimates the net upward force for input voltages
higher than 400 V because it does not consider the contact angle
saturation phenomenon25, which is an experimental observation
that no material can become completely hydrophilic regardless of
the input voltage amplitude. In future studies, this discrepancy
between model and measurement may be reduced by using
alternative dielectric coatings that have smaller saturation angles.

Our experiments show that the maximum upward force an
EWP generates is 11.5 mN. This force reduces to 8.2 mN when a
constant signal of 600 V is sent to the device. This measurement is
an upper bound of the EWP’s performance as it is rigidly
mounted on a force sensor. When installed on the mircorobot,
the EWP’s horizontal surface may not be parallel to the water
surface due to fabrication imperfection, causing a reduction in
contact area and maximum surface forces. As a result, we
measure the maximum robot weight to be 3.09 g (65% of the
maximum static measurement) before sinking.

Locomotion on the water surface. In addition to floating on the
water surface, the robot is capable of locomotion including
swimming forward and turning. Existing designs14–20 based on
water striders cannot be applied to our robot because stationary,
long supporting legs inhibit walking on the ground. Instead, we
require the robot to use the same set of actuators and legs to move
on the water surface. This requirement imposes two major
challenges: symmetric walking gaits for terrestrial locomotion
cannot generate net propulsive force due to the time reversibility
property of low Reynolds number flow, and the amplitude of the
robot legs’ swing motion, and thus the induced drag force, is
substantially less than that of biological examples such as the

diving beetles (Dytiscus marginalis) and the diving flies
(Ephydra hians).

Diving beetles swim underwater by paddling their hind
legs asymmetrically (Fig. 4a) to generate unidirectional thrust7.
During the power stroke, the hind leg tarsus and tibia flatten to
maximize projected area and increase forward thrust. During the
recovery stroke, the hind leg tarsus and tibia retract to minimize
the projected area and reduce backward drag. Previous
biomimetic studies analyzed the diving beetle’s paddling leg
trajectories and showed that they can be modeled by two serial
links connected to each other and the body by two actuated
rotational joints32,33.

Taking inspiration from the diving beetle’s physiology
and swimming mechanics, we develop passive swimming
flaps34 that generate asymmetric gaits for water surface locomo-
tion. The robot leg and its flap constitute a two-serial links
system: the leg motion is controlled and the flap rotation is
passively mediated through an elastic joint. As shown in Fig. 1c,
the flaps are fully submerged in water while the robot rests on the
water surface. The flaps are designed to be passive devices that
retract in a single direction. During the fast downstroke (Fig. 4b),
the flaps remain fully open to generate forward thrust. During the
slow upstroke (Fig. 4b), the flaps collapse to reduce drag. The flap
rotation is passively mediated by forces from an elastic flexure,
drag from the surrounding fluid, and the flap inertia. Conse-
quently, developing an appropriate driving motion for the robot
leg is crucial for achieving desired flapping kinematics35.

To design the swimming kinematics and determine the flap
area, inertia, and flexure stiffness, we conduct at-scale flapping
experiments and construct quasi-steady, dynamical simulations
(see Supplementary Notes 1–3 and Supplementary Figure 2). The
kinematic parameters of stroke angle (ψ) and pitch angle (α) are
defined in the Supplementary Note 1, and they are labeled in
Fig. 4d and Supplementary Figure 2c. During swimming, the
robot’s lift actuators are switched off and a piecewise sinusoidal
driving signal is sent to the swing actuator (Fig. 4c). As shown in
Fig. 4c, the fast downstroke occupies 10% of the flapping period,
the slow upstroke takes 50% of the flapping period, and the
actuator remains stationary for the remaining 40% of the time to
allow the flap to return its nominal orientation.

Figure 4d shows a single leg flapping experiment using this
driving signal at 5 Hz. The flap remains flattened during the fast
downstroke (T= 0 to T= 0.1). At stroke reversal (T= 0.1), the

flap begins to collapse while the leg slows down and reverses
direction. This collapsing behavior is mainly due to the flap
inertia and the force from the surrounding fluid. During the slow
upstroke (T= 0.1 to T= 0.6), the flap remains collapsed to
reduce drag. During the recovery phase (T= 0.6 to T= 1), the
actuator is held stationary and the flap slowly rotates back to its
nominal position due to the restoring torque from the flexure.

Figure 4e shows the tracked stroke angle (ψ) and the passive
flap angle (α), and superimposes the simulated stroke and flap
motion based on the input signal from Fig. 4c. We observe
qualitative agreement between the quasi-steady simulation and
the experimental measurement. The error of the maximum
predicted flap angle and phase offset are 4° and 6% period,
respectively. As detailed in the supplemental material, this error
arises primarily from ignoring the added mass effects and the
collision between the flap and the central strut during the
downstroke. We further estimate the drag force profile using
the quasi-steady model. As shown in Fig. 4f, the thrust force is
mainly generated during the downstroke, whereas the drag force
during the upstroke and stroke recovery is small. Here the model
estimates the time averaged force to be 0.13 mN from a single leg
actuated at 5 Hz.

Driving all four robot legs with the same signal from Fig. 4c, we
demonstrate robot forward swimming on the water surface. For
the experiment shown in Fig. 5a, the robot swims 32 cm in
12 seconds, with an average speed of 2.7 cm s−1 (0.7 body length
(BL) per second). Figure 5b shows the instantaneous robot
swimming speed extracted from a high-speed video of another
swimming experiment (Supplementary Movie 3). The maximum
and mean swimming speed are 8.1 (2.1 BL s−1) and 2.8 cm s−1

(0.7 BL s−1), respectively. In addition to swimming forward, the

actuators on the left or right side, respectively. Figure 5c, d, and

Supplementary Table 2 lists the robot cost of transport for
locomotion on land, underwater, on the water surface, and on an
incline. The cost of transport for moving on the water surface is
18% higher than that of walking on land.

Underwater to land transition. Our microrobot is capable of
walking and avoiding obstacles underwater (Supplementary
Movie 5) and climbing up an incline to transition back onto land
(Supplementary Movie 6). When it is fully submerged, the robot
uses terrestrial walking gaits to demonstrate turning and walking.
We estimate that buoyancy force accounts for 40% of the robot
weight, which enhances locomotion and improves payload
capacity underwater. In the aquatic-to-terrestrial transition pro-
cess, there are two major challenges: overcoming the surface
tension and climbing an incline.

As the robot moves through the air-water interface, the water
surface exerts an inhibiting, downward force whose magnitude is
approximately equal to the robot’s weight. Although the robot
can climb up an 11° incline underwater on surfaces covered by
polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), it is unable to break the water
surface of while climbing up a 6° PDMS surface (Fig. 6a, and
Supplementary Movie 7). Figure 6b shows the tracked robot front
and hind leg trajectories: when completely submerged, the robot’s
front legs lift higher than its hind legs (red colored regions in
Fig. 6b) due to the rearward location of its center of mass. Surface
tension forces push down on the front of the robot as it moves
out of water, inducing a clockwise torque with respect to the
robot center of mass and causing the hind legs to lift higher than
the front legs (blue colored regions in Fig. 6b). As the robot
continues to climb upward, the body torque induced by surface
tension becomes counterclockwise, causing the front legs to lift
higher again (red colored regions in Fig. 6b). In this process, the
downward surface tension force gradually increases and ulti-
mately causes the robot hind legs to stick to the incline surface,
preventing forward locomotion.

To quantify the magnitude of water surface tension force
during the transition process, we measure the net force on a robot
as it is slowly pulled out of water (Supplementary Fig. 3). As
shown in Fig. 6c, the surface tension forces on the robot’s circuit
board and EWPs are approximately 16 mN and 9.3 mN,
respectively. Although these forces are comparable to the robot’s
weight, previous work has demonstrated that HAMR can carry
2.9 g of additional payload36 on flat surfaces.

These force measurements are conducted while mounting the
robot parallel to the water surface, and consequently they do not
account for the influence of the torque induced by the surface

tension force during the transition process. To quantify the
influence of the surface tension torque, we pull the robot through
the water surface on a 3° incline and quantify the deformation
of the robot legs’ transmission. As shown in the top view of
Fig. 6d, the robot hind legs are splayed out further than the robot
front legs, indicating that there is a larger force pushing down on
the back of the robot. In an unloaded configuration (Fig. 1a), the
robot’s legs are approximately perpendicular with respect to the
ground. In the configuration pictured in Fig. 6d, the robot hind
legs splay outward 19° compared to the nominal leg orientation.
This causes the back of the robot body to sag down and its front
to tilt up. The side view in Fig. 6d shows that the robot body
pitching increases to 14° (θB) on a 3° (θI) incline. This unfavorable
body pitching θB exacerbates the adverse effects of climbing an
incline, causing the robot’s front legs to lift higher and preventing
the robot’s rear legs from lifting off the ramp surface.

We make two major modifications to mitigate the adverse
effects caused by surface tension during underwater-to-ground
transitions. First, the legs and swimming flaps are redesigned and
fabricated monolithically using a 150 µm carbon fiber laminate,
substantially reducing the deformation of the entire structure
under load. In addition, we reduce the compliance of the legs’ lift
DOF by manually biasing the leg downward during the assembly
process as detailed in a previous study37. This preloads the
flexures to create a force bias that opposes gravity, effectively
altering the transmission ratio to increase stiffness and reduce
sagging. Second, we attach PDMS-coated foot pads to the robot’s
front legs to increase friction. The experiment illustrated in
Fig. 6a, b shows that the robot’s front and hind legs serve different
functions during the transition process. The surface tension
induced torque inhibits hind leg liftoff and increases friction on
the hind legs. In contrast, the front legs experience lower normal
and frictional forces which results in slipping. Attaching PDMS
foot pads to the robot front legs increases friction on the front
legs and reduces slipping.

Figure 6e shows a composite image of the robot climbing out of
water on an acrylic, 3° incline at an average speed of 0.75 cm s−1.
Compared to the side view in Fig. 6d, this image shows that the
modified robot does not pitch up noticeably during the transition
process. Figure 6f further illustrates the corresponding front and
hind leg trajectories. The lift motions of both front and back legs
reduce as the robot feet emerge from the water surface. Once the
robot front legs completely exit the water surface, the front legs’
lift amplitudes recover. Due to surface tension force and torque,
the cost of transport for transitioning from underwater to land is
approximately four times larger than walking on level ground
(Supplementary Table 2).

Discussion
Our presentation of a hybrid terrestrial-aquatic microrobot
includes a novel mesoscale device design that uses electrowetting
to control surface tension magnitude and achieve controllable and
repeatable water surface to underwater transitions, a multimodal
strategy for locomotion on terrestrial domains and the water
surface, and a detailed analysis of the challenges imposed
by surface tension during a microrobot’s transition from under-
water to land. Our design satisfies the various constraints
imposed by microrobot actuation, payload, and the different
environments. Although many of these constraints lead to con-
flicting design requirements, they can be reconciled by
leveraging physics, such as electrowetting or surface tension,
unique to the millimeter scale. For instance, we design foot pads
that rely on surface tension and surface tension induced buoyancy
to reduce foot size. Furthermore, by leveraging electrowetting
principles, we design four 25 mg EWPs that can both statically

support 1.9 times the robot weight and sink the robot when
actuated. Finally, whereas legged terrestrial locomotion involves
discontinuous contact dynamics and friction, aquatic flapping
locomotion at the low Reynolds number regime is continuous
and requires asymmetric strokes. Using a combination of passive
flaps and asymmetric driving, we develop a swimming strategy
that has a similar cost of transport compared to robot terrestrial
locomotion.

Compared to hybrid terrestrial-aquatic insects, microrobots
have shortcomings in actuation and power density but also
possess advantages in using engineered materials and electrostatic
devices. To dive into water, a diving fly4 can exert a downward
force larger than 18 times its weight to overcome surface tension.
Piezoelectric actuators cannot deliver such high force; however, a
microrobot can utilize electrowetting to modify wettability
−something that is unobserved among insects. In the case of
swimming, the shortcomings in actuation can be compensated by
exploiting fluid-structure interactions in passive mechanisms.

Whereas a diving beetle7 can paddle with asymmetric power
stroke and recovery stroke by independently controlling the
motion of its tibia and tarsus8, a microrobot can generate similar
asymmetric paddling motion by merely controlling its leg (ana-
logous to tarsus) swing. The flap (analogous to tibia) rotation is
passively controlled through the coupling between the fluid flow,
the flap inertia, and the elastic hinge to achieve efficient loco-
motion on the surface of water.

Further, this is a demonstration of a microrobot capable
of performing tasks that are difficult for larger robots. To the
best of our knowledge, no existing robot can walk on land,
swim on the water surface, and transition between these envir-
onments. By leveraging surface effects that dominate at the mil-
limeter scale, this work shows a microrobot can outperform
larger ones in specific applications. In search and rescue
missions, our robot has the potential to move through cluttered
environments that are not accessible to larger terrestrial or
aquatic robots.

Future studies can explore several topics to further improve
microrobot locomotive capabilities in complex environments. Due
to the lack of control during the sinking process, the current robot
may flip over in presence of disturbances such as surface waves
and dynamic flow underwater. Further, the robot cannot return to
land without a modest ramp. These limitations can be addressed
by enabling underwater swimming and improving climbing cap-
abilities in hybrid terrestrial-aquatic microrobots. To demonstrate
swimming, future research could involve designing meso-scale
devices for buoyancy control24, developing leg structures and
associated gaits to generate lift force in addition to thrust, and
conducting dynamical analysis to investigate underwater stability.
To climb steeper incline or to return to land without a ramp,
future research can incorporate electrostatic adhesion13, gecko-
inspired adhesives38, or impulsive jumping mechanisms24.

Methods
EWP fabrication. The robot foot pad is fabricated from a 5 µm copper sheet. First,
the copper sheet is cut into the desired pattern (Fig. 3a) using diode-pulsed solid
state (DPSS) laser. Next, vertical walls around the foot pad base are manually
folded by 90° under a microscope (Fig. 3a). Then we solder the foot pad using
51-gauge quadruple insulated wire and coat the device using Parylene C. The
coatingprocess takes ~12 h to deposit a uniform layer of 15 µm Parylene C. Finally,
the foot pad is attached to a 70 µm thick, circular fiber glass (FR4) piece (Fig. 3a).
The fiber glass connection piece prevents the foot pad from shorting to the robot
chassis.

Experimental setup for measuring surface tension on the EWP. An EWP is
mounted on a capacitive force sensor and slowly pushed into water at ~0.2 mm s−1

(Supplementary Fig. 1c). The net instantaneous force is measured by the force
sensor. The red arrows in Supplementary Figure 1d, e indicate the difference
between the minimum force and the net force once the EWP is completely sub-
merged. This value represents the maximum upward force an EWP can generate.
As shown in Supplementary Figure 1d, e, the net upward force reduces by 30%
when a 600 V signal is sent to the EWP.

Experimental setup for robot locomotion demonstration. We built a 45 cm ×
45 cm × 8 cm aquarium to conduct robot locomotion experiments in terrestrial and
aquatic environments (Supplementary Fig. 4a). The aquarium is filled with deio-
nized water at a depth of 4 cm. A 5 cm tall, 6° ramp is placed in the aquarium
for the robot to walk from land to the water surface. An ~3 cm tall underwater
obstacle is placed in the robot’s swimming path. A 4 cm tall, 3° ramp is placed
in the aquarium for the robot to climb out of water. Two cameras are placed
above and on the side of the aquarium to take top and side view videos. The
water in the aquarium is connected to electrical ground. The robot end-to-end
locomotion experiments are conducted four times to demonstrate robot
robustness and repeatability, and these trajectories are overlaid in Supplementary
Figure 4b.
