Bitcoin tumbles as regulators start
clamping down on trading

BITCOIN’S boom and bust continues. Towards the end of last year, the

digital currency was trading at just under $20,000. This week it dipped

below $6000.

Turbulence has come to be expected with cryptocurrencies, and the

latest drop isn’t the biggest ever. But this week has seen a flurry of

announcements that seem to be contributing to bitcoin’s bursting

bubble.

The People’s Bank of China said it will block foreign digital currency

trading websites using the so-called Great Firewall of China. It has

already shut down domestic exchanges. Regulators in South Korea,

Russia and India have also announced clampdowns. And some banks

have banned customers from buying bitcoin with their credit cards, with

Lloyds Banking Group and Virgin Money both added to that list on

Monday.

Many said that the current cryptocurrency bubble had to burst, the only

question remaining is: how low will bitcoin go?
