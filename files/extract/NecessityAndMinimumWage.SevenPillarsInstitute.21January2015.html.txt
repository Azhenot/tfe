						Necessity and Minimum Wage

						June 23rd, 2016 by Kara in Case Studies
					
					 

 



By John Atherton

Compare someone’s choice to buy a luxurious decoration with the 
purchase of a prescription that staves off death. While one of these 
choices is an aesthetic preference the other is a necessity of survival.
 The distinction between these choices separates economic ‘wants’ and 
‘needs’. A dependence on survival needs forces human behaviour through 
naturally imposed duress, compromising our freedom of choice. A moral 
right to freedom or existence argues for the removal of this duress in 
favour of a default state, where survivalist compulsion is made irrelevant.

A perfect default state would be a system where our freedom 
to choose a necessity is raised until it resembles our freedom to choose
 a luxury. To achieve this ideal, the mitigation of natural duress 
through a guarantee of survival is considered in the practical model of a
 minimum wage. At present, despite any choice we make, we cannot exist 
without the necessities. The ability to meet the costs of food, water 
and shelter are a start in delaying the repercussions of our natural 
shackles [1]. If we did not need these to survive, but regard them as 
optional, then our choice to buy them could certainly be considered more
 freely made. How does the conflict between compulsion to satisfy the 
needs of survival and freedom of choice factor into the economics of the
 minimum wage?


Self Sufficiency

The 2006 self sufficiency standard used in The United States of 
America contains the major categories of housing, child care, food, 
transportation and healthcare [2]. We call the cost of these provisions 
the ‘cost of living’, though this amount varies both locally and abroad.
 Internationally, different nations use different standards; Canada, for
 example, assumes education is provided freely by the state to Canadian 
residents. Education assists all models, including those considered 
later in this article, and there is a valid case for it to be included 
as a need, though for this analysis current measurements and their 
respective assumptions are used. The cost of living in different 
counties also varies while within the same county the cost of having 
children is the final point of difference. Two examples from a standard 
researched in 2006 are listed below.

 

The Self-Sufficiency Standard for 
Selected Family Types* Harrisburg-Carlisle, PA MSA, 2006 Dauphin County 
Monthly Expenses and Shares of Total Budgets



Table 1: 2006, University of Washington for PathWaysPA [2].

 

The Self-Sufficiency Standard for Seattle-Bellevue*, WA HMFA, 2006 King County – Bellevue, Juanita, Kirkland and Redmond



Table 2: 2006, Washington University for the Workforce Development Council of Seattle-King County [3].

* The Standard is 
calculated by adding expenses and taxes and subtracting tax credits. 
Taxes include federal and state income taxes (including state tax 
credits except state IETC and CTC) and payroll taxes. 

** The hourly wage is calculated by dividing the monthly wage by 176 hours (8 hours per day times 22 days per month). 

*** The hourly 
wage for families with two adults represents the hourly wage that each 
adult would need to earn, while the monthly and annual wages represent 
both parents’ wages combined. 

 

Taking the moral imperative of an inherent right to a default state, 
(a right to exist), into account where do these figures leave us? The 
beginning of this analysis resides in discussing merely the cost of 
living of a single adult verses the current minimum wage of $7.25; 
though the variation in cost of living figures makes this difficult. 
Given the difference between local self sufficiency wages we can first 
say the minimum wage should definitely be higher than the lowest living 
wage. If one said so relating to The United States as a whole then it 
would only be feasible for minimum wage workers to live in the cheapest 
county of the entire nation, a mildly impractical notion given the 
distribution of minimum wage jobs throughout the country. If we took the
 lowest self sufficiency wage from a state we would find ourselves with a
 reduced version of the same problem. There is presently no pervasive 
survey connecting minimum wage job locations to the cheapest nearby 
residencies so we will have to approximate.

Taking the United States’ GDP per capita, the International Monetary 
Fund, World Bank and Central Intelligence Agency would all quote a 
figure between $54,000-$55,000, though a great deal of income is unseen 
by the average American due to the extreme nature of wealth inequality 
making the $28,889 per capita income figure quoted by the United States 
Census Bureau paint a more realistic picture with regards to the scope 
of the minimum wage worker [4, 5, 6, 7].

If we made the approximation that a minimum wage worker should, if 
making purely survival based purchases (leaving no money for luxury or 
lifestyle), be able to live in neighbourhoods along people earning 
$28,889 or less, how effective would this be as a measure?

Even attempting to base a minimum wage off approximations of the 
survival wage in this manner is inadequate. In Bellevue, Juanita, 
Kirkland and Redmond – King County, Washington State, for example, where
 the survival wage for an adult individual is on the higher side at 
$41,767, it might seem unreasonable to say that it should be expected 
that a minimum wage worker should not be able to afford to live there 
[7]. That is, however, until you also consider that King County is by 
far the most populated county in Washington with over 2 million people 
(almost 30% of the state’s population).

Furthermore, though the survival wage drops to almost $8 for the 
652,000 residents of Seattle, it is $9.49 in Renton, and higher still 
for all remaining fractions of King County up until the $10.30 hourly 
wage seen in Table 2 [3]. In Pennsylvania, residents of Dauphin County 
earn $30,491 per capita with a survival standard of $17,392 whilst back 
in Kitsap County, Washington, per capita income is a higher $32,340 
while the annual survival wage is the lowest value of any recorded 
county in the state at a staggeringly low $13,807; requiring an hourly 
wage of $6.54 [2, 3, 7].

The conclusion of these widely varying survival and income figures is
 given all these counties employ minimum wage workers, if we do not want
 higher unemployment or increased transport costs the minimum wage must 
be above the survival wage in a given area for employment to truly be 
viable from the perspective of the employee. In analysing these 
differences one might also ponder the ethical positions posed by varying
 minimum wages and its varying effect on local employment, though this 
article will focus on the nation as a whole.

One national poverty model used by The Financial Times (US), calls 
three member households earning near or less than $31,402 a year “in or 
near to poverty”, with this affliction affecting one fifth of the 
American population [8]. Using the assumptions of the model above, if a 
single adult in these households worked, he would have to earn $14.87 an
 hour, or if two members worked full time then they would have to earn 
$7.43 an hour each. This poverty line is still a more conservative 
estimate than the local realities of Dauphin and King County, where a 
single adult living alone without any children at all would have to earn
 $8.23 and $8.06-$10.30 respectively. By all these standards a full time
 worker earning minimum wage may well be living in poverty.

Spending and Profitability

Employment is the next key issue when it comes to the minimum wage; 
specifically regarding what is practical for employers. Regardless of a 
wage based on the cost of living, if the value of a person’s employment 
is lower than their wage then their employer would incur a loss for 
hiring them. If this occurs a rational employer would not hire 
them in the first place, making the minimum wage’s equivocation with a 
survival wage irrelevant to those left unemployed. From a 
consequentialist standpoint, where practical feasibility is favoured 
over intangible principled motivation, employer incentives must be met 
for a minimum wage increase to be permissible. By extension, doing so 
must be economically advantageous for it to be affirmed. Consider these 
principled motivations followed by a more pragmatic, consequentialist 
approach in analysing the minimum wage.

If productivity exceeds income then employment is profitable. 
Additionally, if one supports the right of an individual to the ‘sweat 
of their brow’, or justice, then a wage nearing productivity and hence a
 minimum wage nearing minimum productivity would be supported morally, 
as a practical implementation of meritocracy. Furthermore, with relation
 to the moral concept of egalitarian redistribution, a moral argument 
independent of a right to existence can also be made. The first of these
 arguments is met in any system, with or without intervention, where the
 minimum wage is set near the productivity wage. The second is met where
 a minimum wage, (or similar scheme), is set higher than the cost of 
living such that a person might not merely survive but also develop. 
Finally, the imperative to be free of the coercion of the natural order 
requires a minimum wage, (or similar scheme), that is, at the very 
least, equal to the cost of living.

All three of these positions also overlap a position of Deontological
 Capitalism. From the employer’s standpoint a person should not be 
viewed as a resource or means, affirming their right to their own labour
 as stated by the first moral position. The facilitation for personal 
growth proposed by the second aligns with the portion of the Categorical
 Imperative where one is both subject and sovereign, as a world in which
 all workers were entrenched in the circumstances of the minimum wage 
worker would be vastly inferior [9]. The third of these positions finds 
comports with Kantian Ethics also, where someone’s survival may be seen 
as their responsibility as an independent rational agent. If a minimum 
wage is set above the cost of living, but not above the productivity 
wage, then all these positions are in agreement.

In contrast to this, however, a consequentialist might argue that the
 viability of any proposition is the most important consideration. A 
utilitarian, by extension, also favours an argument for redistribution 
given diminishing returns on happiness from wealth – provided practical 
viability is demonstrated [10]. Beyond a level of inequality required as
 incentive, if income distribution had no effect on spending habits, 
alongside an increase in happiness, then a utilitarian would affirm it 
[11]. Often, however, more equitable systems see improved economic 
conditions, affirming even a consequentialist position without happiness
 as a criterion. What are the practical benefits of an increased minimum
 wage?

The reason for this relates to spending behaviour. Someone whose wage
 equals survival wage, for example, cannot afford to save. His spending 
is continuously circulated throughout the economy, its effect in turn 
amplified by the multipliers of the sectors it is engaged in. If these 
sectors spend more, such as on wages, then their multiplier is also 
increased [12]. This increased rate of capital circulation promotes 
economic growth. A change in income of a set amount also has an 
increased effect on consumer behaviour for lower income earners, and 
hence promotes higher consumer confidence and spending behaviour [13].

There are further studies on the effects of minimum wage increases 
too, with a study from the CEPR noting that even if prices increase from
 a wage hike then the net effect recorded is still positive [14]. This 
means it may be the case that the cyclical effect noted earlier could 
compensate for a wage increase above current productivity, effectively 
increasing productivity provided the wage increase is minimal. Beyond 
the general wage figures discussed later in this article minor 
increases, if supported by specific case studies, indicates the minimum 
wage can be marginally higher.

With regard to competition and unemployment, negative effects to 
employment were not found in a study of two neighbouring states where 
one increased its minimum wage, but where the increased minimum wage was
 still below the productivity wage [15]. The most obvious positive 
effect of all this to a utilitarian, however, is not just the increase 
to happiness from wealth redistribution, but also the reduction of the 
suffering of poverty [16].

Returning to the potential conflict between the survival and 
productivity wages we find a similar consideration. In all places where 
the productivity wage exceeds ‘cost of living’ employment is profitable.
 In determining a viable minimum wage we should be aware that moderation
 is required. What is the viable minimum wage?

The Cost of Living and Productivity

With the viable wage near or below productivity, while hopefully 
exceeding the cost of living, we need to find the productivity wage for 
minimum wage workers. Though specific figures are difficult to quantify 
we can judge the rate of growth in wages against the growth in 
productivity. The following graph was made using data from the economic 
policy institute, noting the value of the minimum wage against 
productivity when we factor out inflation.

 



Graph 1: Productivity and Minimum Wage (Economic Policy Institute [17])

 

These figures suggest that if the minimum wage kept pace with 
productivity it would soon reach $20, well exceeding the $15 hourly 
minimum wage some people are suggesting. Furthermore, these results, 
along with general results about average worker compensation, (which 
also have lost pace with productivity to a huge extent since the 1970s 
much like the minimum wage [18]), were noted in an article by the 
Economic Policy Institute discussing a $12 minimum wage, (by 2020, or 
$10.58 in 2014$), noting how it would only be just above the $9.54, (in 
2014$), minimum wage from 1968 before the decline in the wage’s real 
value due to inflation [17].

Though a $12 minimum wage would account for inflation, given the 
increase of productivity, minimum wage workers are performing a far more
 productive service today, so their minimum wage should not be merely 
indexed, but increased to account for the fact that they are more
 productive today. According to this graph, their productivity wage in 
2014 was $18.42 [17]. Setting this as a minimum wage, or just the $15 
minimum wage some politicians are suggesting, should account for the 
difference in living costs while keeping minimum wage work profitable. 
An $18.42 wage would go further morally, though an increase to the 
minimum wage would certainly be advised.

Wage stagnation in general also entails further consequentialist 
harms from lowered general spending behaviour mentioned earlier, 
decreasing confidence, increasing inequity, increasing reliance on debt 
and instability [19]. Present levels of inequality have been linked to 
greatly more financially difficult college years, making it more 
difficult for people to increase human capital through education, 
thereby slowing economic growth [12, 19].

All of this, however, is assuming the data are accurate. There is 
also some criticism that should be considered in evaluating this data. 
The first is that the data for productivity relate to the whole economy,
 rather than just minimum wage work. Although the minimum wage seemed to
 keep pace with productivity until 1968 we cannot assume it continued to
 increase as quickly. One way to gauge the productivity increase of 
minimum wage work more accurately is to use percentage growth figures 
released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in specific industries, and 
analyse sectors with more minimum wage workers such as the ‘Fast Food 
Industry’, (Accommodation and Food Services – Limited Service 
Restaurants). This approach was used by the Heritage Foundation in 
criticism of a minimum wage rise.

In doing so it noted that the percentage growth in wages seemed 
similar to the percentage growth in productivity, though there is a huge
 fault in this method. That flaw is that these percentage growth figures
 only date back in the Labor Department’s records to 1987, while the 
source of the disparity dates to 1968 [20, 21]. After 1968 productivity 
began to rise far more quickly than wages. In the graph using figures 
from the Economic Policy Institute the real value of the minimum wage 
actually declined.

This means if we use percentage change figures from 1987 they will 
fail to reflect the initial disparity. For example in 1987 a 20% 
increase to the minimum wage would be an estimated $1.34 (2014$), while a
 20% increase to productivity would be an estimated increase of $2.47 
(2014$). Although this method is preferable, as figures for specific 
industries are only available from 1987, this method cannot be used 
without reference to an initial disparity estimated by the negative 
redistribution of wealth in the general economy.

Using this approach, wages in the ‘Accommodation and Food Services – 
Limited Service Restaurants’ sector would be 13.5% up from the $12.35 
1987 productivity wage, placing it at around $14 as opposed to the 
approximately $8 minimum wage suggested by the article’s mathematics 
[22]. This $14 figure, however, is still an important tool for the 
specific consideration of this industry, though it too comes with its 
reduced generalisations and the enhanced potential for distortion from 
both historic and current tipping practices.

An additional disagreement with the validity of the graph is also 
raised by critics regarding how it accounts for inflation. On this 
account we have data back to 1968. The inflation figures given can be 
seen in the graph below.

 



Graph 2: Heritage Foundation calculations using Labor Department Figures [22].

 

There are three main methods of accounting for inflation. The 
Institute of Economic Policy used the Implicit Price Deflator (IPD) for 
productivity and the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for wages. By all three 
measures the real value of the minimum wage, ($7.25), has dropped, 
though by different amounts. Remember also that the real value should 
not just be constant, but increase with respect to workplace 
productivity and so be notably higher than any of these three figures 
making this more than a matter of a $0.14 difference if we take the most
 pessimistic projection for a minimum wage supporter.

Regardless, The Institute of Economic Policy did use the two methods 
which made the divide between productivity and wages appear the largest.
 If we were to use the same deflation method then the productivity wage 
is 22% lower, making deflation calculation an important factor. What is 
the difference between the CPI and the IPD?

Put simply the IPD relates to the economy overall while the CPI 
relates to a ‘basket of goods’ and is more a reflection of the part of 
the economy a minimum wage worker would likely make purchases in than 
the economy as a whole [12, 23]. Some measures of the IPD also exclude 
certain activity a minimum wage worker is likely to be affected by, such
 as transfer payments, (welfare), and household to household payments 
[24]. Effectively, both measures are designed for different things, with
 the CPI relating more to individuals while the IPD relates more to the 
economy generally. It is due to this difference that the Economic Policy
 Institute, (and other governments taking the same approach), would 
defend their method as most applicable to the measures of productivity 
and wages specifically while critics would claim the same measure should
 be used regardless to perform a fair test.

Knowing that the $18.42 wage would easily cover an individual’s cost 
of living and hence align rights based and consequentialist moral 
interests, is the same possible if you use the same deflator? In 2014$ 
it would be approximately $14.40, (taking the scaled deflator difference
 assuming productivity kept pace with average productivity growth) [25].
 In expensive cities like San Francisco $18.42 would be insufficient for
 single parent families and $14.40 would be insufficient altogether, 
though both figures would allow single adult workers in Jersey City, 
Washington D.C., Phoenix, Denver, Tacoma, Philadelphia, Indianapolis, 
Hartford and Charleston to now afford the self-sufficiency standard [3].
 Even this significantly reduced figure would still cover the cost of 
living in many counties, sustaining survival, profits and growth; though
 there are alternatives to the minimum wage, some of which argue profits
 aren’t enough motivation.

Alternatives to the Minimum Wage

Besides the minimum wage there are two common counter-models, the 
Income Earned Tax Credit, (also referred to as negative tax), and the 
complete abolition of any government intervention. An Income Earned Tax 
Credit is effectively a means tested and bureaucratically implemented 
payment from the government to anyone making below a certain wage, so 
the economy is taxed and a payment given to those earning the lowest 
income earners. Though it may involve the inefficiencies and costs of 
bureaucracy, the means testing capability becomes more important if you 
want to specifically target certain family structures, providing the 
argumentative basis for the similar programs of the Child Care Tax 
Credit and the Child Tax Credit, (also listed in Tables 1 & 2).

The Income Earned Tax Credit (IETC), in its current form, is 
considered by some studies to be ineffective without a significant 
increase in size [26]. This same study also makes note of the greater 
capacity for fraud opened by such a program. Of the information in 
Tables 1 and 2 none of the listed family structures would receive an 
Income Earned Tax Credit, though, a ‘one adult, one infant family’ in 
Dauphin County, Pennsylvania, would receive a payment of $34 from the 
program every month, covering 1% of the cost of living [2]. Practically,
 although we have cases of states as well as countries with higher 
minimum wages, we do not have the same range of information relating to 
the Income Earned Tax Credit making discussion around it speculative.

David Stockman, a proponent of the IETC, notes that minimum wage 
workers should also see machinery as competition to their employment. It
 is not enough for them to be profitable but for them to be more
 profitable than mechanical replacement [27]. Though the long term 
effects of this are inconclusive, the general trend of mechanical 
replacement does provide an analogy [28]. In a way, the IETC is the 
welfare equivalent of raising the minimum wage along greater 
restrictions on technological replacement, so a comparison could also be
 made between such a proposition and the IETC as it stands for those 
wanting to consider this further.

Beyond a comparison of the minimum wage and IETC, however, this 
discussion also raises general questions about technological growth. 
Technology is a major driver of economic growth, with machines ideally 
replacing the most primitive tasks while the human population becomes 
more productive through educational specialisation. If education is not 
sufficiently supported, however, a number of people might find 
themselves unskilled and unemployed. Historically, the former has been 
the most prevalent in the long term while the latter is the case in the 
short term.

Compared to increasing the IETC or minimum wage which both, either 
independently or combined, fulfils the moral right to a default state of
 choice, the position of laissez faire economics does not necessarily do
 so.

Laissez faire supporters claim the market equilibrium is the best 
measure of employment; however, this is based on free choice and high 
competition. With 4 million jobs available for 9 million unemployed, 
(discounting discouraged workers), the market may appear more evenly 
balanced than it actually is [29, 30, 31]. While anyone without 
disability can perform the mostly unskilled labour of minimum wage work,
 many of those 4 million jobs require technical skills a minimum wage 
worker may have financial difficulty obtaining [32, 33]. A sizable 
surplus in unemployed, unskilled labour and the lower bargaining power 
this creates, amidst the choice compromising coercion of necessity, are 
the main arguments against a laissez faire approach’s assumption of 
near-perfect competition.

In a typical supply-demand scenario the gradient of a curve relates 
to elasticity, (an elasticity of labour supply from employees and an 
elasticity of labour demand from employers respectively). Generally, 
elasticity is increased by every alternative choice an individual has. 
Elasticity, therefore, acts as a practical measure for choice in the 
market and hence, in the context of the aforementioned notion of 
meritocratic fairness, reflects both a practical and ethical reality. If
 workers are under the threat of poverty, they are more pressured into 
finding a job and their elasticity is decreased. Low labour supply 
elasticity means that if wages were cut by a given amount then the 
number of people who continue seeking employment decline by a far 
smaller margin. Given the surplus of people seeking employment, 
companies hardly have to compete with one another for unskilled workers 
as they might have to in technical fields [34]. In addition, there is 
little perception of competition for the most elite of the unskilled 
employees.

Although the best and brightest of software engineers might see 
exceptional offers due to their even more limited number, there is no 
such opportunity for the savant cashier, mitigating pressures from 
internal competition or an efficiency wage motive towards increasing 
minimum wage worker pay naturally. Combining these factors with an 
inelastic labour supply, many companies might prefer to lower their 
employees’ pay in spite of a relatively trivial decrease in the number 
of unskilled workers who would seek employment with them. The 
implication of this is imperfect competition, placing doubt upon 
simplified supply-demand model analysis [35, 36].

Elasticity also exists for employers; with technological alternatives
 to workers acting as an extra choice for employers. Therefore, 
reductions to their access to technological replacement either through 
direct regulation or indirectly through the IETC could be seen as a 
decrease to the long term elasticity of labour demand. Elasticity is 
often regarded as positive, as it permits natural market forces of 
change to change behaviour to more efficient practices for both the 
employer and employee. To this end, a consequentialist may view free 
choice in a marketplace positively beyond its perception either as a 
right or as distributive justice. It should also be noted that although 
most critics of meritocracy condemn its propensity for inequality and 
reliance on the natural state in the case of the minimum wage, its 
interests align with the egalitarian against survivalist compulsion.

Beyond technological replacement, under deregulation, offshore jobs 
could also pose a similar threat though national interests in this 
matter aren’t necessarily a moral priority [37]. Supporters of 
deregulation might also make the claim that despite any regulation 
multinational migration is a phenomenon too powerful to be combated, 
with regulation only worsening the phenomenon.

Of the three alternatives minimum wage advocates should aim to set a 
wage near where a hypothetically ideal equilibrium would place it if 
there was high elasticity or a lack of survival pressure allowing for 
exploitation. With this minimum wage nearing the productivity wage and 
conveniently exceeding the living wage, the moral obligation to remove 
the survivalist restriction to choice as well as the consequentialist 
consideration of the aggregate economy will both be satisfied.

The IETC would counteract the pressure of necessity in a more 
indirect manner, also potentially steepening employee elasticity 
alongside an already steep elasticity for employees. While if advocates 
for this model are right it will also fulfil our initial moral dilemmas,
 less practical studies exist on the IETC than the minimum wage; though 
there is little mutually exclusive territory between the two. Finally, 
laissez faire positions generally neglect the practical manifestation of
 these moral hurdles and their effect on imperfect competition. Although
 the laissez faire model is more ineffective in the unskilled labour 
market, advocates still claim it is preferable to government 
intervention.

Verdict

There is sound reason to consider an increase to the minimum wage. 
With productivity estimates exceeding the living wage despite its 
variation, not only is a rights or justice based analysis satisfied by 
such a policy but so too is the position of a consequentialist concerned
 for the aggregate economy.

Specifically for the cases of Dauphin County and the whole of King 
County, a suggested $12 minimum wage would cover the costs of an 
individual while a $15 minimum wage would also cover costs for most two 
income households and some single income households while the 
productivity wage projection of $18.42 would cover costs for more, but 
still not all, remaining single income families. Even if we accept some 
critics’ claims about the Economic Policy Institute’s deflation methods,
 a productivity wage of $14.40 is supported, with these productivity 
wages marking the highest minimum wages which remain profitable for 
employers.

Alongside the proposition of a minimum wage increase are alternative 
arguments suggested for the IETC and deregulation, (with consideration 
of an increase in education holding no direct conflict to any of these).
 In analysing these models, some theorise profitability is not enough, 
raising further avenues for moral inquiry.
