All-optical operation holds promise as the future of computing technology, and key com-

ponents include miniaturized waveguides (WGs) and couplers that control narrow band-

widths. Nanowires (NWs) offer an ideal platform for nanoscale WGs, but their utility has

been limited by the lack of a comprehensive coupling scheme with band selectivity. Here, we

introduce a NW geometric superlattice (GSL) that allows narrow-band guiding in Si NWs

through coupling of a Mie resonance with a bound-guided state (BGS). Periodic diameter

modulation creates a Mie-BGS-coupled excitation that manifests as a scattering dark state

with a pronounced scattering dip in the Mie resonance. The frequency of the coupled mode,

tunable from the visible to near-infrared, is determined by the pitch of the GSL. Using a

combined GSL-WG system, we demonstrate spectrally selective guiding and optical

switching and sensing at telecommunication wavelengths, highlighting the potential to use

NW GSLs for the design of on-chip optical components.

Optical interconnects and logic elements operating on thenanometer scale could enable the leap into all-opticalcomputing technology, which would alleviate the band-
width and energy consumption limitations of current technolo-
gies1. For instance, dielectric waveguides (WGs) made on silicon-
on-insulator (SOI) platforms have been widely explored for car-
rying and modulating optical signals2; however, they are confined
to a planar geometry, and coupling light into and out of these
structures relies on conventional grating couplers that are often
orders of magnitude larger in size than the WGs3,4. Nanowires
(NWs)5 offer an alternate platform on which to design dielectric
WGs at exactly the diffraction limit in an optimal cylindrical
geometry6–9. NWs enable the guiding of light in flexible, non-
planar, three-dimensional geometries, and permit the addition of
conformal cladding materials including dielectrics and metals10.
Despite these advantages, in-coupling of light to NW WGs
remains problematic and has relied on scattering at NW end
facets6,7 or end-on parallel coupling to the NWs8,9 because there
is no comprehensive light coupling scheme for a NW geometry.
Moreover, existing methods are not spectrally selective, limiting
their utility for applications where mode-selection is important.
Given that NWs are also well known to exhibit strong Mie
resonances11,12, there have been efforts to explore the connection
between Mie resonances and guided modes13. However, because
of momentum mismatch, guided modes are by their nature
inaccessible optical bound states14 under normal incidence light,
leaving the opportunities for interplay between a Mie and guided
mode as yet obscure.

Nanoscale systems often exhibit unique light-matter interac-
tions15 when the geometric and compositional design of a system
causes complex wave interference effects, which can include Fano
resonances16, electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT)17,
and scattering dark states18,19. A Fano resonance arises from
weak coupling between two resonances with different damping

rates, creating an abrupt spectral feature in the optical response.
EIT and scattering dark states originate from oppositely-oriented
radiative resonances that destructively interfere with each other in
the far field17–21. The same optical effect can occur in systems
with a near-field interaction between a super-radiant, bright
mode and a sub-radiant, dark mode22,23. In this case, an exchange
of energy between the modes results in a coupled excitation of the
bright and dark state, causing an abrupt Fano-like or EIT-like
feature in the optical response. Far-field and near-field interac-
tions are usually interchangeable frameworks that can describe
the same phenomena with a different basis set18,24. These spectral
features are often generated through geometric perturbation of a
nanostructure to break spatial symmetry, causing a previously
dark state to be accessed17,22,25,26.

Here, we show that a NW geometric superlattice (GSL), which
breaks the infinite translational symmetry of a NW, can couple a
Mie resonance with a bound-guided state (BGS) of the NW.
Complementary to reports on bound states in the continuum
(BIC)14, which describe the appearance of bound states above the
light cone, we selectively access one normally inaccessible BGS
from a continuum of conventional bound states below the light
cone by precisely modulating the NW geometry. As a result, a
sharp, Fano-like feature that can be assigned as a scattering dark
state appears in the Mie scattering spectrum at the wavelength of
the BGS. The geometric dependence of both the Mie resonance
and BGS provides broadband tuning of the effect from visible
through near-infrared wavelengths. We experimentally demon-
strate the appearance of scattering dark states from NW GSLs and
show selective guiding of light up to telecommunication wave-
lengths with a Fourier-transform-limited bandwidth. This report
is the first demonstration of Mie-BGS coupling and selective
narrow-band guiding in a NW WG system. In addition, we show
that the coupling wavelength is highly sensitive to the local

Results
Mie-BGS coupling in a NW GSL. The geometry of a NW GSL,
illustrated in Fig. 1a, is uniquely defined by three geometrical
parameters, the pitch (p), outer diameter (d), and etch diameter
(e), and is composed of equally spaced cylindrical segments of
modulated diameter (δ= d− e), where each segment has an axial
length of p/2. We consider this structure illuminated at normal
incidence under TM polarization with the magnetic (H) and
electric (E) fields perpendicular and parallel, respectively, to the
NW axis. Figure 1b schematically illustrates coupling between the
two eigenmodes in a NW geometry, a Mie resonance that
strongly couples with a free-space plane wave and a BGS selected
from the continuum. Here, we consider the criterion for an ideal
bound state to be absence of loss, absence of external coupling,
and time invariance of energy within the structure. Thus, for a
NW system, the ideal BGS refers to a standing wave with
amplitude Ag formed by the superposition of two counter-
propagating guided modes, Ag= [Ar(x,z)B(y)exp(ikg,L(y-
y0) − iωgt)+ Al(x,z)B(y)exp(−ikg,L(y− y0)− iωgt)], with the
same angular frequency (ωg) and longitudinal wavevector (kg,L),
where y is spatial position along the NW axis, y0 is the spatial
origin chosen to coincide with the center of a GSL segment, Ar(x,
z) and Al(x,z) are the cross-sectional amplitudes of right- and left-
propagating guided modes, respectively, (with Ar=Al, for an
ideal BGS), B(y) is the longitudinal envelope function (with B(y)
= constant, for an ideal BGS), i is the imaginary unit (i2=−1),
and t is time. Note that this expression will also describe a con-
ventional guided mode if either Ar or Al is zero. For a perfect
cylinder (δ= 0), the Mie and BGS modes are orthogonal and
incapable of coupling to one another. For a GSL (δ > 0), we
consider a non-zero coupling frequency, ωc, between a Mie
resonance centered at ωm and a BGS centered at ωg. For normal
incidence illumination, the coupling is non-zero only for the ωg
with a kg,L that matches the geometrically defined p (i.e., kg,L=
2πm/p, where m= 1, 3, 5, …) because these frequencies experi-
ence coherent amplification whereas mismatched ones vanish.
Thus, the structure behaves as a Fourier selector in which only the
spatial frequency components, including higher mth order odd
harmonics (Supplementary Fig. 1), matched to the structure are
coupled to a BGS.

Figure 1c shows numerically calculated scattering efficiency
(Qsca, see Methods for details) spectra (solid lines) and
analytically calculated spectra (dashed lines) derived from
temporal coupled-mode theory (TCMT)18,27 for a uniform NW
(labeled p∞) and three NW GSLs of varying p. The dominant
peak in the uniform NW spectrum corresponds to the
fundamental TM11 magnetic dipolar Mie resonance (directly
related to the HE11 guided mode13) centered at ωm. For the GSL,
in contrast, a sharp and pronounced scattering dip (labeled ωg for
p420) is observed within the Mie resonance. The calculated field
profile at ωg (Fig. 1f) exhibits a standing wave with antinodes
centered on each cylindrical segment (see also a time-lapsed
animation in Supplementary Movie 1). This standing wave profile
corresponds to the BGS. For shorter (p360) and longer (p500)
values of p, the scattering dip shifts to the blue or red of ωm,
respectively; nevertheless, the same standing wave profile is
observed at the scattering dip for all values of p (Supplementary
Fig. 2). The peaks to the blue and red of the scattering dip in
Fig. 1c (labeled ω+ and ω−, respectively, for p420) exhibit mode
profiles (Fig. 1d, e) with antinodes centered only on the small or
large diameter segments, respectively, and these profiles are also
preserved for every value of p (Supplementary Fig. 2).

Substantially larger values of p shift ωg off the Mie resonance
envelope, causing the scattering dip to disappear and no power to
be transferred to the BGS (Supplementary Fig. 3). In addition, a
tilt of the incoming plane wave provides a non-zero momentum
along the NW axis, causing the BGS scattering dip to split into
two separate dips dominated by a right- and left-propagating BGS
state (Supplementary Fig. 4); however, we focus only on normal
incidence illumination in this study.

The features of the Mie–BGS coupling can be accounted for
using TCMT18,27. The dynamic state of the resonance amplitudes
can be expressed as:

where Am is the Mie resonance amplitude, γm and γg are radiative
decay rates for the Mie resonance and BGS, S+ is the incoming
wave, and km is the coupling coefficient to the incoming wave.
Here, we have neglected absorptive contributions and neglected
an off-diagonal radiative coupling term, γc. The outgoing wave,
S−, can be expressed as S−= S++ dmAm, where dm is the
coupling coefficient to the outgoing wave. The coupling
coefficients of the BGS to the incoming and outgoing waves are
set to zero under normal incidence illumination, which assumes
that γg is small compared to γm. In a perfectly cylindrical NW
geometry (δ= 0), coupling between the Mie resonance and BGS
does not occur, and ωc and γg are both zero, leaving both
resonances unaffected and the BGS completely dark. However, in
the case of a NW GSL, both parameters are non-zero, and
scattering cross-sections calculated using Eq. (1) are plotted in
Fig. 1c as dotted lines. Analytical parameters are summarized in
Supplementary Table 1 and were determined by a fit to the
numerical simulation considering energy conservation and time
reversal symmetry18, reproducing the spectral features in the
numerical results. Note that the scattering dip does not go to zero
because of the introduction of loss in the guided mode (γg > 0; see
Supplementary Fig. 5). The good agreement of numerical and
TCMT results validates the assignment of the scattering dip as a
scattering dark state resulting from coupling between a Mie
resonance and BGS. Similar calculations with different geome-
trical parameters (Supplementary Fig. 6) show that the effect is
fully tunable from visible through infrared wavelengths by
changing d and p with a fixed δ.

Diagonalization of the energy matrix in Eq. (1) yields
eigenfrequencies, ω+ and ω−, and the eigenmodes, Α+ and Α−.
If the scattering dip appears at the center of the Mie resonance
(ωm= ωg; red curve in Fig. 1c), the eigenmodes are A± = Am ± Ag,
where Am corresponds to a dipolar Mie resonance uniformly
distributed across the axial length of the NW, and Ag is the
standing-wave mode profile of the BGS. The eigenmodes Α+ and
Α− thus represent interference between the Mie resonance and
BGS, in which the axially uniform amplitude of the Mie
resonance overpowers the oscillating amplitude of the BGS with
a relative phase shift of π for the two eigenmodes. This result
corresponds to the numerically calculated mode profiles in
Fig. 1d, e for the adjacent peaks on the blue (ω+) and red (ω−)
sides of the scattering dip. This eigenmode analysis can also
justify the assignment of the scattering dip as a Fano resonance
arising from the interaction between a sharp BGS and a broad
Mie background resonance.

The bound character of the BGS is apparent if we consider the
effect of the modulation depth, δ. Numerical simulations
(Supplementary Fig. 7) with δ ranging from 20 to 2 nm show a

marked narrowing of the scattering dark state linewidth and
increase of the quality factor, extrapolating to infinity as δ
approaches zero. Moreover, ωc decreases as δ decreases in
magnitude (Supplementary Table 2) because access to the bound
state vanishes. In contrast, as δ increases in magnitude, the
linewidth significantly broadens and eventually bifurcates into
two distinct peaks that align with the positions of ω+ and ω−.
This transition occurs because the Mie resonance and BGS are no
longer weakly coupled, and instead two qualitatively new modes
arise that are more representative of scattering from Si NW
segments of distinct diameters.

To experimentally verify the predicted optical properties of
NW GSLs, a process termed ENGRAVE (Encoded Nanowire
GRowth and Appearance through VLS and Etching)28–30 was
used to fabricate Si NW GSL nanostructures from the bottom-up
using a gold (Au) nanoparticle catalyzed vapor-liquid-solid (VLS)
growth process. VLS growth produces single-crystalline NWs and
is capable of precise size control and on-demand modification of
morphology28,29,31–33, chemical composition34, and crystal
phase35. Of the geometric parameters, p is determined by the
dopant switching frequency during the growth, and d and e are
determined by the size of Au catalyst and post-growth etch
duration, respectively. Optimized growth conditions without Au
loss from the catalyst36 yield NWs exceeding 500 μm in length
with no undesired diameter variation (Supplementary Fig. 8).
Figure 2a–c shows scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of
three distinct NW GSLs with increasing diameters d prepared by
the ENGRAVE process using etch depths of δ= 10–25 nm.
Geometrical parameters of each GSL were determined by
quantitative image analysis30. For optical characterization, a
home-built laser microscope (Supplementary Fig. 9) capable of
polarization-resolved bright-field extinction measurements using
a supercontinuum laser source and balanced detection was
employed.

Experimental extinction spectra, plotted as (1− T) × 100%,
where T is the measured transmittance (see Methods), are shown

in Fig. 2d–i for GSLs (Fig. 2d–f) and uniform NWs of the same
diameters (Fig. 2g–i). Each spectrum shows a broad Mie
resonance that shifts to longer wavelengths with increasing
diameter. For the GSLs, sharp spectral features deviating from the
background Mie resonances are observed. Numerical simulations
(black solid lines) of the extinction efficiency (Qext) that use
geometrical parameters obtained from the SEM images and
include the focused laser beam (see Methods) agree well with the
experimental measurements, confirming the presence of Mie-BGS
coupling and a scattering dark state in these nanostructures.
However, the simulations also reveal several differences between
focused excitation and the plane wave excitation modeled in
Fig. 1. First, the simulations predict a scattering dip with a
substantially larger linewidth, which can be attributed to the
localized excitation causing a broader distribution of Fourier
spatial components to couple to the BGS. Second, the simulations
predict an extinction peak within the dip, which can be attributed
to mode distortion caused by the finite number of GSL periods
excited by the focused beam. Mode degradation in truncated
arrays is a common phenomenon observed in planar metamater-
ials due to loss of coherence37,38. In our case, the finite beam
prevents the Bloch condition along the GSL from being satisfied,
causing incomplete formation of the BGS and an increase in
scattering loss, manifesting as a peak within the scattering dip
(Supplementary Fig. 10).

Tunable guiding in a GSL-WG NW. The geometric dependence
of Mie-BGS coupling, as observed in Fig. 2, can be predicted from
the dispersion relation for the WG modes of a uniform diameter
Si NW (Fig. 3a) and the diameter dependence of the TM11 Mie
resonance. For a fixed longitudinal wavevector kg,L, which cor-
responds to a GSL satisfying p= 2πm/kg,L, the frequency of the
guided mode decreases with increasing diameter, and the Mie
resonance frequency similarly decreases with increasing diameter.
However, because the frequencies of the Mie resonance and BGS

change with diameter at different rates, the pitch p required to
center the BGS on the Mie resonance shifts to larger values as the
diameter of the NW increases and the frequency decreases. In
Fig. 3a, this shift can be visualized as the intersection of the solid
lines (BGS dispersion relation) with the magenta dashed line (Mie
resonance position), which represents the degenerate point
where ωm= ωg and provides a guideline for the geometric design
of a GSL to enable optimal Mie-BGS coupling at a given free-
space wavelength. Magenta diamonds and black circles represent
data points where the modes are and are not degenerate,
respectively, as determined from numerical simulations of NW
GSL spectra in Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 6. The good
alignment of these data points with the dispersion relations
confirms the geometric relationship between d and p for Mie-BGS
coupling.

To take advantage of the WG characteristics, we designed a
GSL-WG NW, illustrated in Fig. 3b, composed of a truncated
GSL adjacent to a long, uniform cylindrical segment that can act
as a lossless WG. The geometric parameters of the GSL were
designed to support Mie-BGS coupling in the near-infrared
spectral region to avoid absorptive losses in Si. Numerical
simulations for a GSL (d= 330 nm; e= 310 nm; p= 900 nm)
with 10 periods of the pitch illuminated by a focused laser beam
(Fig. 3c) yield an extinction spectrum (Fig. 3d) with a broad Mie
resonance centered at ~1500 nm and an extinction dip centered at
~1504 nm. A Mie-BGS coupled excitation occurs at the dip, and
the numerical simulations show energy propagation into the
guided mode of the WG segment adjacent to the GSL, as shown
by the magnetic field profile in Fig. 3c and Supplementary
Movie 2. Integration of the energy flux in the WG portion of the
NW yields the guided spectrum shown in Fig. 3e. As expected, the
spectral region guided in the NW corresponds to the spectral
region of the dip in the extinction spectrum. The guided
bandwidth of ~46 nm is in good agreement with the expected
Fourier-transform-limited bandwidth of 48 nm for a Gaussian
beam with a full-width at half maximum of 7 μm. Moreover,
we calculate a maximum guided efficiency (Qguided) of 0.82
for coupling into the WG based on the ratio of the power
measured at the end of the WG to the power incident on
the projected area of the GSL. Thus, the near-unity Qguided

highlights the high efficiency with which the Mie-BGS coupling
mechanism can funnel the energy associated with the strong
light-matter interaction of the Mie resonance into the guided
mode of a NW.

To experimentally validate the expected guiding characteristics
of a GSL-WG NW, we synthesized NWs with a GSL adjacent to a
50 μm WG segment, as illustrated in Fig. 4a. Geometric
parameters of the NW were chosen to support lossless guiding
at frequencies below the bandgap of Si. Because of infrared free
carrier absorption losses in heavily-doped n-type Si NWs39, we
adopted the doping-inverted ENGRAVE process29,36 in which n-
type rather than intrinsic segments are etched (see Methods),
allowing the WG segment to be composed of intrinsic Si. To
experimentally measure guiding in the GSL-WG structure, an
excitation beam was focused on the GSL segment, and optical
images were collected to observe any light emission from the end
of the WG segment, where light is expected to scatter after
traversing the 50 μmWG. Figure 4c–e displays optical images of a
GSL-WG structure illuminated at three excitation wavelengths.
As apparent from these images, WG light emission is observed
from the end of the WG segment for an excitation wavelength of
1455 nm but is not observed at wavelengths of 1400 and 1550 nm.

Extinction spectra were collected from both GSL and WG
segments of NWs with three distinct geometric parameters
(Fig. 4i–n) designed to tune the Mie-BGS coupling from ~1300 to
~1500 nm. As expected, the uniform-diameter WG segments
show one Mie resonance whereas the GSL segments show a
scattering dark state within the Mie resonance. WG emission
spectra, as shown in Fig. 4o–q, were also experimentally
measured by integrating the signal from the end of the WGs
(e.g., from the region denoted by a dashed circle in Fig. 4b). The
WG emission spectra show that guiding occurs over a select
wavelength range that corresponds to the spectral position of the
scattering dip in the extinction spectra. The WG spectrum in
Fig. 4o was collected from the same NW imaged in Fig. 4b, and
the spectrum shows maximal WG intensity in the 1450–1500 nm
range, in agreement with the images in Fig. 4c–e. Simulations of
Qext and Qguided spectra are shown as solid black lines in Fig. 4i–q
and agree well with experimental measurements, confirming the
Fourier-selected guiding characteristics of the GSL-WG NW

system. Qguided ranges from 0.5 to 1.0 depending on the choice of
geometrical parameters.

Interestingly, the guiding spectra exhibit a high frequency
oscillation (Fig. 4o–q), which indicates that the WG acts as a
Fabry-Perot cavity. To confirm this effect, we prepared a single
GSL with WG segments of two different lengths on either side

(Supplementary Fig. 11). WG emission was observed from the
ends of both WGs, and spectra collected from each end (Fig. 4r–s)
show free spectral ranges (FSRs) of 16.9 and 7.1 nm as well as
finesse values of 1.58 and 1.17 from WG1 and WG2, respectively.
The FSRs are in good agreement with the expected values of ~15
and ~6 nm based on respective WG cavity lengths, and the finesse

values correspond to round-trip reflectance values of 3% and
1.2% for WG1 and WG2, respectively. The appearance of this
Fabry-Perot pattern confirms the high-quality and low loss of the
GSL-WG system, and suggests a potential route for further
spectral filtering of the guided light.

Sensing and switching with a GSL-WG NW. The guiding
characteristics of the GSL-WG system are sensitive not only to
geometric parameters but also to the refractive index, n, of the
surrounding medium, as shown schematically in Fig. 5a. A
change in n from 1 to 1.5 in steps of 0.1 refractive index units
(RIUs) results in a shift of the maximal guided power by 142 nm,

as shown by the simulations in Fig. 5b, c. This large spectral shift
corresponds to a sensitivity of 270 nm RIU−1, which is compar-
able to the sensitivity of planar dielectric metasurface sensors37

and suggests potential applications of the GSL system in both
sensing37 and optical switching40. Figure 5d shows the pro-
gressive change in guided power as a function of n at three select
wavelengths, exemplifying the sensing and on/off switching
characteristic that can be achieved at each wavelength by rela-
tively small changes in n. However, in comparison to typical
microresonators and planar metasurfaces, the finite length and
nanoscale dimensions of the NW GSL cause a relatively low
quality factor and wide bandwidth for the guided light. This
difference highlights an inherent but common tradeoff in the
design of optical components in the nanoscale regime; never-
theless, several index-changing strategies, such as the electro-
optic effect41,42 and photoisomerization43, offer sufficiently large
index modulation to enable switching in the NW GSL-WG
system.

We experimentally demonstrate reversible, passive sensing, and
optical switching by sequentially adding up to 4 poly(methyl
methacrylate) (PMMA) layers over a NW GSL-WG on a SiO2
glass substrate. Each successive PMMA layer increases the
effective index of the environment. As shown by the guided
spectra in Fig. 5e, the PMMA layers induce up to a 78 nm spectral
shift of the maximum guided power, from 1286 to 1364 nm. This
shift corresponds to a change of the effective refractive index (neff)
of ~0.29 RIU, from ~1.21 to ~1.50, which is approximately the
expected change considering the fixed n of the substrate.
Moreover, the spectrum reverts to its original position upon
removal of all PMMA layers, thus demonstrating that the process
is reversible. Figure 5f shows the relative guided power measured
at wavelengths of 1286 and 1364 nm as a function of neff. The
data exemplifies the expected sensing and optical switching
behavior of the GSL-WG system, allowing the guiding of a
specific wavelength to be modulated and even turned on and off
by the choice of neff.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated that periodic geometric
perturbation of a NW allows coupling of a Mie resonance and a
BGS. The coupling creates a pronounced dip in scattering spectra
as predicted by both numerical finite-element modeling and
analytical modeling using TCMT. The periodic GSL structure acts
as a Fourier frequency selector to determine the wavelength of the
BGS to be coupled with the Mie resonance. The effect can be
readily tuned from visible through near-infrared wavelengths by
controlling geometric parameters, as proven by experimental
measurements of extinction of individual GSL NWs. We
demonstrate selective, Fourier-transform-limited guiding of light
up to telecommunication wavelengths with near-unity coupling
efficiency, highlighting the unique ability of the Mie-BGS
coupling mechanism to direct energy from the strong Mie
resonance light-matter interaction into a NW WG. We also
demonstrate a simple optical switch that takes advantage of the
spectral sensitivity of the coupled wavelength to the surrounding
medium. The Mie-BGS light coupling mechanism thus offers a
new platform for controlled light management when designing
optical circuits.

Methods
Numerical modeling. Finite-element optical simulations were performed using
COMSOL Multiphysics software by running scattered field calculations with a TM-
polarized plane wave or a focused Gaussian wave defined over three-dimensional
NW GSL structures. For plane wave simulations, a periodic boundary condition
was applied in the axial direction at each side of a GSL repeating unit, and domains
to the side of the NW GSL were surrounded by air and perfectly matched layers
(PMLs). For simulations with a focused Gaussian beam, NW waveguide segments
on each side of the GSL were placed in PMLs. Qsca and Qguided were calculated by
integrating Poynting vectors across the outer surface of a NW in all directions and

across a cross-sectional area at the end of a NW waveguide, respectively, and
dividing by the optical power incident on the projected area of the GSL. Propa-
gation to both right and left directions was taken into account for calculating
Qguided, and absorption efficiency was added to Qsca to calculate extinction effi-
ciency, Qext.

NW GSL synthesis. Si NWs were grown in a home-built, hot-wall chemical vapor
deposition system with silane (SiH4; Voltaix), phosphine (PH3; diluted to 1000 ppm
in H2, Voltaix), hydrogen chloride (HCl anhydrous; Matheson TriGas; 5 N research
purity grade), hydrogen (H2; Matheson TriGas; 5 N semiconductor grade), and with
Au nanoparticle catalysts (150–300 nm; Sigma-Aldrich) of various diameters in a 1-
inch quartz-tube furnace (Lindberg Blue M). All NWs were nucleated at 480 °C with
2.00 standard cubic centimeter per minute (sccm) of SiH4, 4.00 sccm of HCl, and
194.0 sccm of H2 at 40 Torr total reactor pressure for 30min, which yields an
average growth rate of 600 nm/min. A long section of n-type Si was grown for a
desired length after nucleation by turning on the PH3 flow at a fixed flow-rate ratio
of 1:10 SiH4:PH3, and the same gas phase ratio was used throughout the study.
Doping modulation for GSL profiles was performed by abruptly turning on and off
the PH3 flow at a constant time interval, followed by growing a long section of n-
type again until growth termination. For doping-inverted GSLs, the PH3 flow profile
was inverted, and the final intrinsic NW sections were grown for desired WG
lengths. NW GSLs were then subjected to etching in aqueous KOH solution (20
weight%) for standard doping or in buffered hydrofluoric acid (BHF, Transene BHF
Improved, 2 volume%) for inverted doping as described elsewhere36. For optical and
electron microscopy characterization, NWs were transferred after etching onto
standard glass microscopy slides (Fisher Scientific) coated with ~3 nm of ITO by
sputtering (Kurt Lesker PVD 75) to facilitate SEM imaging. For optical switch
experiments, sequential layers of PMMA (MicroChem 950PMMA.A4) were spun
cast (Laurell WS-650MZ-23NPP) at 4000 rpm and baked at 150 °C.

Optical and microscopy characterization. A broadband laser from a super-
continuum source (NKT Photonics; SuperK Extreme EXB-6) was directed into a
monochromator (Princeton Instruments; Acton SP2300) to output a single
wavelength with <2 nm bandwidth. The laser was collimated into a beam size of 1
mm, polarized by a Glan-Thompson polarizer, and split evenly into reference and a
probe arms for balanced detection by Nirvana balanced photoreceivers (Newport;
Nirvana Auto-Balanced Photoreceiver 2007 or 2017, depending on the required
wavelength). The reference beam was directly fiber-coupled to the photoreceiver,
and the probe beam was directed to one side of the back aperture of a reflective
objective (Thorlabs; LMM-40×-P01) to deeply under-fill the aperture and achieve
quasi-plane wave illumination with a low numerical aperture (see Supplementary
Fig. 9). The transmitted probe beam was re-collimated by a matched objective and
fiber-coupled to the photoreceiver. The optical power was collected with the probe
beam placed on and off the NW by modulating the substrate position using a piezo
positioner (Mad City Labs; Nano-LP 200). Measured extinction (%) was calculated
as (1− T) × 100 with T= I/I0, where I and I0 are transmitted powers collected with
the beam on and off the NW, respectively. The position modulation-extinction
collection cycle was repeated twice and averaged at every wavelength. Optical
imaging was performed by a visible-short wave infrared (Vis-SWIR) camera
(Raptor Photonics; Ninox Vis-SWIR 640) with a halogen lamp illuminating in a
dark-field configuration for locating samples or with a laser beam for collection of
guided spectra. The guiding spectra were collected by taking optical images at every
wavelength and integrating the signal within the NW tip region. SEM images were
collected with an FEI Helios 600 Nanolab Dual Beam System, and geometrical
parameters of each GSL were determined using our home-written image analysis
software30. Duty cycles for NW GSLs used in panels a–c in Fig. 2 were calculated to
be 50 ± 2%, 50 ± 2%, 49 ± 2%, respectively, indicating that the length of segments in
each GSL is p/2 within ~1%.
