Artificial muscles hold promise for safe and powerful actuation for
myriad common machines and robots. However, the design, fab-
rication, and implementation of artificial muscles are often lim-
ited by their material costs, operating principle, scalability, and
single-degree-of-freedom contractile actuation motions. Here we
propose an architecture for fluid-driven origami-inspired artificial
muscles. This concept requires only a compressible skeleton, a
flexible skin, and a fluid medium. A mechanical model is devel-
oped to explain the interaction of the three components. A fabri-
cation method is introduced to rapidly manufacture low-cost arti-
ficial muscles using various materials and at multiple scales. The
artificial muscles can be programed to achieve multiaxial motions
including contraction, bending, and torsion. These motions can
be aggregated into systems with multiple degrees of freedom,
which are able to produce controllable motions at different rates.
Our artificial muscles can be driven by fluids at negative pres-
sures (relative to ambient). This feature makes actuation safer
than most other fluidic artificial muscles that operate with posi-
tive pressures. Experiments reveal that these muscles can contract
over 90% of their initial lengths, generate stresses of ∼600 kPa,
and produce peak power densities over 2 kW/kg—all equal to, or
in excess of, natural muscle. This architecture for artificial muscles
opens the door to rapid design and low-cost fabrication of actua-
tion systems for numerous applications at multiple scales, ranging
from miniature medical devices to wearable robotic exoskeletons
to large deployable structures for space exploration.

Artificial muscles (1, 2) are a long-sought class of actuatorsfor applications in industrial robots, wearable devices, and
medical instruments (3–10). Numerous transduction methods
have been proposed, including the use of thermal energy, elec-
tric fields, and pressurized fluids. Shape-memory alloys (SMAs)
can generate a large contractile stress (>200 MPa) when they
are heated above their (solid-state) phase transition temperature
but at the cost of hysteresis and slow cycle times (11). Low-cost
polymer fibers, such as a twisted fishing line and sewing thread,
have been demonstrated to generate impressively large stresses
up to 140 MPa (4.5% stroke) and significant tensile strokes up
to 49% (1 MPa load). Similar to SMAs, this twisted fiber-based
muscle is thermally driven; thus, its energy conversion efficiency
is low (<2%) relative to natural muscles (40%) (12). Electroac-
tive polymers (EAPs), either ionic (13) or dielectric (14–16), are
widely investigated materials for building artificial muscles due to
their relatively high efficiency (≈30%), light weight, and struc-
tural compliance (elastic modulus <1 MPa) (1, 17). Polymer-
based actuators have material properties that closely mimic mus-
cle and can produce substantial deformations in the presence
of an external electric field (18, 19). However, often extremely
high voltages (typically >1 kV for dielectric elastomer actua-
tors) or hermetic encapsulation (in the case of ionic polymer–
metal composites) is required (13), posing barriers to practical
applications. Electrically driven hydrogels are able to produce
reversible actuation at small scales (20), however their responses
are relatively slow (from seconds to hours) compared with other
artificial muscles (1, 21). Phase-change materials (both liquid–

gas and solid–liquid transitions) have been used to build electri-
cally driven elastomeric artificial muscles (22, 23). These mus-
cles exhibit very promising performances in terms of high strain
(up to 900%) and high stress (up to 29 MPa), while their energy
efficiencies are similar to SMAs and their actuation speeds are
relatively slow.

Fluid-driven actuators are the most widely used artificial
muscles due to their simplicity, large actuation stress and defor-
mation, high energy efficiency, and low cost (24–28). The
McKibben actuator is one of the most popular fluidic artificial
muscles (29, 30). A linear contraction and large force can be
produced when a positive fluidic pressure is applied to a bladder
inside an anisotropic outer mesh. This kind of artificial muscle
can be driven either pneumatically or hydraulically. However, a
high-pressure (>100 kPa) fluid is needed where the pressure is
determined by the constituent material properties and desired
force and displacement. Related actuators such as pouch motors
(31) and Peano muscles (32, 33) have a simple planar architec-
ture compared with the standard McKibben actuator. These arti-
ficial muscles can generate both linear contraction and torsional
motion at a relatively low air pressure (10 kPa). The contrac-
tion ratios of these muscles are limited to ∼36% due the cylin-
drical geometry of their inflated membranes. Vacuum-actuated
muscle-inspired pneumatic structures (VAMPs) are elastomeric
actuators that exhibit similar reversible behaviors and mechani-
cal performances as those of natural skeletal muscles (34). Pla-
nar linear contraction and torsional motion can be generated by
VAMPs through the buckling of their elastomeric beams caused

Significance

Artificial muscles are flexible actuators with capabilities sim-
ilar to, or even beyond, natural muscles. They have been
widely used in many applications as alternatives to more
traditional rigid electromagnetic motors. Numerous studies
focus on rapid design and low-cost fabrication of artificial
muscles with customized performances. Here, we present an
architecture for fluidic artificial muscles with unprecedented
performance-to-cost ratio. These artificial muscles can be pro-
gramed to produce not only a single contraction but also
complex multiaxial actuation, and even controllable motion
with multiple degrees of freedom. Moreover, a wide vari-
ety of materials and fabrication processes can be used to
build the artificial muscles with other functions beyond basic
actuation.

by negative pressure (relative to ambient). Negative-pressure
operation offers greater safety, compactness, and robustness
compared with other fluidic artificial muscles driven by positive
pressure, yet the maximum actuation stress (65 kPa) and contrac-
tion (45%) that VAMPs can generate are limited by the negative
pressure (vacuum) and the buckling strength of their elastomeric
structures (35).

Fig. 1. Design, fabrication, and resulting multiscale actuators. (A) Miniature linear actuators use polyether ether ketone (PEEK) zigzag origami structures
as the skeletons and PVC films as the skins. These biocompatible materials make the actuators suitable for medical and wearable applications. (B) A
large-scale high-power actuator is assembled using a zigzag skeleton composed of nylon plates (fold width = 10 cm). The skin is made of thermoplastic
polyurethane (TPU)-coated nylon fabric. A car wheel (diameter ≈75 cm, weight ≈22 kg) is lifted to 20 cm within 30 s (Movie S3). (C) Principle of operation
of the actuators. Contraction is mainly driven by the tension force of the skin. This force is produced by the pressure difference between the internal
and external fluids. Removing fluid from the actuator will temporarily decrease the internal pressure. (D) Fabrication process. A standard actuator can be
quickly fabricated in three simple steps: (step 1) skeleton construction using any of a number of techniques, (step 2) skin preparation, and (step 3) fluid-tight
sealing.

Although significant progress has been achieved, there re-
mains a long-standing scientific challenge for the development
of high-performance artificial muscles with low-cost fabrication,
complex actuation, easy operation, and scalable implementation.
Inspired by the cold gas-pressure folding idea (36), here we pro-
pose the design and fabrication methods for an architecture of
fluid-driven origami-inspired artificial muscles (FOAMs). This

architecture allows us to program artificial muscles with multiax-
ial complex motions as well as controllable motions at different
rates. These artificial muscles are fast, powerful, and energy effi-
cient, and they can be fabricated at multiple scales using a variety
of materials at very low costs (Fig. 1 A and B).

Principle of Operation and Modeling
Our artificial muscle system consists of three fundamental com-
ponents: a compressible solid skeletal structure, a flexible fluid-
tight skin, and a fluid medium. In this system, the skin is sealed as
a bag covering the internal components. The fluid medium fills
the internal space between the skeleton and the skin. In the ini-
tial equilibrium state, the pressures of the internal fluid and the
external fluid are equal. However, as the volume of the internal
fluid is changed, a new equilibrium is achieved. A pressure dif-
ference between the internal and external fluids induces tension
in the flexible skin. This tension will act on the skeleton, driving
a transformation that is regulated by its structural geometry (Fig.
1C and Movie S1).

A simplified mechanical model is developed to describe the
interaction of the three components of the artificial muscle (SI
Appendix, Fig. S1). In this model, each structural void on a skele-
ton is abstracted as two connected rigid plates/beams. This con-
nection is modeled as a compression spring (stiffness: ks) for the
void with two parallel plates/beams. If the void has two hinged
plates/beams, then the hinge can be modeled as a torsional spring,
or as two cantilever springs, with an initial opening angle and
a bending stiffness ks . The skin is modeled as a massless, flex-
ible, and nonstretchable membrane between two plates/beams,

forming a cylindrical void. This membrane’s geometry is approxi-
mated as a parabolic surface, and the skin’s elongation and bend-
ing deformation are both neglected in this model. If the internal
pressure Pin is lower than the external pressure Pout (a negative
pressure difference, ∆P < 0), the membrane deforms inwards
toward the void. Under tension, the void will be driven to con-
tract. In this study, we focus primarily on negative pressure-driven
artificial muscles due to their large contracting ratios and ease
of fabrication. The membrane’s tension force, T , is produced by
the pressure difference ∆P . This force is estimated based on the
Laplace Law as T = ∆P × R × W , where R is the radius
of curvature of the membrane and W is the width of the void.
Based on our model, the void’s force–contraction interaction can
be predicted using the principle of virtual work. We validated this
model by experimenting with a group of linear zigzag-type actu-
ators. The results show that our model could predict the output
force and free contraction with maximum errors of∼7% and 11%
(at ∆P = −70 kPa), respectively. The details for the theoreti-
cal modeling and the experimental validations are described in
SI Appendix. Given this accuracy of prediction, our model can be
used to design the artificial muscles to desired performances.

Fabrication Method and Material Choices
As shown in Fig. 1D and Movie S2, fabrication of the proposed
artificial muscles follows three basic steps: construction of the
deformable skeletal structure, preparation of the outer skin, and
then assembly and sealing. The skeleton can be a spring, an
origami-like folded structure, or any solid structure with hinged
or elastic voids. To construct the skeleton with a given design,

a number of different fabrication techniques can be used, such
as 3D printing, machining, casting, forming, and even manual
folding. Once the skeleton and skin are prepared, the skeleton
is enclosed by sealing the skin. The sealing process is dictated by
the skin material and can include heat-pressing, gluing, welding,
zippering, and sewing. It should be noted that if a positive pres-
sure is used to drive the artificial muscle, then the skin needs to
be fixed at specific locations on the skeleton to produce tension
to deform the skeleton (SI Appendix, Fig. S3 A–C and Movie S4).
For the negative pressure case, the skin–skeleton fixation step is
not necessary, as the skin will be tightly confined onto the skele-
ton’s surface.

Using this fabrication method, a wide variety of materials
can be used to construct artificial muscles for particular appli-
cations, deformation patterns, and force-displacement require-
ments (Fig. 2, Movie S5, and SI Appendix, Fig. S7). The mate-
rial used for constructing the skeleton needs to have a certain
rigidity to support the axial compressive force from the skin
tension. Although an artificial muscle can still work even after
its skeleton is buckled, the contraction ratio and force produc-
tion will be substantially reduced. We experimented with two
vacuum-driven muscles with different wall thicknesses of their
skeletons (1 mm and 3 mm, respectively). A 20% reduction
in blocked force and a 50% decrease in free contraction were
observed after the thinner skeleton was buckled at −70 kPa (SI
Appendix, Fig. S4 A, D, and G). For the case of discrete folds, the
skeleton’s hinges have to be compliant to allow the desired struc-
tural transformation. For repeatable actuation, skeleton elas-
ticity is also required to bring the skeleton back to its initial
configuration after each actuation. To enhance fluid circulation
and avoid jamming, the skeleton should have several channels
through its structure.

Fig. 3. Various basic actuation motions and programmable pseudosequential actuation with multiple degrees of freedom. (A) A 19 cm-long linear zigzag
actuator contracts to a compressed structure shorter than 2 cm. The 1D contraction ratio is ∼90%. (B) A 2D origami skeleton using the Miura-ori patterns
(area: 11 × 10 cm2) can contract to a dense bar-shaped structure (area: 9 × 1 cm2). The 2D area contraction ratio approaches 92%. (C) A 3D “magic-
ball” origami using the water-bomb pattern (radius: 3.5 cm) contracts to a compacted cylindrical structure (radius: 0.9 cm; height: 6.5 cm). The 3D volume
decreases 91% after this contraction. (D) Bending motion can be achieved by using an asymmetrical beam structure as the skeleton. (E) Using a flasher
origami pattern as the skeleton, the actuator rotates more than 90 degrees around its center, and its 2D surface contracts by 54% simultaneously. (F) A
complex out-of-plane motion combining torsion and contraction can be programed through a 2D Miura-ori origami pattern with select folds weakened.
(G) Three fingers on a robotic hand are actuated at different rates using a single control of the internal air pressure. The skeletal structure of this robotic
hand is 3D printed from nylon. Different hinge strengths inside the structural voids are designed for these three fingers, which produce significantly different
bending stiffnesses: ks1(red) < ks2(green) < ks3(blue). The bending stiffness of each finger determines its own bending angle at a certain internal pressure
level. (H) A bottle of water is gripped, lifted, and twisted by a single-channel vacuum-driven robotic arm. The robotic arm has a modular structure including
a cup-shaped gripper and a cylindrical lifter. The gripper uses a polyester magic-ball origami as its skeleton, while a much stiffer compression spring (302
stainless steel) is used as the lifter’s skeleton. When the internal pressure decreases smoothly, the gripping motion will always start first, then the lifting and
twisting motions start later as the internal pressure reduces further.

In general, the skin must be resistant to both the fluids inside
and outside of the skin. However, to demonstrate the flexibil-
ity in materials choices for these artificial muscles, a PVA-based
actuator can be fully dissolved in hot water (≈ 70 ◦C) within 5
min (Fig. 2C and Movie S5). Flexibility is also required to allow
easy bending during actuation. An ideal inextensible thin film
material can avoid undesired elongating and bending deforma-
tions on the skin when a pressure is applied. Such skin deforma-
tions will reduce the system’s performances and make the actua-
tion difficult to control. In the comparison shown in SI Appendix,
Fig. S4 F and I, a linear actuator with 0.24 mm TPU-based skin
(tensile modulus: 25 MPa) produced ∼60% less contractile force
compared with using an actuator with 0.34 mm nylon fabric skin
(tensile modulus: 460 MPa). Sufficient skin tensile strength must
be maintained to effectively transfer the tension force induced
by the fluidic pressure. In addition, the skin material has to be
amenable to a convenient sealing method.

The choice of the fluid depends on the working environment
and performance requirements. In addition, the fluid medium
has to be compatible with the materials used in the skeleton, skin,
and sealing process. In our current study, we focus on using the
available fluid surrounding the artificial muscle. In this case, the
internal fluid and the external fluid are homogeneous, although
using a different internal fluid is also possible for the artificial
muscle. As demonstrated in SI Appendix, Fig. S3D and Movie
S5, a 1 kg weight can be easily lifted in the air by a cylindrical
muscle using water as the internal fluid (flow rate: 80 mL/min). A
fluid with low viscosity is ideal for achieving a rapid and energy-
efficient actuation. Air is the most accessible fluid for making a
lightweight artificial muscle, and the surrounding water can be
directly used for actuation in an underwater environment (Fig.
2D and Movie S5).

A variety of jamming-based mechanisms have been success-
fully developed for universal grippers (37, 38) and stiffness-
tunable robots (39–41). Similar granular materials or layered
structures can be used in FOAMs to enhance the functionalities
of stiffness tuning and object manipulation (e.g., rigidify when an
object is grasped). These are appealing features given the com-
patibility with the FOAM concept both in terms of structures and
materials and with the use of negative pressure.

Programmable Motions
A variety of motions can be achieved by programing the geom-
etry of the skeleton (SI Appendix, Fig. S8 and Movie S6).
Assuming the fluid pressure is constant everywhere within the
skin, the skeleton’s shape transformation is determined by a com-
bination of the contractions from each individual structural void.
Identical voids can be distributed over the skeleton using differ-
ent arrangements for generating various synchronous contrac-
tions. A 90% linear contraction can be produced by an origami
skeleton using a symmetrical zigzag geometry (Fig. 3A). A skele-
ton using a standard Miura-ori origami pattern is able to gener-
ate a 2D surface contraction (92% contraction ratio) when a vac-
uum is applied (Fig. 3B). A 3D skeleton using the water-bomb
origami pattern can transform a spherical structure to a cylindri-
cal structure (91% contraction ratio) (Fig. 3C). Using an asym-
metrical arrangement of the voids, a bending motion can be pro-
duced on a beam-shaped skeleton (Fig. 3D). A flasher origami
skeleton can generate a rotation (>90◦) and a 54% contraction
simultaneously using a single vacuum supply (Fig. 3E).

In addition to the programmable arrangement for identical
voids, voids with different hinge stiffnesses can also be used
to achieve differential contractions. This principle can generate
asymmetrical out-of-plane motions. For example, a 2D Miura-ori
origami skeleton with some hinges weakened can realize a
complex motion that combines both torsion and contraction
(Fig. 3F). Furthermore, if the hinge or connection stiffnesses
ks are significantly distinct, then a controllable pseudosequen-
tial motion can be generated by the artificial muscle (Movie
S6). For example, three fingers on a robotic hand (Fig. 3G
and SI Appendix, Fig. S8G), with a bending–stiffness ratio
ks1 : ks2 : ks3 ≈ 1 : 2 : 3, can be actuated at different rates using
a single pressure control. In a second example, a pneumat-
ically driven robotic arm can first grip an object, then lift
and twist the gripped object. This pseudosequential multiax-
ial manipulation is achieved by a single control pressure. In
this case, the gripper’s plastic skeleton (polyester, elastic mod-
ulus ≈5 GPa) is much more compliant than the metal skeleton
(302 stainless steel, elastic modulus ≈190 GPa) in the “arm”
(Fig. 3H and SI Appendix, Fig. S8H. Although this motion is
not strictly sequential, we believe sequential motion is possi-
ble, if the response is tuned to be nonlinear, for example using
a group of distinct snap-through hinges integrated into the
skeleton (42, 43).

Performance Characterization
We characterized the force and contraction performances of
the proposed artificial muscles through a series of quasi-static
experiments. A group of linear zigzag actuators with nylon skins
were fabricated with different fold angles of their skeletons (SI
Appendix, Figs. S1E and S2I). A blocked force of ∼428 N was
generated using a regulated −90 kPa vacuum supply. This indi-
cates that this nylon-based linear artificial muscle can provide
an actuation stress of ∼600 kPa (approximately six times greater
than the sustainable stress of mammalian skeletal muscle) (1).
The peak free-contraction ratio was ∼50% without prestretch-
ing (SI Appendix, Fig. S2I). The maximum contraction ratio also
depends on the thickness of the skeleton materials, a contrac-
tion ratio over 90% is possible using a thinner zigzag skeleton
as shown in Fig. 3A. The effects of hysteresis, as observed from

linear zigzag actuator (weight ≈ 2.6 g, volume ≈ 32 cm3) and a common
ping-pong ball (weight≈ 2.5 g, volume≈ 33.5 cm3). The actuator is primar-
ily made of polyester sheets (skeleton thickness: 0.254 mm; skin thickness:
0.038 mm). (B) It can lift objects several orders of magnitude more massive
using a negative internal air pressure (−80 kPa). (C and D) Dynamic per-
formance in load-lifting tests. The actuator can lift a 1 kg load to 5.5 cm

peak power density over 2 kW/kg was obtained during the 2 kg load-lifting
tests (D).

our experiments, were negligible compared with an air cylin-
der (SI Appendix, Fig. S2 D and F), enhancing controllability
when using the muscle either as a force source or to control dis-
placement (SI Appendix, Fig. S5 C and D). To characterize the
dynamic performances including power density, energy conver-
sion efficiency, and bandwidth, we performed a group of load-
lifting experiments using a polyester-based lightweight artificial
muscle (Fig. 4A and Movie S7). This 10 cm-long linear actuator
was fabricated within 10 min, with materials costing less than $1.
This actuator weighs 2.6 g, and it can lift a 3 kg object within 0.2 s
using a −80 kPa vacuum. The open-loop control bandwidth of
this actuator was ∼1.1 Hz (with a 0.5 kg load; see SI Appendix,
Fig. S5E). The peak output power density obtained from our
experiments was over 2 kW/kg (Fig. 4C and SI Appendix, Fig.
S6E; the weight of the pressure source and associated plumb-
ing are not included), more than six times the peak power
density of mammalian skeletal muscles (0.3 kW/kg) (1). The
mechanical-to-mechanical energy conversion efficiencies of the
actuators were ∼23% (1 kg load, pneumatically driven) and 59%
(0.5 kg load, hydraulically driven) in our load-lifting experiments
(SI Appendix, Fig. S6D). However, the electrical-to-mechanical
energy efficiencies were ∼2% to 5%, when miniature electric
vacuum pumps were included into the systems (SI Appendix, Fig.
S6C). We should note that the actuators used for characteri-
zation have not been optimized for force, displacement, band-
width, or energy/power. Our experimental result reveals that
the proposed artificial muscles are powerful, fast, and energy
efficient.

Conclusions
In this study, we have demonstrated a concept of FOAMs. These

multidimensional actuation. This technique allows us to quickly
program, fabricate, and implement actuation systems for very
specific working environments at multiple scales, such as active
metamaterials (44), miniature surgical devices (45, 46), wearable
robotic exoskeletons (47), transformable architecture, as well as
deep-sea manipulation (48) and large deployable structures for
space exploration (49, 50). The use of negative pressure offers
a safer way of actuation for FOAMs compared with artificial
muscles driven by highly pressurized fluids. This is a promising
feature for future applications in wearable devices and human–
robot interactions.

Materials and Methods
The blocked force and free contraction were obtained using a universal test-
ing machine (Instron 5544A, Instron Corporation). A laser displacement sen-
sor (LK-031 and LK-2001, Keyence Corporation) was used to measure the

skin deformation (SI Appendix, Fig. S1 F and G). The muscle’s load-lifting
motion was recorded by a camera and then analyzed (speed and height)
using image-analyzing software in each test. A laser cutter was used to
cut thin-sheet skeletons, and most of the other skeletons were built by 3D
printers using different materials (e.g., nylon, TPU, etc.). A variety of thin-
sheet materials, such as TPU, PVC, polyester, and TPU-coated nylon fabric,
were used to make the skins. The majority of the skins were directly sealed
by an impulse heat sealer (AIE-410FL, American International Electric, Inc.)
using proper sealing times for the different skin materials (SI Appendix,
Table S1). More details can be found in SI Appendix.
