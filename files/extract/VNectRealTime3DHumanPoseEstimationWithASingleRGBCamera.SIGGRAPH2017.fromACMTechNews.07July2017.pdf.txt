We present the first real-time method to capture the full global 3D skeletal
pose of a human in a stable, temporally consistent manner using a single
RGB camera. Our method combines a new convolutional neural network
(CNN) based pose regressor with kinematic skeleton fitting. Our novel fully-
convolutional pose formulation regresses 2D and 3D joint positions jointly
in real time and does not require tightly cropped input frames. A real-time
kinematic skeleton fitting method uses the CNN output to yield temporally
stable 3D global pose reconstructions on the basis of a coherent kinematic
skeleton. This makes our approach the first monocular RGB method usable
in real-time applications such as 3D character control—thus far, the only
monocular methods for such applications employed specialized RGB-D cam-
eras. Our method’s accuracy is quantitatively on par with the best offline
3D monocular RGB pose estimation methods. Our results are qualitatively
comparable to, and sometimes better than, results from monocular RGB-D
approaches, such as the Kinect. However, we show that our approach is
more broadly applicable than RGB-D solutions, i.e., it works for outdoor
scenes, community videos, and low quality commodity RGB cameras.

1 INTRODUCTION
Optical skeletal motion capture of humans is widely used in applica-
tions such as character animation for movies and games, sports and
biomechanics, and medicine. To overcome the usability constraints
imposed by commercial systems requiring marker suits [Menache
2000], researchers developed marker-less motion capture meth-
ods that estimate motion in more general scenes using multi-view
video [Moeslund et al. 2006], with recent solutions being real-time
[Stoll et al. 2011]. The swell in popularity of applications such as real-
time motion-driven 3D game character control, self-immersion in
3D virtual and augmented reality, and human–computer interaction,
has led to new real-time full-body motion estimation techniques us-
ing only a single, easy to install, depth camera, such as the Microsoft
Kinect [Microsoft Corporation 2010, 2013, 2015]. RGB-D cameras
provide valuable depth data which greatly simplifies monocular
pose reconstruction. However, RGB-D cameras often fail in gen-
eral outdoor scenes (due to sunlight interference), are bulkier, have
higher power consumption, have lower resolution and limited range,
and are not as widely and cheaply available as color cameras.
Skeletal pose estimation from a single color camera is a much

more challenging and severely underconstrained problem. Monocu-
lar RGB body pose estimation in 2D has been widely researched, but

estimates only the 2D skeletal pose [Bourdev andMalik 2009; Felzen-
szwalb et al. 2010; Felzenszwalb and Huttenlocher 2005; Ferrari et al.
2009; Pishchulin et al. 2013; Wei et al. 2016]. Learning-based discrim-
inative methods, in particular deep learning methods [Insafutdinov
et al. 2016; Lifshitz et al. 2016; Newell et al. 2016; Tompson et al. 2014],
represent the current state of the art in 2D pose estimation, with
some of these methods demonstrating real-time performance [Cao
et al. 2016; Wei et al. 2016]. Monocular RGB estimation of the 3D
skeletal pose is a much harder challenge tackled by relatively fewer
methods [Bogo et al. 2016; Tekin et al. 2016b,c; Zhou et al. 2015,
2016, 2015b]. Unfortunately, these methods are typically offline, and
they often reconstruct 3D joint positions individually per image,
which are temporally unstable, and do not enforce constant bone
lengths. Most approaches also capture local 3D pose relative to a
bounding box, and not the full global 3D pose. This makes them
unsuitable for applications such as real-time 3D character control.
In this paper, we present the first method that captures tempo-

rally consistent global 3D human pose—in terms of joint angles of a
single, stable kinematic skeleton—in real-time (30 Hz) from a single
RGB video in a general environment. Our approach builds upon
the top performing single RGB 3D pose estimation methods using
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) [Mehta et al. 2016; Pavlakos
et al. 2016]. High accuracy requires training comparably deep net-
works which are harder to run in real-time, partly due to additional
preprocessing steps such as bounding box extraction. Mehta et al.
[2016] use a 100-layer architecture to predict 2D and 3D joint posi-
tions simultaneously, but is unsuitable for real-time execution. To
improve runtime, we use a shallower 50-layer network. However,
for best quality at real-time frame rates, we do not merely use a
shallower variant, but extend it to a novel fully-convolutional for-
mulation. This enables higher accuracy 2D and 3D pose regression,
in particular of end effectors (hands, feet), in real-time. In contrast
to existing solutions our approach allows operation on non-cropped
images, and where run-time is a concern, it can be used to bootstrap
a simple bounding box tracker. We also combine the CNN-based
joint position regression with an efficient optimization step to fit
a 3D skeleton to these reconstructions in a temporally stable way,
yielding the global pose and joint angles of the skeleton. In summary,
we contribute by proposing the first real-time method to capture
global 3D kinematic skeleton pose from single RGB video. To strike a
good compromise between computational complexity and accuracy,
our method combines:

• A new real-time, fully-convolutional 3D body pose formu-
lation using CNNs that yields 2D and 3D joint positions
simultaneously and forgoes the need to perform expensive
bounding box computations.

• Model-based kinematic skeleton fitting against the 2D/3D
pose predictions to produce temporally stable joint angles
of a metric global 3D skeleton, in real time.

Our real-time method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy compa-
rable to the best offline RGB pose estimation methods on standard
3D human body pose benchmarks, particularly for end effector posi-
tions (Section 5.2). Our results are qualitatively comparable to, and
sometimes better than, state-of-the-art single RGB-D methods [Gir-
shick et al. 2011], even commercial ones [Microsoft Corporation

2015]. We experimentally show that this makes ours the first single-
RGB method usable for similar real-time 3D applications—so far
only feasible with RGB-D input—such as game character control or
immersive first person virtual reality (VR). We further show that our
method succeeds in settings where existing RGB-D methods would
not, such as outdoor scenes, community videos, and even with low
quality video streams from ubiquitous mobile phone cameras.

2 RELATED WORK
Our goal is stable 3D skeletal motion capture from (1) a single
camera (2) in real-time. We focus the discussion of related work
on approaches from the large body of marker-less motion capture
research that contributed to attaining either of these properties.

Multi-view: With multi-view setups markerless motion-captue solu-
tions attain high accuracy. Tracking of a manually initialized actor
model from frame to framewith a generative image formationmodel
is common. See [Moeslund et al. 2006] for a complete overview. Most
methods target high quality with offline computation [Bregler and
Malik 1998; Howe et al. 1999; Loper and Black 2014; Sidenbladh
et al. 2000; Starck and Hilton 2003]. Real-time performance can be
attained by representing the actor with Gaussians [Rhodin et al.
2015; Stoll et al. 2011; Wren et al. 1997] and other approximations
[Ma and Wu 2014], in addition to formulations allowing model-to-
image fitting. However, these tracking-based approaches often lose
track in local minima of the non-convex fitting functions they opti-
mize and require separate initialization, e.g. using [Bogo et al. 2016;
Rhodin et al. 2016b; Sminchisescu and Triggs 2001]. Robustness
could be increased with a combination of generative and discrimina-
tive estimation [Elhayek et al. 2016], even from a single input view
[Rosales and Sclaroff 2006; Sminchisescu et al. 2006], and egocentric
perspective [Rhodin et al. 2016a]. We utilize generative tracking
components to ensure temporal stability, but avoid model projec-
tion through a full image formation model to speed up estimation.
Instead, we combine discriminative pose estimation with kinematic
fitting to succeed in our underconstrained setting.

Monocular Depth-based: The additional depth channel provided by
RGB-D sensors has led to robust real-time pose estimation solutions
[Baak et al. 2011; Ganapathi et al. 2012; Ma and Wu 2014; Shotton
et al. 2013; Wei et al. 2012; Ye and Yang 2014] and the availabil-
ity of low-cost devices has enabled a range of new applications.
Even real-time tracking of general deforming objects [Zollhöfer
et al. 2014] and template-free reconstruction [Dou et al. 2016; Inn-
mann et al. 2016; Newcombe et al. 2015; Orts-Escolano et al. 2016]
has been demonstrated. RGB-D information overcomes forward-
backwards ambiguities in monocular pose estimation. Our goal is a
video solution that overcomes depth ambiguities without relying
on a specialized active sensor.

Monocular RGB: Monocular generative motion capture has only
been shown for short clips and when paired with strong motion
priors [Urtasun et al. 2006] or in combination with discriminative
re-initialization [Rosales and Sclaroff 2006; Sminchisescu et al. 2006],
since generative reconstruction is fundamentally underconstrained.
Using photo-realistic template models for model fitting enables more
robust monocular tracking of simple motions, but requires more

frame’s keypoints Kt−1. From the crop, the CNN jointly predicts 2D heatmaps Hj,t and our novel 3D location-maps Xj,t , Yj,t and Zj,t for all joints j . The 2D
keypoints Kt are retrieved from Hj,t and, after filtering, are used to read off 3D pose PLt from Xj,t , Yj,t and Zj,t . These per-frame estimates are combined to

expensive offline computation [de La Gorce et al. 2008]. Sampling-
based methods avoid local minima [Balan et al. 2005; Bo and Smin-
chisescu 2010; Deutscher and Reid 2005; Gall et al. 2010]. However,
real-time variants can not guarantee global convergence due to a
limited number of samples, such as particle swarm optimization
techniques [Oikonomidis et al. 2011]. Structure-from-motion tech-
niques exploit motion cues in a batch of frames [Garg et al. 2013],
and have also been applied to human motion estimation [Gotardo
and Martinez 2011; Lee et al. 2013; Park and Sheikh 2011; Zhu et al.
2011]. However, batch optimization does not apply to our real-time
setting, where frames are streamed sequentially. For some appli-
cations manual annotation and correction of frames is suitable,
for instance to enable movie actor reshaping [Jain et al. 2010] and
garment replacement in video [Rogge et al. 2014]. In combination
with physical constraints, highly accurate reconstructions are pos-
sible from monocular video [Wei and Chai 2010]. Vondrak et al.
[2012] succeed without manual annotation by simulating biped-
controllers, but require batch-optimization. While these methods
can yield high-quality reconstructions, interaction and expensive
optimization preclude live applications.
Discriminative 2D human pose estimation is often an interme-

diate step to monocular 3D pose estimation. Pictorial structure
approaches infer body part locations by message passing over a
huge set of pose-states [Agarwal and Triggs 2006; Andriluka et al.
2009; Bourdev and Malik 2009; Felzenszwalb and Huttenlocher 2005;
Ferrari et al. 2009; Johnson and Everingham 2010] and have been
extended to 3D pose estimation [Amin et al. 2013; Balan et al. 2007;
Belagiannis et al. 2014; Sigal et al. 2012]. Recent approaches outper-
form these methods in computation time and accuracy by leveraging
large image databases with 2D joint location annotation, which en-
ables high accuracy prediction with deep CNNs [Belagiannis and
Zisserman 2016; Hu et al. 2016; Insafutdinov et al. 2016; Pishchulin
et al. 2016; Wei et al. 2016], on multiple GPUs, even at real-time
rates [Cao et al. 2016]. Given 2D joint locations, lifting them to 3D
pose is challenging. Existing approaches use bone length and depth
ordering constraints [Mori and Malik 2006; Taylor 2000], sparsity as-
sumptions [Wang et al. 2014; Zhou et al. 2015,a], joint limits [Akhter
and Black 2015], inter-penetration constraints [Bogo et al. 2016],
temporal dependencies [Rhodin et al. 2016b], and regression [Yasin
et al. 2016]. Treating 3D pose as a hidden variable in 2D estimation

is an alternative [Brau and Jiang 2016]. However, the sparse set
of 2D locations loses image evidence, e.g. on forward-backwards
orientation of limbs, which leads to erroneous estimates in ambigu-
ous cases. To overcome these ambiguities, discriminative methods
have been proposed that learn implicit depth features for 3D pose
directly from more expressive image representations. Rosales and
Sclaroff regress 3D pose from silhouette images with the specialized
mappings architecture [2000], Agarwal and Triggs with linear re-
gression [2006], and Elgammal and Lee through a joint embedding
of images and 3D pose [2004]. Sminchisescu further utilized tem-
poral consistency to propagate pose probabilities with a Bayesian
mixture of experts Markov model [2007]. Relying on the recent ad-
vances in machine learning techniques and compute capabilities,
approaches for direct 3D pose regression from the input image have
been proposed, using structured learning of latent pose [Li et al.
2015a; Tekin et al. 2016a], joint prediction of 2D and 3D pose [Li and
Chan 2014; Tekin et al. 2016b; Yasin et al. 2016], transfer of features
from 2D datasets [Mehta et al. 2016], novel pose space formula-
tions [Pavlakos et al. 2016] and classification over example poses
[Pons-Moll et al. 2014; Rogez and Schmid 2016]. Relative per-bone
predictions [Li and Chan 2014], kinematic skeleton models [Zhou
et al. 2016], or root centered joint positions [Ionescu et al. 2014a] are
used as the eventual output space. Such direct 3D pose regression
methods capture depth relations well, but 3D estimates usually do
not accurately match the true 2D location when re-projected to the
image, because estimations are done in cropped images that lose
camera perspective effects, using a canonical height, and minimize
3D loss instead of projection to 2D. Furthermore, they only deliver
joint positions, are temporally unstable, and none has shown real-
time performance. We propose a method to combine 2D and 3D
estimates in real-time along with temporal tracking. It is inspired
by the method of Tekin et al. [2016c], where batches of frames are
processed offline after motion compensation, and is related to the
recently proposed per-frame combination of 2D and 3D pose [Tekin
et al. 2016b].

Notably, only fewmethods target real-timemonocular reconstruc-
tion. Exceptions are the regression of 3D pose from Haar features
by Bissacco et al. [2007] and detection of a set of discrete poses
from edge direction histograms in the vicinity of the previous frame
pose [Taycher et al. 2006]. Both only obtain temporally unstable,

coarse pose, not directly usable in our applications. Chai and Hod-
gins obtain sufficient quality to drive virtual avatars in real-time, but
require visual markers [Chai and Hodgins 2005]. The use of CNNs in
real time has been explored for variants of the object detection prob-
lem, for instance bounding box detection and pedestrian detection
methods have leveraged application specific architectures [Angelova
et al. 2015; Liu et al. 2016; Redmon et al. 2015] and preprocessing
steps [Ren et al. 2015].

In a similar vein, we propose a 3D pose estimation approach that
leverages a novel fully-convolutional CNN formulation to predict 2D
and 3D pose jointly. In combination with inexpensive preprocessing
and an optimization based skeletal fitting method, it enables high
accuracy pose estimation, while running at more than 30 Hz.

3 OVERVIEW
Our system is capable of obtaining a temporally consistent, full
3D skeletal pose of a human from a monocular RGB camera. Esti-
mating 3D pose from a single RGB camera is a challenging, under-
constrained problem with inherent ambiguities. Figure 2 provides
an overview of our method to tackle this challenging problem. It
consists of two primary components. The first is a convolutional
neural network (CNN) to regress 2D and 3D joint positions under
the ill-posed monocular capture conditions. It is trained on anno-
tated 3D human pose datasets [Ionescu et al. 2014b; Mehta et al.
2016], additionally leveraging annotated 2D human pose datasets
[Andriluka et al. 2014; Johnson and Everingham 2010] for improved
in-the-wild performance. The second component combines the re-
gressed joint positions with a kinematic skeleton fitting method to
produce a temporally stable, camera-relative, full 3D skeletal pose.

CNN Pose Regression: The core of our method is a CNN that predicts
both 2D, and root (pelvis) relative 3D joint positions in real-time. The
new proposed fully-convolutional pose formulation leads to results
on par with the state-of-the-art offline methods in 3D joint position
accuracy (see Section 5.2 for details). Being fully-convolutional, it
can operate in the absence of tight crops around the subject. The
CNN is capable of predicting joint positions for a diverse class of
activities regardless of the scene settings, providing a strong basis
for further pose refinement to produce temporally consistent full-3D
pose parameters

Kinematic Skeleton Fitting: The 2D and the 3D predictions from the
CNN, together with the temporal history of the sequence, can be
leveraged to obtain temporally consistent full-3D skeletal pose, with
the skeletal root (pelvis) localized in camera space. Our approach
uses an optimization function that: (1) combines the predicted 2D
and 3D joint positions to fit a kinematic skeleton in a least squares
sense, (2) ensures temporally smooth tracking over time. We further
improve the stability of the tracked pose by applying filtering steps
at different stages.

Skeleton Initialization (Optional): The system is set up with a default
skeleton which works well out of the box for most humans. For more
accurate estimates, the relative body proportions of the underlying
skeleton can be adapted to that of the subject, by averaging CNN
predictions for a few frames at the beginning. Since monocular
reconstruction is ambiguous without a scale reference, the CNN

predicts height normalized 3D joint positions. Users only need to
provide their height (distance from head to toe) once, so that we
can track the 3D pose in true metric space.

4 REAL-TIME MONOCULAR 3D POSE ESTIMATION
In this section, we describe in detail the different components of our
method to estimate a temporally consistent 3D skeletal motion from
monocular RGB input sequences. As input, we assume a continuous
stream of monocular RGB images {..., It−1, It }. For frame t in the
input stream, the final output of our approach is PGt which is the
full global 3D skeletal pose of the person being tracked. Because
this output is already temporally consistent and in global 3D space,
it can be readily used in applications such as character control.

We use the following notation for the output in the intermediate
components of our method. The CNN pose regressor jointly esti-
mates the 2D joint positions Kt and root-relative 3D joint positions
PLt (Section 4.1). The 3D skeleton fitting component combines the
2D and 3D joint position predictions to estimate a smooth, tempo-
rally consistent pose PGt (θ , d), which is parameterized by the global
position d in camera space, and joint angles θ of the kinematic skele-
ton S . J indicates the number of joints. We drop the frame-number
subscript t in certain sections to aid readability.

4.1 CNN Pose Regression
The goal of CNN pose regression is to obtain joint positions, both,
in 2D image space and 3D. For 2D pose estimation with neural nets,
the change of formulation from direct regression of x ,y body-joint
coordinates [Toshev and Szegedy 2014] to a heatmap based body-
joint detection formulation [Tompson et al. 2014] has been the key
driver behind the recent developments in 2D pose estimation. The
heatmap based formulation naturally ties image evidence to pose
estimation by predicting a confidence heatmap Hj,t over the image
plane for each joint j ∈ {1..J }.
Existing approaches to 3D pose estimation lack such an image-

to-prediction association, often directly regressing the root-relative
joint locations [Ionescu et al. 2014a], leading to predicted poses
whose extent of articulation doesn’t reflect that of the person in the
image. See Figure 9. Treating pose as a vector of joint locations also
causes a natural gravitation towards networks with fully-connected
formulations [Mehta et al. 2016; Rogez and Schmid 2016; Tekin et al.
2016a; Yu et al. 2016], restricting the inputs to tight crops at a fixed
resolution, a limitation that needs to be overcome. These methods
assume the availability of tight bounding boxes, which necessitates
supplementation with separate bounding box estimators for actual
usage, which further adds to the run-time of these methods. The
fully-convolutional formulation of Pavlakos et al. [Pavlakos et al.
2016] seeks to alleviate some of these issues, but is limited by the
expensive per-joint volumetric formulation, which still relies on
cropped input and does not scale well to larger image sizes.

We overcome these limitations through our new formulation, by
extending the 2D heatmap formulation to 3D using three additional
location-maps Xj ,Yj ,Zj per joint j, capturing the root-relative lo-
cations x j , yj and zj respectively. To have the 3D pose prediction
linked more strongly to the 2D appearance in the image, the x j ,
yj and zj values are read off from their respective location-maps

Fig. 3. Schema of the fully-convolutional formulation for predicting root rel-
ative joint locations. For each joint j , the 3D coordinates are predicted from
their respective location-maps Xj , Yj , Zj at the position of the maximum

location-maps emerges due to the spatial loss formulation. See Section 4.1.

at the position of the maximum of the corresponding joint’s 2D
heatmap Hj , and stored in PL = {x, y, z}, where x ∈ R1×J is a vec-
tor that stores the coordinate x location of each joint maximum.
The pose formulation is visualized in Figure 3. Networks using this
fully-convolutional formulation are not constrained in input image
size, and can work without tight crops. Additionally, the network
provides 2D and 3D joint location estimates without additional over-
head, which we exploit in subsequent steps for real-time estimation.
Section 5.2 shows the improvements afforded by this formulation.

Loss Term: To enforce the fact that we are only interested in x j ,
yj and zj from their respective maps at joint j’s 2D location, the
joint location-map loss is weighted stronger around the joint’s 2D
location. We use the L2 loss. For x j is the loss formulation is

Loss(x j ) = ∥HGTj ⊙ (Xj − X
GT
j )∥2, (1)

where GT indicates ground truth and ⊙ is the Hadamard product.
The location maps are weighted with the respective ground truth 2D
heatmap HGTj , which in turn have confidence equal to a Gaussian
with a small support localized at joint j’s 2D location. Note that
no structure is imposed on the location-maps. The structure that
emerges in the predicted location-maps is indicative of the correla-
tion of x j and yj with root relative location of joint j in the image
plane. See Figure 3.

Network Details: We use the proposed formulation to adapt the
ResNet50 network architecture of He et al. [2016]. We replace the
layers of ResNet50 from res5a onwards with the architecture de-
picted in Figure 5, producing the heatmaps and location-maps for all
joints j ∈ {1..J }. After training, the Batch Normalization [Ioffe and
Szegedy 2015] layers are merged with the weights of their preceding
convolution layers to improve the speed of the forward pass.

Intermediate Supervision: We predict the 2D heatmaps and 3D
location-maps from the features at res4d and res5a, tapering down
the weights of intermediate losses with increasing iteration count.
Additionally, similar to the root-relative location-maps Xj , Yj and
Zj , we predict kinematic parent-relative location-maps ∆Xj , ∆Yj
and ∆Zj from the features at res5b and compute bone length-maps

as:
BLj =

√
∆Xj ⊙ ∆Xj + ∆Yj ⊙ ∆Yj + ∆Zj ⊙ ∆Zj . (2)

These intermediate predictions are subsequently concatenated with
the intermediate features, to give the network an explicit notion of
bone lengths to guide the predictions. See Figure 5.

Experiments showed that the deeper variants of ResNet offer only
small gains for a substantial increase (1.5×) in computation time,
prompting us to choose ResNet50 to enable real-time, yet highly
accurate joint location estimation with the proposed formulation.

Training: The network is pretrained for 2D pose estimation on
MPII [Andriluka et al. 2014] and LSP [Johnson and Everingham
2010, 2011] to allow superior in-the-wild performance, as proposed
by Mehta et al. [Mehta et al. 2016]. For 3D pose, we use MPI-INF-
3DHP [Mehta et al. 2016] and Human3.6m [Ionescu et al. 2014b].
We take training sequences for all subjects except S9 and S11 from
Human3.6m.We sample frames as per [Ionescu et al. 2014a]. ForMPI-
INF-3DHP, we consider all 8 training subjects. We choose sequences
from all 5 chest-high cameras, 2 head-high cameras (angled down)
and 1 knee-high camera (angled up) to learn some degree of invari-
ance to the camera viewpoint. The sampled frames have at least
one joint move by > 200mm between them. We use various combi-
nations of background, occluder (chair), upper-body clothing and
lower-body clothing augmentation for 70% of the selected frames.
We train with person centered crops, and use image scale augmen-
tation at 2 scales (0.7×, 1.0×), resulting in 75k training samples for
Human3.6m and 100k training samples for MPI-INF-3DHP. Figure
4 shows a few representative frames of training data. In addition
to the 17 joints typically considered, we use foot tip positions. The
ground truth joint positions are with respect to a height normalized
skeleton (knee–neck height 92 cm). We make use of the Caffe [2014]
framework for training, and use the Adadelta [Zeiler 2012] solver
with learning rate tapered down with increasing iterations.

Bounding Box Tracker : Existing offline solutions process each frame
in a separate person-localization and bounding box (BB) cropping
step [Mehta et al. 2016; Tekin et al. 2016c] or assume bounding
boxes are available [Li and Chan 2014; Li et al. 2015b; Pavlakos
et al. 2016; Tekin et al. 2016a; Zhou et al. 2016]. Although our fully-
convolutional formulation allows the CNN to work without requir-
ing cropping, the run-time of the CNN is highly dependent on the

input image size. Additionally, the CNN is trained for subject sizes
in the range of 250–340 px in the frame, requiring averaging of
predictions at multiple image scales per frame (scale space search) if
processing the full frame at each time step. Guaranteeing real-time
rates necessitates restricting the size of the input to the network
and tracking the scale of the person in the image to avoid searching
the scale space in each frame. We do this in an integrated way. The
2D pose predictions from the CNN at each frame are used to deter-
mine the BB for the next frame through a slightly larger box around
the predictions. The smallest rectangle containing the keypoints
K is computed and augmented with a buffer area 0.2× the height
vertically and 0.4× the width horizontally. To stabilize the estimates,
the BB is shifted horizontally to the centroid of the 2D predictions,
and its corners are filtered with a weighted average with the pre-
vious frame’s BB using a momentum of 0.75. To normalize scale,
the BB crop is resized to 368x368 px. The BB tracker starts with
(slow) multi-scale predictions on the full image for the first few
frames, and hones in on the person in the image making use of the
BB-agnostic predictions from the fully convolutional network. The
BB tracking is easy to implement and without runtime overhead,
since the proposed fully-convolutional network outputs 2D and 3D
pose jointly and operates on arbitrary input sizes.

4.2 Kinematic Skeleton Fitting
Applying per-frame pose estimation techniques on a video does
not exploit and ensure temporal consistency of motion, and small
pose inaccuracies lead to temporal jitter, an unacceptable artifact
for most graphics applications. We combine the 2D and 3D joint
positions in a joint optimization framework, along with temporal
filtering and smoothing, to obtain an accurate, temporally stable
and robust result. First, the 2D predictions Kt are temporally filtered
[Casiez et al. 2012] and used to obtain the 3D coordinates of each
joint from the location-map predictions, giving us PLt . To ensure
skeletal stability, the bone lengths inherent to PLt are replaced by
the bone lengths of the underlying skeleton in a simple retargeting
step that preserves the bone directions of PLt . The resulting 2D and

3D predictions are combined by minimizing the objective energy

Etotal(θ , d) = EIK(θ , d) + Eproj(θ , d)
+ Esmooth(θ , d) + Edepth(θ , d), (3)

for skeletal joint angles θ and the root joint’s location in camera
space d. The 3D inverse kinematics term EIK determines the overall
pose by similarity to the 3D CNN output PLt . The projection term
Eproj determines global position d and corrects the 3D pose by
re-projection onto the detected 2D keypoits Kt. Both terms are
implemented with the L2 loss,

Eproj = ∥Π(PGt ) − Kt ∥2 and EIK = ∥(PGt − d) − PLt ∥2, (4)

where Π is the projection function from 3D to the image plane,
and PGt = P

G
t (θ , d). We assume the pinhole projection model. If the

camera calibration is unknown a vertical field of view of 54 degrees
is assumed. Temporal stability is enforced with smoothness prior
Esmooth = ∥P̂Gt ∥2, penalizing the acceleration P̂Gt . To counteract the
strong depth uncertainty in monocular reconstruction, we penalize
large variations in depth additionally with Edepth = ∥[P̃Gt ]z ∥2 where
[P̃Gt ]z is the z component of 3D velocity P̃Gt . Finally, the 3D pose is
also filtered with the 1 Euro filter [Casiez et al. 2012].

Parameters: The energy terms EIK,Eproj,Esmooth and Edepth are
weighted with ωIK = 1,ωproj = 44,ωsmooth = 0.07 and ωdepth =
0.11, respectively. The parameters of the 1 Euro Filter [Casiez et al.
2012] are empirically set to fcmin = 1.7, β = 0.3 for filtering Kt , to
fcmin = 0.8, β = 0.4 for PLt , and to fcmin = 20, β = 0.4 for filtering
PGt . Our implementation uses the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm
from the Ceres library [Agarwal et al. 2017].

video. The importance of the steps towards enabling these applica-
tions with a video solution are thoroughly evaluated in more than
10 sequences. Results are comparable in quality to depth-camera
based solutions like the Kinect [Microsoft Corporation 2013] and
significantly outperform existing monocular video-based solutions.
As the qualitative baseline we choose the state-of-the-art 2D to 3D
lifting approach of Zhou et al. [2015] and the 3D regression approach
of Mehta et al. [2016], which estimate joint-positions offline. The
accuracy improvements are further quantitatively validated on the
established H3.6M dataset [Ionescu et al. 2014b] and the MPI-INF-
3DHP dataset [Mehta et al. 2016]. The robustness to diverse persons,
clothing and scenes is demonstrated on several real-time examples
and community videos. Please see our project webpage for more
results and details1.

Computations are performed on a 6-core Xeon CPU, 3.8 GHz and
a single Titan X (Pascal architecture) GPU. The CNN computation
takes ≈18 ms, the skeleton fitting ≈7–10 ms, and preprocessing and
filtering 5 ms.

5.1 Comparison with Active Depth Sensors (Kinect)
We synchronously recorded video from an RGB camera and a co-
located Kinect sensor in a living room scenario. Figure 6 shows rep-
resentative frames. Although the depth sensor provides additional
information, our reconstructions from just RGB are of a similar qual-
ity. The Kinect results are of comparable stability to ours, but yield
erroneous reconstructions when limbs are close to scene objects,
such as when sitting down. Our RGB solution, however, succeeds
in this case, although is slightly less reliable in depth estimation.
A challenging case for both methods is the tight crossing of legs.
Please see the supplemental video for a visual comparison.
The video solution succeeds also in situations with direct sun-

light (Figure 7), where IR-based depth cameras are inoperable. More-
over, RGB cameras can simply be equipped with large field-of-view
(FOV) lenses and, despite strong distortions, successfully track hu-
mans [Rhodin et al. 2016a]. On the other hand, existing active sen-
sors are limited to relatively small FOVs, which severely limits the
tracking volume.

5.2 Comparison with Video Solutions

Qualitative Evaluation: We qualitatively compare against the 3D
pose regression method of Mehta et al. [2016] and Zhou et al. [2015]
on Sequence 6 (outdoor) of MPI-INF-3DHP test set. Our results are
comparable to the quality of these offline methods (see Figure 10).
However, the per frame estimates of these offline methods exhibits
jitter over time, a drawback of most existing solutions. Our full pose
results are temporally stable and are computed at real-time frame
rate of 30 Hz.

The kinematic skeleton fitting estimates global translation d. Fig-
ure 8 demonstrates that estimates are drift-free, the feet position
matches with the same reference point after performing a circular
walk. The smoothness constraint in depth direction limits sliding
of the character away from the character, as pictured in the supple-
mental video sequences.

Fig. 6. Side-by-side pose comparison with our method (top) and Kinect
(bottom). Overall estimated poses are of similar quality (first two frames).
Both the Kinect (third and fourth frames) and our approach (fourth and
fifth frames) occasionally predict erroneous poses.

Fig. 7. Our approach succeeds in strong illumination and sunlight (center
right and right), while the IR-based depth estimates of the Microsoft Kinect
are erroneous (left) and depth-based tracking fails (center left).

Fig. 8. The estimated 3D pose is drift-free. The motion of the person starts
and ends at the marked point (orange), both in the real world and in our
reconstruction.

Quantitative Evaluation: We compare our method with the state-
of-the-art approach of Mehta et al. [2016] on the MPI-INF-3DHP
dataset, using the more robust Percentage of Correct Keypoints
metric (3D PCK @150mm) on the 14 joints spanned by head, neck,
shoulders, elbow, wrist, hips, knees and ankles. We train both, our
model, as well as that of Mehta et al. on the same data (Human3.6m
+ MPI-INF-3DHP), as detailed in Section 4.1, to be compatible in
terms of the camera viewpoints selected, and use ResNet100 as the
base architecture for a fair comparison. Table 1 shows the results of
the raw 3D predictions from our network on ground-truth bounding
box cropped frames. We see that the results are comparable to that
of Mehta et al. The slight increase in accuracy on going to a 50-layer
network is possibly due to the better gradient estimates coming
from larger mini-batches that can be fit into memory while training,
on account of the smaller size of the network. Evidence that our

predictions.

method ties the estimated 3D positions strongly to image appear-
ance than previous methods can also be gleaned from the fact that
our approach performs significantly better for activity classes such
as Standing/Walking, Sports and Miscellaneous without significant
self-occlusions. We do lose some performance on activity classes
with significant self-occlusion such as Sitting/Lying on the floor. We
additionally report the Mean Per Joint Position Error (MPJPE) num-
bers in mm. Note that MPJPE is not a robust measure, and is heavily
influenced by large outliers, and hence the worse performance on
the MPJPE measure (124.7mm vs 117.6mm) despite the better 3D
PCK results (76.6% vs 75.7%). We further investigate the nature of
errors of our method. We first look at the joint-wise breakup of
accuracy of our fully-convolutional ResNet100 CNN predictions vs
Mehta et al. ’s formulation with fully-connected layers. Figure 11
shows that the accuracy of ankles for our formulation is significantly
better, while the accuracy of the head is markedly worse.

In Figure 9, we visually compare the two methods, further demon-
strating the strong tie-in to image appearance that our formulation
affords, and the downsides of the strong tie-in. We also show that
our method is prone to occasional large mispredictions when the
body joint 2D location detector misfires. It is these large outliers that
obfuscate the reported MPJPE numbers. Figure 12, which plots the

fraction of mispredicted joints vs. the error threshold on MPI-INF-
3DHP test set shows that our method has a higher fraction of per-
joint mispredictions beyond 300mm. It explains the higher MPJPE
numbers compared to Mehta et al. despite equivalent PCK perfor-
mance. The various filtering stages employed in the full pipeline
ameliorate these large mispredictions.

ForHuman3.6m,we follow the protocol as in earlier work [Pavlakos
et al. 2016; Tekin et al. 2016b,c], and evaluate on all actions and cam-
eras for subject number 9 and 11, and report Mean Per Joint Position
Error (mm) for root relative 3D joint positions from our network.
See Table 3. Note that despite the occasional large outliers affecting
the MPJPE measure, our predictions are still better than most of the
existing methods.
The accuracy attained from single view methods is still below

that of real-time multi-view methods, which can achieve a mean
accuracy of the order of 10mm [Stoll et al. 2011].

Generalization to Different Persons and Scenes: We tested our method
on a variety of actors, it succeeds for different body shapes, gender
and skin tone. See supplemental video. To further validate the robust-
ness we applied the methods to community videos from YouTube,
see Figure 1. It generalizes well to the different backgrounds and
camera types.

Fig. 13. Fraction of joints correctly predicted on the TS1 sequence of MPI-
INF-3DHP test set, as determined by the distance between the predicted
joint location and the ground truth joint location being below the error
threshold. The dotted line marks the 150mm threshold for which the 3D
PCK numbers are reported. We see that only using the 2D predictions
as constraints for skeleton fitting (blue) performs significantly worse than
using both 2D and 3D predictions as constraints (red). Though adding 1 Euro
filtering (purple) visually improves the results, the slightly higher error here
is due to the sluggish recovery from tracking failures. The 3D predictions
from the CNN (green) are also shown.

Model Components: To demonstrate that our fully-convolutional
pose formulation is less sensitive to inexact cropping than networks
using a fully-connected formulation, we emulate a noisy BB estima-
tor by jittering the ground-truth bounding box corners of MPI-INF-
3DHP test set uniformly at random in the range of +/- 40 px. This
also captures scenarios where one or more end effectors are not in
the frame, so a loss in accuracy is expected for all methods. Table 2
shows that the fully-connected formulation of Mehta et al. suffers a
worse hit in accuracy than our approach, going down by 7.9 PCK,
while our comparable network goes down by only 5.5 PCK.

We show the effect of the various components of our full pipeline
on the TS1 sequence of MPI-INF-3DHP test set in Figure 13. Without
the EIK component of Etotal the tracking accuracy goes down to a
PCK of 46.1% compared to a PCK of 81.7% when EIK is used. The raw
CNN 3D predictions in conjunction with the BB tracker result in a
PCK of 80.3%. Using EIK in Etotal produces consistently better results
for all thresholds lower than 150 mm. This shows the improvements
brought about by our skeleton fitting term. Additionally, as shown
in the supplementary video, using 1 Euro filtering produces qualita-
tively better results, but the overall PCK decreases slightly (79.7%)
due to slower recovery from tracking failures. The influence of
the smoothness and filtering steps on the temporal consistency are
further analyzed in the supplemental video.

5.3 Applications
Our approach is suitable for various interactive applications since
it is real-time, temporally stable, fully automatic, and exports data
directly in a format amenable to 3D character control.

Character Control: Real-time motion capture solutions provide a
natural interface for game characters and virtual avatars, which
go beyond classical mouse and gamepad control. We applied our
method on motions common in activities like tennis, dance, and
juggling, see Figures 1 and 14. The swing of the arm and leg motion
is nicely captured and could, for instance, be used in a casual sports

and dancing game, but also for motion analysis of professional
athletes to optimize their motion patterns. We also show successful
results in non front-facing motions such as turning and writing on
a wall, as well as squatting.

Virtual Reality: The recent availability of cheap head-mounted
displays has sparked a range of new applications. Many products
use handheld devices to track the user’s hand position for inter-
action. Our solution enables them from a single consumer color
camera. Beyond interaction, our marker-less full-body solution en-
ables embodied virtual reality, see Figure 1. A rich immersive feeling
is created by posing a virtual avatar of the user exactly to their own
real pose. With our solution the real and virtual pose are aligned
such that users perceive the virtual body as their own.

Ubiquitous Motion Capture with Smartphones: Real-time monocular
3D pose estimation lends itself to application on low quality smart-
phone video streams. By streaming the video to a machine with
sufficient capabilities for our algorithm, one can turn any smart-
phone into a lightweight, fully-automatic, handheld motion capture
sensor, see Figure 15 and the accompanying video. Since smart-
phones are widespread, it enables the aforementioned applications
for casual users without requiring additional sensing devices.

6 LIMITATIONS
Depth estimation from a monocular image is severely ill posed,
slight inaccuracies in the estimation can lead to largely different
depth estimates, which manifests also in our results in slight tem-
poral jitter. We claim improved stability and temporal consistency
compared to existing monocular RGB 3D pose estimation methods.
This uncertainty could be further reduced with domain specific
knowledge, e.g., foot-contact constraints when the floor location
is known, and head-pose stabilization with the position of head-
mounted-displays in VR applications, which is readily obtained with
IMU-sensors.
A downside of our CNN prediction formulation is that mispre-

dictions of 2D joint locations result in implausible 3D poses. This is
ameliorated in the tracker through skeleton retargeting and pose

method provides a natural motion interface, e.g. for sport games.

filtering. This could be addressed directly in the CNN through im-
position of stronger interdependencies between predictions. Addi-
tionally, the performance on poses with significant amounts of self
occlusion remains a challenge.

(left) and our estimated pose (right), streamed to and processed by a GPU
enabled PC.

Further, very fast motions can exceed the convergence radius of
our IK optimization, but the integration of per frame 2D and 3D
pose yields quick recovery from erroneous poses. Initial experiments
with 256 × 256 px input to the CNN show that much higher frame
rates are possible with no loss in accuracy.

7 DISCUSSION
The availability of sufficient annotated 3D pose training data re-
mains an issue. Even the most recent annotated real 3D pose data
sets, or combined real/synthetic data sets [Chen et al. 2016; Ionescu
et al. 2014b; Mehta et al. 2016] are a subset of real world human
pose, shape, appearance and background distributions. Recent top
performing methods explicitly address this data sparsity by training
similarly deep networks, but with architectural changes enabling
improved intermediate training supervision [Mehta et al. 2016].
Our implementation only supports a single person, although

the proposed fully-convolutional formulation could be scaled to
multiple persons. Such an extension is currently precluded due to
the lack of multi-person datasets, required to train multi-person 3D
pose regressors. One possible approach is to adapt the multi-person
2D pose methods of Insafutdinov et al. [2016] and Cao et al. [2016].
We also analyze the impact of 2D joint position mispredictions

on the 3D joint position predictions from our fully-convolutional
formulation. We decouple the 3D predictions from the 2D predic-
tions by looking up the 3D joint positions from their location-maps
using the ground truth 2D joint positions. See Table 4. We see a 3D
PCK improvement of 2.8, which is congruent with the notion of a
stronger tie-in of the predicted joint positions with the image plane,
which causes the 3D joint predictions to be erroneous when 2D
joint detection misfires. The upside of this is that the 3D predictions
can be improved through improvements to 2D joint position predic-
tion. Alternatively, optimization formulations that directly operate
on the heatmaps and the location-maps could be constructed. Our

Table 4. Results onMPI-INF-3DHP test set with the 3D joint position lookup
in the location-maps done using the ground truth 2D locations rather the
predicted 2D locations. We see that the location maps have captured better
3D pose information, which can perhaps be extracted through optimization
methods operating directly on heatmaps and location-maps. The evaluation
uses 2 scales (0.7, 1.0).

fully-convolutional formulation can also benefit from iterative re-
finement, akin to heatmap-based 2D pose estimation approaches
[Hu et al. 2016; Newell et al. 2016].

8 CONCLUSION
We have presented the first method that estimates the 3D kinematic
pose of a human, including global position, in a stable, temporally
consistent manner from a single RGB video stream at 30 Hz. Our
approach combines a fully-convolutional CNN that regresses 2D and
3D joint positions and a kinematic skeleton fitting method, produc-
ing a real-time temporally stable 3D reconstruction of the motion.
In contrast to most existing approaches, our network can operate
without strict bounding boxes, and facilitates inexpensive bounding
box tracking. We have shown results in a variety of challenging
real-time scenarios, including live streaming from a smartphone
camera, as well as in community videos. A number of applications
have been presented, such as embodied VR and interactive character
control for computer games.

Qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that our ap-
proach compares to offline state-of-the-art monocular RGB methods
and approaches the quality of real-time RGB-D methods. Hence, we
believe our method is a significant step forward to democratizing
3D human pose estimation, lifting both the need for special cameras
such as the IR-based depth cameras, as well as the long and heavy
processing times.
