Majorana fermion is a hypothetical particle that is its own antiparticle.We report transport
measurements that suggest the existence of one-dimensional chiral Majorana fermion
modes in the hybrid system of a quantum anomalous Hall insulator thin film coupled
with a superconductor. As the external magnetic field is swept, half-integer quantized
conductance plateaus are observed at the locations of magnetization reversals, giving a
distinct signature of the Majorana fermion modes. This transport signature is reproducible
over many magnetic field sweeps and appears at different temperatures. This finding may
open up an avenue to control Majorana fermions for implementing robust topological
quantum computing.

M
ajorana fermion, proposed by Ettore
Majorana in 1937 (1), is a putative elemen-
tary spin-1/2 particle with the unusual
property of being its own antiparticle. In
condensed-matter systems, analogs of

Majorana fermions can be realized as quasipar-
ticles of topological states of quantum matter,
such as the n = 5/2 quantumHall state (2), Moore-
Read–type states in the fractional quantum Hall
effect (3), two-dimensional (2D) px + ipy spinless
superconductors (4), strong spin-orbit coupling
semiconductor-superconductor heterostructures
(5, 6), and ferromagnetic atomic chains on a
superconductor (7, 8). Viewed as a supercon-
ducting analog of the quantum Hall state (9),
a chiral topological superconductor (TSC) in two
dimensions has a full pairing gap in the bulk
and an odd number N gapless chiral Majorana
fermion modes at the edge (10, 11). The funda-
mental aspects of the Majorana fermion modes
and their non-Abelian braiding properties can be
potentially used to implement topological qubits
in fault-tolerant quantum computation (12–15).
Numerous schemes to accommodate Majorana

fermion modes in superconductors coupled with
topological matter have been proposed (16–31).
The Majorana zero mode, a 0D version of the
Majorana fermion, is a charge-neutral bound state
that exists strictly at zero energy. Its existence
could be spectroscopically demonstrated by the
“zero-bias conductance anomalies”modulated by
external electrical/magnetic fields (20–27, 32).
Although these observations provide promising
signatures of Majorana bound states, it is difficult
to energetically resolve the contributions from
other effects, such as Kondo correlations, Andreev-
bound states, weak antilocalization, and reflec-
tionless tunneling (20–22, 33–35).
In contrast, a recent theoretical proposal fo-

cuses on the direct transport signatures of the 1D
Majorana fermion modes (16–18). The 1DMajorana
fermion mode satisfies the propagating wave
equation originally proposed by Ettore Majorana
(1). A series of theoretical results (16–18, 36) sug-
gests that a chiral TSC based on a quantum anom-
alous Hall insulator (QAHI) might be a promising
host of 1D Majorana fermion modes because the
chiral Hall state can be achieved without strong
external magnetic fields, preserving supercon-
ductivity. To break time-reversal symmetry, the
single-domain phase of the QAHI requires an
external field of ~0.1 T, which is more than one
order of magnitude lower than the critical field
of typical superconducting metals. By modu-
lating the external field, topological transitions
can lead eventually to the establishment of single
chiral Majorana edge modes (CMEMs).
When a superconductor is coupled to a QAHI

thin film—i.e., a magnetic topological insulator
thin film—a reversal of the magnetization can
induce a series of topological phase transitions.
The proposed scheme is demonstrated in Fig. 1A,
(i) to (vii), where a superconducting region is
introduced in the middle of a QAHI channel. The
effective Hamiltonian of the QAHI region is

written as H0 ¼

describes the hybridization between the top and
bottom surfaces, which is responsible for open-
ing a trivial surface gap (the Chern number C =
0 state). m0 and m1 are the hybridization gap
and the parabolic band component, respective-
ly. The Chern number of the system is C = l / |l|
for |l| > |m0|, where |C| is equal to the number of
the chiral edge channels; for |l| < |m0|, C becomes
0. As a result, by adjusting the external magnetic
field, a transition between a normal insulator
(NI) with C = 0 (zero plateau, Hall conductance
sxy = 0) to a QAHI with C = ±1 (integer plateau,
sxy = ±e

2/h) can be achieved (38, 39). In the middle
of the QAHI bar, the proximity to an s-wave super-
conductor drives the QAHI into a superconduct-
ing regime, where a finite superconducting pairing
amplitude is induced to the surface of the QAHI,
and in this case the system can be described by
the Bogoliubov–de Gennes (BdG) Hamiltonian

Here, m is the chemical potential and D1,2 are
the pairing gap functions of the top and bottom
surface states, respectively (17, 18, 36). In prin-
ciple, each chiral edge state in the quantum Hall
regime is topologically equivalent to two iden-
tical copies of CMEMs, such that the total Chern
number is even (N = 2C in this case). The key to
achieving a single CMEM is to induce a topological
phase with an odd Chern number to separate
the two copies of CMEMs (16). When the struc-
tural symmetry is preserved between the top
and bottom surface states—i.e., D = D1 = D2—
the topological transition in the TSC region can
only occur betweenN = ±2 [Fig. 1A, (i) and (vii)]
and N = 0 (iv), where the QAHI regions expe-
rience a NI-QAHI-NI transition, thanks to the
surface hybridization. The topological phase tran-
sitions for all three regions are synchronized, and
the two CMEMs cannot be distinguished from
each other. However, when the structural inver-
sion symmetry is broken, the pairing amplitudes
of the top and bottom surfaces are different
(D1 6¼ D2), and phases withN = ±1 [Fig. 1A, (ii),
(iii), (v), and (vi)] emerge (17, 18, 36). The half-
integer conductance of the system can be de-
rived from the scattering matrix for the two
QAHI edge states at the entrance and exit of

the TSC, which allows for a calculation of the
propagation of charge and, therefore, the elec-
trical conductivity (see the supplementary
text).
To experimentally identify the CMEM, we fab-

ricate a QAHI-TSC device (Fig. 1B). The QAHI
bar with dimensions of 2 mm by 1 mm is imple-
mented using a magnetic topological insulator
thin film (Cr0.12Bi0.26Sb0.62)2Te3 grown on a
GaAs (111)B substrate by molecular beam epitaxy.
The Fermi level is within the surface gap without
the assistance of electric-field tuning with a gate
(38). Because the hybridization gap, m0, is impor-
tant to control the proposed topological phase
change, the QAHI film thickness is precisely con-
trolled to be six quintuple layers, i.e., around 6 nm
(38, 40). Across the central part of the QAHI bar,
a superconductor bar (8 mm by 0.6 mm) is depos-
ited, which contains a 200-nm layer of Nb protected
by a 5-nm layer of Au. A control QAHI Hall bar of
the same dimension is also fabricated near the
TSC device on the same wafer. The field-dependent
total longitudinal conductance (s12) is obtained
by passing an alternating current (I12 in Fig. 1B)
through the outer two probes and measuring the
potential drop across the inner two probes (Fig. 1B,
points 1 and 2). In the control QAHI device, trans-

verse and longitudinal resistivities are obtained
using the standard Hall bar setup (Fig. 1B, right).
The single CMEM corresponding to N = ±1

can be identified experimentally by a unique
transport signature of a half-integer longitudi-
nal conductance plateau (0.5 e2/h) during the re-
versal of the magnetization (17, 18, 36). When the
external field is large enough, the device fully
reaches the QAHI scheme (C = ±1). In the TSC
region, both of the two CMEMs exist, forming
the phase of N = ±2. Because the two CMEMs
are topologically equivalent to one QAHI state
(C = ±1), all incident edge modes can almost
perfectly transmit through the device, as shown
in Fig. 1A, (i) and (vii) [compared with (viii) in
the QAHI regime], leading to s12 = e

2/h (to be
discussed in Fig. 2C). When the magnetic field
is reduced, the TSC region experiences the first
topological phase change, leading toN = ±1, such
that one of the paired CMEMs vanishes. Because
the QAHI regions are still in the C = ±1 phase,
the incident QAHI state can transmit only one
of the CMEMs to the TSC region, whereas the
other CMEM is almost perfectly reflected. This
leads to the separation between the two CMEMs
in the incident QAHI state [Fig. 1A, (ii) and (vi)],
such that a half-integer plateau of the longitu-

dinal conductance would occur (to be discussed
in Fig. 2C). Further reducing the magnetic field
drives the QAHI regions to the NI phase (C = 0),
where the surface hybridization gap shuts down
the conducting channels (s12 = 0). Although the
TSC region still experiences two more topological
transitions (N = –1, 0, 1), no current should go
through in these cases, as shown in Figs. 1A, (iii),
(iv), and (v). Thus, during every reversal of the
magnetization, s12 presents a half-integer plateau
close to the coercive fields.
The transport channel formed by the CMEM of

N = ±1 is experimentally demonstrated by the
longitudinal conductance signal of the QAHI-TSC
device. Figure 2A illustrates the temperature-
dependent upper critical field ðm0H⊥C2Þ in the out-
of-plane direction of the Nb bar using a standard
four-probe method (magenta configuration in
Fig. 1B). Here, the zero-resistance temperature
(corresponding to the temperature at which the
zero-resistance state is just achieved) is extracted
from the temperature-dependent resistance char-
acteristics under different perpendicular mag-
netic fields (Fig. 2A, inset). The resulting m0H

shows a linear temperature dependence, which
follows the standard linearized Ginzburg-Landau
theory for 2D superconductors. For comparison,

Fig. 1. Chiral Majorana edge modes in the quantum anomalous Hall
insulator–superconductor structure. (A) The edge transport configurations
of the topological superconductor device as shown in the left of (B) evolve
during a sweep of the external magnetic field (i) to (vii). This sweep starts
by saturating the magnetization along +z (i), and then the field is reduced
to zero. Further increasing the field along –z initiates the reversal of the
magnetization (ii). During this reversal, the QAHI enters the trivial insulating
state (C = 0), such that the system evolves to (iii), (iv), and (v), consecutively.
When the magnetization is close to a full saturation along –z, the
transport configuration is driven to (vi). Finally, when a large negative field
is applied to fully reverse the magnetization, the system ends up with (vii).
Likewise, when the field is swept from –z to +z, the system evolves in
a similar manner, but the current directions are opposite to those in (i) to
(vii). Pink and green arrows represent the CMEMs. There is no normal
backscattering for TSCN=±2 [(i) and (vii)], while Majorana modes transmit
through the TSCN=±1 [(ii) and (vi)]. The last Hall bar (viii) demonstrates

the example of the C = –1 chiral edge transport in a QAHI. (B) Schematics
of a TSC device consisting of a QAHI (Cr0.12Bi0.26Sb0.62)2Te3 thin film (6 nm
thick) and a superconductor Nb bar. A QAHI Hall bar was also fabricated
on the same wafer as a reference.The four-terminal longitudinal conductance
(s12) of the TSC device was obtained by passing a current (I12) and
measuring the potential drop across points 1 and 2. To characterize the
upper critical field ðm0H⊥C2Þ of the Nb bar, its temperature-dependent
resistance was measured using an independent four-probe method by
passing a current ISC and measuring the voltage VSC under different
perpendicular magnetic field strengths (see also Fig. 2A, inset). On the right
side, to obtain the Hall conductance (sxy) of the QAHI device, longitudinal
(Vxx) and transverse (Vxy) voltages were measured when passing a current I0.

The potential drop across the entire Hall bar ðV 012Þ was also independently
measured to calculate its total longitudinal conductance ðs012Þ. (C) Images of
the device structures. (Left) QAHI Hall bar with a Nb/Au bar covering the

the temperature-dependent coercive field ðm0HCÞ
of the QAHI derived from the Hall measurements
(fig. S1) is plotted in the same figure. Because
m0H

⊥
C2 is more than one order of magnitude larger

than m0HC of the QAHI, the superconductivity
is ensured even when the QAHI is driven into a

single magnetic domain regime under a relatively
large external magnetic field. At 350 mK, two
longitudinal conductance (s12) plateaus show
up at the low-field shoulders of the s12 valleys
in Device I (Fig. 2B). These plateaus occur at
~+80 mT, with conductance values of 0.49 e2/h.

The plateaus at the high-field shoulders cannot
be resolved as clearly as the low-field ones. They
appear as kinks valued at 0.51(±0.05) e2/h. The
pertinent data obtained from other two TSC
devices (II and III) exhibit 0.52(±0.06) and
0.48(±0.07) e2/h conductance plateaus at a

similar magnetic field. These plateaus are close
to the predicted value (0.5 e2/h) where the trans-
port in the TSC region is dominated by the 1D
channel of the CMEM in the N = ±1 phase
[see Fig. 1A, (ii) and (vi)]. Despite the fact that
Majorana fermions are charge neutral, the two
CMEMs at the two edges of the TSCN=±1 con-
stitute a coherent charged basis that transmits
exactly one-half of the incoming charges. At
20 mK, distinct plateaus with the quantized
value of 0.50(±0.06) e2/h are seen at both shoul-
ders of the s12 valleys (Fig. 2C). Outside the half-
plateau regimes, when the magnetization is fully
saturated, the conductance reaches a quantized
value of 0.98(±0.04) e2/h, indicating the C = ±1 /
N= ±2 phases [see Fig. 1A, (i) and (vii)]. On
the other hand, during the reversal of the mag-
netization, s12 dips into a valley corresponding
to the NI phase of the QAHI regions [see Fig.
1A, (iii), (iv), and (v)]. Ideally, the NI phase should
completely shut down the QAHI channels, lead-
ing to zero-conductance plateaus. However, this
requires an ultra-smooth sample such that the
electrostatic fluctuations throughout the device
are smaller than the hybridization gap (~4 meV)
induced by the coupling between the top and
bottom surface states of the QAHI thin film.
Thanks to the proximity effect, band-bending may
occur at the Nb covered region, such that the
device may not be fully insulating as expected,
resulting in a vanishingly small but observable
residual s12 of ~0.05 e

2/h observed in the NI phase
(Fig. 2C). Furthermore, in this field range, the
resistance between leads 1 and 2 can increase
to as high as 10 to 100 MW (or even higher), which
is comparable to the internal resistance of the
lock-in amplifier instrument, making the accurate
measurement of s12 very challenging. Consistent
with the phase transitions during the magnetic
reversal, the half-integer plateaus (or kinks) occur
at every reversal of the magnetization in the hys-
teresis loop. Such magnetization reversals can
also be seen in a QAHI device with its Hall con-
ductance (sxy) plotted in Fig. 2D aligned to Fig.
2C, where two intermediate zero plateaus (sxy ~ 0)
induced by the NI-QAHI transition occur at the
coercive fields HC = ~±170mT (38, 40). In these
half-integer plateaus (Fig. 2C), the transport in
the TSC region is, in principle, purely dominated
by a collection of chiral Majorana fermions as 1D
edge modes. This feature is distinct from the
“zero-bias conductance anomalies” induced by
0D Majorana bound states (20, 22, 27, 32), and
is as a hallmark signature associated with the
chiral Majorana edge transport channels in the
TSCN=±1 phases.
To further confirm the transport signature of

the CMEMs in theN = ±1 phase, we carried out
measurements at higher temperatures (Fig. 3A).
With increasing temperature, the thermal broaden-
ing of the transport window gradually smeared
the half-integer plateaus, which became kinks of
finite slopes and then eventually disappeared
above 400, 470, and 390 mK for Devices I (Fig.
3B), II (fig. S2A), and III (fig. S2B), respectively.
In all three devices, the kinks at high-field re-
versals are always narrower than the low-field

plateaus, and they vanish earlier as the temper-
ature increases. This discrepancy between low-
field and high-field reversals may be attributed
to the magnetic field hindering the superconduct-
ing phase. Although the external magnetic field
is lower than the critical field of the Nb bar (as
shown in Fig. 2A), the interfacial exchange coupling
between the Nb and the QAHI may provide a
much larger effective field, which suppresses the
superconducting phase in the TSC region.
Other effects that might lead to the observed

transport signatures, such as the Barkhausen
effect (41), must be ruled out. When domains
are small and not strongly pinned by impurities,
domain walls abruptly jump during the magne-
tization reversal, and the resultant stochastic
Barkhausen steps therefore often appear in
bunches that are irreproducible during different
magnetic field sweeps. These steps mainly occur
at small magnetic fields (fig. S3), and none of
them could reach Rxx = 2 h/e

2 (supplementary
text). In contrast, the CMEM-induced half-integer

plateaus in Device I can be reproduced (fig. S4)
with clear temperature traces (Fig. 3A), and they
occur both in low-field and high-field cases (Fig.
2C). When large domains are pinned by impur-
ities or defects, some Barkhausen steps can be
retraceable at large magnetic fields, as shown in
fig. S2A for Device II. However, these steps can
be strongly suppressed with improved sample
quality, as shown in Fig. 3A for Device I and fig.
S2B for Device III. Among all three devices, only
the 0.5 e2/h plateaus survive in all cases, suggest-
ing that they originate from a fundamentally
different mechanism. Only the backscattering
originating in the TSCN=±1 phase could lead to
such a half-quantized conductance that persists
in different batches of devices. Any backscattering
processes from the TSCN=±2 or the NSCN=0 phase
would have a considerably smaller Andreev
scattering, which cannot explain the half-integer
conductance.
Another alternative explanation of the half-

integer s12 might be that the two QAHI regions

external perpendicular magnetic field. At the upper critical field of the Nb bar of about 4 T at 20 mK
(Fig. 2A), the superconductivity of Nb and the topological superconductivity underneath are
expected to be eliminated. Afterward, the Nb bar becomes a floating metal and connects its left
and right QAHI bars in series. Thus, s12 gradually decreases as the field increases and quantizes
to ~0.5 e2/h when the field reaches about 4 T. (B) Schematic configuration of a TSC device for the
conductance measurements. The three-terminal conductance (s13 and s23) was obtained by passing
a current from either the QAHI lead to the superconductor Nb (I13 and I23) and measuring the
corresponding potential drop (across points 1-3 and 2-3). (C and D) The resulting s13 and s23 as
functions of external magnetic fields, respectively. The dashed lines align with those in Fig. 2, C and
D; the arrows indicate magnetic field sweeping directions. During the transitions to a TSC (N = ±1),
both s13 and s23 become close to e

2/h but almost vanish otherwise, consistent with the theoretical
prediction of the single CMEMs.

could have been connected in series by a non-
superconducting, topologically trivial Nb covered
region. To address this issue, two additional trans-
port measurements were carried out using Device
I, as explained below.
First, s12 was obtained at high magnetic fields

as shown in Fig. 4A, using the same setup as Fig.
1B. After the magnetic field eliminates the super-
conducting phase in both layers, s12 indeed reaches
~0.5 e2/h, suggesting the scenario of two QAHIs
connected in series as expected. This occurs when
the external field exceeds ~4 T, the anticipated
upper critical field of the Nb layer shown in Fig. 2A.
This behavior suggests that the Nb covered region
was indeed in a TSCN=2 phase before s12 starting
to drop back to ~0.5 e2/h. If the half-integer
plateaus below the critical field were induced by
this trivial picture, they would have persisted all
the way throughout large fields (fig. S5E). The
coexistence of these 0.5 and 1.0 e2/h plateaus in
Fig. 4A rules out this trivial picture, providing
again strong evidence that the low-field half-
integer plateaus (within ±300mT) have an origin
different from that of the high-field one (4 to 7 T)
and are likely associated with CMEMs.
Second, s13 and s23 were measured between

electrodes 1-3 and 2-3 at 20 mK, respectively,
using the setup shown in Fig. 4B. If the TSC
were a trivial normal metal, the system should
be equivalent to a QAHI that is directly contacted
with two electrodes. Thus, a typical sxx behavior
of a QAHI (Fig. 3C) should be observed—i.e.,
both s13 and s23 would exhibit two valleys at
±150 mT (C = 0) and then reach e2/h after the
magnetization saturates (C = ±1)—as shown in
fig. S5F. However, the measurements (Figs. 4, C
and D) show four peaks, instead of two valleys, in
both s13 and s23, coinciding with the half-integer
plateaus given by the measurements of s12. The
height of these peaks reaches ~0.9 e2/h, very
close to the quantized value expected from the
Andreev reflection of a single CMEM (N = ±1)
(36) (for an elaborated theoretical explanation
using the Laudauer-Büttiker transport picture,
see the supplementary text). This result also dem-

onstrates that superconductivity in the QAHI
layer was indeed induced owing to the proxim-
ity effect; otherwise, the observed peaks would
not occur, and the conductance would remain
small throughout the magnetic field scan.
The QAHI-superconductor system was real-

ized as a prototype of the chiral TSC in two
dimensions; more complex layouts could be
engineered to host the bound states of Majorana
fermions in solid state and enable their manip-
ulation. The Majorana fermion modes are pre-
dicted to be topologically protected and thus may
become a building block for robust topological
quantum computing.
