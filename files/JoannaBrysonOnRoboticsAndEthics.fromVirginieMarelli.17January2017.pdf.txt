This is definitely interesting. By looking at this AMA, it definitely seems like the problems and
concerns with AI don't exist as much as they did a couple of years ago

The big difference between hearing commentary from a practitioner of AI and someone who reports
on it is amazing. All of the folks I work with in the AI community up here in Seattle get a good
chuckle out of the pop-sci reporting about our field, especially the doom and gloom click bait.
Joanna clearly shows us that she is someone who knows what she is talking about. Keep fighting
the good fight.
