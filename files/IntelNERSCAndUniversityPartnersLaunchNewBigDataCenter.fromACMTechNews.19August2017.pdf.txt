August 17, 2017

A collaboration between the Department of

Energy’s National Energy Research Scientific

Computing Center (NERSC), Intel and five Intel

Parallel Computing Centers (IPCCs) has

resulted in a new Big Data Center (BDC) that

will work both on code modernization and tackle

real science challenges.

According to Prabhat, BDC Director and Group

Lead for NERSC Data and Analytics and

Services team, “The goal of the BDC is to solve

DOE’s leading data-intensive science problems

at scale on the NERSC Cori supercomputer

(http://www.nersc.gov/users/computational-

systems/cori/). The BDC, in collaboration with

Intel and the IPCCs, will test to see if the current

HPC systems can support data-intensive

workloads that require analysis of over 100

terabytes datasets on 100,000 cores or greater.

The BDC will optimize and scale the production

data analytics and management stack on Cori.

All BDC projects will run on the NERSC Cori

supercomputer. Courtesy of NERSC.

“Our first task will be to identify capability

applications in the DOE data science

community, articulate analytics requirements

and then develop scalable algorithms.” Prabhat

continued. “The key is in developing algorithms

in the context of the production stack. Our multi-

disciplinary team consisting of performance

optimization and scaling experts is well

positioned to enable capability applications on

Cori. All the optimizations done at the BDC will

be open source and made available to peer

HPC centers as well as the broader HPC and

data analytics communities.”

Quincey Koziol, BDC co-director and principal

data architect at NERSC, noted, “While data

analytics is undoubtedly the rage at this point in

time, scalable analytics fundamentally relies on

a robust data management infrastructure. We

will be working on examining the performance of

parallel I/O as exercised through modern data

analytics languages (Python, R, Julia) and

machine learning/deep learning libraries.”

Joseph Curley, director for Intel’s code

modernization efforts, states, “We’ve combined

the BDC goal of providing software stacks and

access to HPC machines where the data driven

methods can be developed with our IPCC

program. We married the two ideas together by

combining research members of the community

with a program that we have for outreach.

“The objective of the Big Data Center (BDC)

comes from a common desire in the industry to

have software stacks that can help the NERSC

user base, using data driven methods, to solve

their largest problems at scale on the Cori

supercomputer. So one of our main goals is to

be able to use the supercomputer hardware to

its fullest capability. Some underlying objectives

at BDC are to build and harden the data

analytics frameworks in the software stack so

that developers and data scientists can use the

Cori supercomputer in a productive way to get

insights from their data. Our work with NERSC

and the IPCCs will involve code modernization

at scale as well as creating the software

environment and software stack needed to meet

these needs.”

The five IPCCs who are part of the BDC

program include the University of California-

Berkeley, University of California-Davis, New

York University (NYU), Oxford University and the

University of Liverpool. Their initial BDC work

includes this research:

The University of California-Berkeley team is

working on the Celeste project. Celeste aims

on developing highly scalable inference

methods for extracting a unified catalog of

objects in the visible universe from all

available astronomy data.

The University of California-Davis group is

working on development of computational

mechanics techniques to extract patterns from

climate simulation data. The techniques build

upon techniques in information theory to

achieve unsupervised pattern discovery.

The New York University (NYU) team is

working on extending deep learning to operate

on irregular, graph-structured data. The

techniques are being applied to problems in

high-energy physics.

The Oxford University group is developing a

new class of methods called probabilistic

programming and applying the methods to

challenging pattern and anomaly detections in

high-energy physics. The work combines

probabilistic programming with deep learning

to train large networks on Cori.

The University of Liverpool team is working on

developing topological methods to analyze

climate datasets. The techniques are being

used to extract stable, low-dimensional

manifolds, and robust pattern descriptors for

weather patterns.

The BDC work will also benefit the larger data

analysis and HPC communities. Curley states,

“In our IPCC program, we encourage system

users to discover methods of solving problems

on HPC systems, document what they did, and

teach others how to follow their methods. This

creates a beneficial cycle of new research,

hardening the machine, developing new

software stacks leading to research that is more

productive—what we call a virtuous cycle.

“We are excited about the IPCCs working in

conjunction with the BDC because there will be

people working on problems we never could

have anticipated and advancing human

knowledge in ways we never could have

guessed. If you can combine this with the BDC

at NERSC that has a large machine like Cori

and a diverse user group, you end up creating

networks of knowledge and creating scientific

results that are unpredictably wonderful.”
