Since its first observation in the nineteenth century, the 
photovoltaic (PV) effect has been studied intensively for 
scientific interest and as a sustainable energy source to 
replace fossil fuels and reduce carbon emissions (1–3). In 
1954, the first high-power modern silicon solar cells were 
invented in which the photoexcited carriers were separated 
by a built-in electrical field developed at a p-n junction (4). 
By virtue of the appropriate bandgap energies of the 
semiconductors in a p-n junction solar cell, sunlight is 
efficiently absorbed, resulting in considerable power 
conversion efficiency. Nowadays, silicon PV cells are the 
mainstay of the modern solar industry, contributing more 
than 1% of global electricity supply. Nevertheless, PV cells 
based on p-n junctions have a photovoltage limited by the 
bandgap energy of the constituent semiconductors and an 
ultimate efficiency constrained by the Shockley-Queisser (S-
Q) limit (5). 

The ferroelectric materials exhibit a photovoltaic effect 
distinct from that of p-n junctions, called the bulk photovol-
taic (BPV) effect (6, 7). Under uniform illumination, a homo-
geneous ferroelectric material gives rise to a current under 
zero bias (short-circuit current; ISC) that depends on the po-
larization state of the incident light and produces an anoma-
lously large photovoltage well exceeding its bandgap energy. 
This peculiar PV effect originates from the asymmetric distri-
bution of photoexcited nonequilibrium carriers in k-space 
caused by the absence of centrosymmetry in the material (7). 
Owing to its distinctive charge separation mechanism, solar 
cells based on the BPV effect can in principle exceed the S-Q 
limit (8). However, a substantial BPV effect is generally found 
in wide-bandgap noncentrosymmetric materials, such as fer-
roelectric BaTiO3 (8) and BiFeO3 (9), leading to an overall ex-
tremely low device efficiency under solar illumination. 

Hence, one way to enhance the efficiency may be to realize 
the BPV effect in semiconductors with more favorable 
bandgaps, regardless of their crystalline symmetry. 

Flexoelectricity is an electromechanical property that re-
flects a coupling between an electric polarization and a strain 
gradient (10, 11). In centrosymmetric materials, a strain gra-
dient breaks its inversion symmetry, resulting in a polariza-
tion with a preferred direction and enabling a piezoelectric 
composite containing no piezoelectric elements (11, 12). Like-
wise, one can hypothesize that a strain gradient allows the 
manifestation of the BPV effect in materials that are origi-
nally centrosymmetric. Here, we propose and demonstrate 
that the BPV effect can be induced in any semiconductor by 
mediation of the flexoelectric effect. Given that flexoelectric-
ity is a universal property of all materials, ranging from bio-
materials (13) to semiconductors and dielectrics (14) to 2D 
materials such as graphene (15), this strain-gradient-induced 
BPV effect, termed here the flexo-photovoltaic (FPV) effect, is 
allowed for all symmetry classes. Thus, the devices based on 
the FPV effect can be fabricated with silicon or any other sem-
iconductors. 

To demonstrate our idea, we explored the PV effect in-
duced by a point force exerted onto the surface of centrosym-
metric materials including a SrTiO3 single crystal and a rutile 
TiO2 single crystal (see section S1 of (16)). The point force was 
exerted by the tip of an atomic force microscope (AFM), in-
ducing local inhomogeneous strain at the tip/surface contact 
area and, therefore, a local breaking of centrosymmetry (17, 
18). In our experiments, we used a custom-made photoelec-
tric atomic force microscope (Ph-AFM) consisting of an AFM-
based system equipped with a customized current ampli-
fier/filter system and an optical system (19). The optical sys-
tem allows us to illuminate a sample surface with a 405-nm

It is highly desirable to discover photovoltaic mechanisms that enable a higher efficiency of solar cells. 
Here, we report that the bulk photovoltaic effect, which is free from the thermodynamic Shockley-
Queisser limit but usually manifested only in noncentrosymmetric (piezoelectric or ferroelectric) 
materials, can be realized in any semiconductor, including silicon, by mediation of flexoelectric effect. We 
introduce strain gradients using either an atomic force microscope or a micron-scale indentation system, 
creating giant photovoltaic currents from centrosymmetric single crystals of SrTiO3, TiO2, and Si. This 
strain-gradient-induced bulk photovoltaic effect, which we call the flexo-photovoltaic effect, functions in 
the absence of a p-n junction. This finding may extend present solar cell technologies by boosting the 
solar energy conversion efficiency from a wide pool of established semiconductors.

laser properly polarized by a half-wavelength plate. A conduc-
tive AFM tip applies a local force on a sample surface and 
simultaneously collects the resultant PV current. A brief sche-
matic of the Ph-AFM setup is shown in Fig. 1, A and B. 

SrTiO3 single crystal is one of the ideal systems to study 
the flexoelectric effect thanks to its simple cubic centrosym-
metric lattice and large dielectric permittivity (14, 20). Unlike 
its sister material BaTiO3, ordinary SrTiO3 crystals do not ex-
hibit the BPV effect because they have a center of inversion 
symmetry. But, with illumination around the contact area on 
a (001)-face of SrTiO3 crystal, we observed that ISC exhibits a 
large transient peak as the loading force is increased from 1 
μN to 18 μN (Fig. 1C), which is reproducible, proven by re-
peated exertion/withdrawal of the loading force. 

To show that the giant enhancement of ISC by the point 
force is not confined to SrTiO3 crystals or a cubic structure, 
we investigated the force-induced PV current in a single crys-
tal of rutile TiO2, which is well-known for its photoelectric 
applications such as dye-sensitized photovoltaic cells and 
photocatalysis. As in the case of SrTiO3, large negative ISC ap-
pears once a large force is exerted on a TiO2 (100) face. Figure 
1D shows a stable current under the 15 μN force, confirming 
that the force-induced PV effect is not a transient effect in 
this material. Although it depends on contact conditions and 
locations, the point force exerted by the AFM tip gives rise to 
a substantial current density up to about 1 A/cm2 at the na-
noscale contact area. This is over three orders of magnitude 
higher than ISC (0.3 mA/cm2) obtained from a Schottky junc-
tion between TiO2 and Pt under the same illumination condi-
tion (see section S6 of (16)). 

The current density increases more than 100 times by 
simply increasing the loading force from 1 to 15 μN (Fig. 1E). 
This cannot be explained with an increase of the contact area 
with the loading force because a contact area increases at 
most ~6 times with a 15 times larger contact force in a simple 
elastic sphere contact model (see section S2 of (16)). Moreo-
ver, a 100 times increase of the contact area with an AFM tip 
is unphysical. It should be note that ISC turns to a positive 
value when loading the conductive AFM tip on a (001)-face of 
the TiO2 crystal in contrast to the negative value of ISC on its 
(100)-face (Fig. 1F). The fact that the direction of the PV cur-
rent depends on the crystallographic orientation of the TiO2 
crystal indicates that the observed PV effect cannot be merely 
attributed to a probable Schottky contact formed by the TiO2 
surface and the Pt-coating of the AFM tip. 

A potential origin of this PV current enhancement is the 
BPV effect. As hypothesized, it is likely that a point force ex-
erted on a crystal surface generates a local strain gradient, 
resulting in local centrosymmetry breaking and, thus, a local 
BPV current under illumination, i.e., the FPV effect, in the 
absence of a p-n junction and an appropriate band alignment. 
Given that both the flexoelectric response and the BPV effect 

depend on the crystallographic orientation (19–21), our re-
sults suggest a predominant role of the strain gradient and 
the resultant FPV effect in the enhanced local PV current. 

The strain gradient induced by a sphere contact has a 
complex spatial distribution with giant strain gradient values 
in an elastic material, as described in section S2 of (16). An 
AFM tip apex can be approximated as a hemisphere and the 
distribution of strain gradient induced by the AFM tip can be 
calculated analytically with the Hertzian model and the Bous-
sinesq’s calculation (22). Figure 2 shows the spatial distribu-
tions of the z-component of the calculated strain and its 
derivative with respect to z under ~15.7 μN force with a 10-
nm-radius contact area at the origin. The strain gradient is as 
large as 107 m−1. Interestingly, we found that the ISC density 
and the volume beneath the AFM tip being subject to a strain 
gradient larger than 1 × 106 m−1 show similar dependence on 
the exerted force (Fig. 1E); the detailed process to obtain the 
relative volume can be found in fig. S9 of (16)). It is expected 
that the giant strain gradients induced by the AFM tip break 
local symmetry, leading to the manifestation of the BPV effect 
locally under illumination. However, a relationship between 
the complex distribution of the strain gradient and the BPV 
properties should be quite intricate and deep theoretical con-
siderations are required. 

The main characteristic of the BPV effect is a periodic de-
pendence on the angle between the PV current and the light 
polarization, stemming from its tensorial nature (21). For the 
present case, this dependence is predicted to be 

 ( )0 22FPV z zI I A B cos
π α= +   (1) 

Where IFPV is the PV current, I0 is a light intensity, AZ and 
BZ are effective BPV coefficients of the locally deformed crys-
tal, and α is the polarization angle of the incident light with 
respect to the top surface edge as described in section S3 of 
(16). The FPV effect should inherit the distinctive feature of 
the BPV effect and exhibit a sinusoidal dependence on the 
incident light polarization angle with a period of 180°. In-
deed, ISC measured by a conductive AFM tip in the configura-
tion illustrated in Fig. 1B on the SrTiO3 (010) and TiO2 (001) 
surfaces exhibits a light polarization dependence in accord 
with Eq. 1, as seen in Fig. 3. The sinusoidal behavior upon 
rotating the light polarization provides strong evidence that 
the underlying mechanism of the force-induced PV effect is 
the BPV effect generated by local symmetry breaking due to 
inhomogeneous strain, namely the FPV effect. 

The FPV effect should be neither confined to ionic crystals 
nor restricted to nanoscale geometries. First, we performed 
the same experiment (as in Fig. 1) on an HF-passivated sur-
face of a commercial p-type Si (001) crystal. Similarly, ISC in-
creased two orders of magnitude from ~5 pA with the 1 μN 
loading force to ~0.5 nA with the 15 μN loading force (Fig. 4A 
and section S7 of (16)). Secondly, the FPV effect could also be

demonstrated using a home-built indentation system that de-
forms a semiconductor using a conductive tungsten probe 
needle with a radius of about 10 μm (fig. S1 of (16)). Figure 
4B shows crystallographic orientation dependent photocur-
rent-voltage (I-V) characteristics of the SrTiO3 crystal ac-
quired under 4 N mechanical force exerted by the probe 
needle and 405 nm laser illumination directly to the probe 
contact area as in Fig. 1A. These linear I-V characteristics are 
similar to those of ferroelectrics under illumination (23). The 
oscillating PV current with the rotating light polarization, 
which is well fitted with Eq. 1 (Fig. 4C), demonstrates the FPV 
effect under the indentation force in the micrometer scale. 
The crystallographic orientation dependent PV current is also 
observed on the TiO2 crystal by the indentation system (fig. 
S2 of (16)). The persistence of the FPV effect from the na-
noscale (AFM) to the micrometer level is promising for future 
device design and potential applications. The FPV effect is 
not related to a plasmonic effect found in the tip-enhanced 
Raman scattering because only an atomically sharp tip 
coated with Ag or Au shows the plasmonic enhancement in 
the visible range (24), whereas we used platinum or tungsten 
probes ranging from the nanoscale to the micrometer scale. 
Likewise, a potential cubic-to-tetragonal phase transition in-
duced in a SrTiO3 single crystal under a large hydrostatic 
pressure (>6 GPa) should not play a large role here because 
of the centrosymmetric nature of the induced tetragonal 
phase (25). 

We emphasize here four main features of the FPV effect. 
First, the separation of the photoexcited carriers in the FPV 
effect is controlled by the local symmetry and the resultant 
local BPV effect, in which the power conversion efficiency can 
in principle exceed the S-Q limit (8). Second, to obtain a high 
photocurrent from any semiconductor, only a strain gradient 
generator, such as a sharp probe with a sufficient loading 
force is necessary. This should be distinguished from the pre-
vious reports that a strain gradient modifies a bandgap, but 
the charge separation in the photoelectric process still re-
quires a proper band alignment (26) or a nanostructure (27, 
28). Third, whereas the BPV effect is allowed only in non-cen-
trosymmetric materials, the FPV effect is universal. It is al-
lowed by symmetry in all materials thanks to the universal 
nature of the strain-gradient-induced centrosymmetry break-
ing. The FPV effect can be realized not only in ionic crystals 
(SrTiO3 and TiO2) and covalent crystals (Si), but is also rele-
vant to any semiconductors ranging from organic-inorganic 
hybrid perovskites to semiconducting polymers and even top-
ological insulators. For instance, the topological insulator 
Bi2Te3 with a centrosymmetric structure exhibits the BPV ef-
fect by means of the flexoelectric effect (29). Finally, given 
that the BPV effect consists of asymmetric quantum mechan-
ical processes such as photoexcitation, relaxation, recombina-
tion, and scattering, we demonstrate that one can readily 

control the quantum mechanical processes by macroscopic 
tool such as an AFM tip and a probe needle. 

The configuration of our photovoltaic indentation system 
is very simple and the FPV effect can be increasingly signifi-
cant with material dimensions decreasing into the nanoscale 
where flexoelectricity is more important (11). Thus, an im-
portant strain engineering route for improving the final per-
formance of solar cells and optoelectronic devices is now 
open. For example, a tandem solar cell can be easily fabri-
cated by combining an array of indenters and a conventional 
p-n junction, enabling a higher efficiency because the FPV ef-
fect can be designed to add to the existing PV current gener-
ated by the buried p-n junction. Given that the lattice 
mismatch at the interfaces and crystallographic disorders in 
epitaxial and polycrystalline thin film solar cells give rise to 
substantial strain gradients (30–32), the associated FPV effect 
would dramatically impact the performance of these solar 
cells, which however remains largely unexplored. In addition 
to inorganic solar cells, the FPV effect is also likely to play an 
important role in flexible and stretchable electronics based 
on organic and polymeric semiconductors. Not only the bend-
ing of flexible organic devices at a macroscopic level (33) but 
also the folding and entanglement of the polymeric chains in 
a nanoscale level would generate sizable strain gradients (34), 
which redistribute the electron cloud of π-molecular orbits, 
modifying the electronic transport and inducing the FPV ef-
fect under illumination (15, 35). The detailed effects of strain 
gradient and FPV effect on the nanoscale electronic proper-
ties remain an open question.

Fig. 1. Force-induced photovoltaic effect in centrosymmetric SrTiO3 and 
TiO2 single crystals. (A) Setup for illumination around the contact area. The 
tip loading force is controlled by the feedback loop of atomic force 
microscope. (B) Setup for illumination on the side surface. The sidewise 
illumination geometry has been chosen to avoid the effect of Fresnel 
reflection and have light absorption being independent of the light 
polarization. Evolution of the photocurrent induced and collected by a 
conductive AFM tip with a high loading force on (C) SrTiO3 (001) face and 
(D) TiO2 (100) face. (E) The loading force dependence of the induced 
photocurrent density and the relative volume subject to the strain gradient 
higher than 1 × 106 m−1 (see fig. S9 of (16)). (F) Positive photocurrent 
measured on TiO2 (001) face with a 15 μN force applied by the AFM tip.

Fig. 2. Spatial distributions of strain and strain gradient 
induced by an ideal spherical indenter. (A) The z-component of 
strain and (B) its partial derivative with respect to z. The contact 
area with a radius of 10 nm is centered at the origin, and the force 
is pointing upward. The positive (negative) value of the strain 
means a tensile (compressive) strain along the z-axis.  
 

Fig. 3. Light polarization dependence of the force-induced 
photocurrent. The sinusoidal dependence of the photocurrent 
measured on (A) SrTiO3 (010) face and (B) TiO2 (001) face under 
405 nm laser illumination. The red lines are the fits to Eq. 1.

Fig. 4. Flexo-photovoltaic effect extended to covalent crystal and to the 
micrometer scale. (A) Force-induced photocurrent on (001) Si crystal measured by 
Ph-AFM under illumination of the top intended surface. (B) Current-voltage 
characteristics measured on (001) and (111) faces of a SrTiO3 crystal by the micro-
indenter applying a 4 N force and illumination of the top intended surface. (C) The 
light polarization dependence of the photocurrent on a SrTiO3 (010) face measured 
by the micro-indenter under illumination on the side surface. The red line is the fitting 
of experimental data with Eq. 1. Because the polarization angle origin of the micro-
indenter is not coincident with the Ph-AFM setup, the oscillating ISC has a phase shift 
compared with Fig. 3B.
