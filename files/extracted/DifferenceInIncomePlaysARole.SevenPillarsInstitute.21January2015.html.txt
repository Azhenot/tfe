The first in SPI’s series on Inequality

 

By: May Leung



Difference in income plays a role

One important factor contributing to different levels of wealth is 
people are paid different wages. There are several reasons why some 
people are paid millions while some merely earn minimum wage.

(i) Wages are determined by labor market

Wages are a function of the market price of skills required for a job
 [1]. In a free market, the “market price of a skill” is determined by 
market demand and market supply. The market price of a skill, and hence 
the wage for the job that requires the skill, is low if a large number 
of workers (high supply) are willing and able to offer that skill but 
only a few employers need it (low demand). On the contrary, when there 
is low supply but high demand for a skill, the wage for a job requiring 
the skill goes up.

(ii) Education affects wages

Individuals with different levels of education often earn different 
wages [2]. This is probably related to reason one: the level of 
education is often proportional to the level of skill. With a higher 
level of education, a person often has more advanced skills that few 
workers are able to offer, justifying a higher wage.

The impact of education on economic inequality is still profound in 
developed countries and cities [3]. Although there are usually policies 
of free education in developed nations, levels of education received by 
each individual still differ, not because of financial ability but 
innate qualities like intelligence, drive and personal ability. For 
example, in Hong Kong, 12 years of free education are provided for each 
citizen, not covering tertiary education, offered only when students 
receive certain results on public exams.

Moreover, receiving the same level of education does not mean 
receiving education of the same quality. This accounts for the 
difference in abilities and hence wages for individuals all receiving, 
for example, 12 years of education. Therefore, it seems no matter how 
good the social welfare policy of a country is at preventing denial of 
education due to financial difficulties, differences in education, in 
terms of levels and quality, still play a prominent role in economic 
inequality.

(iii) Growth in technology widens income gap

Growth in technology arguably renders joblessness at all skill levels
 [3]. For unskilled workers, computers and machinery perform a lot of 
tasks these workers used to be do. In many jobs, such as packaging and 
manufacturing, machinery works even more effectively and efficiently. 
Hence, jobs involving repetitive tasks have largely been eliminated. 
Skilled workers are not immune to the nightmare of losing jobs. The 
rapid development in artificial intelligence may ultimately allow 
computers and robots to perform knowledge-based jobs [3].

The impact of increasing unemployment is stagnant or decreasing wages
 for most workers, as there is a low demand for but high supply of 
labor. A small portion of society, usually the owners of capital, 
controls an ever-increasing fraction of the economy [3]. The income gap 
between workers who earn by their skills and owners who earn by 
investing in capital has widened.

Although both skilled and unskilled workers are adversely affected by
 the technological advance, it seems unskilled workers are subject to 
worse outcomes [3]. This is because the labor market may still need 
skilled workers to use computers and operate the advanced machines. The 
rightward shift in the demand for skilled labor creates an increase in 
the relative wages of the skilled compared to the unskilled workers. 
Hence, the income gap among workers also has widened.

(iv) Gender does matter

In many countries, there is a gender income gap in the labor market 
[3]. For example, in America, the median full-time salary for women is 
77 percent of that of men [4]. However, women who work part time make 
more on average than men who work part-time [4]. Additionally, among 
people who never marry or have children, women make more than men [4].

It may be difficult to justify such differences. According to a U.S. 
Census report [4], the wage gap is not fully explained even after 
accounting for key factors that affect earnings, such as discrimination 
and the tendency of women to consider factors other than pay when 
looking for work. The only thing we know for sure is that gender does 
contribute to a difference in wages in society and hence economic 
inequality.

(v) Personal factors

It is generally believed that innate abilities play a part in 
determining the wealth of an individual. Hence, individuals possessing 
different sets of abilities may have different levels of wealth, leading
 to economic inequality [3]. For example, more determined individuals 
may keep improving themselves and striving for better achievements, 
which justifies a higher wage.

Another example is intelligence [3]. A lot of people believe that 
smarter people tend to have higher income and hence more wealth. This is
 debatable. In the book IQ and the Wealth of Nations, Dr. 
Richard Lynn opined that there is a correlation of 0.82 between average 
IQ and GDP. However, Stephen Jay Gould, in the book The Mismeasure of Man, criticized it for employing the wrong methods of evaluation.

In addition to innate abilities, diversity of preferences, within a 
society or among different societies, contributes to the difference in 
wealth [3]. When it comes to working harder or having fun, equally 
capable individuals may have totally different priorities, resulting in a
 difference in their incomes. Their saving patterns may also differ, 
leading to different levels of accumulated wealth.

Inequality is a vicious cycle

“The rich get richer, the poor get poorer” is not just a cliche. The 
concept behind it is a theoretical process called “wealth 
concentration.” Under certain conditions, newly created wealth is 
concentrated in the possession of already-wealthy individuals [5]. The 
reason is simple: People who already hold wealth have the resources to 
invest or to leverage the accumulation of wealth, which creates new 
wealth. The process of wealth concentration arguably makes economic 
inequality a vicious cycle.

The effects of wealth concentration may extend to future generations 
[3]. Children born in a rich family have an economic advantage, because 
of wealth inherited and possibly education, which may increase their 
chances of earning a higher income than their peers. These advantages 
create another round of the vicious cycle.

The French economist Thomas Picketty recently published a book, Capital in the Twenty-First Century
 [6]. Picketty’s thesis supports the previous proposition. It is a 
700-page book on the topic of income inequality. The rich collection of 
statistics in the book shows that in almost every country (examined by 
Picketty), the wealth gap has widened since 1980. Picketty holds the 
view that inequality will remain as long as the aforementioned wealth 
concentration process persists through generations. However, Picketty 
argued that global inequality has probably decreased, as there has been 
rapid growth in Asia partly at the expense of lower-to-middle income 
earners in developed countries. The statistics show economic inequality 
is not just the top 10 percent of the population is richer than the 
bottom 20 percent. Rather, it is “1 percent versus the remaining 99 
percent,” i.e. the top 1 percent of the population has the vast majority
 of wealth in the economy and control of financial markets.

 



Chart 1

 

There is both support and criticism for Picketty’s argument 
inequality has been a persistent phenomenon. World Bank researchers 
Christoph Lakner and Milanovic Branko agree that inequality in rich 
countries has been worsening significantly since 1988 [7]. In Oxfam’s 
Working Paper [8], statistics show that in 24 of 26 countries 
researched, indeed the richest 1 percent increased their share of income
 between 1980 and 2012 (see Chart 1). The share of national wealth owned
 by the wealthiest 1 percent in the U.S. greatly increased after 2008 
(see Chart 2), meaning the top 1 percent has captured 95 percent of 
post-financial crisis growth since 2009, whereas the low-income 
population became poorer. These statistics further support the 
proposition in Picketty’s book that inequality is persistent and is 
getting worse.

 

 



Chart 2

 

Critics of Picketty’s book, such as Michael Hudson, a 
distinguished research professor of economics at the University of 
Missouri, mainly focus on the solutions proposed by Picketty [9]. Hudson
 even supplemented Picketty’s theory in an interview by saying that 
another reason for the persistence of economic inequality is the top 1 
percent exploiting the remaining population and making the latter “in 
debt” to the former.

It should be noted, however, some sociologists, such as Charles 
Murray, disagree with the proposition that wealth accumulation is a main
 cause of economic inequality. They argue factors like innate ability 
instead of a better starting point are the most important determining 
factors in the wealth accumulated by a person.

From a broader perspective: Economic policies and structure

(i) Economic neoliberalism

Economic neoliberalism is defined as a form of economic liberalism 
that supports “free market and minimum barriers to the flow of goods, 
services and capital” [10]. There are four pillars to this approach, 
namely capital account liberalization, trade liberalization, domestic 
liberalization, and privatization [10]. The economy is liberalized in 
different ways. Countries like the U.S. adopt economic policies 
promoting neoliberalism (called the “Anglo-American model”) [11].

Advocates of neoliberalism often argue their ideology is helpful in 
reducing absolute inequality [12]. Some opine neoliberalism itself does 
not directly generate inequality. Rather, it promotes a free system, 
which aims to foster economic prosperity. It is the operation of 
neoliberalism, not the theory itself, which contributes to inequality 
[13]. Yet, numerous scholars argue that economic neoliberalism is itself
 a cause of inequality. While it may somehow reduce absolute inequality,
 it increases relative inequality [12]. According to the economists 
Howell and Diallo (2007), neoliberal policies in the U.S. led to low 
wages (30 percent of the working-age population) and inadequate 
employment (60 percent of the working-age population) [14]. The wealth 
discrepancy between the rich and the poor, usually the working class, 
hence widens.

John Schmitt and Ben Zipperer (2006) of the CEPR hold similar views. 
They claim that economic liberalism, where reduction of business 
regulations and decline of union membership are inevitable, is a cause 
of economic inequality [15]. In their analysis of the effects of 
Anglo-American neoliberal policies, their conclusion is that “the U.S. 
economic and social model is associated with substantial levels of 
social exclusion, including high levels of income inequality. At the 
same time, the available evidence provides little support for the view 
that U.S.-style labor-market flexibility dramatically improves 
labor-market outcomes” [15]. So it seems that economic neoliberalism is 
worsening rather than improving the problem of income inequality.

(ii) Globalization

The great umbrella of globalization, a product of trade 
liberalization, now covers every corner in the world. The extent of its 
effects on economic inequality is debatable. Trade economist Paul 
Krugman supports the proposition that globalization is an important 
cause of inequality. Because of increasing trade among countries, 
workers in richer countries face a higher level of competition from 
those in poorer countries, especially in jobs that do not require a high
 level of skill. Wages for low-skilled work in richer countries are 
decline as a result.

Other experts think the effects of globalization on inequality are 
minor when compared to other causes. For example, Lawrence Katz 
estimates globalization accounts only for 5 to 15 percent of rising 
inequality. Robert Lawrence, an economist, disputes any such 
relationship. Instead, technological innovation causes low-skilled jobs 
to be replaced by machinery in wealthy nations. Rich nations no longer 
have significant numbers of low-skilled workers that can be affected by 
competition from poor nations.

(iii) A Kuznets curve – Phases of development

Nobel laureate economist Simon Kuznets argues that as an economy 
develops, a natural cycle of economic inequality occurs, represented by 
an inverted U-shape curve called the Kuznets curve (see Fig. 1). From 
the curve, we observe as the economy develops, inequality first 
increases, then decreases after a certain level of average income is 
attained. In early development, investment opportunities for those who 
already have wealth multiply so owners of capital can accumulate wealth.
 At the same time, there is an influx of cheap rural labor to the 
developing cities, which drives down wages. Therefore, in early 
development, inequality increases.

 



Figure 1: Kuznets Curve

 

When the economy becomes mature, there is democratization and various
 redistribution mechanisms such as social welfare programs. According to
 Kuznets, countries move back to a lower level of inequality.

As with any theory, there are criticisms. First, the data set used is
 said to be prejudiced. Many of the middle-income countries used in 
Kuznets’ data set are in Latin America, a region with a historically 
high level of inequality. According to Deininger and Squire (1998), the 
shape of Kuznets curve tends to disappear after this variable is 
controlled. Moreover, Kuznets demonstrates his theory by using 
cross-sectional data. But through using data from large panels of 
countries, Fields (2001) demonstrates that hypothesis put forward by 
Kuznets is flawed.

The second criticism is the East Asian miracle (EAM). Basically, EAM 
describes the rapid economic growth between 1965 and 1990 of eight East 
Asian countries – South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore (also known 
as Four Asian Tigers), Japan, Indonesia, Thailand, and Malaysia. EAM 
deviates from the Kuznets curve in the sense that the early development 
economy, particularly manufacturing and exports, grew powerfully, while 
the population living in absolute poverty decreased, i.e. inequality 
“surprisingly” decreased.

Many studies have been conducted to identify reasons why the EAM 
successfully distributes the benefits of rapid economic growth broadly 
among the population, preventing an initial increase in inequality. 
Joseph Stiglitz proposed EAM occurred through the immediate reinvestment
 of initial benefits into land reform increasing the rural productivity 
and income, as well as universal education and government policies such 
as increasing wages and limiting price increase in commodities. Hence, 
there was no significant initial increase in inequality. Average 
citizens could then have more financial ability to consume and invest in
 the economy, furthering economic growth. Simply put, what Stiglitz 
suggests is high economic growth provides resources to promote equality,
 which then provides positive feedback for growth. This is contrary to 
the Kuznets curve theory, which insists that economic growth inevitably 
creates inequality, which then promotes overall growth.

Inequality is not doomed to happen when a country starts developing. 
If there are sufficient government policies and economic planning, a 
high growth rate can coexist with low economic inequality at any stage 
of development.

A free-market society without statutory protection on wages may have 
unfairly low wages for certain types of work, usually those involving 
repetitive tasks and low skills, which widens the wealth gap. Likewise, 
economic neoliberalism, which promotes minimum trade barriers, may also 
lead to labor exploitation in the form of unfairly low wages. Looking at
 EAM in a reverse way, if there had not been policies and regulations to
 distribute the benefits of rapid economic growth broadly among the 
population, those eight countries might have had totally different fates
 – economic inequality would have increased in their early stages of 
development.

	One Response to “The Causes of Economic Inequality”

		  Hi Angela,

Thanks for putting out an interesting article about economic inequality.
 I just wanted to highlight the fact (often misinterpreted) is that 
Kuznet’s curve is NOT predictive but DESCRIPTIVE of a certain phase in 
history. Kuznet went on to lament its use as a tool to predict (and 
often excuse) inequality as countries developed.

I just thought I’d shrae this with you.

Thanks
