Imaging around corners with single-pixel detector by

computational ghost imaging

Bin Bai, Jianbin Liu, Yu Zhou,∗ Songlin Zhang, Yuchen He, and Zhuo Xu

Abstract

We have designed a single-pixel camera with imaging around corners based on computational

ghost imaging. It can obtain the image of an object when the camera cannot look at the object

directly. Our imaging system explores the fact that a bucket detector in a ghost imaging setup

has no spatial resolution capability. A series of experiments have been designed to confirm our

predictions. This camera has potential applications for imaging around corner or other similar

environments where the object cannot be observed directly.

I. INTRODUCTION

Ghost imaging (GI) was first realized by Pittman et.al. in 1995 by employing entangled

photon pairs generated from spontaneous parametric down conversion [1]. At the beginning

of the 21st century, it was realized that GI could also be performed with classical light

[2–10]. In this system, a thermal light beam is split into two beams by a beam splitter.

One beam is projected onto an object. The light reflected from or passing through the

object is collected by a bucket detector with no spatial resolution. The other beam is sent

to a detector with spatial resolution. Finally the image is reconstructed by correlating the

signals from these two detectors. The possible applications of GI in military and civilian have

been studied by many groups, such as high-order correlation ghost imaging [11, 12], lensless

ghost imaging [13–18], ghosting imaging through turbulence [19–22]. Nevertheless, a charged

coupled device (CCD) is needed to measure the intensity fluctuations in a typical thermal

light GI, because the intensity fluctuations with spatial resolution of a typical thermal light

can not be predicted. Meanwhile, a beam splitter is also needed. These factors limited the

development of the practical application of GI system in daily life.

Computational ghost imaging (CGI) was proposed in 2008 by Shapiro [23]. The intensity

fluctuations of light in CGI are artificially modulated. The random, yet known, speckle

patterns are projected onto an unknown object. The spatial information of detector signals

is not needed, therefore a photodiode (PD) can be used to replace a CCD [24]. The need for

the beam splitter and camera is removed in CGI, which helps GI system become simpler and

more applicable. The practical applications of CGI are developed by more and more groups

[25–34]. The speed and quality of imaging have both been improved, such as the real-time

video with the single-pixel detectors [31] and the improvement of the signal-to-noise ratio

for different systems [32, 33]. Moreover, some features of CGI which the traditional camera

does not have have been also proposed and realized, such as 3D imaging of CGI [34], imaging

of CGI through turbulence and against scattering [26, 35]. They make CGI more significant

in real life.

In this paper, we studied a feature of CGI that imaging an object without looking at

it directly, which can be thought as a single-pixel camera with imaging around corners.

This camera is based on the technique of single-pixel detector with CGI system. Traditional

camera cannot obtain the image when it dose not see the object directly. However, the single-

2



pixel camera with imaging around corners can get the image under the same condition. Other

group also has achieved imaging with similar ability [36]. Their experiment is based on the

speckle autocorrelation and phase-retrieval algorithm. The scattering media is needed as

lens. We use a different approach to achieve the same idea and only a single-pixel detector

is needed.

The article is organized as follows. In Sec.II, we report the experimental results of CGI

and imaging around corners with the single-pixel detector, respectively. The discussions

about the physics of the single-pixel camera with imaging around corners are in Sec.III.

Section IV summaries our conclusions.

II. EXPERIMENT

In this article, a series of experiments are designed to study the single-pixel camera with

imaging around corners. The first experiment is shown in Fig. 1 (a), which is the basic

scheme of CGI with a single-pixel detector. The light source is a projector (BenQ MW526).

Speckle patterns, controlled by computer, are projected onto an object. The object is a

transparent pattern “XJTU” and the size of each letter is 0.2 cm∗0.3 cm. The distance

between the projector and object is 30 cm. The transmitted light through the object is

received by a single-pixel detector (Thorlabs DET36A/M). The function of the detector is

to obtain the intensity of light in one position. Figure 2(a) shows the image of the object in

the common CGI.

To test CGI against scattering, a ground glass is placed between the object and the

detector as shown in Fig. 1 (b). Light through the scattering media will be scattered in

all directions. Figure 2(b) shows the image of XJTU under this condition. The signal-

to-noise ratio (SNR) of Fig. 2(a) and 2(b) are 18.02 dB and 17.92 dB, respectively. The

results indicate that the quality of the image is nearly the same as that of the image in CGI

without scattering media. SNR is defined as SNR = s̄(2)/σn, where s̄ is average of the signal

intensity, and σn is the variance of the background intensity [27]. The difference between

the average intensity of the bright and dark regions of images is regarded as the signal, and

the variation of dark background is considered as the noise.

Based on the above results, this imaging technology is exploited as a single-pixel camera

with imaging around corners. The characteristic of CGI against scattering is employed.

FIG. 1. Experimental setup of CGI. (a) is the basic scheme of CGI. A projector is controlled by

computer which projects a series of speckle patterns onto an object. The object is transparent

letters “XJTU”. The transmitted light is received by a single-pixel detector. (b) is the scheme of

CGI with scattering media. A ground glass is placed between the object and the detector. The

light transmitted through the object will be disturbed by this media.

scattering media. (b) is the image in CGI with scattering media. Two results are both calculated

by 18,000 random patterns.

Figure 3(a) shows the experimental scheme of the single-pixel camera with imaging around

corners. The same object “XJTU” is used. Speckle patterns are controlled as 40∗40 matrices

of black and white squares by computer. And the ratio of white and black squares is 0.11

in the patterns. The changing speckle patterns are projected onto the object. The distance

FIG. 3. The scheme of single-pixel camera with imaging around corners. (a) is the basic scheme.

The transparent letters “XJTU” are imaged. A light tight baffle between the object and the single-

pixel detector is used for preventing the detector obtaining the light from the object directly. (b)

is the scheme with scattering media. (c) is the scheme of imaging a three-dimensional object with

rough surface. This diffuse object is a common toy for children (a plane model).

between the projector and object is 30 cm. The transmitted light through the letters is

reflected by the rough white wall. The distance between the object and the wall is 15 cm.

The single-pixel detector, which is 12 cm away from the wall, collects the reflected light. A

light tight baffle is inserted between the object and the single-pixel detector to avoid the

detector receiving the signal from the object directly. The result is shown in Fig. 4(a),

where the letters are imaged clearly. To study the ability of this camera against scattering,

a rotating ground glass (5 cm behind the object) is placed between the object and the

detector. The rotating speed of the ground glass is 1,200 cycles/min. The result is shown

in Fig. 4(b). The SNR of the image in Fig. 4(a) and Fig. 4(b) are 17.34 dB and 17.51 dB,

5



respectively. They indicate that imaging around corners with the single-pixel detector can

image clearly whether there is the scattering media or not. Especially, we use white paper as

the distraction. Two pieces of paper are placed at the different locations behind the object.

One is 120 mm behind the object and the other is 10 mm in front of the detector. The result

is shown in Fig. 4(c) and the SNR is 18.58 dB.

FIG. 4. The image of the letters “XJTU” by the single-pixel camera with imaging around corners.

(a) is the result of letters “XJTU” without scattering media. (b) is the image through a rotating

ground glass. (c) shows the result when the ground glass is replaced by the white paper. Two

pieces of paper are placed at two different locations. The thickness of paper is 0.05 mm.

Figure 3(c) shows the scheme of imaging the diffuse object by the single-pixel camera

with imaging around corners. A three-dimensional object with rough surface is used as

the imaging target. The inset in Fig. 5(a) is this diffuse object (a common toy plane for

children). The size of object is 55 mm∗32 mm. Speckle patterns are irradiated on this

diffuse object. The intensity of light reflected from the object and the wall is very weak.

In addition, the environment light is significantly strong. Under the circumstances, the

detector will receive more light from environment than from the object. Traditional camera

generally gets a picture with the misty light. The light becomes disordered and the image is

blurred because of the reflection on the diffuse object and the wall. However, the single-pixel

camera with imaging around corners can image the object under the same condition. The

result of imaging by the camera with imaging around corners is shown in Fig. 5(a), where

the toy is imaged clearly. The SNR of the image in Fig. 5(a) is 23 dB. The diffuse object

is more difficult to be imaged than the simple transmission object, therefore the number

of speckle patterns is increased to 50,000 to get a clear image. In addition, the resolution

can be controlled by the computer. When the size of speckle patterns becomes smaller, the

resolution of the image becomes higher. Fig. 5(b) is the result when the resolution increases

to 4 times better than (a). All the details of the object in Fig. 5(b) become more obvious.

The SNR of the image becomes 20 dB. All results show that the single-pixel camera with

6



imaging around corners can image the diffuse object when the camera cannot look at object

directly.

FIG. 5. The image and object in the experiment of imaging around corners with the single-pixel

detector. The inset picture in (a) is the diffuse object (a common toy for children). (a) and (b)

show the result of image. The number of patterns which is used to image in two pictures are both

50,000. The resolution ratio of (b) is 4 times better than (a).

III. THEORY AND DISCUSSION

The image of the object in CGI is obtained via calculating the second-order correlation,

g(2)(x, y) =
〈Icom(x, y)Idet〉

〈Icom(x, y)〉 〈Idet〉
, (1)

where 〈〉 means ensemble average. Icom(x, y) is the intensity distribution of speckle patterns

which are controlled by computer. Idet is the intensity detected by the single-pixel detector.

Idet =

∫∫
Iobj(x

′, y′)T (x′, y′)dx′dy′, (2)

where Iobj(x
′, y′) is the intensity of light in the object plane. T (x′, y′) is the transmission

function of the object. Equation (1) can be simplified as [4]

g(2)(x, y) = 1 +
〈∆Icom(x, y)∆Idet〉

〈Icom(x, y)〉 〈Idet〉
, (3)

where ∆Icom(x, y) and ∆Idet are the intensity fluctuations to their ensemble averages, respec-

tively. It shows that g(2)(x, y) depends on the second-order intensity fluctuation correlation

〈∆Icom(x, y)∆Idet〉. Light first propagates from the source to one point on object, and then

7



through this point arrives in the detector plane. When the intensity fluctuation of the de-

tector signal contains the intensity fluctuations of light through this point on the object, the

value of g(2)(x, y) on the same location of that point in the picture would be greater than

1. At last, the object would be imaged on the picture. When a ground glass is inserted

between the object and the detector, light is scattered in all directions. If the scattering is

strong enough, the intensity of the transmitted light through all points on the object would

be close to homogeneous distribution in space. The single-pixel detector can only obtain

parts of light which is fully scattered. Furthermore, the light intensity is relatively weak.

Nevertheless, this part of light still contains all information of object, which means that the

single-pixel detector can get the information of the intensity fluctuations of light from every

points on the object. In addition, the signal of detector Idet also contains the intensity of

light from the ground glass. Because the intensity from the glass and that from computer

are independent, there is no correlation between them. The effect from the ground glass

will disappear when 〈∆Icom(x, y)∆Idet〉 is calculated [22]. The imaging of the object can

still be recovered successfully. However, the visibility of the image will become lower since

the background 〈Icom(x, y)〉 〈Idet〉 relatively increases. According to the above equations and

discussions, CGI can still image letters of XJTU through the scattering media. Figure 2(b)

shows the result with scattering media is similar as the image in CGI without scattering

media. Furthermore, the SNR of the image of the transparent object in CGI is studied.

Figure 6 shows the SNR of the image changes with the number of collected patterns in both

cases. The difference of two cases is whether the scattering media exists. Under two different

conditions, the curves have a good coincide. It illustrates that the scattering media behind

object has little effect to the quality of the image.

When the scattering media becomes a reflection type, imaging around corners with the

single-pixel detector can be achieved. The transmitted light through the object reaches the

white wall which replaces the former ground glass. Light with the information of the object

will be scattered into every direction in the room, so the information of the object can be

obtained in many places. Idet will contain the intensity of light reflected from the object,

the white wall and optical noise. However, there is no correlation between the intensity of

light controlled by computer and all intensities of light except reflected from the object. It

will be the same calculation as the one of CGI with scattering media if the transmission

function of the scattering media is replaced by the reflection function of the white wall. The

FIG. 6. The SNR of images. The SNR of the images of the transparent object in CGI is measured

in two cases. One case, which is represented as square, is that the scattering media exists. The

other case, which is represented as circle, is that the scattering media does not exist. The tendency

of SNR with the increasing number of speckle patterns is shown.

image of the object will be shown in the area where g(2)(x, y) is greater than 1. Imaging

through scattering layers and around corners is also studied by some researchers [36, 37].

They applied the memory-effect for speckle correlations [36] and the Fourier-domain shower-

curtain effect [37] to image the object. The difference between the strategies is that our

image system is a kind of “direct imaging” which is based on simple product of intensities

of a bucket detector and preset speckles patterns. It does not need a complex computation

such as phase retrieval algorithms. The image only needs that the correlation is calculated.

Moreover, the detector in our experiment is a single-pixel detector which is simpler than the

high-megapixel camera.

When a diffuse object instead of the transmission object is imaged, the intensity would

multiply by the reflection function instead of the transmission function of the object in

Eq.(2). Light with the information of the object will be scattered again. The information of

the object can be obtained in many places even though the intensity of light is still extremely

weak. Under this condition, there is still correlation between the intensity of light controlled

by computer and the intensity of light from the object. In the end, the image of object will

appear as if the sight of the single-pixel camera with imaging around corners can bypass the

barrier.

IV. CONLUSIONS

In conclusion, we designed and accomplished the imaging around corners with the single-

pixel detector by a series of experiments about CGI with a single-pixel detector. This

imaging around corners with the single-pixel detector obtains parts of light reflected from

the wall and cannot “see” the diffuse object directly. However, it still can obtain the image

of the object. We analyzed the feature of the camera without image optimisation, so this

camera still has great potential in enhancing image quality and speed. With optimized

algorithms to make CGI faster and the experimental equipments connected by a wireless

system, the single-pixel camera with imaging around corners can be a powerful equipment

in imaging around corners and obstacles in real world.
