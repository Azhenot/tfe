Abstract

As a large-scale instance of dramatic collective behavior, the 2005 French riots started in a poor suburb
of Paris, then spread in all of France, lasting about three weeks. Remarkably, although there were no
displacements of rioters, the riot activity did traveled. Daily national police data to which we had access have
allowed us to take advantage of this natural experiment to explore the dynamics of riot propagation. Here
we show that an epidemic-like model, with less than 10 free parameters and a single sociological variable
characterizing neighborhood deprivation, accounts quantitatively for the full spatio-temporal dynamics of the
riots. This is the first time that such data-driven modeling involving contagion both within and between cities
(through geographic proximity or media) at the scale of a country is performed. Moreover, we give a precise
mathematical characterization to the expression “wave of riots”, and provide a visualization of the propagation
around Paris, exhibiting the wave in a way not described before. The remarkable agreement between model
and data demonstrates that geographic proximity played a major role in the riot propagation, even though
information was readily available everywhere through media. Finally, we argue that our approach gives a
general framework for the modeling of spontaneous collective uprisings.

Introduction

During the Autumn of 2005, France experienced the
longest and most geographically extended riot of the
contemporary history of Europe[1, 2]. Without any
political claims nor leadership, localization was mainly
limited to the “banlieues” (suburbs of large metropoli-
tan cities), where minority groups are largely confined.
Contrary to the London “shopping riots” of 2011, ri-
oting in France essentially consisted in car destruc-
tion and confrontations with the police. The trigger-
ing event took place in a deprived municipality at the
north-east of Paris: on October 27, 2005, two youths
died when intruding into a power substation while

trying to escape a police patrol. Inhabitants sponta-
neously gathered on the streets with anger. The exten-
sion in time and space of these riots – three weeks, more
than 800 municipalities hit across all of France – pro-
duces a natural experiment amenable to analysis thanks
to detailed police data available[3]. The present work
aims at analyzing these data through a mathematical
model that sheds new light on qualitative features of
the riots as instances of collective human behavior[4, 5].

Several works[6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15] have
developed mathematical approaches to rioting dynam-
ics, and their sociological implications have also been
discussed[16]. The 1978 article of Burbeck et al. [10] pi-
oneered quantitative epidemiological modeling to study

the dynamics of riots. Very few works followed the
same route, but similar ideas have been applied to
other social phenomena such as the spreading of ideas
or rumors[17] and the viral propagation of memes on
the Internet[18]. This original epidemiological model-
ing was however limited to the analysis within single
cities, without spatial extension. Few studies aim at
quantitatively describing the spatial spread of riots cou-
pled with contagion. Notable exceptions are an anal-
ysis of the US ethnic riots[13], correlating the occur-
rences of riots in different cities, and the studies of the
2011 London riots[7, 11], which describe the displace-
ments of rioters. In contradistinction with the London
case, media reports and case studies[3, 19] show that
the 2005 French rioters remained localized in a partic-
ular neighborhood of each municipality. However, the
riot itself did travel. Our data give a unique oppor-
tunity to study this contagion from city to city at the
level of a whole country.

We introduce here a compartmental epidemic model
of the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) type[20,
21, 22]. Infection takes place through contacts within
cities as well as through other short- and long-range in-
teractions arising from either social networks or media
coverage. These influence interactions are the key to ri-
ots spreading over the discrete set of French municipal-
ities. In particular, diffusion based on geographic prox-
imity played a major role in generating a kind of riot
wave around Paris which we exhibit here. This is sub-
stantiated by the remarkable agreement between the
data and the model at various geographic scales. In-
deed, one of our main findings is that less than ten free
parameters together with only one sociological variable
(the size of the population of poorly educated young
males) are enough to accurately describe the complete
spatio-temporal dynamics of the riots.

The qualitative features taken into account by our
model – the role of a single triggering effect, a ‘social
tension’ buildup, a somewhat slower and rather smooth
relaxation, and local as well as global spreading –, are
common to many riots. This suggests that our ap-
proach gives a general framework for the modeling of
spontaneous collective uprising.

Results

The 2005 French riots dataset

We base our analysis here on the daily crime reports[3]
of all incidents recorded by the French police at the mu-
nicipalities (corresponding to the French “communes”)
under police authority, which cover municipalities with

a population of at least 20,000 inhabitants. Such data,
on the detailed time course of riots at the scale of hours
or days, and/or involving a large number of cities, are
rare. In addition, as an output of a centralized national
recording procedure applied in all national police units
operating at the local level, the data are homogeneous
in nature. These qualities endow these data with a
unique scientific value. We adopt a simple methodol-
ogy for quantifying the rioting activity: we define as a
single event any rioting-like fact, leaving aside its na-
ture and its apparent intensity. Thus, each one of “5
burnt cars”, “police officers attacked with stones” or
“stoning of firemen”, is labeled as a single event. We
thus get a dataset composed of the number of riot-like
events for each municipality, every day from October
26 to December 8, 2005, a period of 44 days which cov-
ers the three weeks of riots and extends over two weeks
after.

The top of Fig. 1a shows two typical examples of the
time course of the number of events for municipalities
(see also SI Fig. S1, same plots for the 12 most active
Île-de-France municipalities). A striking observation is
that there is a similar up-and-down dynamics at every
location, showing no rebound, or, if any, hardly distin-
guishable from the obvious stochasticity in the data.
This pattern is similar to the one observed for the US
ethnic riots[10]. In addition, we observe the same pat-
tern across different spatial scales (see Fig. 1 and SI
Fig. S3). Moreover, this pattern shows up clearly de-
spite the difference in amplitudes (see also Fig. 4a and
4b). This fractal-like property suggests an underlying
mechanism for which geographical proximity matters.
Finally, the rioting activity appears to be on top of a
background level: as can be seen on Fig. 1, the number
of events relaxes towards the very same level that it
had at the outset of the period. Actually, in the po-
lice data, one cannot always discriminate rioting facts
from ordinary criminal ones, such as the burning of cars
unrelated to collective uprising. For each location, we
assume that the stationary background activity corre-
sponds to this “normal” criminal activity.

Modeling framework

We now introduce our modeling approach. Section Ma-
terials and Methods provides the full model and nu-
merical details. The model features presented below
are based on the analysis at the scale of municipali-
ties. However, since aggregated data at the scale of
départements present a pattern similar to the data of
municipalities, we also fit the model at the département
scale, as if the model assumptions were correct at the

2



scale of each département. A ‘site’, below, is a munici-
pality or a département depending on the scale consid-
ered.
As the rioting activities are described by a discrete set
of events, we assume an underlying point process[23]
characterized by its mean value. Assuming statisti-
cal independence between the rioting and the criminal
activities, the expected number of events at each site
k (k = 1, ...,K, K being the number of sites), is the
sum of the mean (time independent) background ac-
tivity λbk, and of the (time dependent) rioting activ-
ity, λk(t). In fitting the model to the data, we take
the background activity λbk as the average number of
events at the considered site over the last two weeks
of our dataset. Assuming Poisson statistics (which ap-
pears to be in good agreement with the data, see Mate-
rials and Methods), the means λk(t) fully characterize
the rioting activities. We make the assumption that
this number of events λk(t) is proportional to the local
number of rioters, Ik(t):

λk(t) = αIk(t).

We model the coupled dynamics of the set of 2×K vari-
ables, the numbers Ik(t) of rioters (infected individuals
in the terminology of the SIR model) and the num-
bers Sk(t) of individuals susceptible to join the riot,
by writing an epidemic SIR model[21, 22] in a form
suited for the present study. This gives the coupled
dynamics of the λk(t) and of the associated variables,
σk(t) ≡ αSk(t). We fit the model to the data by con-
sidering a discrete time version of the equations (events
are reported on a daily basis), and by optimizing the
choice of the model free parameters with a maximum
likelihood method.

We now sketch the proposed SIR model. We as-
sume homogeneous interactions within each municipal-
ity (a hypothesis justified by the coarse-grained nature
of the data, and by the absence of displacements of riot-
ers), and influences between sites. The model thus be-
longs to the category of metapopulation epidemic mod-
els [24]. Motivated by the relative smoothness of the
time course of events, we make the strong assumption
that, at each site, there is a constant rate at which riot-
ers leave the riot. This parameter aggregates the effects
of different factors – arrests, stringent policing, other
sources of deterrence, fear, fatigue, etc. –, none of them
being here modeled explicitly. In addition, since there
are almost no rebounds of rioting activity, we assume
that there is no flux from recovered (those who left the
riot) to susceptible (and thus we do not have to keep
track of the number of recovered individuals).

In the epidemic of an infectious disease, contagion

typically occurs by dyadic interactions, so that the
probability for a susceptible individual to be infected
is proportional to the fraction of infected individuals
– leading to equations written in terms of the frac-
tions of infected and susceptible individuals. In the
present context, contagion results from a bandwagon
effect[25, 12, 4]. The probability of becoming a rioter
is thus a function of the number of rioters, hence of
the number of events given the above hypothesis. This
function is nonlinear since, being a probability, it must
saturate at some value (at most 1) for large rioting ac-
tivities.

Single site epidemic modeling

As a first step, following Burbeck et al., we ignore inter-
actions between sites, and thus specify the SIR model
for each site separately. We consider here one single
site (and omit the site index k in the equations). Be-
fore a triggering event occurs at some time t0, there is
a certain number S0 > 0 of susceptible individuals but
no rioters. At t0 there is an exogenous shock leading
to a sudden increase in the I population, hence in λ,
yielding an initial condition λ(t0) = A > 0. From then
on, the rioting activity at a single (isolated) site evolves
according to:

dλ(t)

dt
= −ω λ(t) + β σ(t)λ(t),

dσ(t)

dt
= −β σ(t)λ(t),

where β is a susceptibility parameter. Here we work
within a linear approximation of the probability to be-
come infected, which appears to provide good results
for the single site modeling. The condition for the
riot to start after the shock is that the reproduction
number[20] R0 = βσ(t0)/ω is greater than 1. In such
a case, from t = t0 onward, the number of infected
individuals increases, passes through a maximum and
relaxes back towards zero.

We obtain the initial condition σ0 = σ(t0) = αS0
from the fitting procedure. Thus for each site, we are
left with five free parameters to fit in order to best
approximate the time course of the rioting events: ω,
β, t0, A and σ0.

By showing examples at different scales, Fig. 1 (b,
red curves) illustrate the remarkable quality of the re-
sulting fits (see also SI Fig. S1). The obvious limitation
is that fitting all the 853 municipalities present in the
dataset amounts to determining 853×5 = 4265 free pa-
rameters. The fit is very good but meaningless (over-
fitting) for sites with only one or two events. In addi-

tion, these single site fits cannot explain why the riot
started on some particular date at each location. Fit-
ting the single site model requires one to assume that
there is one exogenous specific shock at a specific time
at each location, whereas the triggering of the local riot
actually results from the riot events that occurred be-
fore elsewhere. Nevertheless, we see that everywhere
the patterns are compatible with an epidemic dynam-
ics and that through the use of the model it is possible
to fill in missing data and to smooth the data (filtering
out the noise). As a result of this filtering, the global
pattern of propagation becomes more apparent. In-
deed, looking at the Paris area, one observes a kind of
wave starting at Clichy-sous-Bois municipality, diffus-
ing to nearby locations, spreading around Paris, and
eventually dying out in the more wealthy south-west
areas (see Fig. 3a and SI Video 1).

Modeling the riot wave

We now take into account the interactions between
sites, specifying the global metapopulation SIR model.
Among the K sites under consideration, only one site
k0, the municipality of Clichy-sous-Bois (département
93 when working at département scale), undergoes a
shock at a time t0, 27 October 2005. To avoid a num-
ber of parameters which would scale with the number
of sites, we choose here all free parameters to be site-
independent (in Materials and Methods we give a more
general presentation of the model). The resulting sys-
tem of 2 ×K coupled equations writes as follows: for
t > t0, for k = 1, ...,K,

dλk(t)

dt
= −ω λk(t) + σk(t) Ψ(Λk(t)),

dσk(t)

dt
= −σk(t) Ψ(Λk(t)).

Here ω is the site-independent value for the recovering
rate. For the interaction term we consider that at any
site k the probability to join the riot is a function Ψ
of a quantity Λk(t), the global activity as ‘seen’ from
site k. This represents how, on average, susceptible
individuals feel concerned by rioting events occurring
either locally, in neighboring cities, or anywhere else
in France. We make the hypothesis that the closer
the events, the stronger their influence. We thus write
that Λk(t) is a weighted sum of the rioting activities
occurring in all sites,

Λk(t) =
∑
j

Wkj λj(t),

4



where the weights Wkj are given by a decreasing func-
tion of the distance between sites k and j. We tested
several ways of choosing the weights and obtained the
best results for two types of parametrizations. One
is a power law decay with the distance, motivated by
several empirical observations[26, 27, 28]. The second
option is the sum of an exponential decay and of a
constant term. Both involve two parameters, a prox-
imity scale d0 and, respectively, the exponent δ and the
strength ξ of the constant term. The constant term
may correspond to proximity perceived in terms of cul-
tural, socio-economic characteristics.
For the (site independent) function Ψ(.), we consider
either its linear approximation, writing

Ψ(Λk(t)) = β Λk(t) = β
∑
j

Wkj λj(t),

with the susceptibility β as a site-independent free pa-
rameter, or various non-linear cases, involving up to
four parameters.

Finally, we have to make the crucial choice of the
initial values σk,0 = σk(t0), specific to each site. By
definition, they must be proportional to the size of the
initial susceptible population. We make the hypothe-
sis that the latter scales with the size of a population
defined by a sociological specification. Thus we assume

σk,0 = ζ0 Nk,

where ζ0 is a site-independent free parameter, and Nk
is the size of a reference population provided by INSEE,
the French national statistics and economic studies in-
stitute. The results we present here take as reference
the population of males aged between 16 and 24 out-of-
school with no diploma – see Materials and Methods for
a discussion on the choice of the reference population.

For the whole dynamics, we are left with only six
free parameters in the linear case: ω, A, ζ0, d0, δ or ξ,
and β, and up to nine free parameters in the non linear
case: five as for the linear case, ω, A, ζ0, d0, δ or ξ,
and, in place of β, up to four parameters characterizing
the function Ψ.

The above model, in the case of the linear approxima-
tion, makes links to the classical spatially continuous,
non-local, SIR model[29] (see section Links to the orig-
inal spatially continuous SIR model in Materials and
Methods, and SI Videos 3 and 4). In dimension one,
when the space is homogeneous, we know[30] that trav-
eling waves can propagate, quite similar to the way the
riot spread around Paris as exhibited in the previous
section. The new class of models we have introduced
is however somewhat different and more general, and

raises several open mathematical questions. The next
section shows the wave generated by our global model
and the fit to the data.

Fitting the data: the wave around Paris

We first focus on the contagion around Paris, charac-
terized by a continuous dense urban fabric with de-
prived neighborhoods. There are 1280 municipalities
in Île-de-France. Among the ones under police author-
ity (a total of 462 municipalities, for all of which we
have data), 287 are mentioned for at least one riot-like
event. For all the other municipalities, which are under
“gendarmerie” authority (a military status force with
policing duties), we have no data. Since their popu-
lation size is small, we expect the associated numbers
of riot events to be very small if not absent, so that
these sites have little influence on the whole dynam-
ics. We choose the free parameters with the maximum
likelihood method, making use of the available data,
i.e. the 462 municipalities. However, the model sim-
ulations take into account all the 1280 municipalities.
Results are presented for a power law decrease of the
weights and a non linear function Ψ characterized by
3 parameters. Thus, we have here a total of 8 free
parameters: ω,A, ζ0, d0, δ, in addition to three for the
non-linear function.

Figures 2, 3b and the SI Video 2 illustrate the main
results. Figure 2 compares the model and the data on
four aspects: time course in each département (a), am-
plitude of the events (b), date at which the number
of events is maximum (c), and spatial distribution of
the riots (d). The global model with a single shock
correctly reproduces the up-and-down pattern at each
location, as illustrated on Fig. 2 at département scale.
One can note the preservation of the smooth relaxation
at each site, despite the influence of other (still active)
sites. This can be understood from the SIR dynam-
ics: at a given location, the relaxation term (−ωλk)
dominates when there is no more enough susceptible
individuals, so that the local dynamics becomes es-
sentially independent of what is occurring elsewhere.
Quite importantly, these local patterns occur at the
correct times. One sees that the date of maximum
activity spreads over several days and varies across lo-
cations, which reflects the propagation of the riot.

On the SI Video 2 one can see the wave generated
by the model. Figure 3b shows a sketch of this wave,
with one image every 4 days – which corresponds to
the timescale found by the parameter optimization,
1/ω ∼ 4 days. On the same figure, this timeline has to
be compared with the one obtained from the single site

fits. One can see the good agreement, except for few lo-
cations where the actual rioting activity occurs earlier
than predicted by the global model. A most visible ex-
ception is Argenteuil municipality (north-west of Paris
on the map, see Fig. 3, second images from the top),
where the Minister of Interior made a speech (October
25) perceived as provocative by the banlieues residents.
This could potentially explain the faster response to the
triggering event.

The calibrated model gives the time course of the ex-
pected number of events in all municipalities, including
those under ‘gendarmerie’ authority for which we do
not have any data. For all of the later, the model pre-
dicts a value remaining very small during all the stud-
ied period, except for one, the municipality of Fleury-
Mérogis (see Fig. 2d, South of the map). Remark-

6



ably, searching in the media coverage, we found that
a kindergarten has been burnt in that municipality at
that period of time (Nov. 6).

Fitting the data: the wave across the
whole country

We now show that the same model reproduces the
full dynamics across the whole country. We apply our
global model considering each one of the départements
of metropolitan France (except Corsica and Paris,
hence 93 départements) as one homogeneous site –
computing at municipality scale would be too demand-
ing (more than 36, 000 municipalities). The best model
options lead to 9 free parameters: ω,A, ζ0, d0, ξ, the
susceptibility β (using the linear approximation), and
different susceptibility values at three specific locations.
In this case too, the resulting fit is very good, as illus-
trated on Fig. 4 (see also SI Fig. S3). Figures 4a and 4b
show the results for the 12 most active départements.
Figure 4c compares model and data on the total num-
ber of events, and Fig. 4d on the date of the maximum
activity. For the latter, the data for the Île-de-France
municipalities (Fig. 2c) are reported. One sees that the
wave indeed spread over all France, with the dynamics
in Paris area essentially preceding the one elsewhere.
Remarkably, as shown on Fig. 5, the model also pre-
dicts correctly the time of arrival and the weak ampli-
tude of the riot wave for sites where very few rioting
events have been recorded.

Discussion

Studying the dynamics of riot propagation, a dramatic
example of large-scale social contagion, is difficult due
to the scarcity of data. The present work takes advan-
tage of the access to detailed national police data on the
2005 French riots that offer both the timescale of the
day over a period of 3 weeks, and the geographic exten-
sion over the country. These data exhibit remarkable
features that warrant a modeling approach. We have
shown that a simple epidemic-like model with less than
10 free parameters, combining contagion both within
and between cities, allows one to reproduce the daily
time course of events, revealing the wave of contagion.
A crucial model ingredient is the choice of a single so-
ciological variable, taken from the census statistics as a
proxy for calibrating the size of the susceptible popula-
tion. It shows that the wave propagates in an excitable
medium of deprived neighborhoods. Since our analysis
shows that diffusion by geographic proximity is a key

the correct period of time.

underlying mechanism, having the outbreak location
surrounded by a dense continuum of deprived neigh-
borhoods made the large-scale contagion possible.

What lesson on human behavior can we draw from
our analysis? Firstly, ‘geography matters’[26]: despite
the modern communication media, physical proximity
is still a major feature in the circulation of ideas, here of
riotous ideas. Secondly, strong interpersonal ties are at
stake for dragging people into actions that confront so-
cial order. The underlying interpretation is that inter-
personal networks are relevant for understanding riot
participation. Human behavior is a consequence not
only of individuals’ attributes but also of the strength
of the relation they hold with other individuals[31].
Strong interpersonal connections to others who are al-
ready mobilized draws new participants into partic-
ular forms of collective action such as protest, and
identity (ethnic or religious based) movements[32, 33].
Thirdly, concentration of socio-economic disadvantage
facilitates formation of a sizable group and therefore
involvement in destruction: numbers of rioters in the
model (rather than proportions) can be interpreted as
an indirect indication of risk assessment before partici-
pating to a confrontation with the police[34, 5]. Rioters
seem to adopt a rational behavior and only engage in
such event when their number is sufficient.

The question of parsimony is of the essence in our
modeling approach: an outstanding question was to
understand whether a limited number of parameters
might account for the observed phenomena at various
scales and in various locations. We answer this ques-
tion positively here, thus revealing the existence of a
general mechanism at work. The similar up-and-down
pattern observed for the US ethnic riots in different

cities suggests that this process is indeed common to a
larger class of spontaneous riots. The 2005 riot prop-
agation from place to place is also reminiscent of the
spreading of other riots, such as the one of the food
riots in the late eighteen century in the UK[35], and of
the ethnic riots in US cities – also coined as a wave[13].
We thus believe that the modeling approach introduced
here provides a general framework, different from the
statistical/econometric approach, that may be adapted
to the detailed description of the propagation of spon-
taneous collective uprisings – notably, the interaction
term in our SIR model can be modified to include time
delays (time for the information to travel) or to take
into account time integration of past events.

Materials and Methods

French administrative divisions

The three main French administrative divisions are:
the “commune”, which we refer to as municipality in
the paper (more than 36, 000 communes in France);
at a mid-level scale the ‘département’, somewhat
analogous to the English district (96 départements
in Metropolitan France, labeled from 1 to 95, with
2A and 2B for Corsica); the ‘région’ aggregating
several neighboring départements (12 in metropolitan
France, as of 2016). At a given level, geographic
and demographic characteristics are heterogeneous.
However the typical diameter of a département is
∼ 100 km, and the one of a region, ∼ 250 km.
There are two national police forces, the ‘police’
and the ‘gendarmerie’ (a civilian like police force
reporting to the ministry of Interior whose agents have
a military status in charge of policing the rural parts
of the country). Most urbanized areas (covering all
municipalities with a population superior to 20000)
are under police authority. The more rural ones are
under gendarmerie authority. The available data for
the present study only concern the municipalities
under police authority, except Paris, for which we lack
data (but was not much affected by the riots).
The full list of the municipalities is available on the
French government website,
https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/competence-
territoriale-gendarmerie-et-police-nationales/.

Dataset

The present analysis is based on the daily crime reports
of all incidents of civil unrest reported by the French
police at the municipalities under police authority[3]

8



(see above). The daily reports are written in natural
language, and have been encoded to allow for statistical
treatment. From the reports we selected only facts re-
lated to urban violence. Some facts are reported more
than once (a first time when the fact was discovered,
and then one or two days later e.g. if the perpetrators
have been identified). We carefully tried to detect and
suppress double counting, but some cases may have
been missed. There are also a few missing or incom-
plete data – notably in the nights when rioting was at
its maximum, as the police was overwhelmed and re-
ported only aggregated facts, instead of details city per
city.

In the police data, incidents in relation with the ri-
ots are mostly cases of vehicles set on fire (about 70%),
but also burning of public transportation vehicles, pub-
lic buildings, of waste bins, damages to buses and bus
shelters, confrontations between rioters and police, etc.
Facts have been encoded with the maximum precision:
day and time of the fact, who or what was the target,
the type of damage, the number and kind of damaged
objects and the number and quality of persons involved,
whenever these details are mentioned in the report. In
the present work, as explained in the main text, from
these details, we compute a daily number of events per
municipality. We generated two different datasets, one
for the events (with a total of 6877 entries concerning
853 municipalities) and the other for the arrests (2563
entries), that in forthcoming work will serve to charac-
terize the rioters as well as the severity of the penalties.
In future work we also plan to explore the rioting events
beyond the sole number of events as studied here. One
can expect to see what has been for instance the role of
curfews and other deterrent effects (in space and time).

In addition, we have also built a specific dataset of
media coverage, from both local newspapers and na-
tional TV and radio broadcasts. In ongoing work we
extend our modeling framework by considering the cou-
pling between the dynamics of riot events and the me-
dia coverage.

Background activity

The rioting activity appears to be above a constant
level which most likely corresponds to criminal activ-
ities (an average of an order of 100 vehicles are burnt
every day in France, essentially due to criminal acts not
related to collective uprising). Since this background
activity has the same level before and after the riot, we
assumed that the riot and the criminal activities are
statistically independent. In addition, we also consid-
ered alternative models where the background activity

is an equilibrium state, the riot being a transient ex-
cited state. Such models would predict an undershoot-
ing of the activity just after the end of the riot – more
exactly a relaxation with damped oscillations –, but
the data do not exhibit such behavior.

For the fits, the background activity λb is taken as
the mean activity over the last two weeks in our dataset
(November 25 to December 8), period that we can con-
sider as the tail of the data for which there is no longer
any riot activity (see Fig. 1). For the sites with a non
zero number of events in the tail, we observed that this
base rate is proportional to the size of the reference
population chosen for calibrating the size of the sus-
ceptible population. For the sites where the number of
events in the tail is either zero or unknown (which is
the case for a large number of small municipalities, in
particular the ones under gendarmerie authority), one
needs to give a non zero value of the corresponding base
rate in order to apply the maximum likelihood method
(see below). We estimated it from the size of the refer-
ence population (set as 1 when it is 0), using the latter
proportionality coefficient (with a maximum value of
λb set to one over the length of the tail, ie 1/14).

Poisson noise assumption

In order to calibrate the model to the data, we assumed
Poisson statistics, although we do not claim that the
underlying process is exactly of Poisson nature. How-
ever, it is a convenient working hypothesis for numeri-
cal reasons (see below Free parameters: numerical opti-
mization). From a theoretical point of view, this choice
is a priori appropriate as we deal with discrete values
(often very small). In addition, we have seen that the
data suggests that a same kind of model is relevant
at different scales: this points towards infinitely divisi-
ble distributions, such as the Poisson distribution – the
sum of several independent Poisson processes still be-
ing a Poisson process. We wish to emphasize that we
show that the statistics of the data are compatible with
the Poisson hypothesis. Under such a hypothesis, the
variance is equal to the mean. Figure 6a shows that,
for each département, if we look at the last two weeks
exhibiting a stationary behavior, the variance/mean re-
lationship is indeed in good agreement with a Poisson
hypothesis. Figure 6b shows Poissonness plot[36] for
each of the 12 regions, which gives additional support
to the Poisson noise property.
For completeness, we recall the meaning of a Poisson-
ness plot. One has a total number of observations n.

Mean and variance computed on the tail of the data
(taken as the last two available weeks considered as
background noise, without rioting activity). Each cir-
cle corresponds to one département. For comparison,
we generated fake Poisson data mimicking the typical
values observed in the dataset: the gray crosses give the
sample mean and variance for 14 realizations of 1000
Poisson processes, with true means randomly generated
between 0 and 10. (b) For each region, Poissonness plot

times nx, hence an empirical frequency of occurrence
nx/n. If the underlying process is Poisson with mean
λ, then one must have log(x!nx/n) = −λ + x log(λ).
Thus, in that case, the plot of the quantity log(x!nx/n)
(the blue circles in Fig. 6b) as a function of x should
fall along a straight line with slope log(λ) and intercept
−λ (the red lines on Fig. 6b).

Single site epidemic modeling

We detail here the compartmental SIR model when ap-
plied to each site separately (each municipality, or, af-
ter aggregating the data, for each département). Let us
consider a particular site (we omit here the site index
k in the equations). At each time t there is a number
S(t) of individual susceptible to join the riot, and I(t)
of infected individuals (rioters). Those who leave the
riots become recovered individuals. Since we assume
that there is no flux from recovered to susceptible, we
do not have to keep track of the number of recovered
individuals. Initially, before a triggering event at some
time t0 occurs, there is a certain number S0 > 0 of
susceptible individuals but no rioters, that is, I(t) = 0
for all t ≤ t0. At t0 there is an exogenous shock and

the number of rioters becomes positive I(t0) = I0 > 0.
From there on, neglecting fluctuations, the numbers of
rioters and of susceptible individuals evolve according
to the following set of equations:

dI(t)

dt
= −ω I(t) + S(t)P (s→ i, t)

dS(t)

dt
= −S(t)P (s→ i, t)

(1a)

(1b)

Let us now explain this system of equations. In Eq.
(1a), ω is the constant rate at which rioters leave the
riot. The second term in the right hand side of Eq. (1a)
gives the flux from susceptible to infected as the prod-
uct of the number of susceptible individuals, times the
probability P (s → i, t) for a susceptible individual to
become infected. The second equation, Eq. (1b), sim-
ply states that those who join the riot leave the sub-
population of susceptible individuals.

We now specify the probability to join the riot,
P (s → i, t) (to become infected when in the suscep-
tible state). In line with accounts of other collective
uprising phenomena[5], testimonies from participants
in the 2005 riots suggest a bandwagon effect: individu-
als join the riot when seeing a group of rioters in action.
Threshold decision models[25, 12] describe this herding
behavior assuming that each individual has a threshold.
When the herd size is larger than this threshold the in-
dividual joins the herd. Granovetter[12] has specifically
applied such a model to riot formation, the threshold
being then the number of rioters beyond which the in-
dividual decides to join the riot. Here we make the
simpler hypothesis that the probability to join the riot
does not depend on idiosyncratic factors, and is only an
increasing function of the total number of rioters at the
location (site) under consideration. It is worth empha-
sizing that this herding behavior is in contrast with the
epidemic of an infectious disease, where contagion typi-
cally occurs from dyadic interactions, in which case the
probability is proportional to the fraction of infected
individuals, I(t)/S0. Being a probability, P (s → i, t)
must saturate at some value (at most 1) for large I,
and is thus a nonlinear function of I. Nevertheless,
we will first assume that conditions are such that we
can approximate P (s → i, t) by its linear behavior:
P (s → i, t) ∼ κI(t) (but note that κ does not scale
with 1/S0) and discuss later a different specification
for this term.

Given the assumption λ(t) = αI(t), it is convenient
to define

σ(t) = αS(t) (2)

so that the riot dynamics at a single (isolated) site is

10



described by:
dλ(t)

dt
= −ω λ(t) + β σ(t)λ(t)

dσ(t)

dt
= −β σ(t)λ(t)

(3a)

(3b)

where β ≡ κα . Initially λ = 0, which is a fixed point of
this system of equations. With σ(t0) = σ0 > 0, the riot
starts after the shock if the reproduction number[20]
R0 ≡ βσ0/ω = κS0/ω is greater than 1. In such a
case, from t = t0 onward, the number of infected indi-
viduals first increases, then goes through a maximum
and eventually relaxes back towards zero. Because κ
is not of order 1/S0, this condition seems too easy to
satisfy: at any time, any perturbation would initiate a
riot. One may assume that the particular parameter
values allowing one to fit the data describe the state of
the system at that particular period. Previous months
and days of escalation of tension may have led to an
increase in the susceptibility κ, or in the number of
susceptible individuals S0.

Non local contagion model

We give here the details on the global SIR model, with
interactions between sites. We have a discrete number
K of sites, with homogeneous mixing within each site,
and interactions between sites. At each site k, there is
a number Sk of ‘susceptible’ individuals, Ik of ‘infected’
(rioters), and Rk of ‘recovered’ individuals. As above,
there is no flux from recovered to susceptible (hence we
can ignore the variables Rk), and individuals at site k
leave the riot at a constant rate ωk. Assuming homo-
geneous mixing in each site, the dynamics is given by
the following set of equations:

dIk(t)

dt
= −ωk Ik(t) + Sk(t)Pk(s→ i, t)

dSk(t)

dt
= −Sk(t)Pk(s→ i, t)

(4a)

(4b)

with the initial conditions t < t0 Ik(t) = 0, Sk(t) =
Sk0 > 0, and at t = t0, a shock occurs at a single
location k0, Ik(t0) = I0 > 0. In the above equations,
ωk is the local recovering rate, and Pk(s → i, t) is the
probability for a s-individual at location k to become
a rioter at time t.

We now write the resulting equations for the λk. We
assume the rioting activity to be proportional to the
number of rioters:

λk(t) = αIk(t) (5)

Note that different hypothesis on the dependency of λk
on Ik could be considered. For instance we tested λk ∼
(Ik)

q with some exponent q coming as an additional
free parameter. In that case, the optimization actually
gives that q is close to 1.

Multiplying each side of (4) by α, one gets
dλk(t)

dt
= −ωk λk(t) + σk(t)Pk(s→ i, t)

dσk(t)

dt
= −σk(t)Pk(s→ i, t)

(6a)

(6b)

where as before we introduce σk(t) = αSk(t). Taking
into account the hypothesis on the linear dependency
of the number of event in the number of rioters, (5),
we write P (s→ i, t) directly in term of the λs:

Pk(s→ i, t) = Ψk(Λk(t)) (7)

where Λk(t) is the activity ‘seen’ from site k (see main
text):

Λk(t) ≡
∑
j

Wkjλj(t) (8)

where the weights Wkj are given by a decreasing func-
tion of the distance dist(k, j) between sites k and j:
Wkj = W (dist(k, j)) (see below). The single site case
is recovered for Wkj = δk,j .

In the linear approximation,

Ψk(Λ) = βk Λ, (9)

in which case one gets the set of equations

(10a)

(10b)

The form of these equations is analogous to the ones
of the original distributed contacts continuous spatial
SIR model [30] (see below) but here with a discrete set
of spatial locations.
In the non-linear case, we choose parameters for Ψk(Λ)
in order to have a function (i) being zero when there
is no rioting activity; (ii) which saturates at a value
(smaller or equal to 1) at large argument; (iii) with a
monotonous increasing behavior giving a more or less
pronounced threshold effect (e.g. a sigmoidal shape).
This has to be done looking for the best compromise
between quality of fit and number of parameters (as
small as possible). We tested several sigmoidal func-
tions. For the fit of the Paris area at the scale of the

11



municipalities, we made use of a variant with a strict
threshold:{

Λ < Λck, Ψk(Λ) = 0

Λ > Λck, Ψk(Λ) = ηk (1− exp−γk (Λ− Λck))
(11a)

(11b)

The fit being done with site-independent free param-
eters, this function thus contributes to three free pa-
rameters, Λc, η and γ.

Choice of the weights

The best results are obtained for two options. One is
a power law decay with the distance:

Wkj = (1 + dist(k, j)/d0)
−δ

(12)

where dist(k, j) is the distance between site k and site
j (see below for its computation). The second option
is the sum of an exponential decay and of a constant
term

Wkj = ξ + (1− ξ) exp (−dist(k, j)/d0) (13)

In both cases we normalize the weights so that for every
site k, Wkk = 1. Taking site-independent free parame-
ters, both cases give two free parameters, d0 and δ for
the choice (12), d0 and ξ for the choice (13).

Links to the original spatially continuous
SIR model

In the case of the linear approximation, the meta-
population SIR model that we have introduced leads to
the set of equations (10) of a type similar to the space-
continuous non local (distributed contact) SIR model.
With a view to describe the spreading of infections
in spatially distributed populations, Kendall[29] intro-
duced in 1957 this non-local version of the Kermack-
McKendrick SIR model in the form of space-dependent
integro-differential equations. Omitting the recovered
population R, the system in the S, I variables reads:


dI(x, t)

dt
= −ω I(x, t) + β S(x, t)

∫
K(x, y) I(y, t) dy

dS(x, t)

dt
= −β S(x, t)

∫
K(x, y) I(y, t) dy

(14a)

(14b)

where x ∈ RN , with N = 1, 2, and here I(x, t) and
S(x, t) are densities of immune and susceptible individ-
uals. In the particular case of dimension N = 1, and
the space is homogeneous, meaning here that K(x, y)
is of the form K(x, y) = w(x − y), we know[30] that
there exist traveling waves of any speed larger than or

equal to some critical speed. Furthermore, this crit-
ical traveling wave speed also yields the asymptotic
speed of spreading of the epidemic[37]. There have
been many mathematical works on this system and on
various extensions[38, 18]. Thus, at least in dimension
N = 1 and for homogeneous space, this non-local sys-
tem can generate traveling fronts for the density of sus-
ceptible individuals, hence the propagation of a ‘spike’
of infected individuals. Although no proof exists in di-
mension N = 2, numerical simulations show that the
model can indeed generate waves[39, 40], as illustrated
by the SI Videos 3 and 4, similar to the way the riot
spread around Paris giving rise to the informal notion
of a riot wave.

However, the model we introduce here is more gen-
eral and differs from the Kendall model in certain as-
pects. Indeed, rather than continuous and homoge-
neous, the spatial structure is discrete with heteroge-
neous sites. Moreover, the set of equations here (14)
corresponds to the linear approximation (10), whereas
our general model involves a non-linear term. The
understanding of generalized traveling waves and the
speed of propagation in this general context are inter-
esting open mathematical problems.

More work is needed to assess the mathematical
properties of the specific family of non local contagion
models introduced here, that is defined on a discrete
network, with highly heterogeneous populations, and a
non linear probability of becoming infected.

Figures 2c and 4b show how well the model accounts
for the temporal unfolding of the riot activity, thanks
to a comparison between model and data of the date
when the riot activity peaks at each location. Given
the noisy nature of the data, the empirical date of that
maximum itself is not well defined. For each site, we
estimated this date as the weighted average of the dates
of the 3 greatest values, weighted by those values. We
filled in missing data values by linear interpolation.

Non-free parameters: Reference popula-
tions

Choice of the reference population. As discussed
in the main text, the riots started and developed in
poor neighborhoods, a feature common to many ur-
ban riots[5]. Making use of French national statis-
tics provided by INSEE (see below), we tested the use
of various specific populations, considering cross-linked

12



databases that involve age, sex, diploma or unemploy-
ment. We found the best log-likelihood when using the
size of the population of males aged between 16 and 24
with no diploma, while not attending school (INSEE
statistics of 2006). We thus calibrate the susceptible
population in the model by assuming that, for each
site, its size is proportional to the one of the corre-
sponding reference population.
Populations at the scale of a département. When
applying the model at the scale of départements, for
each département the size of the reference population
is computed as the sum of the sizes of the correspond-
ing populations of all its municipalities that are under
police authority.
Influence on the results. The choice of the refer-
ence population has a major influence on the results.
We find that an improper choice cannot be compen-
sated by the optimization of the free parameters. As
an example, compare SI Fig. S2, for which the refer-
ence population is the total population, with Fig. 2a
and 2b.
Source of national French statistics: INSEE, the
French national institute carrying the national census
(http://www.insee.fr/). For the period under con-
sideration, in most cases, we used relevant data from
2006 when data from 2005 were not available.

Non-free parameters: distance between
sites

The geographic data are taken from the collabo-
rative project Open Street Map (http://osm13.
openstreetmap.fr/~cquest/openfla/export/).
The distance dist(k, j) is taken as the one (in km)
between the centroid of each site. In the case of
the municipalities, the centroid is taken as the ge-
ographic centroid computed with QGIS[41]. In the
case of départements, the centroid is computed as
the weighted centroid (weighted by the size of the
reference population) of all its municipalities that are
under police authority.

Free parameters: numerical optimiza-
tion

The data fit makes use of the maximum likelihood
approach[42]. Let us call X = {xk,i, k = 1 . . .K, i =
1 . . . 44} the data, where each xk,i ∈ N corresponds to
the number of events for the site k at day i (i = 1
corresponding to October 26, 2005), and let θ denote
the set of free parameters (e.g. θ = {ω,A, ζ0, d0, δ, β}
in the multi-sites linear case). Assuming conditional

independence, we have:

p(X|θ) =
∏
k

∏
i

p(xk,i|θ) (15)

Under the Poisson noise hypothesis, the xk,i are Pois-
son probabilistic realizations with mean (λk,i(θ)+λbk):

p(xk,i|θ) =
(λk,i(θ) + λbk)

xk,i

xk,i!
exp

(
− (λk,i(θ) + λbk)

)
(16)

The log-likelihood, computed over all the sites under
consideration and over the whole period (44 days long)
for which we have data, thus writes:

`(θ|X) = log p(X|θ)

=
∑
k,i

(
− λk,i(θ)− λbk + xk,i log(λk,i(θ) + λbk)

)
+
∑
k,i

log xk,i! (17)

Note that the last term in the right hand side does not
depend on the free parameters and we can thus ignore
it.
We performed the numerical maximization of the log-
likelihood using the interior point algorithm[43] imple-
mented in the MATLAB[44] fmincon function.

The method developed here allows one to explore
the possibility of predicting the future time course of
events based on the observation of the events up to
some date. Preliminary results indicate that, once the
activity has reached its peak in the Paris area, the pre-
diction in time and space of the riot dynamics for the
rest of France becomes quite accurate.

Results, details: Paris area, municipality
scale

For the results illustrated by the figures in the paper,
we give here the free parameters numerical values ob-
tained from the maximum likelihood method in the
case of the fit at the scale of municipalities in Île-de-
France. Note that this optimization is computationally
demanding: it requires to generate a large number of
times (of order of tens of thousands) the full dynamics
(44 days) with 2560 (2× 1280) coupled equations. For
the choice of the function Ψ, we tested the linear case
and several nonlinear choices. Results are presented
for the non linear case, the function Ψ being given by
(11). We find: ω = 0.26, A = 5.5; for the power law de-
crease of the weights, d0 = 8. 10

−3km, δ = 0.67; ζ0 =
7.7/Nmax, where Nmax = 1174 is the maximum size of

13

http://osm13.openstreetmap.fr/~cquest/openfla/export/


the reference populations, the max being taken over all
Île-de-France municipalities; for the parameters of the
non linear function: η = 0.63, γ = 1.27,Λc = 0.06.

Results, details: All of France,
département scale

We detail here the model options and the numerical re-
sults for the global model, considering each one of the
départements of metropolitan France (except Corsica
and Paris, hence 93 départements) as one homogeneous
site. We have thus 186 (2×93) coupled equations with
6 to 9 free parameters, depending on the choice of the
function Ψ.
Outliers. Looking at the results for different versions,
we observe some systematic discrepancy between data
and model for three départements: 93, where the pre-
dicted activity is too low, and 13 and 62 where it is too
high. Actually, if one looks at the empirical maximum
number of events as a function of the size of the ref-
erence population used for calibrating the susceptible
population, these three départements show up as out-
liers: the riot intensity is significantly different from
what one would expect from the size of the poor pop-
ulation. Outliers are here defined as falling outside the
mean ± 3 standard deviations range when looking at
the residuals of the linear regression.
The cases of 93 and 13 are not surprising. Département
93 is the one where the riots started, and has the high-
est concentration of deprived neighborhoods. Inhabi-
tants are aware of this particularity and refer to their
common fate by putting forward their belonging to
the ‘neuf-trois’ (nine-three, instead of ninety three).
Events in département 13 are mainly those that oc-
curred in the city of Marseille. Despite a high level of
criminality, and large poor neighborhoods, the inhab-
itants consider that being “Marseillais” comes before
being French, so that people might have felt less con-
cerned. The case of 62 (notably when compared to 59)
remains a puzzle for us.
Parametrization and results. Making use of the
linear choice for Ψ, and the weights given by (13), we
then introduced one more free parameter for each one
of these sites, β93, β62 andβ13, allowing for a differ-
ent value of the susceptibility than the one taken for
the rest of France. Optimization is thus done over the
choice of 9 free parameters: ω,A, ζ0, d0, ξ, β, β13, β62
and β93.
The numerical values of the free parameters obtained
after optimization are as follows: ω = 0.41, A = 2.6;
ζ0 = 190/Nmax, where here Nmax = 15632 is the maxi-
mum size of the reference populations of all metropoli-

tan départements; here the function Ψ is taken lin-
ear, β = 2. 10−3, except for three départements as ex-
plained above. For these three départements with a
specific susceptibility, one finds about twice the com-
mon value for the département 93 (where riots started),
β93/β ∼ 1.95, and about half for the département 62
and 13, β62/β ∼ 0.47 and β13/β ∼ 0.42.
For the weights chosen with an exponential decrease
plus a constant global value, Eq. (13), d0 = 36 km,
ξ = 0.06. When using instead the power law decrease,
Eq. (12), one finds that the fit is almost as good.
The exponent value is found to be δ = 0.80, which
is similar to the value δ = 0.67 found for the fit at
the scale of municipalities (restricted to Île-de-France
region). Yet, these exponent values are much smaller
than the ones, between 1. and 2., found in the litera-
ture on social interactions as a function of geographical
distance[26, 27, 28]. A small value of δ means a very
slow decrease, a hint to the need of keeping a non zero
value at very large distance. This can be seen as an-
other indication that the alternative choice with a long
range part, Eq. (13), is more relevant, meaning that
both geographic proximity and long range interactions
matter.

SI Videos

• SI Video 1. Riot propagation around Paris:
smoothed data.
This video shows the riot propagation around Paris. The
map shows the municipality boundaries, with Paris at the
center. For each municipality for which data is available,
a circle is drawn with an area proportional to the estimate
of the size of the susceptible population (see main text,
section Methods). Instead of making use of the raw data,
for each municipality we replaced each day value by the
one given by the fit with the single site epidemic model
considered here as a tool for smoothing the data. The color
represents the intensity of the rioting activity: the warmer
the color, the higher the activity. The pace of the video
corresponds to three days per second. In order to improve
the fluidity of the video, we increased the number of frames
per second by interpolating each day with 7 new frames,
whose values are computed thanks to a piece-wise cubic
interpolation of the original ones. The resulting frame rate
is then 24 frames per second.
The movie is encoded with the open standard H.264.

• SI Video 2. Riot propagation around Paris: model
with non-local contagion.
This video shows the riot activity as predicted by the
data-driven global epidemic-like model. Same technical
details as for the SI Video 1.
The movie is encoded with the open standard H.264.

• SI Video 3. Spatial SIR: wave propagation in a
homogeneous medium.
We illustrate the formal continuous spatial SIR model
with a video showing the propagation of a wave. The
underlying medium is characterized by a uniform density
of susceptible individuals. The weights w(x − y) in the
interaction term are given by a decreasing exponential
function of the Euclidean distance ||x− y||.
The movie is encoded with the open standard H.264.

• SI Video 4. Spatial SIR: wave propagation in a
non-homogeneous medium.
Same as SI Video 3, but with a heterogeneous density of
susceptible individuals, characterized by (1) a decrease of
the density towards 0 near the boundary of the image,
so that the wave dies before leaving the frame, (2) a hole
at the center, which is then bypassed by the wave, (3)
a concentration of susceptible individuals that globally
decreases on the y-axis, so that the wave dies while going
downward.
The movie is encoded with the open standard H.264.
