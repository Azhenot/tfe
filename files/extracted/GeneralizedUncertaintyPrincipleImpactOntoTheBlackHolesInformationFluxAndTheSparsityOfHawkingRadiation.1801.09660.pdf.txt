We investigate the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) corrections to the entropy content
and the information flux of black holes, as well as the corrections to the sparsity of the Hawking
radiation at the late stages of evaporation. We find that due to these quantum gravity motivated
corrections, the entropy flow per particle reduces its value on the approach to the Planck scale due
to a better accuracy in counting the number of microstates. We also show that the radiation flow
is no longer sparse when the mass of a black hole approaches Planck mass which is not the case for
non-GUP calculations.

I. INTRODUCTION

Since the 1970s it is known that it is possible to apply
thermodynamic tools to black holes. The fact that black
holes not only absorb but also emit radiation when quan-
tum mechanics is taken into account was first proposed
by Hawking [1, 2]. This mechanism of black hole evapo-
ration relies on the semiclassical approach, so applies the
methods of quantum field theory. Hawking calculated the
emission from black holes, being thermal (called Hawking
radiation), and the associated temperature from which
the corresponding thermodynamic entropy was obtained
[3]. The importance of this result lies in the issue that
considering an initial pure state black hole, when it evap-
orates (thermally), the final state is a mixed state [4].
Such evolution implies a nonunitary process which is not
allowed in the standard quantum mechanics. This im-
plies loss of information during the evolution and is com-
monly called the black hole information puzzle. This
problem has been one of the first points of discussion con-
cerning black hole during decades and is still unsolved.
There exist many different proposals that try to solve it.
Some of them consider that we should forget about a uni-
tary process, others, assuming unitary, try to find where
the information of the process is lost and how to recover
it. For more details, see Refs. [5–15].

The thermodynamic entropy is associated with the lack
of information. In this sense, we are interested in what is
the entropy flux in the Hawking radiation and what we
can learn about hidden information in the correlations
that we decide not to see because of the coarse-graining
we consider [16]. Specifically, in this paper, we are in-

teresting in how this radiation is modified when we take
into account effects coming from pure quantum gravity.

Recently in [17–20], one of the authors of this paper,
quantified the information budget in black hole evapora-
tion. The starting point was the calculation of the bud-
get of entropy for a black body, where the entropy flux is
compensated by hidden information in the correlations,
due to the emission process is unitary. This argument
was extended for black holes, demonstrating that the as-
sumption of unitarity can lead to a perfectly reasonable
entropy/information budget. It was shown that during
the evaporation process Bekenstein entropy of a black
hole is adiabatically transferred into the Clausius entropy
of the Hawking radiation field, holding during the whole
evaporation process that the initial Bekenstein entropy
is equal to the increasing Clausius entropy of the radi-
ation field and the decreasing Bekenstein entropy. This
study was done considering classical and quantum en-
tropies and directly provides also that the total number
of particles is proportional to the initial entropy of a black
hole.

Another interesting aspect to note, is the (extreme)
sparsity of the Hawking radiation during the evaporation
process [21–25]. The average time between emission of
successive Hawking quanta, is many times larger than
the natural timescale set by the energies of the emitted
quanta themselves.

At the late stages of the Hawking evaporation pro-
cess, one should take into account the strong effects com-
ing from the underlying theory of quantum gravity that
can modify Hawking temperature [1] and Bekenstein en-
tropy [3]. These modifications expressed in terms of gen-
eralized uncertainty principle (GUP) have been investi-
gated in the context of string theory [26–30], loop quan-
tum gravity [31, 32], modified dispersion relations and
from black hole physics [34, 36–45]. As a consequence of
these modifications, black holes do not evaporate com-
pletely and are left with a remnant of order of Planck size

with finite entropy. It was suggested that these Planck
size remnants store information [14, 33–35] which gives a
possible solution to the information puzzle.

It is possible to have two different kind of corrections
of the entropy. First of them comes from the quan-
tum corrections in counting microstates, keeping fixed
the horizon area (microcanonical corrections) [41]. These
corrections will reduce the entropy as a consequence of
the reduction of the uncertainty over the underlying mi-
crostates. The second kind of a correction is not related
to the fundamental degrees of freedom, but corrects the
entropy by considering thermal fluctuations on the hori-
zon area (canonical corrections) [42]. Contrary to the
former one, in this latter case, the entropy increases, as
one adds uncertainty to the system. In this paper we
are interested in the quantum corrections when the black
holes reach the Planck scale, so we will consider only the
microcanonical corrections (that can also be understood
as more fundamental). We investigate how these cor-
rections modify the information flow and sparsity of the
Hawking radiation. These corrections are expressed by
the GUP and first of all they influence the Bekenstein
entropy and the Hawking temperature, then extending
onto other related quantities.

In Sec. II we review the key results about the informa-
tion content of black holes as given in Refs. ([17–20]). In
Sec. III we discuss the GUP corrections to the flow of in-
formation in black holes when they approach the Planck
mass. In Sec. IV we study the GUP modifications to the
frequency of emission of Hawking quanta. The summary
of our results is given in Sec. V.

II. ENTROPY OF BLACK HOLES PER
EMITTED QUANTA

In Ref. [17] the average entropy released during the
standard thermodynamic process of burning a lump of
coal in a blackbody furnace was calculated. It is useful to
present this entropy in a dimensionless fashion, expressed
in units of nats or bits. Henceforth, the entropy in nats
is Ŝ = S/kB , and the entropy in bits is just defined as

Ŝ2 = S/(kB ln 2), where kB is the Boltzmann constant
and S the original (dimensionfull) entropy. The explicit
result for an average entropy flow in black body radiation
was obtained to be

〈Ŝ2〉 =
π4

30ζ(3)ln2
bits/photon ≈ 3.90 bits/photon. (1)

The standard deviation of Eq. (1) is

bits/photon

≈ 2.52 bits/photon, (2)

where ζ(n) is the Riemann zeta function.

This reasoning was then extended to the black
hole evaporation process, determining the flux of en-
tropy/information emitted in the form of radiation (as-
suming an exact Planck spectrum as first approxima-
tion) [18, 19]. For the case of a Schwarzschild black
hole with mass M , the Bekenstein entropy loss per emit-
ted massless boson was found to be equal to the entropy
content per photon in black body radiation. In addition,
after calculating the gain of entropy in the Hawking flux,
one finds that all the information emitted by a black hole
is perfectly compensated by the entropy gain of the radi-
ation, so that the information is completely transmitted
from the hole to the external radiation [18, 19].

One can also estimate the total number of emitted
quanta in terms of the original Bekenstein entropy as
being equal to [18, 19]

N =
30ζ(3)

π4
Ŝ2 ≈ 0.26 Ŝ2. (3)

According to these results, it was shown, semiclassi-
cally, how it was possible to describe the evaporation
process of a black hole with an explicit and continuous
flux of entropy (from the hole into the radiation), where
each photon carries an amount of entropy that should be
compensated by information hidden in correlations (as-
suming that the evaporation is a unitary process).

III. GUP CORRECTIONS TO THE ENTROPY
OF BLACK HOLES

The calculations involving Hawking radiation are usu-
ally performed using semiclassical methods, but when the
size of a system approaches the Planck scale, they cease
to be valid and it is the full theory of quantum gravity
which should be applied. As still there is no complete
theory of quantum gravity, what one usually considers
are some corrections to the classical theory coming from
the quantum nature of spacetime. In our case of interest,
we will investigate the corrections in the Hawking tem-
perature and the Bekenstein entropy. These corrections
were first suggested in string theory [28, 29] and in loop
quantum gravity [31, 32]. In fact, it is possible to di-
rectly apply the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP)
to describe such corrections [34, 41]. They are applied in
order to accurately count the number of microstates that
describe a black hole, and this translates into quantum
corrections to microcanonical entropy.

The GUP modifies the Heisenberg principle, in pres-
ence of a gravitational field, at the Planck energies
into [34–44]

with α0 a dimensionless constant, lpl the Planck length,
~ the Planck constant, and α a constant with the dimen-
sion of inverse momentum i.e. kg−1m−1s. The value
of α0 has been largely discussed in the literature and it
depends on the correction we want to apply to our sys-
tem [34, 40–42, 46–48]. In the case that concerns us it
has a negative value due to the microcanonical correc-
tions we consider (as it was detailed in the introduction)
and is of order unity on the theoretical basis (showing
only our ignorance of the exact correction to the uncer-
tainty principle from quantum gravity) [34, 41]. Recently,
some investigations are discussing observational bounds
over the value of α0 [46–49]. There have even been also
claims that α0 is not a pure number, but depends on the
ratio mp/M where M is the black hole mass and mp is
the Planck mass [47]. The GUP corrections should be
applied to a black hole evaporation process at its final
stages (when the size of a black hole is of the magnitude
of the Planck scale) and so they imply a modification of
the information/entropy carried by the emitted particles
as it is explained below.

Following [34], we can write Hawking temperature of a
black hole by using the uncertainty relation ∆p∆x ≈ ~;
and near the horizon of a black hole, the position uncer-
tainty has a minimum value of ∆x = 2lp, where for the
case of a Schwarzschild black hole, lp = 2GM/c

leads to an energy uncertainty

where, m2p = ~c/G, G is the Newton’s gravitational con-

we can derive TGUP . For this purpose, one can express
∆p in terms of ∆x from Eq. (4) and it gives

Using this modified Hawking temperature, TGUP , we ob-

From now on we will use only the first two terms in Eq.

modifications. In Fig. 1 one can see that the entropy
carried per escaping particle it is not always the same
(and consequently the information is not escaping at the
same rate), but it reduces its value when the system is
decreasing its size on the approach to the Planck length.
This result makes sense together with the fact that some
more accurate determination of the degrees of freedom
(more information) in the system, due to the quantum
correction we have introduced, reduces its entropy. By
using the GUP generalized temperature (10) we also can
obtain the number of particles per emitted mass as

in terms of entropy.This expression, compared with the
semiclassical calculation of the total emitted particles
[Eq. (3)], shows the introduction of a GUP modification
that results in decreasing the total of emitted particles.
Such a correction makes sense considering that the final
state of evaporation is a remnant of the Planck size.

IV. SPARSITY OF HAWKING RADIATION
MODIFIED BY GUP

An interesting characteristic of the Hawking flux is
that it is very sparse during the whole evaporation pro-
cess. In order to probe this, one can use several dimen-
sionless quantities that gave the ratio between an average
time between the emission of two consecutive quanta and
the natural time scale [21].

In the first approximation one assumes the exact
Planck spectrum and it results in a general expression
for the Minkowski spacetime, that should be specified de-
pending on a dimensionless parameter η (for a detailed
discussion, see Ref. [21]) given by

η = C
λ2thermal
gA

, (22)

where the constant C is dimensionless and depends on
the specific parameter (η) we are choosing, g is the spin
degeneracy factor, A is the area and

λthermal = 2π~c/(kBT ) (23)

is the “thermal wavelength.”
For a Schwarzschild black hole the temperature in the

thermal wavelength is given by the Hawking tempera-
ture and the area should be replaced by an effective area
(that corresponds to the universal cross section at high
frequencies) given by Aeff = 27/4A, where A is a horizon
area of a black hole. In this case, the relevant factor in
any dimensionless parameter results in

λ2thermal
Aeff

=
64π3

27
∼ 73.5...� 1, (24)

for massless bosons. Consequently, any of the dimen-
sionless parameters is much larger than unity (contrary
that emitters under normal laboratory conditions, where
η � 1). This implies that the gap between successive
Hawking quanta is on average much larger than the nat-
ural timescale associated with each individual emitted
quantum, so the flux is very sparse. It is interesting to
note that the mass M of a black hole drops out during
the calculations.

What is relevant here is that both the area and the
“thermal wavelength” are GUP-modified when the sys-
tem approaches the Planck scale. This results in modi-
fying the frequency of emitted quanta from a black hole.

We obtain that the new generalized by GUP effective
area is

on the GUP parameter α.

|GUP as given by (28)
as a function of a black hole mass for different values of
α. The horizontal line represents the case α = 0, which
is consistent with the original calculation [21].

It is worth emphasizing again that the dimensionless

parameter
λ2thermal
Aeff

|GUP depends on the initial mass of
the black hole M and the GUP parameter α. At early
stages of the Hawking evaporation process, this is not
relevant (due to the huge mass of a black hole) and
this dimensionless parameter is much greater than one.
However, when a black hole approaches the Planck mass
at the late evaporation time, the parameter approaches
unity and finally becomes less than one. Note that for
higher values of α, this dimensionless parameter starts
decreasing for smaller values of mass, that is for earlier
phases of an evaporation process. This result indicates
that the Hawking flux is no longer sparse when the black
hole approaches the Planck mass, and that this regime
depends of the specific GUP parameter, although the
qualitative result is the same for all values of α. In [50]
a similar result from calculating the sparsity of Hawking
flux close to the Planck scale, using corrections coming
from backreaction effects have been studied. It is in-
teresting to note that how different approaches for that
scale lead to qualitative similar results, which reassert
the behavior of the Hawking flux at the final stages of
evaporation.

V. SUMMARY

We have investigated quantum gravity modifications
to the entropy and temperature of an evaporating black
hole expressed by the generalized uncertainty principle
(GUP), that will be relevant when it approaches the
Planck size. In this process, GUP prevents complete
evaporation leaving a final remnant of the Planck size.
We have shown that these modifications change the flow
of information from black holes when they approach the
Planck mass, and also influence amount of the sparsity
of the Hawking radiation.

We have considered microcanonical corrections that
are taken into account in order to more accurately count
the microstates that describe a black hole. This proper
count of microstates allows to reduce the uncertainty, so
the entropy is diminished in comparison to the semiclas-
sical calculation.

The first important result we have obtained is that
the radiation flux, although continuous, does not always
carry the same amount of information. Once the evap-
oration reaches its final stages (that is, the black hole
size approaches the Planck length), the entropy budget
carried by escaping particles reduces drastically, there-
fore the hidden information in the system also reduces.
In addition is also interesting to note how also the total
number of emitted particles is reduced, what is consistent
with the presence of a final remnant.

The second important result is that although the
Hawking radiation flux is extremely sparse during the
evaporation once the semiclassical regime is considered,
when we take into account the GUP modifications this is
no longer the case and the radiation ceases to be sparse
when the process reaches its last stages which are close
to the Planck scale.

These results help to understand the behaviour of the
flux of Hawking particles and the information loss from
the black holes. They show how modifications com-
ing from quantum gravity (here- the GUP corrections)
change the semiclassical picture of the entropy flux, when
a black holes approach last stages of their evaporation
processes.
