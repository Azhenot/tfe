Optical atomic clocks, due to their unprecedented stability1–3 
and uncertainty3–6, are already being used to test physical 
theories7,8 and herald a revision of the International System of 
Units9,10. However, to unlock their potential for cross-disciplin-
ary applications such as relativistic geodesy11, a major chal-
lenge remains: their transformation from highly specialized 
instruments restricted to national metrology laboratories into 
flexible devices deployable in different locations12–14. Here, 
we report the first field measurement campaign with a trans-
portable 87Sr optical lattice clock12. We use it to determine the 
gravity potential difference between the middle of a mountain 
and a location 90 km away, exploiting both local and remote 
clock comparisons to eliminate potential clock errors. A local 
comparison with a 171Yb lattice clock15 also serves as an impor-
tant check on the international consistency of independently 
developed optical clocks. This campaign demonstrates the 
exciting prospects for transportable optical clocks.

The application of clocks in geodesy fulfils long-standing pro-
posals to interpret a measurement of the relativistic redshift Δ νrel 
between clocks at two sites as the associated gravity potential differ-
ence Δ U = c2 Δ νrel/ν0 (ν0 being the clock’s frequency and c the speed of 
light)11. National geodetic height systems based on classical terrestrial 
and satellite-based measurements exhibit discrepancies at the deci-
metre level16. Optical clocks, combined with high-performance fre-
quency dissemination techniques17,18, offer an attractive way to resolve 
these discrepancies, as they combine the advantage of high spectral 
resolution with small error accumulation over long distances17,19.

A clock-based approach to geodesy with a capability competitive 
with current techniques requires high clock performance: a frac-
tional frequency accuracy of 1 ×  10−17 corresponds to a resolution 
of about 10 cm in height. Furthermore, it is important to realize 
that the side-by-side frequency ratio has to be known to determine 
the remote frequency shift Δ νrel. Taking the uncertainty budgets of 
optical clocks for granted harbours the possibility of errors, because 
very few have been verified experimentally to the low 10−17 region 
or beyond4, 6, 17,20. A transportable optical clock not only increases 
the flexibility in measurement sites but mitigates the risk of unde-
tected errors by enabling local calibrations to be performed.

The test site chosen for our demonstration of chronometric level-
ling11 with optical clocks was the Laboratoire Souterrain de Modane 

(LSM) in France, with the Italian metrology institute INRIM in 
Torino serving as the reference site. The height difference between 
the two sites is approximately 1,000 m, corresponding to a fractional 
redshift of about 10–13. From a geodetic point of view, LSM is an 
interesting location at which to make such measurements: first it 
is located in the middle of the 13 km long Fréjus road tunnel (rock 
coverage 1,700 m), and second the area exhibits long-term land 
uplift (Alpine orogeny) accompanied by a secular gravity potential 
variation. Furthermore, LSM lacks the metrological infrastructure 
to independently validate components of the clock and the envi-
ronmental control on which the operation of optical clocks usually 
relies. The air temperature is high (∼ 26 °C), with fluctuations of 
several Kelvin at the transportable clock, and the humidity is very 
low. Working hours are also severely restricted for safety reasons, 
a problem that was further compounded during our measurement 
campaign by interruptions due to blasts caused by construction of 
a new tunnel nearby. Even without this additional source of seis-
mic noise, the acoustic noise levels in the laboratory are high. The 
selected location thus constitutes a challenging but realistic testbed 
with practical relevance.

The transportable 87Sr lattice clock is (compared with laboratory 
clocks) designed to be compact, with robust optical parts12. The 
physics package is less than 0.6 m3 in size, and we use laser bread-
boards with mechanical stress-resistant fibre couplers21. All com-
ponents except the reference cavity of the interrogation laser are 
rigidly mounted in a car trailer (size 2.2 m ×  3 m ×  2.2 m), and vibra-
tion isolation is provided by rubber dampers. The trailer interior is 
temperature stabilized, while the small volume of the trailer hinders 
air exchange and generates hot spots with more than 10 K tempera-
ture rise. However, the optics and the physics package are placed 
apart and shielded from these and are stable to within 0.4 K after an 
initial temperature rise of about 1 K. The transportable ultrastable 
reference cavity for the clock interrogation lasers is rigidly mounted 
to endure transport12. It was placed next to the trailer to avoid its 
performance being degraded by vibrations induced in the trailer’s 
air conditioning system. The vibration amplitudes in the trailer are a 
factor of ten larger than under typical laboratory conditions, leading 
to a corresponding increase in clock instability. A reference reso-
nator with lower acceleration sensitivity or an active feed-forward 
system may in the future remedy this inconvenience22.

The Sr clock was operated in both locations, LSM and INRIM, to 

eliminate the need for a priori knowledge of the clock’s frequency. 
A schematic outline of the experiment is given in Fig. 1. LSM and 
INRIM were connected by a 150 km noise-compensated optical 
fibre link (see Methods). At LSM, a transportable frequency comb 
measured the optical frequency ratio between a laser resonant with 
the Sr clock transition at 698 nm and 1.542 µ m radiation from an 
ultrastable link laser transmitted from INRIM. In this way, the fre-
quency of the optical clock at LSM could be directly related to the 
frequency of the link laser even without a highly accurate absolute 
frequency reference. In addition to the optical carrier, the fibre link 
was used to disseminate a 100 MHz radiofrequency reference sig-
nal from INRIM for the frequency comb, frequency counters and 
acousto-optic modulators at LSM (see Methods). At INRIM, a cryo-
genic Cs fountain clock23 and a 171Yb optical lattice clock15 served as 
references. The connection between the clocks at INRIM and the 
link laser is provided by a second frequency comb.

Ten days after arriving at LSM in early February 2016, the first 
spectra of motional sidebands on the 1S0–3P0 clock transition were 
recorded from the 87Sr transportable clock, marking the point at 
which a recharacterization of the clock could begin. This set-up 
time included general logistics, powering and thermalization of the 
equipment, installation of reference frequency equipment, realign-
ment of optical fibre couplings, individual testing of all subcompo-
nents and magnetic field compensation for loading the atoms into 
the lattice. The operation of the lattice clock (see Methods) was 
similar to the procedure described in previous works12.

The transportable clock operated less reliably in the environ-
mental conditions at LSM than in initial tests at PTB before trans-
port. Vibrations caused by the tunnel blasting mentioned earlier led 
to degradation of the light delivery for the first cooling stage of the 
magneto-optical trap (MOT; see Methods), which in turn led to 
interruptions due to insufficient atom number. The low-humidity 

environment also hampered the air conditioning in the trailer, caus-
ing the Ti:sapphire laser used to create the optical lattice to overheat, 
further shortening the clock operation periods and thus the evalu-
ation of some contributions to the clock uncertainty budget. The 
blackbody radiation (BBR) shift was still controlled to the level of 
3 ×  10−17. For these reasons, during the allocated time in the tun-
nel simultaneous operation was achieved only with the primary Cs 
fountain clock at INRIM and not with the high-stability Yb lattice 
clock. Although the Yb lattice clock at INRIM operated reliably for 
the majority of the time, the commercial lattice laser for the clock 
failed just before the characterization of the transportable clock had 
been completed. With the transportable clock operating for 2.8 h 
over two days at the end of the LSM campaign in mid-March 2016, 
the instability of the fountain clock (2.2 ×  10−13 τ−1/2, where τ is given 
in seconds) poses a limitation on the uncertainty of the frequency 
measurement. We therefore apply a hydrogen maser as a flywheel24 
to reduce the statistical uncertainty of the measurement: the maser’s 
frequency is rapidly and accurately calibrated by the optical clock, 
and due to the frequency stability of the maser this calibration is 
valid for longer periods of time. This makes it possible to extend 
the averaging time to 48 h (see Methods), leading to an uncertainty 
of 17 ×  10−16 associated with the measurement time. With system-
atic uncertainties of the Sr and Cs clocks of 2.6 ×  10−16 and 3 ×  10−16 
respectively (see Table 1, Methods and ref. 23), the frequency of 
the Sr lattice clock at LSM was measured by the fountain clock at 
INRIM with an uncertainty of 18 ×  10−16 (see Fig. 1).

As noted earlier, an initial frequency comparison at a common 
gravity potential is required to transform a general frequency mea-
surement or clock comparison into a chronometric levelling mea-
surement. For this reason, the Sr apparatus was moved to INRIM in 
April 2016 for local clock comparisons. There, it was directly linked 
to the INRIM frequency comb. In the process, small upgrades 
were made to the set-up for the cooling light distribution and the

Fig. 1 | Schematic representation of the measurement campaign. a, For chronometric levelling, the transportable 87Sr optical lattice clock was placed in 
the LSM underground laboratory close to the France–Italy border in the Fréjus tunnel (top left). The clock was connected by a noise-compensated fibre 
link (length 150 km) to the Italian national metrology institute INRIM in Torino (red line). There, a primary Cs fountain clock and a 171Yb optical lattice 
clock were operated (right). At both sites, frequency combs were used to relate the frequencies of the 1S0–3P0 optical clock transitions and the 1.5 µ m laser 
radiation transmitted through the link. After the remote frequency comparison, the transportable clock was moved to INRIM for a side-by-side frequency 
ratio measurement. b, Frequency of the transportable Sr clock as seen by the INRIM Cs fountain clock (black circles, uncertainties are one standard

a combination of GNSS (global navigation satellite system), spirit levelling and gravimetric geoid modelling (see Methods).

 thermal management in the car trailer. With these changes, the 
availability of the Sr clock was improved significantly, allowing for 
several hours of data taking per day after the initial set-up phase 
was completed. With systematic uncertainties comparable to the 
first campaign and a fountain instability of 3.6 ×  10−13 τ−1/2, the total 
uncertainty was reduced by a factor of two to 9 ×  10−16 (see Methods 
for Sr transition frequencies). In this chronometric levelling dem-
onstration, we resolved a relativistic redshift of the optical lattice 
clock of 47.92(83) Hz (Fig. 1), from which we infer a potential dif-
ference of 10,034(174) m2 s−2 (The numbers in the parentheses are 
the 1σ  uncertainties referred to the corresponding last digits of the 
quoted results.). This is in excellent agreement with the value of 
10,032.1(16) m2 s−2 determined independently by geodetic means 
(see Methods). Though our result does not yet challenge the clas-
sical geodetic approach in accuracy, it is the first demonstration of 
chronometric levelling using a transportable optical clock.

With the increased reliability of the transportable Sr clock, we 
were also able to measure its optical frequency ratio R with the 
Yb lattice clock15 operated on the 1S0–3P0 transition at 578 nm. 
In total, 31,000 s of common operation of the two optical clocks 
and the frequency comb were achieved over a period of 7 days. 
This optical–optical comparison (Fig. 2) shows much higher sta-
bility than the optical–microwave one. Consequently, the optical 
frequency ratio measurement is limited by the systematic uncer-
tainty of the clocks (Table 1), rather than by their instability. This 
demonstrates the key advantage of optical frequency standards: 
they are able to achieve excellent uncertainties in short averag-
ing times even though they may operate less reliably than their 
microwave counterparts.

The 171Yb/87Sr frequency ratios measured on different days are 
summarized in Fig. 3, which also shows previous measurements of 
this ratio. After averaging (see Methods), we determine the ratio to 
be R =  νYb/ νSr = 1.207,507,039,343,338,41(34). Independent mea-
surements of particular optical frequency ratios are important to 
check the consistency of optical clocks worldwide25, and are key to 
establishing more accurate representations of the second26 as pro-
vided by the International Committee for Weights and Measures 
(CIPM) as a step towards a future redefinition of the second. To 
our knowledge, this is the only optical frequency ratio that has 
been measured directly by three independent research groups27–29; 

however, our measurement differs from the most accurate pre-
vious measurement by two standard deviations (Fig. 3), and the 
origin of this difference will require further investigation by the 
research groups concerned.

from the instabilities of the two clocks involved in the comparison as well 
as the measurement chain. The stability of each individual clock depends 
on its clock laser, and separating their contributions is not straightforward. 
The instability of the Sr clock is estimated to be about 7 ×  10–15 τ–1/2 from 
the instability of the frequency offset between the Sr clock transition and 
the clock laser reference cavity, after removing a linear cavity drift. The 
contribution from the Yb clock is probably more than 1 ×  10–14 τ–1/2.

Note that, even with the only slightly improved transportable Sr 
apparatus as used at INRIM, chronometric levelling against the Yb 
lattice clock with considerably improved resolution would be pos-
sible. We expect that the transportable clock with improved reli-
ability will be able to achieve an uncertainty of 1 ×  10−17 before, for 
example, BBR-related uncertainties pose a limitation to the pres-
ent set-up. Instabilities of 1 ×  10–15 τ–1/2 are realistic with the cur-
rent interrogation laser; lower instabilities will require an improved 
reference cavity. The uncertainty will enable height differences of 
10 cm to be resolved, which is a relevant magnitude for geodesy in 
regions such as islands, which are hard to access using conventional 
geodetic approaches. As metrological fibre links become more 
common, chronometric levelling along their paths30 will become a 
realistic prospect.

Methods
Operation of lattice clocks. The realization and operation of the 171Yb (I =  1/2) 
and 87Sr (I =  9/2) clocks are very similar and have been presented in detail12, 15,21. 
Ytterbium and strontium atoms are cooled to microkelvin temperatures in two-
stage MOTs, exploiting the strong 1S0–1P1 and weaker 1S0–3P1 transitions (at 399 nm 
and 556 nm for Yb and 461 nm and 689 nm for Sr, respectively). The atoms are then 
trapped in one-dimensional optical lattices operating at the magic wavelengths31 
λYbmagic ≈  759 nm and λSrmagic ≈  813 nm, which to first order give a zero differential 
light shift between the 1S0 and 3P0 states.

Finally, the atoms are prepared for spectroscopy in a single magnetic sublevel 
mf by optical pumping. As a result, shifts due to cold collisions and line pulling are 
reduced. The two π  transitions from the mf =  ± 1/2 sublevels in Yb (mf =  ± 9/2  
in Sr) are probed alternately at approximately halfwidth detunings so that the 
interrogation laser is locked to their average transition frequency. This effectively 
removes the linear Zeeman shift.

Uncertainties of lattice clocks. Here, we discuss the most important uncertainty 
contributions listed in Table 1. More details of the methods used to evaluate these 
uncertainties are given in refs 15,24 and 12.

Lattice light shifts. The lattice of the Yb clock is operated at νl =  394,798.238 GHz 
with a trap depth U0 =  196(4)Er (Er being the lattice recoil energy) and an atomic 
temperature of 7(3) µ K as determined by sideband spectroscopy32. We measured 
the linear shift near the magic wavelength while the non-linear induced lattice light 
shift can be calculated using data from ref. 27.

For the Sr lattice clock, the typical lattice depth was about 100Er as measured 
from sideband spectra32. These also yielded an atomic temperature of about 3.5 µ K.  
The light-shift cancellation frequency was determined earlier; a reference resonator 
served as a wavelength reference during the experiments discussed here. The 
uncertainty of the linear lattice light shift allows for a possible resonator frequency 
change of 50 MHz caused by vibrations and shocks during transport and changes 
due to potential variations of the scalar and tensor light shift caused by geometrical 
changes or changes of the environmental magnetic field33. Without transport, the 
resonator frequency stays stable within 1 MHz for weeks, but relaxation during 
transport cannot be excluded. In future measurement campaigns, a determination 
of the light-shift cancellation wavelength will be made at the site of measurement. 
Higher-order light shifts were calculated using the coefficients in the same 
reference. As a check, three of the measurements in Fig. 2 were performed with a 
deeper lattice of about 160Er, which resulted in uncertainties for the linear lattice 
light shift and higher-order shifts of 29 ×  10−17 and 1 ×  10−17, respectively. No 
significant variation of the measured frequency ratio R was observed.

Density shift. The density shift was evaluated in both lattice clocks by varying the 
interrogated atom number. Corrections for changes of the atomic temperature have 
been applied for the Sr clock. The lower uncertainty of the density shift at LSM is due 
to the lower atom number and thus density with which the clock was operated there.

BBR shift. The influence of BBR on the clock frequency has been discussed 
elsewhere3,4,34–36. Temperatures of the atomic environment were measured with 
calibrated platinum resistance thermometers. The uncertainty of the BBR shift is 
mostly related to temperature inhomogeneity. The representative temperature and 
its uncertainty are derived from the extreme temperatures found on the apparatus 
(the atomic oven is treated separately12,15) following the procedure described in 
ref. 37 for a rectangular probability distribution. The difference between the BBR 
corrections at LSM and INRIM is caused by different temperatures inside the 
trailer, as this temperature depends slightly on the outside temperature.

Other uncertainties. The uncertainties of servo error, second-order Zeeman shift 
and line pulling are reduced at INRIM by adjustments of experimental parameters, 
which were possible due to the more reliable operation.

H-maser as flywheel. A flywheel oscillator with good stability and high reliability, 
such as an H-maser, can be used to extend the averaging time between a less reliable 
system such as our Sr lattice clock and a Cs primary clock with lower stability24. 
The frequency ratio νSr/νCs was thus determined from the frequency ratios νSr/νH 
and νH/νCs using datasets with different lengths. The noise of the flywheel results in 
different average frequencies for these two intervals, but the additional uncertainty 
can be calculated24 if the noise is well characterized, as it often is for masers. The 
calculation relies on Parseval’s theorem, and uses the noise spectrum of the maser 
together with the Fourier transform of a weighting function that represents the two 
averaging intervals. For the full measurement-related uncertainty, this extrapolation 
uncertainty is combined with the statistical uncertainties of the maser calibration 
by the optical clock and the maser–Cs clock ratio over the extended interval. We 
modelled the maser noise by a superposition of flicker phase noise 6 ×  10−14 τ−1 
(1 ×  10−13 τ−1), white frequency noise 5 ×  10−14 τ−1/2 (4.5 ×  10−14 τ−1/2) and a flicker 
noise 1.7 ×  10−15 (1 ×  10−15) in March (May) 2016, respectively.

Gravity potential determination. To provide an accurate reference for the 
chronometric levelling, a state-of-the-art determination of the gravity (gravitational 

plus centrifugal) potential was performed, targeting the best possible uncertainty 
for each clock site. Spatial variations of the gravity potential are most important; 
corresponding temporal variations (mainly due to solid Earth and ocean tides) are 
below 0.07 m2 s−2 for the potential difference between INRIM and LSM38.

The static (spatially varying) gravity potential or corresponding potential 
differences can be determined by two classical geodetic methods39. The first is 
geometric levelling (together with gravity observations along the levelling path). 
The second (the so-called GNSS/geoid approach) uses GNSS positions (ellipsoidal 
heights) and the results from gravity field modelling, that is, a high-resolution 
(quasi)geoid model based on terrestrial and satellite gravity data. Both methods 
can be formulated in terms of either potential or height quantities. In the following 
discussion, metric units based on heights are generally preferred for simplicity, but 
corresponding potential values can easily be obtained by multiplying the height 
values by an average gravity value (e.g. 9.81 m s–2). Geometric levelling is accurate 
at the millimetre level over short distances40, but as a differential technique it can 
deliver only potential differences and is susceptible to systematic errors, which may 
accumulate to the few-decimetre level over continental distances. On the other 
hand, the GNSS/geoid approach can deliver absolute potential values; in this case 
the uncertainty depends mainly on the quality of the regional (quasi)geoid models, 
but the uncertainty of the GNSS positions also has to be considered.

New gravity measurements were made around the clock sites at INRIM 
and LSM to improve the reliability and uncertainty of the geopotential field 
modelling. These measurements included spot checks of the largely historic 
gravity database (consistency check), and the addition of new observations in 
areas so far void of gravity data (coverage improvement). Separate gravity surveys 
were carried out around INRIM and LSM, resulting in 36 and 123 new gravity 
points, respectively. The gravity surveys included one absolute gravity observation 
at INRIM and another at LSM, while the remaining points were observed with 
relative gravity meters (relative to the established absolute points), with 11 gravity 
points being located inside the Fréjus tunnel. Maps giving an overview of the 
distribution of gravity observations are given on the ITOC project page41.  
These new gravity observations as well as some other gravity updates  
(e.g. for Germany) were integrated into the terrestrial gravity database,  
the starting point being the version used to compute the previous European 
Gravimetric (Quasi)Geoid, EGG200816. A consistency check between the new  
and existing gravity measurements showed no significant differences between  
the two data sets, confirming the quality of the entire database. However,  
a re-evaluation of the combined data-set revealed some old stations with 
obviously wrong positions, mainly located in France; these stations lie offroad 
and show large discrepancies between station and digital elevation model heights, 
and were therefore excluded from the (quasi)geoid computation.

A new (quasi)geoid model, EGG2015, was computed in a similar way to 
the previous EGG2008 model, using the remove–compute–restore procedure 
and the spectral combination approach, combining a global long-wavelength 
satellite gravity model with high-resolution terrestrial gravity and terrain data16. 
In addition to the new gravity measurements, enhancements included the use of 
a fifth-generation GOCE global geopotential model (GOCO05S)42 and a spectral 
weighting scheme adapted to the GOCE model. The largest difference between 
the EGG2015 and EGG2008 input gravity values is about 3.5 ×  10−4 m s−2; for the 
output (quasi)geoid grids the largest difference is about 0.15 m. By far the largest 
differences are around the LSM site; they result from the new observations in areas 
previously void of gravity data and from the removal of gross errors related to some 
points in France with incorrect positions16. However, the maximum (quasi)geoid 
change at the two clock sites was less than 0.03 m. The uncertainty of EGG2015 
was estimated in the same way as for EGG2008, resulting in a standard deviation 
of 2 cm, which holds for areas with a good coverage and quality of the terrestrial 
gravity field data, such as around INRIM (best-case scenario). However, around 
LSM the remaining data gaps in inaccessible areas and the strong spatial gravity 
field variation caused by the high mountains lead to a higher uncertainty  
estimate of about 4 cm.

The final relativistic redshift correction for the INRIM/LSM clock comparison 
was derived by the GNSS/geoid approach, although geometric levelling and 
gravity measurements were used to transfer the gravity potential from the nearest 
GNSS stations to the reference markers adjacent to the clocks at INRIM and 
LSM. The GNSS/geoid approach was chosen because the levelling data for Italy 
are rather old and do not include gravity corrections43, and because the GNSS/
geoid approach is not affected by systematic levelling errors. This resulted in 
a gravity potential difference of 10,029.7(6) m2 s−2 between the two reference 
markers, and 10,032.1(16)m2 s−2 between the actual clock positions at LSM and 
INRIM, respectively. The final uncertainty of the gravity potential difference 
between the reference markers nearest to the two clock positions (about 6 cm in 
terms of height) includes contributions from the (quasi)geoid in the Alpine region 
(approximately 5 cm, neglecting correlations16), the GNSS positions (1–2 cm)  
and the levelling connections (< 1 cm, mainly from the tunnel portal to LSM).  
The larger uncertainty for the actual clock positions is because, for convenience 
and in view of the uncertainty of the chronometric levelling experiment, the  
height differences between the clock locations and the corresponding  
reference markers (less than 10 m apart) were determined using a simple  
spirit level rather than by geodetic levelling.

INRIM–LSM frequency transfer. The remote clock comparison was performed by 
comparing the frequency of a link laser at 1,542.14 nm, sent from INRIM to LSM 
by a telecom optical fibre, with the frequencies of the clocks operated in the two 
locations. Two fibre frequency combs spanned the spectral gaps between the link 
laser and the clock interrogation lasers. The combs employed the transfer oscillator 
principle44, making the measurements of the optical frequency ratios immune to 
the frequency noise of the combs. The frequency of the link laser was stabilized 
using a high-finesse cavity, whose long-term drift is removed by a loose phase-lock 
to a H-maser via a fibre frequency comb. As a result, the beat notes with the combs 
remained within a small frequency interval, facilitating long-term operation and 
reducing potential errors arising from any counter de-synchronization between 
INRIM and LSM17.

The link laser used a multiplexed channel in the telecom fibre. Its path was 
equipped with two dedicated bidirectional erbium-doped fibre amplifiers that allowed 
a phase stable signal to be generated at LSM through the Doppler noise cancellation 
technique17,18. The contribution of fibre frequency transfer to the total fractional 
uncertainty was assessed to be 3 ×  10–19 by looping back the signal from LSM using 
a parallel fibre. The occasional occurrence of cycle slips was detected by redundant 
counting of the beat note at INRIM. At LSM, the signal was regenerated by a diode 
laser phase locked to the incoming radiation with a signal-to-noise ratio greater than 
30 dB at 100 kHz bandwidth; this ensured robust and cycle-slip-free operation.

In addition to the optical reference, a high-quality radiofrequency signal 
was needed at LSM to operate the Sr clock apparatus (frequency shifters and 
counters) and the frequency comb. Given the impossibility of having a GNSS-
disseminated signal in the underground laboratory, a 100 MHz radiofrequency 
signal was delivered there by amplitude modulation of a second 1.5 µ m laser that 
was transmitted through an optical fibre parallel to the first. At LSM, the amplitude 
modulation was detected on a fast photodiode, amplified and regenerated by an 
oven-controlled quartz oscillator at 10 MHz to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. 
The inherent stability of the free-running fibre link is in this case enough to deliver 
the radiofrequency signal with a long-term instability and uncertainty smaller 
than 10-13. This resulting uncertainty contribution to the optical frequency ratio 
measurement is below 1 ×  10–19.

Averaging of the optical frequency ratio data. We made eight different optical 
frequency ratio measurements with a total measurement time of 15 h over a 
period of one week in May 2016 (Fig. 3). The data acquired on different days have 
different statistical and systematic uncertainties. We applied a statistical analysis 
that considers the correlations between the measurements from the different 
systematic shifts where the covariance matrix of the eight daily measurements is 
used to calculate a generalized least squares fit for the average25,45. We regarded 
the systematic uncertainties of the clocks (Table 1) as fully correlated, while the 
statistics related to the measurement duration were uncorrelated.

Absolute frequency of the Sr lattice clock. The chronometric levelling can 
be viewed from an alternative perspective: If we assume that the conventional 
measurement of the gravity potential difference is correct then we can deduce an 
average absolute frequency value of 429,228,004,229,873.13(40) Hz for the Sr lattice 
clock. The accuracy of the absolute frequency measurement achieved with the 
transportable clock is comparable to several recent measurements with laboratory 
systems24,46–61.

Averaging the previously published values gives a frequency of 
429,228,004,229,873.05(05) Hz. Together with the average Yb clock transition 
frequency of 518,295,836,590,863.75(25) Hz derived from other references15,62–66,  
a Yb/Sr frequency ratio of 1.207,507,039,343,337,97(61) can be calculated (Fig. 3).  
This averaging assumes that there are no correlations between the different 
measurements.
