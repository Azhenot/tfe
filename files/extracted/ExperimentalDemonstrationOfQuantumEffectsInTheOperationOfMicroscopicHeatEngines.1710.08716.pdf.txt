The heat engine, a machine that extracts useful work from thermal sources, is one of the

basic theoretical constructs and fundamental applications of classical thermodynamics. The

classical description of a heat engine does not include coherence in its microscopic degrees of

freedom. By contrast, a quantum heat engine might possess coherence between its internal

states. Although the Carnot efficiency cannot be surpassed1–3, and coherence can be per-

formance degrading in certain conditions4–9, it was recently predicted that even when using

only thermal resources, internal coherence can enable a quantum heat engine to produce

more power than any classical heat engine using the same resources10,11. Such a power boost

therefore constitutes a quantum thermodynamic signature. It has also been shown that the

presence of coherence results in the thermodynamic equivalence of different quantum heat

engine types10,12, an effect with no classical counterpart. Microscopic heat machines have

been recently implemented with trapped ions13,14, and proposals for heat machines using

superconducting circuits15,16 and optomechanics17,18 have been made. When operated with

standard thermal baths, however, the machines implemented so far have not demonstrated

any inherently quantum feature in their thermodynamic quantities. Here we implement two

types of quantum heat engines by use of an ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond,

and experimentally demonstrate both the coherence power boost and the equivalence of dif-

ferent heat-engine types. This constitutes the first observation of quantum thermodynamic

signatures in heat machines.

A quantum heat engine consists of a microscopic system, or an ensemble of such systems,

whose internal state can be a coherent superposition of energy states. The engine cycle consists

of a sequence of operations (strokes), which include the interaction of the system (or part thereof)

either with a thermal bath (cold or hot), or with an external classical/semi-classical field respon-

sible for work extraction. Interactions with the thermal baths act to change the populations of the

energy states of the heat engine incoherently, in contrast to the field, which changes the popula-

tions coherently. Fig. 1 schematically presents three basic quantum heat-engine types: continuous,

two-stroke and four-stroke, which differ by the ordering of the different strokes. Of these types,

the four-stroke engine bears the strongest resemblance to macroscopic classical engines such as

the Otto engine. It can be described (classically) by a two level system undergoing a four part

cycle, illustrated in the top panel of Fig. 1a, consisting of alternating couplings to the hot and cold

baths, interspersed with couplings to the work reservoir, whose effect is to change the spacing

between the levels. It can be shown that this dynamics is equivalent to classical swap operations

in a multilevel system10 (multilevel embedding), as shown in the middle panel of Fig. 1a (taking

U = swap). In a quantum heat engine, the operator U can be any unitary transformation, allowing

for the generation of coherence between the two lower levels during the application of the exter-

nal field. It is coherence generated in this manner that enables quantum heat engines to exhibit

non-classical behaviour and so underlies the results in this paper. Note that no non-thermal energy

sources such as squeezed baths19–21, or externally injected coherence22–24 are required. A general

four-stroke cycle is schematically illustrated in the bottom panel of Fig. 1a. One can simplify the

cycle structure of the engine by combining the distinct hot and cold strokes into a single thermal

stroke, obtaining a two-stroke engine (Fig. 1b). Reducing the complexity of the engine operation

even further, one obtains the continuous engine, implemented by simply coupling the system to

both thermal baths and the external field continuously (Fig. 1c).

FIG. 1: Quantum heat engine schematics. a, An example of a four-stroke engine. Top: The

classical case of two levels with a variable energy gap. Population is transferred by thermal cou-

plings to a cold bath (blue) and a hot bath (red). Coherence has no role in this case. Middle: A

generalization by embedding the operation into three constant levels with general unitary trans-

formations performed on the lowest two levels, and the cold (hot) bath couplings on the top two

(upper most and lower most) levels. A swap operation (a π-pulse) would correspond to the classi-

cal case of the top panel. Bottom: schematic description. The gray rectangles represent the unitary

(work-extracting) operations, while the orange (light blue) rectangle represents coupling to a hot

(cold) thermal bath. The horizontal dimension represents time, while the vertical represents cou-

pling rate. The area of each rectangle is the stroke action (in units of ~). b, The two-stroke engine.

Top: three-level embedding. Bottom: Schematic description. c, Schematic description of the con-

tinuous engine. All the three examples presented here have the same coherent and thermal actions

per cycle. In this work we experimentally implement the continuous and two-stroke engines.

The coherence-related improvement in work and power output of a quantum heat engine, con-

stituting a quantum thermal signature (QTS), can be understood as follows: when the coherence

produced by the field during the work stroke is not completely erased during the thermal stroke, the

work output, proportional to the population change during the work stroke, would be proportional

to Cτw, where C is the surviving coherence and τw is the duration of the work stroke. In con-

trast, for a fully stochastic engine, where no coherence survives the thermal stroke, the population

4



change is only due to the coherence produced within the same work stroke, and the work output

is therefore quadratic in τw. For a fixed duty cycle d = τw/τcyc, where τcyc is the cycle time, the

average power of a stochastic engine is therefore linear in τcyc, while that of a quantum engine is

constant. Thus, for τcyc → 0, the power of a stochastic engine vanishes, while that of a quantum

engine does not. Note that this picture10 holds only when the engine action is significantly less

than ~. The action of a periodic quantum heat engine is formally defined as the operator norm of

the generator of motion integrated over the cycle10. For a two-stroke quantum heat engine (See

Fig. 1b) the action is simply given by s = ~ [Ωd+ γth (1− d)] τcyc, where Ω is the Rabi frequency,

proportional to the amplitude of the external field, and γth is the total coupling rate to the heat baths

(including both population transfer and pure dephasing). Thus, for the action to be small enough,

both Ω and γth should be much lower than the repetition rate of the engine.

In this small-action regime we also observe the predicted quantum heat machine equivalence

(QHME)10: the three basic quantum heat engine types (four-stroke, two-stroke and continuous) all

show the same performance per cycle. This effect takes place since in time-symmetric cycles, the

strokes commute up to second order in the action. Therefore, for small actions, the order of the

strokes does not matter.

The system we use in order to experimentally demonstrate QTS and QHME is an ensemble of

negatively charged nitrogen vacancy (NV−) centres in diamond25. The NV− centre is an atomic-

like system that exhibits several features desirable for this purpose. First, its ground state contains

three spin states, | − 1〉, |0〉, and | + 1〉, that maintain coherence even at room temperature, and

can coherently interact with a microwave (MW) field, that can serve as the work reservoir. Sec-

ond, after optical excitation, the system decays back into the ground-state manifold both by direct,

spin-preserving, optical de-excitation (fluorescence), and by spin-dependent non-radiative chan-

nels, through a meta-stable spin-singlet state |0′〉. The system therefore tends to a steady state with

a population difference between the different spin components of the ground state. The dynam-

ics of this process is equivalent to that produced by heat bath coupling [see the Supplementary

Information (SI)]. Finally, the fluorescent decay channel provides a direct means to measure the

populations within the ground-state manifold. As spin is preserved during the optical excitation,

but the non-radiative decay is spin-dependent, the fluorescence intensity is also spin dependent.

The power output of the engine, related to the change in population within the ground-state mani-

5



fold, can thus be deduced from the change in fluorescence intensity upon introduction of the MW

field. This technique, known as optically detected magnetic resonance25, provides a significant

advantage over direct measurement of microwave amplification, especially when working in the

small action regime.

lower intermediate singlet states of the NV− under axial magnetic field. Optical excitation (green

upward arrows) and inter-system crossing (orange downward arrows) transfer population from the

| ± 1〉 states to the |0〉 state through the upper |0′〉 state. The widths of the arrows represent the

transition rates. b, Steady state populations emulate the equilibrium populations due to coupling

of |0〉 and |0′〉 (| ± 1〉 and |0′〉) to a cold (hot) bath. c, Work, in the form of stimulated emission of

MW radiation, can be extracted by resonantly driving of the |+ 1〉 ↔ |0〉 transition. Note that the

| − 1〉 state does not contribute to the work extraction.

The specific experimental scheme we use is presented in Fig. 2. Under an axial magnetic field

of 0.2 T, the state | + 1〉 is lowered below the state |0〉 by the Zeeman interaction, as shown in

Fig. 2a. It is possible to excite the |+ 1〉 ↔ |0〉 transition with a MW field without exciting the

| − 1〉 ↔ |0〉 transition, due to the difference in their resonance frequencies. As shown in Fig. 2b,

optical excitation and subsequent non-radiative decay through |0′〉 result in population inversion

between |+ 1〉 and |0〉. This enables the extraction of work, in the form of stimulated emission

of MW radiation, upon resonant MW driving of the |+ 1〉 ↔ |0〉 transition (Fig. 2c). Indeed, this

specific system has been recently considered for the production of a chip-scale, room-temperature

maser26,27. The thermal interaction, induced by laser excitation, and the coupling to the work

6



reservoir, resulting from resonant MW driving, can either be interlaced or both be on continuously,

which correspondingly implements either a two-stroke engine or a continuous engine.

FIG. 3: Quantum heat machine equivalence (QHME) of two-stroke and continuous engine

types. The data points present the power output of the two-stroke engine as a function of the

action per cycle (varied by changing the cycle time), for a variety of peak Rabi frequencies. The

continuous output powers (together with their uncertainty) are indicated by the shaded regions.

The theory predictions for the continuous (two-stroke) engine are given by the dotted (solid) line.

It can be seen that, for each Rabi frequency, the output of the two-stroke engine has the continuous

engine output as its zero action asymptote.

It can be shown (see SI), that the average output power of the engine (per NV− centre) is

proportional to the relative average change in the fluorescence intensity upon MW driving, 〈P 〉 =

κ(Γ)~ω10 〈∆F 〉〈F0〉 , where 〈∆F 〉 is the MW-induced change in the average fluorescence intensity, 〈F0〉

is the average fluorescence intensity in the absence of MW driving, ~ω10 is the energy of a MW

photon emitted in the transition between the two lower ground states, and κ(Γ) is a rate which,

for a fixed duty-cycle, depends only on the optical excitation rate, Γ. In Fig. 3, the power output

of the heat engine, working in two-stroke mode, is presented as a function of the engine action

per cycle, varied by changing the cycle time, for a thermal bath coupling rate of γth = 0.41 ±

0.02 MHz and several values of the peak Rabi frequency (symbols). The duty cycle was fixed

at d = 1/3. In addition, Fig. 3 shows the output of the continuous engine (shaded area with

width signifying the measurement error. See SI), with the same mean Rabi frequencies and optical

7



pumping rates as for the two-stroke engine. The convergence in performance constitute the first

experimental verification of QHME. The theoretical predictions for the output power of the two-

stroke (continuous) engine are presented in Fig. 3 by the solid (dashed) lines (see SI).

In order to measure a QTS in a quantum heat engine, we first determine an upper power bound

for a fully stochastic engine, which is equivalent to the quantum engine in all respects (energy

levels, coupling rates and stroke durations), bar the presence of coherence at the end of the thermal

stroke. Since the power of a fully stochastic engine is constrained to lie below this bound, any

measured output exceeding the bound is indicative of quantum effects. For the case of a two-

stroke engine, it can be shown that the stochastic bound is given in the small action regime by10

Pstoch ≤ 14~ω10d
2Ω2τcyc (see SI). Fig. 4a presents the measured power output of the two-stroke

engine vs. the action per cycle (varied by changing the cycle time), for Ω = 1.6± 0.05 Mrad/s,

γth = 0.41 ± 0.02 MHz, and d = 1/3, along with the corresponding stochastic bound (blue line).

It is clearly seen that for the smallest action applied (dashed frame, enlarged in the inset), the

bound is violated by 2.4 standard deviations, corresponding to a p value of 0.0082 (see SI). This

constitutes a clear QTS.

We also study the work output as the coherence of the system is reduced. Fig. 4b presents

the work per cycle in the two-stroke engine, where the work stroke duration is fixed at 10 ns, the

Rabi frequency is fixed at 1.6 MRad/s, and the thermal stroke contains a fixed population-transfer

action, but is of variable duration. The total action per cycle excluding pure dephasing is fixed at

0.05~. Thus, by changing the length of the work stroke, only the pure-dephasing related action

is increased, due mostly to inhomogeneous dephasing (T ∗2 ∼ 75 ns), enabling the examination of

the dependence of the output work on the coherence of the system. The insets in Fig. 4b show

schemes of this cycle for short and long thermal strokes. It is clearly seen that the output work per

cycle decreases as the thermal stroke duration is increased, and drops below the stochastic bound

(blue line). The bound, taking into account experimental imperfections, increases slightly at long

thermal strokes. The slight discrepancy between theory and measurement for long thermal strokes

might be attributed either to homogeneous dephasing or to charging effects, both neglected in the

present theory (see SI). These measurements clearly demonstrate that coherence in microscopic

heat engines can be performance enhancing.

power is four standard deviations above the stochastic bound. b, Work output vs. decoherence.

The work per cycle of the two-stroke engine is presented vs. the thermal stroke duration (in units of

adjusted to keep the population-transfer-related thermal action constant. The insets schematically

depict cycles with a short (left) and a long (right) thermal stroke. The measured work output

decreases due to the increased decoherence during the longer thermal strokes, to well below the

stochastic bound.

In conclusion, we have used an ensemble of NV− centres in diamond for implementing different

types of quantum heat engines. We have used these to demonstrate the equivalence of the power

output of two different engine types, continuous and two-stroke, for small actions. Additionally,

we have shown that, for very small actions, the engines produce more power than their classical

counterparts, significantly exceeding the stochastic power bound. These measurements constitute

the first observation of quantum thermodynamic effects in heat machines. We hope that this work

will motivate further research along at least three lines: 1) Demonstration of quantum effects in

other physical realisations of heat machines such as superconducting circuits15,16 and ion traps13,14.

2) Theoretical search of quantum thermal signatures in heat machines based on other quantum

agents such as entanglement28 and quantum discord. 3) Application to the design and development

of novel devices such as room-temperature masers26,27. We further hope that this work will be of

interest to other research areas concerned with the role of quantum coherence in the enhancement

of work extraction by microscopic heat engines, such as the study of photosynthesis29 and the

development of solar cells.

S1. SAMPLE PREPARATION

A type Ib high-pressure-high-temperature 3×3×0.5 mm, (100) diamond slab (Element-Six)

with an initial nitrogen concentration of ∼200 ppm was electron irradiated (1018 cm−2) and then

annealed (950◦C, 2.5 hours), to form a dense (∼1018 cm−3) ensemble of NV− centres. The ori-

entations of the centres are randomly distributed between all the 〈111〉 directions. However, the

microwave (MW) driving is resonant only with the centres oriented parallel to the magnetic field,

and thus only these centres (∼25% of all centres) produce the work.

S2. THE EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

The experimental system is schematically presented in Fig. S1(a). The diamond sample was

placed between two permanent magnets aligned along the [111] direction. A solid-state continuous-

wave laser at 532 nm was focused inside the diamond sample to a spot of (nominally) 2.2 µm

in diameter by a long-working-distance objective lens (NA=0.29). An acousto-optic modulator

(AOM) was used for the intensity modulation of the laser-light reaching the sample. In addition, an

AC magnetic field was applied to the sample by a broad-band MW strip-line waveguide embedded

in the sample holder. Just below the sample, the strip-line was narrowed down to a width of

300 µm, in order for the applied field to be both strong enough and uniform across the active

volume. A photograph of the sample on the MW waveguide is presented in Fig. S1(b). A fast

MW switch (MS) between the MW generator and the MW amplifier was used for the amplitude

modulation of the applied MWs. The MS and the AOM had switching times of 1.5 ns and 12 ns,

respectively, and were both simultaneously driven at ∼MHz rates by a fast function generator.

The fluorescence emitted from the diamond was collected by the objective lens and was imaged

with a ×10 magnification on a single-mode optical fibre. This confocal geometry ensures the

collection of light only from the central part of the laser spot, where the optical excitation rate is

maximal and approximately uniform. The collected light was then detected by an avalanche photo

diode operating in the linear regime.

FIG. S1: Experimental setup. (a) Schematic description. The fast function generator, driving the

AOM and the MW switch, allows for the implementation of the two-stroke engine. Using slow

amplitude modulation of the MW and lock-in detection allows for direct measurement of the net

change in fluorescence induced by the operation of the engine. (b) A photograph showing the

diamond sample on the MW waveguide between the two magnets. The diamond is glowing red

while the green illumination is on.

To efficiently detect the change in fluorescence due to the operation of the engine, that is, due to

the MW driving, lock-in detection was used, where the output of the MW generator was amplitude-

modulated by a ∼100 Hz square wave, much slower than the repetition rates of the engine, and a

13



lock-in amplifier was locked to this slow modulation.

S3. SPECTROSCOPY AND CALIBRATIONS

First, the distance between the magnets, as well as their mean position with respect to the

sample were adjusted, such that the resonance frequency was 2π · 2600 MHz. During this process,

we observed an anti-crossing between |0〉 and |−1〉. The angle of the magnetic field was adjusted

to minimise the gap at the anti-crossing point, from which we were able to infer the field angle

relative to the NV axis. In our case, the angle was determined to be 0.6◦. The transition was found

to be inhomogeneously broadened with minimal full-width at half maximum of 2π · (7± 0.7)

MHz, determined by a Gaussian fit. This implies a maximal ensemble coherence time (1/e) of

75 ± 7.5 ns. This was also confirmed by directly measuring the decoherence time using Ramsay

interferometry, which yielded a similar result. Then, by measuring the change in fluorescence as a

function of the MW pulse length, the Rabi-frequency was measured for different MW intensities.

It was found that the ratio between the Rabi frequency and the square root of the applied MW

power (after the amplifier) was 2π · (244± 2) kHz/
√

mW. The maximum MW power available

after the amplifier was 3000 mW.

To determine the dependence of the optical excitation rate, Γ, on the laser power in our set-up,

we scanned the laser power whilst measuring the total fluorescence. As can be seen in Fig. S2, one

obtains a curve which is linear for small laser powers, but then deviates from linear dependence.

We used a rate equation model (see Sec. S4 below) to fit to the data using the ratio between the laser

power and Γ as a fitting parameter (together with the overall coefficient for the fluorescence). All

the other parameters are known from previous, independent measurements30. The obtained ratio

between Γ and the laser power measured before the objective lens was r = 436±25 kHz/mW. Note

that this number depends on the position in the sample of the focus of the beam, most probably

due to absorption in the sample. The maximum optical power available (as measured before the

objective lens) was 4.0 mW. One can compare this result with a simple calculation using the known

absorption cross-section of an NV− centre at 532 nm (ς = (3.1±0.8)×10−17 cm231), r = ς/(AεL),

where A is the laser spot area and εL is the energy of one laser photon. When taking into account

the measured transmission of the objective lens (81%), the Fresnel transmission of the diamond

14



surface (83%), and absorption due to propagation to the middle of the sample through a dense

ensemble of 1018 cm−3 NV− centers (45% transmission), one finds that the focal spot diameter

that yields the measured value of r is 2.7 ± 0.4 µm, in good agreement with the nominal value

of 2.2 µm predicted for a perfect 0.29 NA objective lens. The small discrepancy might be due

to deviations of the exact position of the focal spot or the exact NV− density from the estimated

values used above, or due to aberrations.

FIG. S2: Measured (symbols) and fitted (red line) fluorescence saturation curves. Using the rate

equation model described in Sec. S4, the ratio between the optical excitation rate, Γ, on the light

intensity, Ilaser, was determined. The green line is the tangent at zero laser intensity, showing that

the saturation curve significantly deviates from linear behaviour.

S4. RATE EQUATION MODEL

The spin-state-dependent fluorescence intensity exhibited by NV− centres25 was a part of our

initial motivation for using NV− centres to implement a quantum heat engine. In this section we

show how this property, quantified using a rate equation model, allows us to take all the measure-

ments required for the experiment.

The fluorescence spectrum for the optical excitation intensities used in this experiment con-

tained less than 1% neutral NV (NV0) emission. Furthermore, the charging rates for these excita-

tion intensities are expected to be on the order of ∼ 1µs32, longer than all the other characteristic

times in the system (see below). We therefore neglect optical charging effects (transitions from

15



NV− to NV0 and back), and focus on the dynamics within the NV− states.

The NV− centre consists of a ground state spin triplet, denoted by 3A2, two excited spin triplets,
3E, as well as three intermediate singlets, 1E1,2 and 1A. Of the various interactions that lift the

degeneracy of the sub-levels in the ground and excited states, orbital averaging at room temperature

results in only the axial spin-spin interaction remaining33; this allows us to treat the two excited

state triplets as a single triplet. Additionally, the upper of the three singlets, 1A1, decays directly

into the lower pair, 1E, and has so short a lifetime (< 1 ns) as to allow us to treat the three singlets

as an effective single state . A diagram of this structure, together with the allowed transitions is

shown in Fig. S3.

Let the unitary transformation between the zero field and final energy eigenstate be denoted by

U . The contribution of state |k〉 to the population of the transformed state
∣∣̃i〉 is |Uik|2. Elements

in the transformed rate matrix are then given by a sum over the zero-field rates, weighed by these

factors:

|Uik|2 |Ujl|2Rkl =⇒ R→ |U |2R

where |U |2 denotes the element-wise absolute square. In Fig. S5 (a) we use the matrix obtained

in this manner to calculate the steady state populations of the NV centre as a function of axial

magnetic field strength, for the optical excitation rate used in the experiment. The sharp changes

at ∼ 0.05T and ∼ 0.1T correspond to anti-crossings in the excited and ground states respectively.

Fig. S5 (b) shows the corresponding effective temperatures between the levels (as calculated using

the Boltzmann factor and the known energy splittings between the ground-state triplet and the

metastable singlet of (89± 10) THz35).

The legend refers to the spin state of the level at the magnetic field used in the experiment (indicated

by the vertical dashed line). The ground-singlet (3A2 −1 E) splitting used for the temperature

calculation is (89± 10) THz35.

S5. EMULATION OF A THERMAL ACTION

We now show that the optical cycle in the NV− centre does indeed emulate a thermal interaction.

The intuitive idea is that the optical cycle transfers population from |±1〉 to |0〉 in the ground state

manifold. We will formalise this and show precisely how to obtain the emulated action. The

goal is to find a projection operator, P , on the set of population vectors, together with a reduced

evolution operator L, which satisfies the requirements for a thermal evolution operator, such that

the following condition is satisfied:

eLt (Pσ) = P
(
eMtσ

)
(S2)

This condition is a statement that the thermal operator L should describe the time evolution of

the reduced state, when the evolution of the whole system is generated by the optical matrix M .

The approach we take is to treat our system as an effective 4 level system, consisting of the ground

states together with the singlet, σred = [ g0 , g1 , g−1 , s ], which is described by the projection,

P =

0 1 0 0 0 0 0

0 0 1 0 0 0 0

0 0 0 0 0 0 1

 .

This is a justifiable choice if we can find the operator L which satisfies the requirements for a

thermal operator (Lij ≥ 0 for i 6= j, Lij ≤ 0 for i = j, and Lij ≤ Lji for i > j ) and Eq. S2 to a

good approximation. This will be done through an eigen-analysis of the matrix M. Using Eq. S1,

it can be shown that M is given by,

M =

−Γ I3×3 γ I3×3 u

Γ I3×3 − (γ I3×3 + V ) 03×1
01×3 v −

∑3
i=1 ui

 ,
where V is a diagonal matrix with the elements of v on its diagonal.

Finding the eigenvectors of M as a function of Γ is not feasible analytically, so instead we use

perturbation theory. Ordinarily one might wish to expand about Γ = 0, however, this brings about

the difficulty of dealing with the degeneracy in the ground state, which is not lifted by the first order

20



corrections of degenerate perturbation theory. Instead we take the perturbative expansion about a

value nearer the range that we use in the experiment, specifically Γ = 0.5 MHz. The zeroth order

eigenvalues are given (in units of MHz) by,

λ(0) = [ 0.0 , −0.15 , −0.22 , −1.84 , −74.28 , −119.47 , −119.48 ]

We can split these eigenvectors (and their eigenvalues) into two groups as follows: the first four

eigenvectors are those which describe the changes in the 3 ground states and the singlet and for

which the components corresponding to the excited states are at least an order of magnitude smaller

than the other components; the other three eigenvectors have large components corresponding to

the excited state triplets. This partitioning also splits the eigenvalues according to their magnitude,

with the last three at least an order of magnitude greater than the first four. Note too that, if we

restrict our attention to the ground state triplet together with the singlet, then the first four form

a linearly independent set spanning these states. Therefore, if the system has little population in

its excited states, the coefficients of the final three eigenvectors will be correspondingly small and

we can write such a state in terms of the first set of eigenvectors to a good approximation. By

considering the first and second order perturbative corrections, it can be shown that this is true for

all Γ used in the experiment (|∆Γ| ≤ 0.5 MHz, where ∆Γ ≡ Γ− 0.5 MHz). We now return to the

problem of finding L. Consider Eq. S2 – note that this condition holds if the following holds:

[LP − PM ]σ = 0

It is clearly not possible to find a L which satisfies this for all possible states σ; however given

that the first four eigenstates span the possible states of our system to a good approximation,

21



we instead require that it holds on the subspace spanned by these states. We therefore require

[LP − PM ]σi = 0 and so [L− λiI] (Pσi) = 0 for i = 1, 2, 3, 4, where σi (λi) is the ith eigenvec-

tor (eigenvalue) of M . So we see that the condition can be satisfied exactly if we require that L

would have eigenvectors {Pσi | i = 1, 2, 3, 4}with corresponding eigenvalues {λi | i = 1, 2, 3, 4}.

Since there are four eigenvector/eigenvalue pairs, this completely determines L. Performing the

calculation one finds,

L (Γ) = L0 + ∆ΓL1 +O
(
∆Γ2

)
,

where,

L0 =

The operator L generated in this way is very close to being population conserving for small Γ,

but not exactly so, since some population can be transferred to the excited state manifold. Thus we

simply calculate L as above, and then manually impose population conservation, modifying it by

the minimal amount required to obtain the thermal evolution L that we seek.

We now consider what thermal reservoirs and couplings this matrix corresponds to. First notice

that all the couplings are between the ground states and the singlet, with no couplings between

states within the ground state triplet. Also, because the energy difference between the ground state

manifold and the singlet is much greater than the differences within the ground state manifold, we

can treat the effective temperature and coupling between the |±1〉 states and the singlet as being the

same. Further, by examining the ratios of the rates, we see that the effective temperature between

the singlet and |0〉 is less than that between the singlet and |±1〉. So we are left with the picture in

Fig. S6.

To demonstrate that this is a valid description, consider Fig. S8, which contains a plot of

‖[LP − PM ]σ0‖ as a function of evolution time and Γ, for a starting state σ0 with equal pop-

ulations in each of the ground and singlet states and ≈ 0.5% in the excited state manifold.

FIG. S8: Difference in state evolution when using the full optical cycle as opposed to the effective

thermal interaction. The horizontal (vertical) axis shows the evolution time (optical excitation

rate). The scale is the percentage difference in total population.

We can see that the difference between the two descriptions remains below 0.5% for the range

of Γ under consideration. We can further consider how the performance of the engine (see Sec. S6)

compares when described by the full optical matrix as opposed to the emulated thermal interaction.

This is shown in Fig. S9, and here too, the differences are very small within the parameter space

used in the experiment.

S6. ENGINE PERFORMANCE CALCULATIONS

The evolution of the engine in contact with thermal reservoirs and an external field is governed

by the Lindblad equation36–38,

~∂tρ = −i [HI , ρ ] +
∑
k

AkρA
†
k −

1

2

{
A†kAk, ρ

}
,

where HI is the interaction Hamiltonian which generates unitary evolution, and Ak describes the

interaction with thermal baths. We can cast this into matrix operator form by vectorising the density

matrix, ρ→ |ρ〉.

~∂t |ρ〉 = H |ρ〉 ≡ (−iHw + L) |ρ〉 ,

Hw results from HI and is Hermitian, and L results from the remaining terms and is non-

Hermitian. This formalism is known as the Liouville space (or superoperator) formalism. We

can write L = Lcoh ⊕ Lpop, where Lpop (coh) is the restriction of L to the population (coherence)

subspace. In our case, we can either take Lpop to be the full rate matrix M , or the effective thermal

operator L derived in the previous section. We only have to consider the coherences ρ01 and ρ10

(as the MW field only couples to the 0↔ 1 transition), so that Lcoh = −Γ I2×2. The restriction of

Hw to the basis {ρ01, ρ10, ρ00, ρ11}, is given by,

Hw (Ω, δ) =


−2δ 0 −Ω Ω

−Ω Ω 0 0

Ω −Ω 0 0

 ,

where Ω is the Rabi frequency, and δ is the detuning of the MW radiation from resonance (resulting

from the inhomogeneously broadened ensemble) .

Let | ρ0(δ)〉 be the steady state for a given detuning. It is given by the normalised zero eigenstate

of the unitary evolution operator for a full two-stroke cycle,

U = e−iτthH2e−iτwH1 ,

25



where H1 = Hw(Ω, δ), H2 = iL(Γ) + Hw (0, δ), τw is the work stroke duration, and τth is the

thermal stroke duration. The work produced is then simply given by,

W (δ) = 〈H0| e−iH1tw − I | ρ0 (δ)〉 ,

where |H0〉 is the vectorised system Hamiltonian (H0 = diag [0, ω10, ω12] and vectorising is

achieved by reorganising the elements of H0 into a column vector) and we have used the identity,

〈O〉 = Tr (Oρ) = 〈O |ρ〉. The total average output power from the ensemble is then found by

integrating this over the inhomogeneous distribution, N (δ), and dividing by the cycle time, τcyc,

〈P 〉 = 1
τcyc

∫
dδ W (δ)N (δ).

The detuning distribution was deduced using a Gaussian fit to the measured MW spectrum.

In the above treatment we neglected homogeneous dephasing. The main source of such a pro-

cess in dense NV ensembles is spin-spin interactions between NV centres (and other paramagnetic

impurities)39. Its timescale is given by39, T2 ≈ 1/αn, where α = µ0g2sµ2B/4π~ and n is the density

of NV centres. Substituting n = 1018cm−3 gives T2 ≈ 2 µs, which is greater than the longest cycle

time used in this work (180 ns) and the inhomogeneous dephasing time due to the inhomogeneous

energy distribution N (δ) (75 ns), allowing us to safely neglect it.

S7. DERIVATION OF THE STOCHASTIC BOUND

The existence of a stochastic bound was derived in Ref. 10. Here we will present a brief

overview of this derivation, together with a description of how the bound was calculated for our

case. Such a bound must be independent of the state of a system and should also have no depen-

dence on coherences in the system. As above we start by considering the work produced in a single

cycle of the engine; however now with the coherences eliminated at the beginning and end of the

cycle,

W = 〈H0| D
(
e−iHwtw − I

)
D | ρ0〉 ,

where D is a projection onto the population subspace (physically it represents a complete dephas-

ing operation), and we include the detuning implicitly. It can be shown10 that when one expands

26



this expression for small actions, s� ~, one is left with,

W =
τ 2w
8
〈H0|H2w | ρpop〉+O

[

,

where τw is the work stroke duration, and | ρpop〉 ≡ D | ρ0〉. At this point we can simply use the

known form of our Hamiltonian to show that,

S8. LINKING THE FLUORESCENCE TO THE ENGINE WORK OUTPUT

As before, let σ be the column vector whose elements represent the populations in the various

levels and let M be the optical matrix. Then given some rate, R(t), at which population is trans-

ferred from the |0〉 to the |1〉 ground states, due to the microwave field, the equation describing the

system is,

∂tσ = Mσ +R(t)ν, (S3)

where ν = (−1 1 0 · · · 0 0)T . The rate R is the quantity we wish to determine from the experimen-

tally measured fluorescence. We proceed by considering how the inhomogeneous solution differs

from the homogeneous solution (physically the difference between MW driving and no driving).

Let Φ(t) be the fundamental matrix solution to the homogeneous version of Eq. S3 (that is, a

matrix which satisfies (∂t −M)Φ = 0). Then it can be checked that the following is a solution to

27



the inhomogeneous equation S3,

σ(t) = Φ(t, 0)σ0 +

∫ t
0

dτ Φ(t, τ)R(τ)ν, (S4)

where Φ(t, τ) = Φ(t)Φ(τ)−1. Once past the transient period, one can take R(t) to be periodic with

the same period, τcyc, as that of M(t), as the microwaves are pulsed at the same rate as the laser

pulses. This follows quite generally from Floquet theory and physical considerations. To proceed

we need to find the state at the start of the cycle, σ0 , during this steady state operation. Using the

periodicity of the solution we have,

σ0 = σ(τcyc) = Φ(τcyc, 0)σ0 +

∫ τcyc
0

dτ Φ(τcyc, τ)R(τ)ν,

and therefore,

[I− Φ(τcyc, 0)]σ0 =
∫ τcyc

0

dτΦ(τcyc, τ)R(τ)ν. (S5)

We would like to solve for σ0, however the matrix on the left hand side is singular. Note that

Φ(τcyc) is diagonalisable [it has an inverse: Φ(−τcyc)], which allows us to write (I− Φ(τcyc)) =

UDU−1, where D is diagonal. We define the pseudo-inverse, (I− Φ(τcyc))− = UD−U † , where

the diagonal matrix D− is given by:

D−ii =

1/Dii if Dii 6= 00 otherwise
Let A = (I− Φ(τcyc))−. A solution to Eq. S5 is then given by:

σ̃0 = A
∫ τcyc

0

dτ Φ(τcyc, τ)R(τ)ν.

The full space of solutions to Eq. S3 is then generated by αρ0 + σ̃0 for α ∈ R, where ρ0 is the

(unique) eigenvector of Φ(τcyc) with eigenvalue 1. We now show that
∑

j [σ̃0]j = 0 : Suppose {ρi}

are the eigenvectors of Φ(τcyc) with corresponding eigenvalues {λi}. Then by virtue of Φ(τcyc)

being population preserving we have,

∑

[Φ(τcyc)ρi]j = λi

[ρi]j =

which implies

[ρi]j = 0 for i ≥ 1. Then given a vector ω,
∑

j ωj = 0 =⇒ ω ∈

span (ρ1, . . . , ρn). It is also clear that Im (A) ⊆ span (ρ1, . . . , ρn). The unique normalised so-

lution, σ0, to Eq. S5 is therefore simply obtained by setting α = 1 (assuming we have normalised

ρ0). Substituting this back into Eq. S4, we have,

σ(t) = Φ(t, 0)ρ0 + Φ(t, 0) A
∫ τcyc

0

dτ R(τ)Φ(τcyc, τ)~ν +

dτ R(τ) Φ(t, τ)ν

∫ τcyc

0

dτ R(τ)Φ(τcyc, τ)~ν +

∫ t
0

dτ Φ(t, τ)R(τ)ν,

where ρ(t) = Φ(t, 0)ρ0 is the state evolution when R = 0. We define the excited state population

projector to be the vector ΩE = (0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0) , so that the fluorescence rate, F (t), from a state

σ(t) is proportional to ΩE · σ(t), where ζ is the radiative decay rate. Denote the time dependent

fluorescence in the presence of MW driving by F (t) and denote the fluorescence in the absence of

MW driving by F0(t). Further define,

g(t, τ) = ΩE · Φ(t, 0) A Φ(τcyc, τ) · ν and f(t, τ) = ΩE · Φ(t, τ) · ν.

We can then write,[

Experimentally, we only measure the change in the average fluorescence, 〈∆F 〉, so we must

where H(τ) =

duration and optical pumping rate,H is constant to a good approximation (for the maximum stroke

duration and optical intensity used in the experiment, the relative change of H over the interval is

∼ 4× 10−4). This allows us to write,

experiment. The error (one standard deviation) in the value of κ, estimated using the Monte-Carlo

S9. UNCERTAINTY ANALYSIS

In examining expression S7 it is apparent that there are a number of contributions to the uncer-

tainty in the final value of the power, 〈P 〉. There is measurement variation in the value 〈∆F 〉 from

one measurement to the next, due to detector shot noise. The mean and standard error were simply

calculated from a sample of individual measurements. The value for κ depends on the parameters

listed in table S1, together with the value calculated for Γ, which itself depends on the former

parameters. We use a Monte-Carlo simulation to propagate the uncertainties in these parameters,

and the calculated uncertainty for Γ, to a final uncertainty in κ. The error in the value for 〈F0〉

was determined to be negligible (relative error < 1%) relative to the other errors and therefore

disregarded. Finally we also need to account for uncertainty in the value for the bound. This stems

principally from the uncertainty in the value for the Rabi frequency.

The quantity of interest is the certainty with which we can demonstrate Pmeasured−Pbound > 0.

This requires that we use a one sided normal distribution. The null hypothesis is Pmeasured −

Pbound ≤ 0, whilst the alternative hypothesis is that the measured power breaks the stochastic

bound. In our case the test statistics for the null outcome is t = 2.4, which corresponds to a p-

value of 0.0082. Thus we can discard our null hypothesis and adopt the alternative hypothesis, to

a significance of < 1%.
