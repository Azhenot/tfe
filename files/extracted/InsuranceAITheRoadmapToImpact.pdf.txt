Insurance Nexus in association with CCA Global Partners explores 
how AI will impact the insurance industry

Insurance Artificial Intelligence: The Journey towards efficiency and 
customer engagement 

It’s hard not to use the language of science fiction when talking about Artificial 
Intelligence (AI). Machines that can read information, act, learn, adapt and create 
feel alien, far away from our experiences today. 

But it is a fact that AI – of a kind – is already in use in the insurance industry today. 
As early as 2015, Tata Consultancy Services put the average investment in AI per 
insurer that year at $124m1.

What insurers are investing in today is arguably not AI but its foundations. “Today, 
AI is in a development stage. It is the very practical use of technology for the 
simplification and automation of processes, leveraging some defined rules around 
the overall business,” explains George Hansen, Claims Actuary, General Insurance, 
Zurich Insurance. 

Insurers believe AI has the potential to transform their business model, delivering 
cost efficiencies, generating new product lines and improving customer engage-
ment. Like any sector-wide transformation, it is an iterative process and one that 
sees some players better able to adapt than others.

“There are some organizations in insurance that will be more ready for AI than 
others and it’s the ones with the ability to harness data and leverage skilled 
engineers, programmers and automated platforms” said Imir Arifi, Imir Arifi, senior 
director, business solution consulting, Health Care Service Corporation.

In this paper we look at the type of insurance capabilities AI is most likely to influ-
ence in the near future and how insurers can prepare for it today. 

AI and insurance 2020: Two speed insurance 

Experts agree that in the interim we are likely to see a two-speed insurance 
landscape as the old meets the new. For the insurance customer, the most obvious 
example of this will be new types of insurance product.

Technology is making customers’ environments ‘smarter’. Homes are less suscep-
tible to fire, flood and theft because of smart monitoring devices. Cars are driven 
more safely and are less likely to break down because of preventative maintenance. 
Even health is proactively managed using apps and wearables to encourage active 
lifestyles and monitor vitals as an early warning system. 

“In the property space, we are beginning to see two distinct books of business. One 
will require claims solutions for all the advancements the industry has seen so far 
– with respect to smart home technology. By defaults, the other book will center 
on those figuratively ‘ignorant’ properties. The pace of smart home construction

will make smart insurance statistically meaningful by 2030 and by 2050 it will 
be responsible for radical change and ensure that virtually all insurable physical 
property will have the DNA of the smart home,” states Gregory Johnson, Senior Vice 
President, CCA Global, Strategic Partners Group.

AI and Insurance 2020: Finding beauty in the data

Pattern recognition is and will continue to be one of the major benefits of AI. 
Already helpful in identifying fraud risks, it is going to prove increasingly valuable in 
managing insurer exposure. 

“We’re already looking at AI in some of our high severity books. We run those 
through the AI model to look at the notes that are in there, looking for combinations 
and connections that the claims handlers are putting in, identifying high exposures 
and then putting team leaders on it to make sure they proactively address those 
cases,” Hansen reveals. “We identify through the history of a claim, starting at FNOL, 
flagging anything with potential for business interruption and that kicks off the 
forensic accounting unit, who then work to quantify and limit the exposure.”

The ability to find the ‘unknown unknowns’ in the data allows insurers to refine 
their offerings. It’s a win-win for insurer and insured. The risk to the company is 
reduced as more factors can be weighted and the customer is given coverage that 
more accurately reflects their need. 

AI and insurance 2020: The rise of the machines? 

There is natural concern among both customers and the insurance workforce that 
people will be replaced wholesale by machines. Not only is this unlikely in the short 
term, but most executives believe this will never be fully realized. That’s not to say 
automation won’t reshape the employee landscape: 

“How far you can automate comes down to where insurers use human interven-
tion to add value. But even then, the issue is to define what it is to ‘add value’. That 
becomes broader and broader as AI becomes more sophisticated. In the foresee-
able future we will have AI intervention in a lot of customer contact processes. You 
either won’t need as many people, and people who are there will need to handle 
the more complex tasks,” explains Hansen. 

“A significant amount of our business processes will be automated – with an ability 
to handle exceptions where customization needs to occur. But in general, many of 
our processes have the perfect infrastructure to move into AI – it’s all logic driven 
decision criteria on structured data sets,” explains Matt Marino, AVP, Operational 
Effectiveness, Unum.

One such example would be in first notification of loss (FNOL): “You want it as fast 
as possible and get approvals in for everything that can be done automatically. 
That’s good for customers and good for the business. Simplifying workstreams and 
zero touch operations are the opportunities in AI that come to mind,” Marino adds.

“Simplify processes as much as possible,” Hansen advises. “Streamline mundane 
activities that don’t add value to that process. If a system can quickly validate a

simple claim and give the customer a cheque, that’s certainly a benefit in getting 
them swiftly back to their pre-loss state. 

AI and insurance 2020: Intelligent prospecting

AI is all about making intelligent connections in data. While this is already under-
way in certain parts of underwriting and claims processing, it has seen limited use 
in customer acquisition. That’s a big missed opportunity, according to Johnson: 

“The big deficit that’s not being addressed is better using AI and InsurTech to make 
the connection between insurers’ existing book of business and the next gener-
ation. With advances at the organisational level, how do we use technology to 
better ensure that the grandchildren of our existing clients become our customers.” 

Carriers focus a great deal on the recommendation potential of a positive claims 
experience, but fail to segment those word of mouth targets by their relationship 
to the insured. AI gives them visibility on that information.

Making connections is more than just finding customers with closer ties to the 
carrier brand than the general population. Building relationships with customer’s 
family members would be considered by many to be a value-added proposition:

“This is about taking a leadership role in crafting solutions for customers that they 
don’t yet know they’re going to face. Undiagnosed dementia for example. How do 
we leverage technology to help manage the claims experience when the children 
and grandchildren may not know that their parents aren’t quite right? Such 
solutions are not just about risk mitigation for the insurer, it’s about the right thing 
to do,” Johnson says.

Johnson believes insurers don’t look far enough into the future to anticipate attri-
tion and that using AI to make those connections is the answer. “Life insurers are 
just as guilty of failing to forward plan. Because there is no meaningful relationship 
or connectivity between the generations, there are a vast amount of annuity and 
life insurance disbursements that don’t make their way back to those insurers.” 

AI and insurance 2020: Limitations

There will be elements of the insurance landscape that will prove too involved even 
for AI to manage, Hansen adds. “There are processes outside the insurance world. 
Litigation means it takes time to settle complex claims. Workers Compensation 
insurance has to take into account subjective assessments including things such as 
maximum medical improvement. It isn’t around facts, it is up to individuals to make 
the correct assessment. AI can help but it can’t take over.”

The use of the word ‘involved’ is deliberate. It implies many moving parts, incom-
patible situations and data sets but most importantly, it implies a constantly chang-
ing landscape presenting new challenges.

We’re delving into semantics because often people refer to some situations as 
being too complex for AI to manage. AI is incredibly proficient – it eats complex-
ity for breakfast. However, Arifi warns: “Complexity is not the challenge. The real

challenge and where you want to be careful is repeatability. Machines can zero in 
on complexity. We can build complex neural networks. But if the case occurs rarely, 
if it’s something that hasn’t been observed, AI isn’t possible. It can’t make one-off 
strategic decisions.”

Quite simply, if you don’t have the data to train the algorithm, you can’t use AI.

These are just some areas where AI is likely to impact the insurance sector in the 
near future of 2020 and beyond. To capitalize on these advances, carriers need to 
start taking action today, if they haven’t already. From legacy systems to corporate 
culture, there are still many challenges to address. 

Preparing for AI – making the business case

One of the biggest challenges is taking the first step. There is an understanding 
that investment must be made:

“In large companies, the vast majority of AI or machine learning projects hugely 
impact the bottom line and customer experience. Certainly, the industry is begin-
ning to understand that AI and advanced analytics will be part of the next indus-
trial revolution,” Arifi states, adding: “Even if the use cases are not as detailed as we’d 
like them to be, that’s the way society is going.”

But understanding intellectually that there will be some need to adapt to AI-based 
processes by 2020 and beyond is one thing, figuring out how to make it a reality 
in each organization is quite another. It is the difficulty in linking a vague sense of 
future need with current insurance pressures that is challenging executives who 
want to see AI in action today. 

“One of the biggest stumbling blocks has been defining what the objectives of AI 
are,” claims Hansen. “You cannot build an AI model without defining the problem 
we are trying to solve.”

For many, that starting point for investing in AI has been its ability to create cost 
efficiencies. Insurance executives are spending to save: “Ironically, we started with 
looking at how we minimise our IT investments in legacy systems, and we are start-
ing with how we can apply robotics to deliver better customer experiences with less 
IT investment and time required. We have been looking at the lower expense options 
to replace old systems. There is significant opportunity here,” Marino explains. 

Preparing for AI – developing the culture

The general belief has been that insurance leadership teams understand and 
support the integration of AI. They also know that business transformation is neces-
sary. However, Johnson feels progress may not be as significant as we are led to 
believe. It seems that buy-in may only be skin deep:

“There’s a lot of lip service. There are pockets of really robust executive thinking 
around InsurTech and AI but it’s also incredibly siloed. There also is a tremendous 
level of protectionism in place.”

Unum’s Marino agrees: “A lot of the work AI and automation is suited for is preva-
lent within insurance companies. Being able to partner with the business leaders 
to demonstrate how AI and automation help an organization is critical. It’s going 
to come down to getting the business to test and learn to discover that there is 
more science in that process than they would believe.  If we lead these efforts as IT 
driven projects instead of building capabilities with business leaders adoption will 
be slowed significantly.”

Johnson explains that the personal history of senior insurance executives may color 
their view: ““The generation of executives who populate senior leadership today tend 
to have risen through the ranks. They were adjusters and underwriters who worked 
their way up. This will be in sharp contrast to the next generation of claims leaders 
who will have backgrounds and expertise in big data, mathematics and technology.”

He goes on to add: “There’s also a disconnect between the evolution of InsurTech 
and the board and governance community. Their focus is on an already crowded 
dashboard and they haven’t yet been baptised into this brave new world. This 
small but influential group of stakeholders is now being asked to fund technology 
initiatives that will make stark changes to a legacy business largely unchanged 
for a century. The key to quicker adoption is ultimately bringing the governance 
community up to speed.”

“This technology is highly disruptive but the challenges around technology have 
largely been resolved. If you have the drive and the budget you can do it. You 
need executive sponsorship to support engagement because implementation 
takes time and resources. But you also need true believers at the grassroots level 
because they have to be willing and able to do the work. You can’t expect change 
overnight.” Arifi adds. 

Change may not be coming overnight but it is imminent: “We are at a tipping 
point where the pressures on profitability from other parts of the business are 
compelling companies one by one to look harder and more seriously at making 
substantive change. More carriers are being forced, rather than running willingly, 
into strategic AI investments because they’re experiencing other tremors on their 
balance sheet,” Johnson says.

Preparing for AI – hiring and firing

A significant worry for senior leadership is to find the skilled employees that can 
deliver AI seamlessly into the organization. Without knowledge of their own, they 
are looking to experts to drive the function internally. The challenge is, that in this 
brave new world, no-one really knows what today’s crack AI team looks like: 

“We haven’t nailed down how our team supporting these new capabilities will be 
formed. As we look at building out new capabilities we will evaluate talent that is 
available in the workforce as well as strategic partnerships.” Marino explains.

Johnson refers to the notion that there might be a single AI leader who can 
embody all the competencies with respect to technology and science, strategy 
and finance and the customer experience ethos as a ‘unicorn’. In other words, such 
a person doesn’t exist.

“You don’t try to hire someone with all the skill sets but you do make sure you 
bring those skill sets to the table,” Hansen elaborates. “Data scientists have skill sets 
used across a lot of different industries that are transferable to AI in insurance.”

“The real limit is the availability of talent,” Arifi admits. “You need someone with at 
least three core competencies. Someone who understands the data, understands 
the business, and understands coding but also understands the mathematics of 
what you’re trying to do. Getting that in a single person is pretty rare.”

It looks as though ‘AI by committee’ is the way forward: “You need leadership 
to understand how integrating AI has been successfully completed in another 
industry or organization. Then you need to set up teams and ingrain standards for 
the projects they’re charged with. It’s unavoidable. The whole field is so new that 
everyone needs some training. There are no turnkey solutions.”

In Zurich, Hansen says, they have built a ‘team of all the talents’. “The data scientists 
are in house and have a lot of experience; some have actuarial experience, others 
come from an AI background. A lot of companies struggle to build that. Talent is 
available and it doesn’t have to come from the insurance industry.”

“But,” he adds, “you can’t just throw a problem at that team. You need to get the 
business knowledge, have subject matter experts and senior management all 
together identifying the problem that needs to be solved and figuring out how it 
fits into the business flow.”

Preparing for AI – looking for leaders 

It would appear that the insurance sector is on a relentless shift towards an 
AI-driven universe and the only question is how far or fast they can go with the 
tools they already have. 

There will be no ‘overnight sensation’ as organizations build or buy in capability; 
advancing and enhancing parts of their proposition until the data and strategy is in 
place that takes the industry into a truly ‘intelligent’ future. 

Insurers are getting more comfortable with adopting innovation, but that’s not to 
say they are generally willing to take the first step:

“Progress towards AI is going to be incremental. I’m holding out hope for a couple 
of players to be bold and think about how they’re going to be leaders in this space,” 
Marino suggests.

What is clear is that AI will transform the sector over time and that insurers must find 
ways around the challenges they still face to remain relevant to their customers:

“We don’t have to look very far to see what’s coming in the way the big, established 
players adapt. Within the wealth management space, at the dawn of the roboadvisor 
trend, the establishment laughed at the concept. After all, who was going to trust 
their investments to an algorithm? Fast forward 15 years and the big players have 
either developed proprietary models or acquired them outright. Insurers will go the 
same way across the full spectrum of technology solutions,” Johnson concludes.
