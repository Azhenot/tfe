Regression-based algorithms have shown to be good at denoising Monte Carlo (MC) renderings by leveraging its inexpensive by-products
(e.g., feature buffers). However, when using higher-order models to handle complex cases, these techniques often overfit to noise in the
input. For this reason, supervised learning methods have been proposed that train on a large collection of reference examples, but they use
explicit filters that limit their denoising ability. To address these problems, we propose a novel, supervised learning approach that allows the
filtering kernel to be more complex and general by leveraging a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. In one embodiment of
our framework, the CNN directly predicts the final denoised pixel value as a highly non-linear combination of the input features. In a second
approach, we introduce a novel, kernel-prediction network which uses the CNN to estimate the local weighting kernels used to compute each
denoised pixel from its neighbors. We train and evaluate our networks on production data and observe improvements over state-of-the-art
MC denoisers, showing that our methods generalize well  to a variety of scenes. We conclude by analyzing various components of our
architecture and identify areas of further research in deep learning for MC denoising.
