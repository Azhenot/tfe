he 1919 detection of the apparent 

displacement of background stars 

near the edge of the eclipsed Sun’s 

disk provided one of the first con-

vincing proofs of Einstein’s theory 

of general relativity (1, 2). Almost 

100 years later, Sahu et al. report on page 

1046 of this issue the first measurement 

of the gravitational deflection of starlight 

by a star other than the Sun (3). Using the 

superior angular resolution of the Hubble 

Space Telescope (HST), they measured 

shifts in the apparent position of a distant 

background star as a nearby dense stel-

lar remnant called a white dwarf passed 

almost in front of it in 2014. Because of 

the relative distances involved, the deflec-

tions they observed were about 1000 times 

smaller than those seen in 1919, but also in 

agreement with general relativity theory.

A ray of light from a background source 

passing by a foreground object is bent to-

ward the line of sight by an amount that 

depends on how close they line up in the 

sky, the mass of the foreground object, and 

the relative distances between each object 

and the earthbound observer (see the fig-

ure, top). Because all rays passing the fore-

ground object at the same radial distance 

from the background object are deflected by 

the same amount, this creates an “Einstein 

Ring” around the foreground object that 

brightens the combined light seen by the 

observer. If the two objects are not exactly 

lined up, this ring is asymmetrical, and the 

background object appears to be displaced. 

Einstein envisioned such events in a 1936 

paper published in Science (4), but he felt it 

extremely unlikely that any two stars in the 

sky would ever line up so precisely that such 

an event would be observed.

Because the foreground star observed by 

Sahu et al. was about 400 times brighter than 

the background star, the brightening of their 

combined light was far too small to be detect-

able even with Hubble. However, the appar-

ent displacement in the background star’s 

position, so-called “astrometric lensing,” was 

measurable (see the figure, bottom). The 

more nearly the two objects align, the more 

an apparent displacement occurs in the di-

rection away from the foreground star. In the 

case of the nearby white dwarf, Stein 2051 B, 

this caused the faint background star to ap-

pear to trace out a small ellipse as the white 

dwarf passed by.

A white dwarf star is the collapsed 

remnant of a star that has completed its 

hydrogen-burning life cycle. At least 97% 

of the stars in the sky, including the Sun, 

will become or already are white dwarfs 

(5). Because they are the fossils of all prior 

generations of stars, white dwarfs are key 

to sorting out the history and evolution of 

galaxies such as our own. 

The single most important property of a 

white dwarf star is its mass. The mass of 

Stein 2051 B has been a source of contro-

versy for over 100 years. It has a very distant 

companion star (not involved in the lensing 

event) whose purported orbital motion im-

plies a much lower mass for the white dwarf 

than normal, which, if true, implies an un-

usual composition.

Here lies the importance of Sahu et al.’s 

project. Their astrometric lensing mea-

surements show convincingly that Stein 

2051 B is not an exotic “iron core” white 

dwarf but a rather typical one, with a car-

bon-oxygen core and a normal mass and 

radius, thus resolving the long-standing 

debate over its nature. Their results agree 

very well with Chandrasekhar’s 1930 No-

bel-Prize–winning theoretical relation be-

tween a white dwarf ’s mass and radius (6). 

Even today, this relation is very poorly con-

strained by only three other nearby white 

dwarfs, all of which are in wide binary sys-

tems where masses were obtained from the 

stars’ orbital motion. Now, a completely in-

dependent verification of Chandrasekhar’s 

relation has been achieved from astromet-

ric lensing.

The astrometric lensing approach used 

by Sahu et al. can be used equally well for 

any other nearby stars that happen to pass 

in front of background stars. In the coming 

era of truly massive sky surveys such as the 

Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (7), astron-

omers are bound to observe other similar 

events, despite their rarity.        j

Defect and detect

Incoming parallel light rays from a distant star (solid 
red arrows at right side) are defected by the gravity 
of a nearby foreground star. 
 

 

Astrometric lensing

A nearby white dwarf star approaches from the right.  
Its high gravity causes a background star to appear to 
move in a small loop as the white dwarf passes by on 
fve separate dates (labeled 1 to 5).

Weighing a star with light
As a dense stellar remnant called a white dwarf nearly passes in front of it, the white dwarf’s gravity deflects a 

distant background star’s light. If the alignment is perfect, the background star appears as an “Einstein Ring”; 

if it is not, one side of the ring is brighter and the background star’s position appears to shift.
