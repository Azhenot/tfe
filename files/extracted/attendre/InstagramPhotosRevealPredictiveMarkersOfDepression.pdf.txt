Abstract
Using Instagram data from 166 individuals, we applied machine learning tools to
successfully identify markers of depression. Statistical features were computationally
extracted from 43,950 participant Instagram photos, using color analysis, metadata
components, and algorithmic face detection. Resulting models outperformed
general practitioners’ average unassisted diagnostic success rate for depression.
These results held even when the analysis was restricted to posts made before
depressed individuals were first diagnosed. Human ratings of photo attributes (happy,
sad, etc.) were weaker predictors of depression, and were uncorrelated with
computationally-generated features. These results suggest new avenues for early
screening and detection of mental illness.

1 Introduction
The advent of social media presents a promising new opportunity for early detection and
intervention in psychiatric disorders. Predictive screening methods have successfully an-
alyzed online media to detect a number of harmful health conditions [–]. All of these
studies relied on text analysis, however, and none have yet harnessed the wealth of psycho-
logical data encoded in visual social media, such as photographs posted to Instagram. In
this report, we introduce a methodology for analyzing photographic data from Instagram
to predictively screen for depression.

There is good reason to prioritize research into Instagram analysis for health screening.
Instagram members currently contribute almost  million new posts per day [], and
Instagram’s rate of new users joining has recently outpaced Twitter, YouTube, LinkedIn,
and even Facebook []. A nascent literature on depression and Instagram use has so far
either yielded results that are too general or too labor-intensive to be of practical signifi-
cance for predictive analytics [, ]. In particular, Lup et al. [] only attempted to cor-
relate Instagram usership with depressive symptoms, and Andalibi et al. [] employed a
time-consuming qualitative coding method which the authors acknowledged made it ‘im-
possible to qualitatively analyze’ Instagram data at scale (p.). In our research, we incorpo-
rated an ensemble of computational methods from machine learning, image processing,

and other data-scientific disciplines to extract useful psychological indicators from pho-
tographic data. Our goal was to successfully identify and predict markers of depression in
Instagram users’ posted photographs.

Hypothesis  Instagram posts made by individuals diagnosed with depression can be re-
liably distinguished from posts made by healthy controls, using only measures extracted
computationally from posted photos and associated metadata.

1.1 Photographic markers of depression
Photographs posted to Instagram offer a vast array of features that might be analyzed
for psychological insight. The content of photographs can be coded for any number of
characteristics: Are there people present? Is the setting in nature or indoors? Is it night or
day? Image statistical properties can also be evaluated at a per-pixel level, including values
for average color and brightness. Instagram metadata offers additional information: Did
the photo receive any comments? How many ‘Likes’ did it get? Finally, platform activity
measures, such as usage and posting frequency, may also yield clues as to an Instagram
user’s mental state. We incorporated only a narrow subset of possible features into our
predictive models, motivated in part by prior research into the relationship between mood
and visual preferences.

In studies associating mood, color, and mental health, healthy individuals identified
darker, grayer colors with negative mood, and generally preferred brighter, more vivid
colors [–]. By contrast, depressed individuals were found to prefer darker, grayer col-
ors []. In addition, Barrick, Taylor, & Correa [] found a positive correlation between
self-identification with depression and a tendency to perceive one’s surroundings as gray
or lacking in color. These findings motivated us to include measures of hue, saturation,
and brightness in our analysis. We also tracked the use of Instagram filters, which allow
users to modify the color and tint of a photograph.

Depression is strongly associated with reduced social activity [, ]. As Instagram
is used to share personal experiences, it is reasonable to infer that posted photos with
people in them may capture aspects of a user’s social life. On this premise, we used a face
detection algorithm to analyze Instagram posts for the presence and number of human
faces in each photograph. We also counted the number of comments and likes each post
received as measures of community engagement, and used posting frequency as a metric
for user engagement.

1.2 Early screening applications
Hypothesis  is a necessary first step, as it addresses an unanswered basic question: Is de-
pression detectable in Instagram posts? On finding support for Hypothesis , a natural
question arises: Is depression detectable in Instagram posts, before the date of first diag-
nosis? After receiving a depression diagnosis, individuals may come to identify with their
diagnosis [, ]. Individuals’ self-portrayal on social media may then be influenced by
this identification. It is possible that a successful predictive model, trained on the entirety
of depressed Instagram users’ posting histories, might not actually detect depressive sig-
nals, per se, but rather purposeful content choices intended to convey a depressive condi-
tion. Training a model using only posts made by depressed participants prior to the date
of first diagnosis addresses this potential confounding factor.



Reece and Danforth EPJ Data Science  (2017) 6:15 Page 3 of 12

Hypothesis  Instagram posts made by depressed individuals prior to the date of first
clinical diagnosis can be reliably distinguished from posts made by healthy controls.

If support is found for Hypothesis , this would not only demonstrate a methodological
advance for researchers, but also serve as a proof-of-concept for future healthcare appli-
cations. As such, we benchmarked the accuracy of our model against the ability of general
practitioners to correctly diagnose depression as shown in a meta-analysis by Mitchell,
Vaze, and Rao []. The authors analyzed  studies that evaluated general practitioners’
abilities to correctly diagnose depression in their patients, without assistance from scales,
questionnaires, or other measurement instruments. Out of , patient outcomes in-
cluded across the pooled studies, .% were actually depressed, as evaluated separately
by psychiatrists or validated interview-based measures conducted by researchers. General
practitioners were able to correctly rule out depression in non-depressed patients % of
the time, but only diagnosed depressed patients correctly % of the time. We refer to
these meta-analysis findings [] as a comparison point to evaluate the usefulness of our
models.

A major strength of our proposed models is that their features are generated using en-
tirely computational means - pixel analysis, face detection, and metadata parsing - which
can be done at scale, without additional human input. It seems natural to wonder whether
these machine-extracted features pick up on similar signals that humans might use to iden-
tify mood and psychological condition, or whether they attend to wholly different infor-
mation. A computer may be able to analyze the average saturation value of a million pixels,
but can it pick out a happy selfie from a sad one? Understanding whether machine learning
and human opinion are sensitive to the same indicators of depression may be valuable in-
formation for future research and applications. Furthermore, insight into these issues may
help to frame our results in the larger discussion around human versus machine learning,
which occupies a central role in the contemporary academic landscape.

To address these questions, we solicited human assessments of the Instagram pho-
tographs we collected. We asked new participants to evaluate photos on four simple met-
rics: happiness, sadness, interestingness, and likability. These ratings categories were in-
tended to capture human impressions that were both intuitive and quantifiable, and which
had some relationship to established depression indicators. DSM-IV [] criteria for Ma-
jor Depressive Disorder includes feeling sad as a primary criterion, so sadness (and its
anti-correlate, happiness) seemed obvious candidates as ratings categories. Epstein et al.
[] found depressed individuals ‘had difficulty reconciling a self-image as an ‘outgoing
likeable person’’, which prompted likability as an informative metric. We hypothesized
that human raters should find photographs posted by depressed individuals to be sadder,
less happy, and less likable, on average. Finally, we considered interestingness as a novel
factor, without a clear directional hypothesis.

Hypothesis a Human ratings of Instagram posts on common semantic categories can
distinguish between posts made by depressed and healthy individuals.

Hypothesis b Human ratings are positively correlated with computationally-extracted
features.



Reece and Danforth EPJ Data Science  (2017) 6:15 Page 4 of 12

If human and machinea predictors show positive correlation, we can infer that each set of
features tracks similar signals of depression. In this case, the strength of the human model
simply suggests whether it is better or worse than the machine model. On the other hand,
if machine and human features show little or no correlation, then regardless of human
model performance, we would know that the machine features are capable of screening
for depression, but use different information signals than what are captured by the affective
ratings categories.

2 Method
2.1 Data Collection
Data collection was crowdsourced using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk) crowdwork
platform. Separate surveys were created for depressed and healthy individuals. In the de-
pressed survey, participants were invited to complete a survey that involved passing a
series of inclusion criteria, responding to a standardized clinical depression survey, an-
swering questions related to demographics and history of depression, and sharing social
media history. We used the CES-D (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale)
questionnaire to screen participant depression levels []. CES-D assessment quality has
been demonstrated as on-par with other depression inventories, including the Beck De-
pression Inventory and the Kellner Symptom Questionnaire [, ]. Healthy participants
were screened to ensure no history of depression and active Instagram use. See Additional
file  for actual survey text.

Qualified participants were asked to share their Instagram usernames and history. An
app embedded in the survey allowed participants to securely log into their Instagram ac-
counts and agree to share their data.b Upon securing consent, we made a one-time col-
lection of participants’ entire Instagram posting history. In total we collected , pho-
tographs from  Instagram users,  of whom had a history of depression.

We asked a different set of MTurk crowdworkers to rate the Instagram photographs col-
lected. This new task asked participants to rate a random selection of  photos from the
data we collected. Raters were asked to judge how interesting, likable, happy, and sad each
photo seemed, on a continuous - scale. Each photo was rated by at least three differ-
ent raters, and ratings were averaged across raters. Raters were not informed that photos
were from Instagram, nor were they given any information about the study participants
who provided the photos, including mental health status. Each ratings category showed
good inter-rater agreement.

Only a subset of participant Instagram photos were rated (N = ,). We limited rat-
ings data to a subset because this task was time-consuming for crowdworkers, and so
proved a costly form of data collection. For the depressed sample, ratings were only made
for photos posted within a year in either direction of the date of first depression diagnosis.
Within this subset, for each user the nearest  posts prior to the diagnosis date were
rated. For the control population, the most recent  photos from each user’s date of
participation in this study were rated.

2.2 Participant safety and privacy
Data privacy was a concern for this study. Strict anonymity was nearly impossible to guar-
antee to participants, given that usernames and personal photographs posted to Instagram
often contain identifiable features. We made sure participants were informed of the risks

of being personally identified, and assured them that no data with personal identifiers,
including usernames, would be made public or published in any format.

2.3 Improving data quality
We employed several quality assurance measures in our data collection process to reduce
noisy and unreliable data. Our surveys were only visible to MTurk crowdworkers who had
completed at least  previous tasks with a minimum % approval rating; MTurk work-
ers with this level of experience and approval rating have been found to provide reliable,
valid survey responses []. We also restricted access to only American IP addresses, as
MTurk data collected from outside the United States are generally of poorer quality [].
All participants were only permitted to take the survey once.

We excluded participants who had successfully completed our survey, but who had a
lifetime total of fewer than five Instagram posts. We also excluded participants with CES-
D scores of  or higher. Studies have indicated that a CES-D score of  represents an
optimal cutoff for identifying clinically relevant depression across a range of age groups
and circumstances [, ].

2.4 Feature extraction
Several different types of information were extracted from the collected Instagram data.
We used total posts per user, per day, as a measure of user activity. We gauged commu-
nity reaction by counting the number of comments and ‘likes’ each posted photograph
received. Face detection software was used to determine whether or not a photograph
contained a human face, as well as count the total number of faces in each photo, as a
proxy measure for participants’ social activity levels. Pixel-level averages were computed
for Hue, Saturation, and Value (HSV), three color properties commonly used in image
analysis. Hue describes an image’s coloring on the light spectrum (ranging from red to
blue/purple). Lower hue values indicate more red, and higher hue values indicate more
blue. Saturation refers to the vividness of an image. Low saturation makes an image ap-
pear grey and faded. Value refers to image brightness. Lower brightness scores indicate a
darker image. See Figure  for a comparison of high and low HSV values. We also checked
metadata to assess whether an Instagram-provided filter was applied to alter the appear-
ance of a photograph. Collectively, these measures served as the feature set in our primary



Reece and Danforth EPJ Data Science  (2017) 6:15 Page 6 of 12

model. For the separate model fit on ratings data, we used only the four ratings categories
(happy, sad, likable, interesting) as predictors.

2.5 Units of observation
In determining the best time span for this analysis, we encountered a difficult question:
When and for how long does depression occur? A diagnosis of depression does not indi-
cate the persistence of a depressive state for every moment of every day, and to conduct
analysis using an individual’s entire posting history as a single unit of observation is there-
fore rather specious. At the other extreme, to take each individual photograph as units of
observation runs the risk of being too granular. De Choudhury et al. [] looked at all of a
given user’s posts in a single day, and aggregated those data into per-person, per-day units
of observation. We adopted this precedent of ‘user-days’ as a unit of analysis.c

2.6 Statistical framework
We used Bayesian logistic regression with uninformative priors to determine the strength
of individual predictors. Two separate models were trained. The All-data model used all
collected data to address Hypothesis . The Pre-diagnosis model used all data collected
from healthy participants, but only pre-diagnosis data from depressed participants, to
address Hypothesis . We also fit an ‘intercept-only’ model, in which all predictors are
zero-weighted to simulate a model under a null hypothesis. Bayes factors were used to
assess model fit. Details on Bayesian estimation, model optimization and selection, and
diagnostic checks are available in Additional file .

We also employed a suite of supervised machine learning algorithms to estimate the pre-
dictive capacity of our models. We report prediction results only from the best-performing
algorithm, a -tree Random Forests classifier. As an informal benchmark for com-
parison, we present general practitioners’ unassisted diagnostic accuracy as reported in
Mitchell, Vaze, and Rao [].d

In evaluating binary classification accuracy, a simple proportion of correct classifications
is often inappropriate. In cases where data exhibit a class imbalance, i.e. more healthy
than depressed observations (or vice-versa), reporting naive accuracy can be misleading.
(A classification accuracy of % seems excellent until it is revealed that % of the data
modeled belong to a single class.) Additionally, naive accuracy scores are opaque to the
specific strengths and weaknesses of a binary classifier. Instead, we report precision, recall,
specificity, negative predictive value, and F scores for fuller context. Definitions for these
terms are as follows:

Precision TP/(TP + FP)
Recall TP/(TP + FN)
Specificity TN/(TN + FP)
Negative Predictive Value TN/(TN + FN)
F  ∗ (Precision ∗ Recall)/(Precision + Recall)
TP = True Positive FP = False Positive TN = True Negative FN = False Negative

3 Results
Both All-data and Pre-diagnosis models were decisively superior to a null model (Kall =
.; Kpre = .), see page  of the Additional file  for a description of K. All-data pre-
dictors were significant with % probability. Pre-diagnosis and All-data confidence lev-
els were largely identical, with two exceptions: Pre-diagnosis Brightness decreased to %

confidence, and Pre-diagnosis posting frequency dropped to % confidence, suggesting
a null predictive value in the latter case.

Increased hue, along with decreased brightness and saturation, predicted target class
observations. This means that photos posted by depressed individuals tended to be bluer,
darker, and grayer (see Figure ). The more comments Instagram posts received, the more
likely they were posted by depressed participants, but the opposite was true for likes re-
ceived. In the All-data model, higher posting frequency was also associated with depres-
sion. Depressed participants were more likely to post photos with faces, but had a lower
average face count per photograph than healthy participants. Finally, depressed partici-
pants were less likely to apply Instagram filters to their posted photos. Figure  shows the
magnitude and direction of regression coefficients for both models.

General practitioners’ diagnostic accuracy from (Mitchell et al. [24]) is included for comparison. See see Additional file 1 for
definitions of accuracy metrics.

A closer look at filter usage in depressed versus healthy participants provided additional
texture. Instagram filters were used differently by target and control groups (χall = .,
p = . × –; χpre = ., p = . × –). In particular, depressed participants
were less likely than healthy controls to use any filters at all. When depressed participants
did employ filters, they most disproportionately favored the ‘Inkwell’ filter, which converts
color photographs to black-and-white images (see Figure ). Conversely, healthy partici-
pants most disproportionately favored the Valencia filter, which lightens the tint of photos.
Examples of filtered photographs are provided in Additional file .

Our best All-data machine learning classifier, averaged over five randomized iterations,
improved over Mitchell et al. [] general practitioner accuracy on most metrics (see Ta-
ble ). Compared with Mitchell et al. [] results, the All-data model was less conservative
(lower specificity) but better able to positively identify target class observations (higher re-
call). Given  observations, our model correctly identified % of all target class cases
(n = ), with a relatively low number of false alarms (n = ) and misses (n = ).

Pre-diagnosis predictions showed improvement over the Mitchell et al. [] benchmark
on precision and specificity. The Pre-diagnosis model found only about a third of actual
target class observations, but it was correct most of the time when it did predict a target
class label. By comparison, although Mitchell et al. [] general practitioners discovered
more true cases of depression, they were more likely than not to misdiagnose healthy sub-
jects as depressed.

Out of the four predictors used in the human ratings model (happiness, sadness, likabil-
ity, interestingness), only the sadness and happiness ratings were significant predictors of
depression. Depressed participants’ photos were more likely to be sadder and less happy
than those of healthy participants. Ratings assessments generally showed strong patterns
of correlation with one another, but exhibited extremely low correlation with computa-
tional features. The modest positive correlation of human-rated happiness with the pres-
ence and number of faces in a photograph was the only exception to this trend. Correlation
matrices for all models are available in Additional file .

4 Discussion
The present study employed computational machine learning techniques to screen for
depression using photographs posted to Instagram. Our results supported Hypothesis ,
that markers of depression are observable in Instagram user behavior, and Hypothesis ,
that these depressive signals are detectable in posts made even before the date of first
diagnosis. Human ratings proved capable of distinguishing between Instagram posts made
by depressed and healthy individuals (Hypothesis a), but showed little or no correlation
with most computational features (Hypothesis b). Our findings establish that visual social



Reece and Danforth EPJ Data Science  (2017) 6:15 Page 9 of 12

media data are amenable to analysis of affect using scalable, computational methods. One
avenue for future research might integrate textual analysis of Instagram posts’ comments,
captions, and tags. Considering the early success of textual analysis in detecting various
health and psychological signals on social media [, , ], the modeling of textual and
visual features together could well prove superior to either medium on its own.

Our model showed considerable improvement over the ability of unassisted general
practitioners to correctly diagnose depression. On average, more than half of general prac-
titioners’ depression diagnoses were false positives []. By comparison, the majority of
both All-data and Pre-diagnosis depression classifications were correct. As false diagnoses
are costly for both healthcare programs and individuals, this improvement is noteworthy.
Health care providers may be able to improve quality of care and better identify individ-
uals in need of treatment based on the simple, low-cost methods outlined in this report.
Given that mental health services are unavailable or underfunded in many countries [],
this computational approach, requiring only patients’ digital consent to share their social
media histories, may open avenues to care which are currently difficult or impossible to
provide.

On the other hand, our Pre-diagnosis prediction engine was rather conservative, and
tended to classify most observations as healthy. There is good reason to believe, however,
that the Pre-diagnosis prediction accuracy observed represents a lower bound on perfor-
mance. Ideally, we would have used the All-data classifier to evaluate the Pre-diagnosis
data, as that model was trained on a much larger dataset. The fact that the Pre-diagnosis
data was a subset of the full dataset meant that applying the All-data model to Pre-
diagnosis observations would have artificially inflated accuracy, due to information leak-
age between training and test data. Instead, we trained a new classifier for Pre-diagnosis,
using training and test partitions contained within the Pre-diagnosis data, which left the
Pre-diagnosis model with considerably fewer data points to train on. As a result, it is likely
that Pre-diagnosis accuracy scores understate the technique’s true capacity.

Regarding the strength of specific predictive features, some results match common per-
ceptions regarding the effects of depression on behavior. Photos posted to Instagram by
depressed individuals were more likely to be bluer, grayer, and darker, and receive fewer
likes. Depressed Instagram users in our sample had an outsized preference for filtering
out all color from posted photos, and showed an aversion to artificially lightening pho-
tos, compared to non-depressed controls. These results matched well with the literature
linking depression and a preference for darker, bluer, and monochromatic colors [–].
Depressed users were more likely to post photos with faces, but they tended to post fewer
faces per photo. This finding may be an oblique indicator that depressed users interact in
smaller social settings, or at least choose only to share experiences of this sort on social
media. This would be in accordance with previous findings that reduced social interactiv-
ity is an indicator of depression [, , ].

Other, seemingly obvious, relationships failed to emerge. For example, when people
rated a photograph as sad, that impression was unrelated to how blue, dark, or gray that
photo was. Both ‘sad’ and ‘blue, dark, and gray’ were strong predictors of depression, how-
ever, and semantically these descriptions seem like they should match well with one an-
other, as well as link to depression. These divergences may serve as the basis for a number
of future research inquiries into the relationship between depressive behavior and com-
mon perceptions of depression.



Reece and Danforth EPJ Data Science  (2017) 6:15 Page 10 of 12

A general limitation to these findings concerns the non-specific use of the term ‘depres-
sion’ in the data collection process. We acknowledge that depression describes a general
clinical status, and is frequently comorbid with other conditions. It is possible that a spe-
cific diagnostic class is responsible for driving the observed results, and future research
should fine-tune questionnaires to acquire specific diagnostic information. Additionally,
it is possible that our results are in some way specific to individuals who received clin-
ical diagnoses. Current perspectives on depression treatment indicate that people who
are ‘well-informed and psychologically minded, experience typical symptoms of depres-
sion and little stigma, and have confidence in the effectiveness of treatment, few concerns
about side effects, adequate social support, and high self-efficacy’ seek out mental health
services []. The intersection of these qualities with typical Instagram user demographics
suggests caution in making broad inferences, based on our findings.

As these methods provide a tool for inferring personal information about individuals,
two points of caution should be considered. First, data privacy and ethical research prac-
tices are of particular concern, given recent admissions that individuals’ social media data
were experimentally manipulated or exposed without permission [, ]. It is perhaps
reflective of a current general skepticism towards social media research that, of the 
individuals who began our survey,  (%) refused to share their Instagram data, even
after we provided numerous privacy guarantees. Future research should prioritize estab-
lishing confidence among experimental participants that their data will remain secure and
private. Second, data trends often change over time, leading socio-technical models of this
sort to degrade without frequent calibration []. The findings reported here should not
be taken as enduring facts, but rather as promising leads upon which to build and refine
subsequent models.

Paired with a commensurate focus on upholding data privacy and ethical analytics, the
present work may serve as a blueprint for effective mental health screening in an increas-
ingly digitalized society. More generally, these findings support the notion that major
changes in individual psychology are transmitted in social media use, and can be iden-
tified via computational methods.

Endnotes
a The term ‘machine’ (e.g. ‘machine predictors’, ‘machine model’) is used as shorthand for the computational feature

extraction process we employed. Significant human biases informed this process, however, as the initial selection of
features for extraction involved entirely human decision-making.

b Data collection source code is available on Github, see Additional file 1.
c Occasionally, when reporting results we refer to ‘observations’ as ‘participants’, e.g. ‘depressed participants received

fewer likes’. It would be more correct to use the phrase ‘photographic data aggregated by participant-user-days’
instead of ‘participants’. We chose to sacrifice a degree of technical correctness for the sake of clarity.

d Comparing point estimates of accuracy metrics is not a statistically robust means of model comparison. However,
we felt it was more meaningful to frame our findings in a realistic context, rather than to benchmark against a naive
statistical model that simply predicted the majority class for all observations.
