Nanoscale metal inclusions in or on solid-state dielectrics are an integral part of modern

electrocatalysis, optoelectronics, capacitors, metamaterials and memory devices. The

properties of these composite systems strongly depend on the size, dispersion of the

inclusions and their chemical stability, and are usually considered constant. Here we

demonstrate that nanoscale inclusions (for example, clusters) in dielectrics dynamically

change their shape, size and position upon applied electric field. Through systematic in situ

transmission electron microscopy studies, we show that fundamental electrochemical

processes can lead to universally observed nucleation and growth of metal clusters, even for

inert metals like platinum. The clusters exhibit diverse dynamic behaviours governed by

kinetic factors including ion mobility and redox rates, leading to different filament growth

modes and structures in memristive devices. These findings reveal the microscopic origin

behind resistive switching, and also provide general guidance for the design of novel devices

involving electronics and ionics.

T
he ability to control and manipulate metal inclusions (for
example, individual metal clusters) inside a solid-state
medium will greatly expand the functions and create new

classes of materials (for example, metamaterials) and devices for
electronic, magnetic, photonic, chemical and optoelectronic
applications1–6. Such abilities have been demonstrated, for
example, with scanning tunneling microscopy tools1. However,
manual manipulation using scanning tunneling microscopy is
slow and inefficient, and not device-friendly compared with
methods such as using local electric fields. Indeed, devices based
on the field-driven migration of metal inclusions (such as resistive
switching or memristive devices)7–9 have attracted broad interest
recently and have shown great potential as a disruptive
technology for a number of applications including nonvolatile
memory10–13, logic14–16 and neuromorphic computing17. In
these devices, the resistive switching is normally attributed to
filament formation caused by the movement of metal inclusions
in the insulating dielectric film9,10,18–20. Attempts to
microscopically study the filament growth processes have been
carried out using scanning probe microscopy15,21 and high-
resolution transmission electron microscopy19,20,22–24 techniques.
For example, a recent experiment reveals different filament
growth modes20 and shows that filament formation can be
achieved in the form of metal nanoclusters. However, a critical
question was raised regarding the fundamental, microscopic
origin of the growth and migration of the nanoclusters inside
dielectrics25, and whether the different and seemingly contradicting
experimental results can be reconciled within the same theoretical
framework.

Here we directly reveal the microscopic origin of the dynamic
growth and migration processes of metal nanoclusters in
dielectrics and show that the field-driven migration is a universal
behaviour, even for inert metals such as Pt. We show the different
migration modes can be explained in the electrochemical model
framework, driven by both thermodynamic and kinetic factors.
Specifically, we show that in conventional insulators the metal
clusters can be treated as bipolar electrodes (BPEs), and can
dissolve from their original locations and nucleate and redeposit
at new positions closer to the counter electrode in a process
driven by the competing electrochemical processes occurring at
the two polarized sides. We show this fundamental process can be
used to explain the diverse filament growth modes observed
experimentally, and predict and verify the growth modes at
different limiting cases, therefore reconciling the different
experimental results obtained earlier within a generalized
theoretical framework10,20,22. By tuning kinetic factors, we
further show different nanocluster dynamics can be observed in
the same device, leading to the transition between different
filament growth modes.

Results
Dynamic migration of metal nanoclusters. In situ transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) studies were first conducted on bulk
samples consisting of individual metal nanoclusters embedded in
the bulk of a dielectric film. This approach enables detailed
analysis and tracking of individual clusters and ensures the
migration occurs inside the bulk of the film. By tracing the
dynamic motion of the same nanocluster under electric field in an
in situ TEM setup for different material systems (Ag, Cu, Pt, Ni),
we successfully revealed fundamental atomic/ionic dynamics that
are universally applicable.

The experimental strategy is illustrated in Fig. 1a–d, using Ag
nanoclusters as an example. An array of Ag nanoclusters was
embedded inside the SiO2 film by annealing a stacked SiO2/Ag/
SiO2 structure with a B1-nm-thin Ag layer. Inert Au electrodes

were then deposited to apply electric fields across the SiO2/Ag/
SiO2 stack (see Methods). SiO2 was selected as the dielectric layer
in this study because it is the most important dielectric material
in the semiconductor industry and is also widely used for other
devices including memristive devices18,26,27. Successive focused
ion beam (FIB) lift-out, patterning, and thinning processes were
subsequently performed to prepare an array of Au/SiO2/Ag
nanoclusters/SiO2/Au devices with individual top electrodes
and shared bottom electrode for cross-sectional TEM studies
(Fig. 1b–d). During in situ TEM analysis, the top Au electrode of
a device is contacted by a movable W probe, whereas the bottom
Au electrode is grounded (Fig. 1d). Figure 1e shows a TEM image
of one of the embedded Ag nanoclusters along its [011] zone axis,
with the corresponding fast Fourier transformation results
displayed in Fig. 1f, which clearly reveal the crystalline face-
centered cubic structure of the Ag cluster.

When an electric field is applied, evolution and migration of
the embedded Ag nanoclusters can be regularly observed, as
shown in Fig. 1g–l (also see Supplementary Movie 1). The
nanoclusters have diameters of B5 nm and the applied voltage
was 3 V corresponding to an electric field of B0.8 MV cm� 1.
Notably, at location 1 (marked by the upper arrow) dynamic
interactions between a pair of Ag nanoclusters were observed. As
shown in Fig. 1g–i, the cluster on the left (upstream in the
direction of the electric field) was gradually dissolved and merged
into another cluster on the right side (downstream), resulting in
an overall movement of Ag clusters along the direction of the
applied electric field. Similarly, clusters 2 (marked by the middle
arrow) and 3 (marked by the lower arrow) were also gradually
dissolved. Cluster 2 disappeared (Fig. 1k) and left a void in the
film as shown in Fig. 1j,k. Additionally, as cluster 3 was dissolved
a new cluster, named cluster 4, emerged nearby, as marked by the
lower circle in Fig. 1k,l.

These behaviours have been repeatedly observed in different
devices. Figure 1m–p shows the interactions between another pair
of Ag nanoclusters, and illustrates the gradual dissolution of
the original cluster upstream and the nucleation and growth
of another cluster downstream. The original Ag cluster was
completely dissolved and left a void behind in the original position
(marked by circle in Fig. 1p, see Supplementary Movie 2), and
effective growth along the field direction was achieved.

The dynamic evolution of metal nanoclusters revealed by
in situ TEM can be consistently explained in the theoretical
framework of electrochemical redox processes in BPEs with
strong influence from kinetic effects. Under an electric field inside
the dielectric, the metal nanoclusters can be treated as
BPEs25,28,29, with an effective cathode (d–) facing the field
direction and an effective anode (dþ ) on the opposite side, as
shown in Fig. 1q. In this model, Agþ ions will be generated from
the anode side of the clusters via electrochemical oxidation
processes. The Agþ ions will drift along the electric field and
become reduced when they reach a cathode (for example, the
cathode side of another Ag cluster downstream). In the current
experimental setup, there is no Ag supply to the first Ag cluster
upstream, so it experiences only net oxidation and thus gradually
dissolves. The created Agþ ions can be reduced and deposit onto
the second nanocluster downstream. If oxidation on the anode
side of the 2nd nanocluster is suppressed (due to, for example,
kinetic limitations discussed later), the 2nd nanocluster will
experience net growth. As a result, the first cluster merges into the
2nd nanocluster downstream, resulting in an effective cluster
displacement along the electric field, as shown in Fig. 1q–s. It is
worthwhile noting that charge neutrality needs to be maintained
in the nanocluster after the generation of Agþ ions. The possible
processes involve reduction of another Agþ ion at the cathode
side of the BPE, escape of the trapped electron, or through

another reaction process (for example, reduction of moisture
or proton27). In addition, the redox and migration processes of a
specific cluster are determined by the local electrochemical and/or
structural environment sensed by the cluster and are affected by
the film inhomogeneity and electric field distribution, so the
cluster dynamics are stochastic in nature. For example, out of the
five Ag clusters shown in Fig. 1g–i, the three marked clusters
migrated to different new locations at different times, while the
other two clusters did not undergo apparent oxidation processes
within the measurement time frame.

We note the formation of the 2nd nanocluster inside the
SiO2 film requires first a nucleation process, that is, the initial

formation of a critical nucleus. This process can be regarded as a
chemical process of formation of stable atomic configuration to
minimize the excess surface energy and allow further growth. The
free enthalpy of nucleation is given by30:

DGðNcÞ ¼ NceDjþFðNcÞþNce ð1Þ
Where Nc is the number of atoms constituting the critical

nucleus; DG is the free enthalpy of nucleation; Dj is the voltage
drop (a part of the applied voltage, depending on the position of
the nucleus); F the surface energy contribution and e is the strain
energy per atom. Dj, F and e will have significant influence on
the nucleation as a function of the particular local chemical,

electrical and mechanical properties of the oxide matrix. As a
result, the nucleation process is spatially selective instead of being
homogenous, as shown in Fig. 1 and Supplementary Movies 1–4.
If nucleation could not proceed, the Agþ ions can reach the Au
counter electrode and become reduced there. This appears to be
the case for cluster 2 in Fig. 1g–l. However, a significant geometric
change may not be observed in this case due to the much larger
volume of the electrode.

These analyses show that kinetic factors (for example, the
interplay between the redox rates at the cathode/anode sides of
the BPE, nucleation rates and ionic migration speed) of the
electrochemical redox reactions and ionic drift strongly influence
the dynamics of the metal nanoclusters. The evolution of the
shape and size of a cluster can be determined by the competition
between the oxidation and reduction rates on the cathode and
anode sides of the BPE, which can be described as

dVi

dt
/ Gired�Giox ð2Þ

where Vi is the volume of cluster i, and Giox (G
i
red) is the oxidation

(reduction) rate for the Ag atoms (ions) on the anode and
cathode sides of cluster i, respectively.

For two neighbouring clusters (i and i� 1) with small distance,
we can approximate the ion exchange as

Gired ¼ Gi� 1ox ð3Þ
accounting for the conservation of the Ag material. In systems
with more clusters interacting electrostatically, the different
growth rates will be affected by the distance between the clusters,
their relative position to each other and their sizes. These factors
account for the electric field strength and the overall evolution of
the system (for example, the conducting filament in a memristive
device20).

In light of the above understandings, the experimental results
that the clusters upstream merge into their counterparts down-
stream, for example, clusters 1 and 3 in Fig. 1g–l and the cluster
in Fig. 1m, can be explained. Figure 1m–p shows simulation
results using equations (2–3) by assuming Giox ¼ 0 for the 2nd
nanocluster (Methods). The simulation confirms the experimen-
tal observations (Fig. 1m–p). Other behaviours can also be
expected from equation (2), as will be elaborated later. As the
electric field is continuously applied, the cluster splitting and
merging processes can be repeated, resulting in an effective
displacement (movement) of the clusters along the electric field
(Fig. 1s) towards the counter electrode. Since SiO2 is an
amorphous insulator rather than a homogeneous electrolyte, the
conditions for ion migration and nucleation are inhomogeneous
and depend strongly on the local microstructure, electric field
distribution, electrochemical environment and presence of
defects, as observed in Fig. 1g–p.

We have extensively studied the behaviours of different metal
systems, including active metals such as Ag and Cu as well as
inert metals such as Ni and Pt. The volume of the source material
was also varied systematically. Among these materials, Ag and Cu
are widely recognized as the material of choice for the formation
of metal filaments and most commonly used in resistive memory
devices9,10,12,18. Compared with Ag, in situ TEM studies on Cu
have shown essentially similar results. As displayed in Fig. 2a–f,
after applying a voltage of 6 V, 3 Cu clusters were found to have
nucleated and grown between the embedded Cu source and the
counter Au electrode (Fig. 2b, Supplementary Movie 3). As the
sizes of the newly formed clusters 1–3 grew larger, these clusters
also became oxidized (Fig. 2c–f), since the polarization strength
of the clusters (P) are proportional to the cluster radius (r),
that is, P¼E � r(cosy� cosl) (where y and l are angles used to
define the position on the cluster surface)25. The electro-

chemical processes of the clusters thus enter a second stage
and Giox4G

i
red applies. While clusters 1 and 2 were gradually

dissolved, cluster 3 underwent another splitting-merging
process and grew into cluster 4 that was even closer to the
counter electrode. The dynamic behaviours of clusters 3 and 4
highlight the rapidly evolving kinetics of the BPEs, including
GioxoGired during initial growth (Fig. 2b), and subsequent
transitions to Giox4G

i
red during the dissolution process

(Fig. 2c–f). Significantly, these processes lead to a step-by-step
movement of the metal inclusions along the electric
field direction, and reveal the microscopic nature of the
formation and dissolution processes of conducting filaments in
dielectrics.

In general, Giox and G
i
red can be impacted by many factors such

as material properties, local electric field, the amount of available
atoms/ions and charge compensation. As a result, complex
electrochemical dynamics are expected, which could in turn lead
to significantly different filament growth behaviours that explain
the contradicting reports in the literature10,20,22,25. For example,
in our experiments, the Pt clusters that were formed after the first
nucleation process (Fig. 2g) were never found to be dissolved
again within the time frame of the in situ experiments, probably
due to the low Giox for the newly formed Pt clusters. In another
case for Ni clusters, persistent reduction of Ni ions (supplied from
the large Ni source) onto the cathode side of an existing Ni cluster
led to a backward growth towards the Ni source, as shown in
Fig. 2i–l (also see Supplementary Movie 4). Since the volume of
the Ni source was hardly changed, the deposition of the Ni ions
leads to a backward connection between the nanocluster BPE and
the Ni source (Fig. 2n). It should be noted that the backward
growth in this case is still different from the conventional
electrochemical metallization (ECM) model10,12,18, as the
reduction process does not initiate from the counter electrode
but instead from a BPE inside the dielectric. As a result, the
filament will form an extension of the anode instead of the
cathode as predicted by the ECM model.

We have investigated dozens of devices based on different
materials, and found it to be universally true that the apparent
movements of metal nanoclusters are always along the direction
of the electric field (Figs 1 and 2). Different electric fields,
however, are required for the migration of different metals within
the measurement time frame of several minutes, as shown in
Fig. 2h for Ag, Cu, Ni and Pt. The dissolution/nucleation of
embedded Ag clusters inside SiO2 was found to be the easiest,
typically requiring an electric field of o1 MV cm� 1, while the
electric field required for Cu movement is slightly higher but
roughly in the same level. In contrast, the more inert Ni and Pt
clusters require much higher electric field of 3–5 MV cm� 1. The
different electric fields required for the cluster migration reflect
the electrochemical activity of the different metals and this
observation explains why Ag and Cu are more suitable for metal
filament-based memristive devices9,10,12,18. In general, the ease of
displacement of nanoclusters shows a tendency to increase as a
function of the polarizability of the half-cell reaction, that is, the
Agþ /Ag redox reaction is typically considered in liquid
electrolytes as ideally non-polarizable, whereas the polarizability
increases in the series Cu-Ni-Pt. Moreover, Ni- and Pt-ions
have higher charge numbers and sizes, and their diffusion in
solids is suppressed in contrary to Ag- and Cu-ions being well
known as one of the most mobile ions in solids.

Filament growth dynamics. The controlled migration of
nanoclusters can be used to design and tune the operations of
novel electric devices. For example, memristive devices are based
on the formation of conductive filaments and the insight gained

from the migration of discrete metal nanoclusters naturally
explains the filament growth dynamics in memristive devices.
Specifically, the different filament growth modes observed
experimentally20,22 can now be reconciled in the same theoretical
framework. In a simplified, qualitative model, the filament growth
dynamics may fall into four different regimes depending on the
kinetic factors. When the ion mobility (m) and the redox rates Gi

are high and homogeneous (case a), the ions can reach the inert
electrode without agglomerating, thus avoiding nucleation within
the insulating film so filament growth initiates from the inert
electrode, and the large amount of ion supply (due to high Gi)
leads to an inverted cone-shaped filament12,18 with its base at the
inert electrode interface, as schematically shown in Fig. 3a. This is
in agreement with the filament growth in conventional ECM
devices, and corresponds to material systems with high ionic
conductivity (that is, large amounts of ions and high ion
mobility). An experimental proof for case a is the in situ TEM
observation on devices based on Cu–GeTe electrolyte22. In
contrast, in the other extreme of low and inhomogeneous m and
low Gi (case b, Fig. 3b), the ions can pile and reach the critical
nucleation conditions inside the dielectric and further filament
growth is fulfilled by cluster displacement via the repeated
splitting-merging processes shown in Fig. 1. An experimental
example is the filament growth in amorphous Si, where
the filament is initiated from the active electrode and grows
towards the inert electrode as discrete nanoclusters20. This case

corresponds to material systems with very low ionic conductivity.
Instead, if the ion mobility is low while the redox rates are high
(case c), nucleation can occur inside the dielectric while large
amounts of atoms can be deposited onto the cathode sides of the
nuclei, leading to gap filling shown in Fig. 3c. This case
corresponds to observations in Fig. 2i–l. After a connection
between the nuclei and the active electrode is made, the process is
repeated thus again leading to an effective forward growth
towards the inert electrode. Finally, if the ion mobility m is high
while the redox rates Gi are low (case d), nucleation only occurs at
the counter electrode but the limited ion supply means reduction
predominately occurs at the edges with high field strengths, thus
leading to branched filament growth towards the active electrode,
as shown in Fig. 3d. This case corresponds to the experimental
observations in sputtered SiO2 films20, whose open structure and
high defect density result in higher m than evaporated SiO2. The
different experimental observations can thus be fully accounted
for in this generalized framework based on fundamental
electrochemical processes. In general, the ion mobility in a
given dielectric m determines the nucleation sites and the
direction of the filament growth, while the redox rates
Gidetermine the ion supply and the geometry of the filament.
By tuning these kinetic factors, different growth modes and
filament geometry can be potentially controlled in a systematic
fashion. In practice, the local m and Gican be affected by
variations in the local defect density, defect energy profile and

local electrochemical potentials so different migration modes may
be observed simultaneously in the same system.

To experimentally verify the theory, we performed in situ TEM
studies in actual resistive memory structures. The devices consist
of a Ag/SiO2/W structure with an evaporated SiO2 film covering a
W probe. Compared with sputtered SiO2, the evaporated SiO2
here has less defects and lower m, therefore this system in general
falls into the low m, low Gi regime. The device was directly formed
inside the TEM column by connecting a high-purity Ag wire with
a movable W probe coated with the SiO2 film (Fig. 4a, Methods).
Representative results for a device with a B40-nm-thick SiO2
film are shown in Fig. 4b–e (also see Supplementary Movie 5).
The first visible filament growth in the SiO2 film was the
appearance of several Ag clusters near the Ag electrode after
B3 min (Fig. 4b). This is in agreement with the nucleation of
metal nanoclusters in Figs 1 and 2. These clusters then behave as
BPEs during subsequent growth. As expected, over time these
clusters move closer to the inert electrode, following the
splitting-merging processes discussed earlier (Fig. 1m–p) and
correspond to case b. Due to the higher concentration of Agþ

ions near the Ag electrode and therefore the higher probability to
overcome the nucleation barrier, more Ag clusters will be
nucleated near the Ag electrode inside SiO2 and the repeated

nucleation and growth leads to the filament shape as observed
Fig. 4d. As predicted for case b, this growth mode leads to a
conically shaped filament (Fig. 4d,e) with its base at the Ag/SiO2
interface and expanding towards the inert electrode. Such growth
direction is in contrast to the conventional ECM growth model
for solid electrolytes10,18 but can be explained by the generalized
framework discussed above. The overall growth of the filament
can be then characterized by the step-by-step movements of
Ag cluster components driven by the electrochemical kinetics,
as illustrated by Fig. 4f–j (more details can be found in
Supplementary Note 1).

Additionally, a feature reminiscent of a void was observed in
the SiO2 film at the interface region in Fig. 4d,e, after large
amounts of Ag atoms have passed through. The void formation is
a clear sign of plastic deformation of the dielectric film due to
increased mechanical stress that was introduced into the SiO2.
Similar voids have also been observed for the cases of discrete
nanoclusters (for example, Fig. 1j–l,p). Apart from facilitating fast
ion diffusion, the voids (channels) provide space for continuous
movement of Ag clusters in a bootstrapping fashion as shown in
Fig. 4d,e. As the existing Ag clusters move away towards the inert
electrode new Ag clusters can move in and fill the void with
reduced strain energy component (equation 1), facilitating the

filament growth towards the inert electrode. The observation of
the void channel formation and the dynamic step-by-step
filament growth processes will be fundamentally important for
the understanding and optimization of memristive device
operations.

Analysing the filament growth dynamics also reveals effects
that can have significant practical implications for device
operations. For example, Fig. 5a shows current–time (I–t)
dependence of a Ag/SiO2/W device with a limited Ag source by
reducing the contact area between the Ag electrode and the SiO2
film. The corresponding dynamic filament growth TEM images
are shown in Fig. 5b–f (also see Supplementary Movie 6). The
device was initially in a high-resistance state and no filament
growth was observed. At B100 s, an abrupt resistive change was
observed corresponding to the formation of conduction chan-
nel(s) inside the electrolyte (the dark region within the SiO2) as
shown in Fig. 5c,d. The filament formation, however, requires the
consumption of the Ag electrode which serves as the Agþ ion
supply. Notably, in Fig. 5a it was found that the current drops
spontaneously after the initial filament formation. Close exam-
ination of the TEM recordings reveals that the current drop was
due to the depletion of the Ag source (the Ag electrode) at the Ag/
SiO2 interface (Fig. 5e,f) leading to the breakage of the contact.
This finding particularly is of critical significance for memristive
device operations as the devices are scaled towards the 10 nm
range. The depletion of electrode is less of a concern for large-
scale devices with a virtually infinite Ag reservoir compared with
the volume needed to form the filament (see Supplementary
Fig. 1, Supplementary Movie 7, Supplementary Note 2). However,
the consumption of the electrode material is no longer negligible
when the device size is pushed close to the scaling limit, for
example, where the electrode size is comparable with the filament
size. For example, Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary
Movie 8 show that when the device size shrinks to 30–40 nm, the
immediate contact to the filament at the Ag electrode/SiO2
interface can be lost after the initial filament growth, even though
overall electrical contact appears to be intact.

The broken electrical contact can be cured by refilling the
gap at the Ag electrode/SiO2 interface when positive voltage
was continuously applied on the Ag electrode (Fig. 5h,i,

Supplementary Movie 9). The surface diffusion of atoms from
the bulk of the Ag electrode into the gap was believed to drive this
process, mediated by inhomogeneous electric field distribution
around the gap31. Figure 5j shows the electric field distribution
through a multiphysics simulation (Methods). A highly
nonuniform electric field distribution is revealed and noticeably
higher electric field intensity is seen in the vicinity of the nanogap,
consistent with the observation that Ag atoms migrate towards
the nano-gap region and refill the gap over time (see
Supplementary Fig. 3, Supplementary Note 3).

Finally, we show that different growth modes can coexist in the
same device when the growth dynamics can be properly tuned, as
shown in Fig. 6. After an initial growth period characterized by
the step-by-step bootstrapping growth mode (Fig. 6b–h, also see
Supplementary Movie 10), the Ag clusters suddenly transformed
into a much larger, dominant filament in Fig. 6i, accompanied by
a significantly increase in current of 41mA (Fig. 6a). Here the
newly formed filament has a much wider base on the W cathode
side and grows backwards towards the Ag electrode, and is much
more solid, implying a transition to the conventional ECM
growth mode shown in Fig. 3a. The structure of the new, solid
filament was analysed using high-resolution transmission electron
microscopy, where (111) planes of elemental Ag were clearly
resolved (Fig. 6j) suggesting the filament corresponds to a
crystalline Ag wire. The transition to the ECM mode (with high m
and Gi) can be explained by the increase of the device
temperature due to the formation of the original filament, leading
to significantly increased m and Gi (refs 18,32). The increase in
Agþ ion mobility means that the ions have a much higher
probability to reach the W cathode instead of piling inside the
oxide through nucleation, as the increased temperature retards
stable nucleus formation33. The combination of these effects
suppresses the step-by-step cluster growth but enhances the rate
of direct Agþ reduction at the W cathode, leading to the
conventional ECM growth.

Discussion
To summarize, we report fundamental electrochemical dynamics
of metal inclusions inside conventional solid-state dielectrics.

The cluster interactions and formation processes are strongly
affected by kinetic factors leading to different shapes and growth
modes of the clusters that can be observed experimentally. Four
types of metal systems and two types of device structures were
studied, and based on these extensive experimental observations,
we suggest a generalized framework governing the electrochemi-
cal dynamics of the metal clusters. The nanoclusters were found
to act as BPEs under electric field, with their dissolution and
nucleation processes mediated by the competing electrochemical
reactions on both sides. By controlling the kinetic factors
including ion mobility and redox rates, different growth modes
can be achieved and verified experimentally. This framework well
explains the apparently contradicting experimental observations
of filament growth in memristive devices, and provides critical
insight into the principle of device operations. Our qualitative
model may help to develop a more quantitative and microscopic
model for electric field-induced nanoionics based on two main
kinetic factors, ion mobility and redox rate. These findings can be
readily expanded to material and device systems where control-
ling the metal inclusion dynamics (or avoiding such) is critical
and will have significant theoretical and practical impacts.

Methods
in situ TEM. The in situ TEM experiments were carried out using a Nanofactory
scanning tunnelling microscopy platform inside a JEOL 3011 TEM operating at
300 kV. For samples with embedded metal clusters, the bottom electrode was
grounded, while the top electrodes were individually addressed by the movable W
probe, controlled by a piezomotor in the Nanofactory system. For the Ag/SiO2/W
devices, the specimen was prepared by depositing a conformal SiO2 film on a W
probe (Bruker), and the probe was then mounted on the moveable end of a single-
tilt TEM holder. A high-purity Ag wire (99.99%, Goodfellow) was fixed on the
other end of the TEM holder, serving as the active electrode. The Ag/SiO2/W
device structure was formed inside the TEM column when contact was achieved
between the probe and the Ag wire. During in situ experiments on both types of
devices, electrical signals were applied to the devices and measured through
a low-noise Keithley 4200 semiconductor characterization system. The movies were
recorded simultaneously with the electrical measurements.

Preparation of FIB samples. The TEM specimens with embedded Ag, Cu, Ni and
Pt metal nanoclusters were prepared by FIB. First, Au films (400 nm) with a NiCr
adhesion layer (20 nm) were deposited on SiO2/Si substrates by electron beam
evaporation, serving as the bottom electrodes. Afterwards, a SiO2 layer with a
thickness of B20 nm was evaporated, followed by the evaporation of thin Ag, Cu,
Ni or Pt metal layers. A second SiO2 layer with a similar thickness of B20 nm was
then evaporated. The samples were then subjected to rapid thermal annealing

processes in Ar. The metal layers form nanoclusters embedded in the SiO2 films
during annealing when the metal film is thin enough (B1 nm). Afterwards, a 100-
nm thick Au film was evaporated to form the top electrode. The TEM specimens
were then prepared out of these samples by successive FIB lift-out, patterning and
thinning processes. The devices were designed in such a configuration that all the
devices in the same sample have individual top electrodes while sharing the bottom
electrode. The lift-out, patterning and thinning processes were conducted on a
dual-beam FIB system (FEI Helios Nanolab 650 FIB workstation). During FIB
patterning, low-energy Gaþ milling with extreme care was used to obtain high-
quality and thin TEM specimens in order to reduce the projection effect caused by
cluster distributions in the Z direction.

Preparation of samples on W probes. Silicon dioxide films were deposited on W
tips in high vacuum at a low evaporation rate of 0.01 nm s� 1 by electron beam
evaporation. The SiO2 film thickness was adjusted in the range of 10–50 nm. The
samples were checked by TEM, and the SiO2 films were found to be fully
conformal.

Simulations. Electric field simulations were performed using a COMSOL multi-
physics package based on finite element analysis. Simulations on cluster movement
dynamics via splitting and merging processes were performed using a custom
Matlab code based on equations (2–3) by assuming Giox ¼ 0 for the nanocluster
downstream. The two interacting nanoclusters were modelled by perfect spheres
with a constant total volume, and the maximum distance between the two spherical
surfaces (from the leftmost position on the left sphere to the rightmost position on
the right sphere) was assumed fixed when their diameters vary during the elec-
trochemical oxidation and reduction processes.
