Google's computer scientists have created an AI to tweak the company’s other AIs. The advanced machine learning
 system, which goes by the faintly sinister name of Google Vizier, 
automatically tunes algorithms right across Google’s parent company 
Alphabet. But to test it, the researchers used an old-fashioned metric: 
cookie quality in the canteen.

    Modern machine learning systems are the 
algorithmic equivalent of Formula 1 racing cars. The systems have 
tremendous power, but they are extremely sensitive: to function 
effectively they need to be finely tuned, usually by hand.

In particular, the systems need
 carefully set 'hyperparameters': parameters set in advance that are 
adapted to the problem at hand. This isn’t easy, because machine 
learning systems are “black boxes”: even when you’ve made them, you can 
never be entirely sure how they get their results. One common method for
 tuning is known in the field as “grad student descent”: basically, you get a graduate student to twiddle the parameters until the algorithm works.
Google
 Vizier cuts short this tedious manual task by automatically optimising 
hyperparameters of machine learning models. According to Google’s 
researchers, the system is already in use across the company.
"Our
 implementation scales to service the entire hyperparameter tuning 
workload across Alphabet, which is extensive," they write in a paper released this week,
 citing an example where Google researchers “used Vizier to perform 
hyperparameter tuning studies that collectively contained millions of 
trials for a research project… That research project would not be 
possible without effective black–box optimisation.”

One process employed in Google 
Vizier is called 'transfer learning,' essentially, learning from 
experience. Using data from previous studies as a guide, the Vizier 
algorithm can suggest optimal hyperparameters for new algorithms. The 
method is most effective when there have been lots of studies in the 
area, but it also works when there is relatively little crossover: for 
instance "when the observed metrics and the sampling of the datasets are
 different".

        Subscribe to WIREDAs
 well as helping research, Google Vizier is being put to use at 
Alphabet, where, its creators write, it "has made notable improvements 
to production models underlying many Google products, resulting in 
measurably better user experiences for over a billion people".

These improvements include 
automated A/B testing of features of Google's websites, including fonts,
 colours and the format of search results. On Google Maps, for instance,
 the system is being used to optimise the trade-off between the 
relevance of a particular search and the distance of that result from 
the user (with the inevitable aim of getting higher engagement for 
Google).

    Google Vizier can also be used to solve black box 
optimisation problems in the messy physical world. And this is where the
 cookies come in.
To test their system, the researchers gave 
cookie recipes to the contractors who make the puddings in Google’s 
canteen. They taste-tested the result and tracked any alterations the 
chefs made to improve the taste. Recipes are a kind of algorithm in 
their own right, with similar black box properties (because you never 
exactly know why your bake went wrong). And this test allowed the 
researchers to try out their transfer learning approach:
ADVERTISEMENT




    “Before starting to bake at large scale, we baked
 some recipes in a smaller scale run-through,” they write. “This 
provided useful data that we could transfer learn from when baking at 
scale.”
Even when things went slightly wrong – as, for instance, 
when the dough was allowed to sit longer, which "unexpectedly, and 
somewhat dramatically, increased the subjective spiciness of the cookies
 for trials that involved cayenne" – the schema was able to respond. 
After a number of rounds, the cookies improved significantly, the 
researchers say:
“Later rounds were extremely well-rated and, in the authors’ opinions, delicious."
