PSYCHOLOGY

Logic in babies
12-month-olds spontaneously 
reason using 
process of elimination

By Justin Halberda

T
he success of science rests on our hu-

man ability to reason logically. But 

where does this ability come from? 

Is it an inherent attribute of mind 

that even a young child might pos-

sess, or is it a hard-won accomplish-

ment mastered later in life? On page 1263 

of this issue, Cesana-Arlotti et al. (1) reveal 

that one essential form of logical inference, 

process of elimination, is within the toolkit 

of 12-month-old infants. This reveals the 

earliest known foundations of our human 

ability to reason logically. The race to doc-

ument the range of early logical abilities 

shared by infants, adults, and nonhuman 

animals, and to determine how these foun-

dational abilities empower our broader ca-

pacities to reason, has begun.

Every scientific method requires a sup-

porting logic. For Francis Bacon (2), this 

was unfettered empirical observation fol-

lowed by induction (reasoning from many 

cases to form a general principle). Karl 

Popper (3) stressed the importance of hy-

pothesis testing and the ability to refute 

hypotheses found to be false (science as 

an extended instance of process of elimi-

nation). And Thomas Kuhn (4) highlighted 

the dramatic changes that occur during 

scientific revolutions, in which wholly new 

models of phenomena are created through 

model building and abduction (sometimes 

called “inference to the best explanation”). 

Examples of such revolutions are the Co-

pernican Revolution (5) producing the 

heliocentric model of the solar system, 

and the Einsteinian Revolution of special 

relativity in which space and time become 

one (6). In each of these cases (induction, 

hypothesis testing, abduction), the work 

of science is supported by an underlying 

logic. No logic, no science.

Where does our human faculty to reason 

logically come from? At the end of the pre-

vious century, Susan Carey suggested that 

such logic might be deep in our develop-

mental roots: A young child might reason 

using intuitive theories, models, and abduc-

and avoid infected conspecifics on the basis 

of olfactory cues associated with the altered 

chemical composition of infected feces (2). 

Thus, whereas prey “fear” predators, parasite 

avoidance is more akin to disgust—an innate 

aversion to cues associated with parasites (1). 

As with predator avoidance, parasite avoid-

ance incurs costs such as altered social inter-

actions, reduced reproductive opportunities, 

diminished foraging, and increased energy 

expenditure (4). To predict when parasite 

avoidance is most likely to occur and under-

stand its consequences, it must be integrated 

into the same trade-off framework that is 

widely applied to predator avoidance. 

Beyond its direct effects on hosts, parasite 

avoidance has cascading effects at a range of 

scales and in various systems (5). Ants and 

their parasitoids provide a useful model 

system for studying the cascading effects of 

parasite avoidance on herbivory. Azteca ants 

experimentally exposed to parasitoid flies 

dramatically reduce their activity levels to 

avoid infection. This reduces the ants’ ability 

to attack their herbivorous prey, the coffee 

berry borer, and allows the latter to consume 

more coffee berries (6). Such ecological im-

pacts of parasite avoidance are not limited 

to top-down effects on vegetation; they also 

alter mutualism, competition, and predation. 

Like the predator-induced landscape of 

fear, a parasite-induced landscape of dis-

gust (see the figure) has far-reaching con-

sequences for population dynamics, species 

interactions, and ecosystem structure. How-

ever, whereas direct effects of predators are 

naturally restricted to prey species (7), a par-

asite-induced landscape of disgust extends to 

all animals, including very large species and 

top predators that are typically immune to 

predation (8). For example, a recent synthesis 

by Moleón et al. showed that carnivores avoid 

foraging on other carnivore carcasses and 

rarely engage in cannibalism (9).  Feeding on 

conspecifics increases disease transmission, 

and forgoing this food resource reduces expo-

sure to shared parasites (10). At a landscape 

level, this avoidance behavior dramatically 

alters the amount of carcass material that 

is available in an ecosystem, with important 

downstream effects. For instance,  carcasses 

 not consumed by mammalian scavengers 

may support more diverse and abundant 

arthropod commun ities (9). Furthermore, 

when carcasses decompose, their nutrient 

inputs increase plant growth (11). Like the 

ecosystem-level impacts of predator avoid-

ance, the ecosystem-level impacts of parasite 

avoidance are likely to be substantial. 

Parasite and predator avoidance can exert 

opposing pressures on host and prey species. 

For example, tadpoles increase their activity 

levels to protect themselves from trematode 

infection, but this increases their susceptibil-

ity to visual predators (12). The tadpoles fear 

and avoid both predators and parasites, but 

do not perceive these threats as equal. When 

experimentally forced to choose between pre-

dation and parasitism risk, tadpoles opt for 

infection (13). This makes sense because pre-

dation has a larger short-term fitness effect 

than does parasitism,  and the optimal behav-

ior avoids the greatest immediate threat.

However, parasite and predator avoidance 

are not always mutually exclusive. For in-

stance, avoiding predator feces protects prey 

against both predators and their parasites 

(14), and, when animals group together, they 

dilute their risk of attack by both predators 

and some parasites (for example, ticks, bot-

flies) (15).    Although predator avoidance has 

received more attention, parasite avoidance 

also has strong effects on foraging, move-

ment, and social interactions (1). 

Parasite avoidance is likely to have impor-

tant consequences.  For example, grazing ani-

mals such as cows, sheep, and horses avoid 

fecal contaminated forage (4), and changing 

livestock practices to recognize the needs and 

capabilities of animals to avoid parasites will 

reduce the cost associated with avoidable 

livestock diseases. Furthermore, conservation 

planning and projections may benefit from 

knowledge of how shrinking and fragmented 

habitat limits the ability of animals to avoid 

risky sites and conspecifics. As populations of 

large predators continue to decline, parasite 

avoidance may become a relatively stronger 

driver of ecological processes. Integrating 

parasites into the ecology of fear is thus cru-

cial to understanding the general ecological 

and evolutionary effects of parasites on eco-

systems and predicting how ecosystems are 

likely to respond to the rapidly changing en-

vironments of the Anthropocene. j

tion, much like a professional scientist (7). 

Other developmental psychologists pushed 

this further and suggested that even infants 

might be understood to be little scientists 

drawing inferences in the cradle about ob-

jects and causes (8). But suggestions like 

these are frequently met with incredulity 

(9): After all, it often feels like logical rea-

soning is effortful, conscious, and even lin-

guistically based (10). These characteristics, 

if accurate, would seem to preclude the pos-

sibility that preverbal infants could engage 

in any such process. 

Cesana-Arlotti et al. asked whether pre-

linguistic 12- and 19-month-old infants 

would spontaneously reason using process 

of elimination. This is a form of inference 

also known as disjunctive syllogism or mo-

dus tollendo ponens—it is any argument of 

the form: A or B, not A, therefore B. Cesana-

Arlotti et al. relied on one of the few behav-

iors babies voluntarily engage in—looking 

at whatever they find most interesting (11). 

They measured infants’ looking at comput-

erized vignettes in which two different ob-

jects (A and B) were shown being hidden 

behind a wall. Infants watched as a cup 

scooped one of the objects from behind 

the wall, and then came to rest next to the 

wall—critically, only the topmost edge of 

the contained object could be seen peeking 

out of the cup, such that infants could not 

tell for sure whether the object was A or B. 

At this moment, infants could have formed 

a disjunctive thought—for example, “either 

the object in the cup is object A or it is ob-

ject B.” Next, this ambiguity was resolved: 

The wall dropped to reveal that object A was 

behind the wall, but the contents of the cup 

remained hidden. This is the moment of po-

tential elimination, and an opportunity for 

infants to draw a key inference—“because 

object A is not in the cup, object B must be 

in the cup.” Finally, infants’ expectations for 

the cup’s contents were tested: Either the 

expected object (object B) or, surprisingly, 

another object A emerged from the cup. 

Infants looked longer at the surprising out-

come—an indication that their expectations 

were violated and a hint that they were 

seeking further information to resolve the 

conflict (12). 

Potentially even more exciting, infants 

also showed signs of making the necessary 

inferences along the way—for example, 

upon seeing which of the two objects was 

behind the wall, but before the cup’s con-

tents were revealed, infants’ pupils dilated 

and they tended to shift their fixation to 

the cup (consistent with them inferring 

which object must be inside). This pattern 

suggests that infants used the information 

they had seen to reason through a disjunc-

tive syllogism (A or B, not A, therefore 

B). There were also additional versions 

of these vignettes that manipulated the 

precise sequence of hiding and revealing, 

which allowed the authors to determine 

what specifically the infants were remem-

bering and expecting during each moment. 

The careful crafting of stimuli and clever 

analyses of infants’ spontaneous looking 

behavior by Cesana-Arlotti et al. show us 

that infants have the capacity to reason 

by process of elimination. By contrast, 

whereas nonhuman animals such as dogs 

facing similar situations of ambiguity may 

ultimately form the right conclusion, they 

appear to arrive at this hunch using an as-

sociative rather than logical process (13). 

Unwinding the similarities and differences 

among infant, child, adult, and animal rea-

soning abilities is an important task for 

the future, as is determining why, despite 

being deployed by infants, reasoning feels 

effortful and why humans often “go with 

our gut” and rely on heuristics and biases 

rather than logical inference (14). 

A new field, studying the foundations of 

logical abilities, is emerging. As with other 

successes of developmental psychology 

in recent decades [as in work on the psy-

chology of number, language, and theory 

of mind (15)], this new field will make use 

of behavior and brain studies with infants, 

children, and adults; studies of nonhuman 

animal abilities; studies of the correlations 

between reasoning and other abilities; and 

training studies to determine where we 

all begin and how maturation and experi-

ence build upon these foundations. It is a 

thrilling time for us as scientists—using 

logical reasoning to understand how we 

reason logically. j
