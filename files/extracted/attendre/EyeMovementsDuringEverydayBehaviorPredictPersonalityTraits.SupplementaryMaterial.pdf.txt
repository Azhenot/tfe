1 LIST OF EYE MOVEMENT FEATURES

From each time window, we extracted a list of 207 features which are summarised in the list below. For
brevity, we sometimes collapsed several items into one bullet point and gave the number of features per
bullet points in brackets. E.g. ’mean/variance/minimum/maximum of the fixation duration (4)’ means that
there are four features, namely statistical mean, variance, minimum and maximum of the fixation duration.

Please note that all code we used to extract these features is publicly available on GitHub1.

Statistics over fixations, saccades and blinks

Fixations were detected using a dispersion-threshold algorithm with a threshold of 2.5% of the tracking
range width (and an additional threshold on the minimum duration of 100ms). This dispersion threshold
was also used to define small and large saccades by comparing the amplitude of a saccade to twice the
dispersion threshold.

A saccade that ends right (left) of its point of origin is called right (left) saccade. Note that this is
independent of the saccade’s absolute position, e.g. a saccade within the left lower corner of a person’s
field of view might still be a right saccade, if it ended a little further right than it started.

A ratio between eye movements is meant to describe the ratio between the number of occurrences in
one time window. E.g. if there were 1 fixations and 2 saccade in a time window, the ratio of fixations to
saccades would be 12 .

The rate of an eye movement is defined as its number of occurrences per second (e.g. 5 fixations per
second).

• fixation/saccade rate (2)
• small/large saccade rate (2)
• left/right saccade rate (2)
• saccade to fixation ratio
• ratio of small/large/right/left saccades to the

total number of saccades (4)

• mean/variance/minimum/maximum saccade

• mean/variance/minimum/maximum saccade

Statistics over raw gaze data

Features that are computed on the raw x coordinates, raw y coordinates and pupil diameter separately are
abbreviated as on ’XYD’.

• heatmap counts with 8× 8 cells (64)
• mean of XYD (3)
• minimum of XYD (3)
• maximum of XYD (3)
• range of XYD (3)
• standard deviation of XYD (3)
• median of XYD (3)
• 1st quartile of the distribution over XYD (3)

• 3rd quartile of the distribution over XYD (3)
• inter quartile range of the distribution over

XYD (3)
• absolute value of mean difference between

subsequent XYD (3)
• mean difference between subsequent XYD (3)
• mean angle between two subsequent raw gaze

points (i.e. between the x-axis and the vector
connecting the two gaze points)

Information on the temporal course of saccades and fixations

n-grams describe series of n events, for instance 2-grams based on the events {short fixation, long
fixation, saccade} could be: [short fixation, saccade] or any of the 32 possible combinations of events. The
frequency of one such n-gram is defined as its number of occurrences here, e.g. the example 2-gram [short
fixation, saccade] could occur twice in a given time window. The frequencies for all possible events could
be computed, concatenated and then features such as the mean over these frequencies can be extracted.

For n-grams with n from 1 to 4,
each once based on saccades only, once based on saccades and fixations.
For saccades only, each saccade was labelled as small or large, and with one out of 8 possible directions.
For saccades and fixations, a fixation was labelled as either short or long; a saccade was labelled as small
or large and with one out of 4 possible directions.

• number of different movements
• highest/lowest frequency within the n-gram (2)
• most/least frequent movements (2)
• range/mean/variance of frequencies within the n-gram (3)

Table S1. Personality score ranges for each personality trait. Participants with raw values smaller or equal
to boundary 1 were assigned to personality score range 1, those larger than boundary 1 but smaller or equal
to boundary 2 were assigned to score range 2, and those larger than boundary 2 were assigned to score
range 3.

3 DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS
To facilitate comparisons with related work we also provide correlation coefficients between personality
scores and those features extracted from a sliding window with a length of 15 seconds (which was the
window length that was most frequently selected in our training scheme) in Table S2. These correlation
coefficients describe properties of the collected data and, in contrast to the feature importance scores in
Figure 2 in the main article, are independent of the machine learning approach.

Table S2. Correlation coefficients between personality score ranges for each trait and features extracted from a
sliding window with a length of 15 seconds. The features listed in the table form the smallest set that contains the 15
features with highest correlations for each trait. These 15 coefficients are highlighted in bold. The n-gram features
are called sacc. movements if they were based on saccades only and SF if fixations were considered as well.

4 TRAINING PROCEDURE
In the following, the scheme to train a single random forest classifier will be described (see GitHub for our
implementation):
A priori, no clear hypotheses about useful window sizes for the sliding window approach or informative
features for every day life recordings existed. Therefore, each classifier was trained in a nested cross
validation scheme that fits parameters during training while preventing overfitting. Cross validation means
that a given set of recordings is not simply split into one training and one test set, but instead the algorithm
cycles different splits into the training and test sets. On each pair of training and test set, a separate classifier
is trained and the performance measure is then averaged over all splits. Typically, a single classifier is
trained on the training set and is later evaluated on the unseen test set. In nested cross validation however,
another (so-called inner) cross validation takes place on the training set. This is, the algorithm again cycles
through different splits of the (outer) training set into (inner) training and (inner) test set. In this inner cross
validation, different parameters can be tested on the inner training set and applied to the inner test set. Once
the best performing parameters (i.e. in our case window size and features) are chosen, a classifier with
these parameters is newly trained on the entire outer training set and evaluated on the still unseen outer test
set. Figure S1 shows the distribution of all chosen window sizes.

Figure S1. During the training procedure, a nested cross validation scheme is used to determine the best
performing parameters, one of which is the size of a sliding window used to process raw gaze data. This
histogram shows the frequency of each window size (x-axis) summed up over all cycles of the training
scheme. While the y-axis shows relative frequency, the number above each bar is the absolute number of
times a window was chosen.

The inner cross validation cycle included 3 different data splits (folds) that were chosen to contain an
approximately equal number of samples for each class. The goodness of a classifier on the inner test set
was evaluated using the accuracy over all samples (i.e. independent of the participant they belong to). For
the outer cross validation, the data used for testing is cycled such that each time, 5 different participants are
in the test set and the remaining 37 in the training set. Finally, a prediction for each participant in the outer

test set was derived by majority voting over all time windows associated with that particular participant.
The predictions from all outer folds were merged into a set of exactly one prediction per participant and
evaluated in terms of an F1 score with macro averaging. The F1 score is defined as the harmonic mean of
precision and recall, where precision for a certain class captures how many of the actual class instances
were correctly detected, whereas recall captures how many of the instances that were predicted to be class
instances were actually correct. Macro averaging means that one F1 score per class is computed and those
are then averaged. This reflects the intuition that a personality predictions system is expected to predict
extreme values, as opposed to a system that typically predicts the most frequent personality class.
Feature selection within the inner cross validation cycle is performed based on the Random Forests’ feature
importance: all features that did not reach a higher average importance than 0.005 across all splits were
disabled for the outer cross validation.
