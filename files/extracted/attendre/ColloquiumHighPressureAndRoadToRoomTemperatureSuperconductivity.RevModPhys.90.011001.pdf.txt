This Colloquium is concerned with the superconducting state of new high-Tc compounds containing
hydrogen ions (hydrides). Recently superconductivity with the record-setting transition temperature
of Tc ¼ 203 K was reported for sulfur hydrides under high pressure. In general, high pressure serves
as a path finding tool toward novel structures, including those with very high Tc. The field has a rich
and interesting history. Currently, it is broadly recognized that superconductivity in sulfur hydrides
owes its origin to the phonon mechanism. However, the picture differs from the conventional one in
important ways. The phonon spectrum in sulfur hydride is both broad and has a complex structure.
Superconductivity arises mainly due to strong coupling to the high-frequency optical modes, although
the acoustic phonons also make a noticeable contribution. A new approach is described, which
generalizes the standard treatment of the phonon mechanism and makes it possible to obtain an
analytical expression for Tc in this phase. It turns out that, unlike in the conventional case, the value of
the isotope coefficient (for the deuterium-hydrogen substitution) varies with the pressure and reflects
the impact of the optical modes. The phase diagram, that is the pressure dependence of Tc, is rather
peculiar. A crucial feature is that increasing pressure results in a series of structural transitions,
including the one which yields the superconducting phase with the record Tc of 203 K. In a narrow
region near P ≈ 150 GPa the critical temperature rises sharply from Tc ≈ 120 to ≈ 200 K. It seems
that the sharp structural transition, which produces the high-Tc phase, is a first-order phase transition
caused by interaction between the order parameter and lattice deformations. A remarkable feature of
the electronic spectrum in the high-Tc phase is the appearance of small pockets at the Fermi level.
Their presence leads to a two-gap spectrum, which can, in principle, be observed with the future use
of tunneling spectroscopy. This feature leads to nonmonotonic and strongly asymmetric pressure
dependence of Tc. Other hydrides, e.g., CaH6 and MgH6, can be expected to display even higher
values of Tc up to room temperature. The fundamental challenge lies in the creation of a structure
capable of displaying high Tc at ambient pressure.

I. INTRODUCTION

In a recent development, superconductivity with a critical
temperature Tc ¼ 203 Kwas observed in sulfur hydride under
high pressure (Drozdov et al., 2015). This development is the
most significant breakthrough since the discovery of the high-
Tc oxides (Bednorz and Mueller, 1986). There is every reason
to anticipate even higher values of Tc for other hydrides,
which means that achieving superconductivity at room tem-
perature now appears perfectly realistic.

We focus here on theoretical aspects, which can provide a
clue to understanding the specifics of the new superconduct-
ing state. It should be emphasized that in many respects the
system is quite unusual. As will be discussed, the observed
phenomenon can be explained by the phonon mechanism.
Nevertheless, a number of key features reveal that the picture
differs from the conventional one. In this Colloquium we
devote particular attention to these features. One of them is the
peculiar pressure dependence of the critical temperature. Not
only does external pressure result in metallization and the
appearance of superconductivity, but also the value of Tc
grows dramatically with a further rise in pressure. Moreover,
this variation turns out to be nonmonotonic. It should also be
noted that while Cooper pairs formation is mediated by
phonons, the complex structure of the phonon spectrum
and its broad range (all the way up to Ω ≈ 2000 K, where
Ω is the phonon frequency) makes it necessary to modify the
conventional treatment. While the strong isotope effect affirms
the action of the phonon mechanism, the value of the isotope
coefficient turns out to vary with pressure. Next we discuss
all these interesting aspects of the new development in
superconductivity.
Despite its rich and interesting prehistory, the discovery

came as a surprise, especially for those who accept the notion
that electron-phonon interaction cannot give rise to such a
high Tc. The background of this notion will be discussed
later (Sec. III.A). One also should not lose track of the fact that
this impressive discovery came about thanks to the remarkable
progress in high-pressure technique and to experimental
innovations by the M. Eremets group (Max Planck
Institute, Mainz, Germany). Note that the study of the
hydrides has attracted the attention of many theoretical
groups (see Sec. III). And special credit should be given to
the group of Y. Ma and also to D. Duan, T. Cui, and their
collaborators (Julin University, Changchun, China) (see
Secs. III and VII). Their remarkable studies brought special
attention to the sulfur hydrides and motivated the key
experimental studies.
A few remarks on the historical perspective are in order.

The phenomenon of superconductivity was discovered more
than 100 years ago by Onnes (1911). While measuring the
temperature dependence of the electrical resistance RðTÞ of
mercury he observed that at the temperature of 4.2 K the
resistivity suddenly vanishes. The dissipationless (R ¼ 0)
state which emerged was named the superconducting state.
Subsequently superconductivity was discovered in many other
materials. Moreover, it was soon realized that the loss of
resistance was only one facet of the superconducting state;
hence, the latter corresponded to a qualitatively new state of
matter. Its most fundamental feature, the so-called Meissner
effect (Meissner and Ochsenfeld, 1933), is manifested in the
expulsion of the magnetic field from the bulk of the sample
(anomalous diamagnetism).
The microscopic theory of superconductivity was created

by Bardeen, Cooper, and Schrieffer (1957), almost 50 years
after the experimental discovery. According to the BCS
theory, the key microscopic factor behind the phenomenon
is the attraction between electrons mediated by the exchange
of phonons, such that below Tc within the electronic system

there forms a macroscopic manifold of bound electron pairs
(known as the Cooper pairs). Thus the attraction has its
origin in the ionic system; qualitatively the effect may be
related to the dielectric function changing its sign at low
frequencies.
The well-known expression for the critical temperature is

Tc ≈ ~Ω exp
�
− 1
λ − μ�

�
. ð1:1Þ

Here ~Ω is the characteristic phonon frequency (typically on
the order of the Debye temperature), λ is the electron-phonon
coupling constant, and μ� is the so-called Coulomb pseudo-
potential which characterizes the direct electron-electron
repulsion (usually μ� ≈ 0.1–0.15). Equation (1.1) is valid in
the weak coupling approximation (λ ≪ 1). Note that the
specific value of the preexponential factor is determined by
the renormalization effect (see Sec. III.A).
The search for superconducting materials with higher

critical temperatures has been ongoing. Figure 1 shows
how the maximum transition temperatures within different
superconductor families have grown with time. In the first
75 years progress was rather modest (from Tc ¼ 4.2 K for
mercury up to Tc ≈ 23 K in Nb3Ge). A breakthrough came in
1986 when Bednorz and Mueller discovered a new family of
superconducting materials, the copper oxides (cuprates), and
observed a Tc close to 40 K in the La-Sr-Cu-O compound.
Subsequent research on cuprates raised their Tc all the way up
to 130 K in the HgBaCaCuO compound (Schilling et al.,
1993). For what follows, it is noteworthy that under pressure
Tc was raised up to ≈160 K (Gao et al., 1994). Until recently,
this remained the highest critical temperature ever observed.

FIG. 1. Increase in Tc;max with time. During the next 75 years
since the discovery the increase was ΔTc ≈ 18 K; the main focus
was on the Nb-based materials. The highest Tc for the cuprates at
ambient pressure (Tc ≈ 130 K) was raised under pressure up to
Tc ≈ 160 K. At present, the curve is extended up to Tc;max ¼
203 K observed for sulfur hydride under high pressure.

II. HYDRIDES

A. Metallic hydrogen

As noted in the Introduction, recent work on sulfur hydrides
under high pressure led to the observation of a superconduct-
ing state with the record value of Tc ¼ 203 K. This achieve-
ment was preceded by developments, which started almost 50
years ago (Ashcroft, 1968). According to the BCS theory, Tc
is proportional to the characteristic phonon frequency ~Ω ∝
1=

M

p
[see Eq. (1.1)]. One may expect, therefore, that

metallic hydrogen should have a high value of Tc: for such
a light metal the characteristic phonon frequency in the
prefactor of Eq. (1.1) is high and (ignoring for the moment
the magnitude of the exponential factor) Tc may also turn out
to be rather high. However, this prediction can be verified only
under very high pressure. Indeed, hydrogen first must become
metallic, but the transition from the molecular phase into the
metallic state is known to require high pressure (Wigner and
Huntington, 1935). This is the dissociative transition to an
atomic lattice, which occurs through compression of solid
molecular hydrogen.
A conductive (probably, semimetalic) state of hydrogen

was observed by Eremets and Troyan (2011) at room temper-
ature under the pressure of 260–270 GPa (recall that 100 GPa
corresponds to 1 × 106 atmospheres).
The phase diagram for hydrogen is rather complicated

(Fig. 2), and the determination of this diagram was a nontrivial
task. The main complication derives from the fact that the usual
technique for structure determination, which underlies the phase
diagrams of materials, namely, x-ray diffraction (XRD), is not
conclusive because scattering by hydrogen is very weak. The
diagram in Fig. 2 is based on Raman and infrared measurements
along with resistivity data. The low temperature phases I–III
were observed at relatively low pressures (≤150 GPa); see the
review by Mao and Hemley (1994).

Recently Eremets, Troyan, andDrozdov (2016) and Eremets
et al. (2017) observed a new phase (phase VI in Fig. 2) at
pressures ≳360 GPa and temperatures <200 K. This phase
displays a drastic drop in resistivity, characteristic featureless
Raman spectra, and the absence of a photoconductive response.
These properties are characteristic of the metallic state.
Concerning the superconducting state of metallic hydrogen,

theoretical calculations (McMahon et al., 2012) showed that a
high Tc state of pure metallic hydrogen requires pressures on
the order of ≈500 GPa. Hopefully, this phenomenon will be
observed in the near future.

B. Hydrides: High-Tc superconductivity

The reasoning for an elevated value of Tc applies not only to
pure hydrogen but also to hydrides, that is, to materials
containing hydrogen as one of their components (Ashcroft,
2004;Wang andMa, 2014). The presence of hydrogen results in
the appearance of high-frequency optical-phonon modes,
whereas heavy ions provide additional acoustic modes, which
also contribute to the pairing.At the same time, themetallization
of such compounds does not require extraordinarily high
pressures. In fact, hydrides are even more promising materials
than pure metallic hydrogen. Indeed, the presence of more than
one ion in the unit cell, in this case an additional hydrogen ion,
leads to an appearance of high-frequency optical modes which,
in addition to high frequency, are characterized by a high density
of states. The latter is beneficial for superconductivity.
A number of density-functional theory studies supported the

high promise of hydride compounds. For example, calculations
(Gao et al., 2008) suggested that GaH3 at P ≈ 160 GPa would
display Tc ≈ 140 K and Si2H6 at ≈275 GPa would display
Tc ≈ 73–86 K (Jin et al., 2010). The most thermodynamically
stable structures were established by calculating the enthalpy-
difference curves. Among others, the minima hopping method
was employed (Goedecker, 2004).
Initial experiments on SiH4 (Eremets et al., 2008) demon-

strated that hydrides can indeed support a superconducting
state, although the critical temperature was a relatively modest
≈17 K. Later, following the discovery of the record high Tc in
sulfur hydrides, a high-Tc state (≈100 K) in covalent hydride
phosphine (P-H) was also observed (Drozdov, Eremets, and
Troyan,2015).Theoreticalanalysis (Flores-Livas,Amsleretal.,
2016) suggested that the PH1;2;3 systems indeed have a rather
high Tc, but the material is probably in a metastable state.
Li et al. (2014) made the prediction that metallic sulfur

hydride would become superconducting with Tc ≈ 80 K
under the relatively low pressure P ≈ 100 GPa. Following
the first experimental observation of such a superconducting
state, Eremets and collaborators continued increasing the
pressure and discovered that Tc goes up significantly all
the way to Tc ≈ 203 K (Drozdov, Eremets, and Troyan, 2014;
Drozdov et al., 2015); see also the review by Eremets and
Drozdov (2016). Such a remarkable observation was
explained by a mixed valence of S and the formation of
sulfur hydride with a higher hydrogen content. This
assumption was in agreement with an interesting independent
theoretical study by Duan et al. (2014) More specifically, an
increase in pressure is accompanied by the formation of H3S
structural units [Fig. 3(a)] via the following transformation:

domains for different phases. Phases I–III correspond to a
molecular state of pure hydrogen. Their boundaries can be
determined from Raman and infrared measurements. Phase IV
is a mixed atomic-molecular phase, phase V is an atomic liquid
phase. Recently observed phase VI corresponds to the metallic
state. From Eremets, Troyan, and Drozdov, 2016.

3H2S → 2H3Sþ S. ð2:1Þ

The transformation H2S → H3S has also been confirmed by
detailed calculations of Bernstein et al. (2015) and Errea
et al. (2015).
Sulfur hydride at the pressure P ≈ 90 GPa has Tc ≈ 90 K.

As mentioned, the subsequent increase in pressure leads to a
large increase in the value of the critical temperature up to
Tc ≈ 200 K. This pressure dependence implies that the
presence of hydrogen is necessary but not sufficient by itself
for reaching the highest Tc values. Indeed, the sample at
90 GPa contains hydrogen and consequently high-frequency
modes. The Tc of 90 K is very high and was sensational
30 years ago, but it is much below the 203 K that is achieved
under higher pressure. Therefore the pressure increase brings
in some additional factors. As mentioned, Drozdov, Eremets,
and Troyan (2014) and Drozdov et al. (2015) suggested that
the rise in Tc is due to the formation of new compounds with
higher valence states of sulfur.
As will be described, the pressure increase changes the

crystal structure of sulfur hydride, thereby signifying a
structural phase transition. The structural transformation plays
the crucial role in the observed behavior.
Next we focus on the two phases with the highest values of

Tc (Fig. 3). One of them [Figs. 3(a) and 3(b)] has the crystal
structure, which corresponds to R3m symmetry (Massa, 2004).
Increasing the pressure further leads, at P ≈ 150 GPa, to the
appearance of a different phase [Fig. 3(c)]. It is this new
structure that displays the record-high Tc. The symmetry group

of the lattice is cubic Oh ðIm-3mÞ. The theoretically predicted
structure is in agreement with x-ray data (Einaga et al., 2016;
Goncharov et al., 2016, 2017).
The usual x-ray spectroscopy does not allow one to

determine the structure of the hydrides with a high accuracy,
because the light H ions do not provide strong scattering. In
addition, the multiphase nature of the studied samples
(Goncharov et al., 2016) also represents a serious complica-
tion. Recently, advance spectroscopy has been employed to
monitor how the structure evolves with pressure (Goncharov
et al., 2017). More specifically, the synthesis performed out of
S and molecular hydrogen along with the cyclotron XRD
technique and Raman spectroscopy did allow the researchers
to study all structures formed with an increase in pressure. It
turns out that the transformation (2.1) occurs at pressure
P > 40 GPa. It has also been demonstrated that the phase at
P≲ 110 GPa (Tc ≈ 120 K) has R3m symmetry [Figs. 3(a)
and 3(b)]. As for the most interesting high-Tc phase, its
structure [Fig. 3(c)], indeed, is characterized by the Im-3m
symmetry.
The transformation (2.1) supports the suggestion by

Drozdov et al. (2015); see the previous discussion on the
mixed valence state of sulfur. The latter factor turns out to be
essential (see Sec. IV.C).

C. Superconductivity in hydrides: Main properties

Experimentally, the onset of the high-Tc superconducting
state in sulfur hydrides (Drozdov et al., 2015) is detected by
the drastic resistance drop near Tc. A sharp transition was
observed in annealed samples. The measured resistance was at
least 2 orders of magnitude below that of pure copper.
The critical temperature shifts downward in the presence of

an external magnetic field. Magnetic susceptibility measure-
ments reveal an abrupt transition into the diamagnetic state
(the Meissner effect). This key result was also confirmed by a
direct observation (Troyan et al., 2016) of magnetic field
expulsion as detected by the response of a thin Sn film placed
inside the bulk sample. The Meissner effect was also observed
later by Huang et al. (2016) by means of ac magnetic
susceptibility measurements.
Next we concentrate on the two phases with the highest Tc.

One of them (R3m) [Figs. 3(a) and 3(b)] has Tc ≈ 120 K, and
the other (Im-3m [Fig. 3(c)] has the highest Tc of ≈200 K.We
refer to the former structure as the “low-Tc phase” (although
this name sounds ironic for Tc ≈ 120 K), and to the second
structure as the “high-Tc phase.”
The question of the mechanism of superconductivity with

such a record Tc is of fundamental interest. The strong isotope
effect indicates that pairing is provided by phonon exchange.
The main contribution comes from the high-frequency optical
modes. Nevertheless, as stressed in the Introduction, the
picture is far from conventional.
The phase diagram, that is, the pressure dependence of Tc,

is very peculiar. Indeed, Fig. 4 demonstrates that Tc is strongly
dependent on the applied pressure (Einaga et al., 2016). It
increases from ≈100–120 K up to the record ≈200 K over the
relatively narrow pressure interval 125–150 GPa. We argue
that such a rapid Tc change is a fingerprint of a first-order
structural transition.

Note that once Tc reaches its maximum value, it decreases
upon further rise in applied pressure. The decline is rather
slow, so that the Tc dependence is strongly asymmetric
relative to Tc;max. Such a dependence is unusual and requires
an explanation. We interpret this feature (see Sec. VII.D) as
deriving from the impact of the superconducting order
parameters on the main Fermi surfaces and on small pockets,
with the latter appearing in the electronic spectrum of the
high-Tc phase in the course of a first-order phase transition.
Note also that because of the complex structure and the

width of the phonon spectrum evaluation of Tc and of the
isotope coefficient (whose value turns out to be pressure
dependent) must be carried out with considerable care.
The next section contains a general description of the

phonon mechanism with emphasis on the strong coupling
case. Subsequent sections focus on the challenges previously
described.

III. ELECTRON-PHONON INTERACTION:
CRITICAL TEMPERATURE

A. Main equations: Coupling constant and Tc

Our main goal is to evaluate the value of the critical
temperature for the hydrides. The usual BCS model is
not applicable here, because it has been developed in a
weak coupling approximation (λ ≪ 1 and correspondingly,
2πTc ≪ ~Ω). The equations describing strong-coupled super-
conductors (Migdal, 1958; Eliashberg, 1960) contain the so-
called phonon propagator [see Eq. (3.1)], and therefore the
phonon frequency Ω.
The equation for the pairing order parameter ΔðωnÞ has the

following form (at T ¼ Tc):

ΔðωnÞZ ¼ πTc

α2ðΩÞFðΩÞ

is the phonon propagator, Ω is the phonon frequency, and
ωn ¼ ð2nþ 1ÞπTc (the method of thermodynamic Green’s
functions is employed) [see, e.g., Abrikosov, Gor’kov, and
Dzyaloshinski (1975)]; one should also add the Coulomb
pseudopotential μ�. The factor Z is the renormalization
function determined by

Z¼ 1þðπTc=ωnÞ
X
m

Z
dΩ

α2ðΩÞFðΩÞ
Ω

DðΩ;ωn−ωmÞ ωmjωmj .
ð3:3Þ

The renormalization function describes the “dressing” of
electrons moving through the ionic lattice.
Equations (3.1) and (3.3) contain the important quantity, the

function α2ðΩÞFðΩÞ. Here FðΩÞ is the phonon density of
states, α2ðΩÞ describes the electron-phonon interaction and
contains the corresponding matrix element (Scalapino, 1969;
Grimvall, 1981; Wolf, 2012).
In addition, one can introduce an important parameter, the

so-called coupling constant λ, defined by

λ ¼
Z

dΩ
α2ðΩÞFðΩÞ

Ω
. ð3:4Þ

Note that Eqs. (3.1) and (3.3) do not explicitly contain the
coupling constant λ. Indeed, generally speaking, this constant
cannot be factored out, because the phonon frequency enters
not only in the factor α2ðΩÞFðΩÞ but also in the phonon
propagator DðΩ;ωn − ωmÞ, which, in addition, depends on
ωn − ωm [see Eq. (3.2)]. It is apparent from Eq. (3.1) or (3.3)
that the coupling constant can be factored out, if Eq. (3.1) does
not contain a phonon propagator function (e.g., D ≈ 1 for the
weak coupling case) or if the phonon propagator D slowly
depends on the frequencyΩ, so that Ω inD can be replaced by
its average value.
When the function α2ðΩÞFðΩÞ is known, the value of

the critical temperature can be evaluated from the nonlinear
equation similar to Eq. (3.1) with the replacement jωnj →
½ω2n þ Δ2ðωnÞ�1=2 in the denominator of the integrand
(Gor’kov, 1958). Such an equation describes the order
parameter at any temperature [then ωn ¼ ð2nþ 1ÞπT]. The
calculation can be performed numerically, without invoking
the coupling constant concept. We discuss the corresponding
method in Sec. IV.A while focusing on the sulfur hydrides.
At the same time the possibility to introduce the coupling

constant λ is beneficial for the analysis. The concept of
a coupling constant is commonly used to study usual
superconductors. It allows one to deduce the analytical expres-
sions for Tc and interpret its dependences on other para-
meters in the problem. Such an approach is justified, because
usually the function α2ðΩÞFðΩÞ is characterized by the peak
structure in phonon density of states FðΩÞ [see, e.g., Wolf
(2012), and also Fig. 5(b)]. The latter structure corresponds
to the short-wavelength part of the spectrum where the

FIG. 4. Pressure dependence of Tc. The data for annealed
samples are presented. One can see a large increase in the value
of Tc in the region near P ¼ 140 GPa. Adapted from Einaga
et al., 2016.

mode dispersion is weak. The phonon propagator changes
slowly on the scale corresponding to the peak structure,
and this permits the replacement of Ω in the phonon
propagator by its average value ~Ω; the latter can be taken
either as ~Ω ¼ hΩ2i1=2 [see, e.g., Louie and Cohen (1977), and
the reviews by Grimvall (1981) and Kresin and Wolf (2009)],
or as ~Ω ¼ hΩlogi which is close to ~Ω ¼ hΩ2i1=2 (Allen and
Dynes, 1975; Carbotte, 1990). The average hfi is defined by
hfðΩÞi ¼ ð2=λÞ R dΩfðΩÞα2ðΩÞFðΩÞΩ−1. If ~Ω ¼ hΩlogi,
then f ¼ logΩ. We have chosen ~Ω ¼ hΩ2i1=2, so that
hΩ2i ¼ ð2=λÞ R dΩΩα2ðΩÞFðΩÞ; λ is defined by Eq. (3.4).
As a result, Eqs. (3.1) and (3.3) can be written in the form

ΔðωnÞZ ¼ πTcλ

Here

Dð ~Ω;ωn −ωmÞ ¼ ~Ω2=½ðωn −ωmÞ2 þ ~Ω2�; ~Ω¼ hΩ2i1=2.
ð3:7Þ

As is known, the solution of Eq. (3.5) can be written in
analytical form and the explicit expression depends on the
strength of the electron-phonon interaction [see the review by
Kresin, Morawitz, and Wolf (2014)]. For the weak coupling
case (λ ≪ 1; then 2πTc ≪ ~Ω), D ≈ 1, Z ≈ 1, and we obtain a
well-known BCS expression, Eq. (1.1). For the intermediate
coupling one should take into account the renormalization of
the coupling constant, since Z ≈ 1þ λ, and Tc is described by
the corresponding equation (Nakajima and Watabe, 1963;
Grimvall, 1981). Note that even in the weak coupling case the
renormalization function affects the value of the preexponen-
tial factor (Karakozov, Maksimov, and Mashkov, 1976; Wang
and Chubukov, 2013), which appears to be approximately
a ≈ 0.25 ~Ω; see Eqs. (4.5) and (7.1). Awell-known McMillan-
Dynes expression (McMillan, 1968; Dynes, 1972) is widely
used in the literature:

Tc ¼ ð ~Ω=1.2Þ exp
�
− 1.04ð1þ λÞ
λ − μ�ð1þ 0.62λÞ

�
. ð3:8Þ

This expression is valid for λ≲ 1.5. Note that for small λ
Eq. (3.8) can be written in a form similar to Eq. (1.1) with
a ≈ 0.3 ~Ω, which is close to the value already mentioned. For
larger values of λ one should use a different expression, which
was obtained by numerical modification of Eq. (3.8) (Allen
and Dynes, 1975); see Sec. IV.A. One can also use the
expression valid for any λ (Kresin, 1987); see Eq. (7.1). Note
that for the case of very strong coupling (λ≳ 5; then πTc ≳ ~Ω)
the dependence of Tc on λ is entirely different from Eqs. (1.1)
and (3.8) (we omitted μ� for simplicity) and has the following
form:

Tc ¼ 0.18λ1=2 ~Ω ð3:9Þ

[see Allen and Dynes (1975) and Kresin, Gutfreund, and
Little (1984)].
In addition, one can introduce the following important

relation (McMillan, 1968):

λ ¼ hIi2ν=M ~Ω2 ð3:10Þ

(I describes the electron-phonon scattering, and ν is the
electronic density of states).
The important question is whether there exists an upper

limit of the value of Tc. A “myth,” which persists even today,
claims that the phonon mechanism is unable to provide the
values of the critical temperature higher than ∼30 K. For some
scientists the argumentation is based on Eqs. (3.8) and (3.10).
Indeed, neglecting μ� for simplicity and calculating ∂Tc=∂ ~Ω,
one can easily find the maximum value of Tc; this value
corresponds to λ ≈ 2. However, the McMillan equation is
valid only for λ≲ 1.5. This limitation was mentioned below
Eq. (3.8). In connection with this, note that the MacMillan-
Dynes equation (3.8) was obtained by taking into consid-
eration the renormalization function Z ≈ 1þ λ [see Eqs. (3.1)
and (3.3)] and by fitting the coefficients to describe the data on
Nb. The same limitation was obtained by Geilikman, Kresin,
and Masharov (1975), who analytically derived the equation
similar to (3.8) [see Eq. (4.6)]; the derivation is valid for

λ≲ 1.5 [then ðπTc= ~ΩÞ2 ≪ 1]. Therefore, the value λ ≈ 2 is
outside the range of the applicability of the MacMillan-Dynes
equation. One can see from Eq. (3.9) that the mentioned upper
limit for Tc does not exist.
Another erroneous restriction was imposed not on the

dependence of Tc on λ (see above), but on the limiting value
of the coupling constant λ itself. In the framework of the so-
called Froelich Hamiltonian Ĥ ¼ Ĥel þ Ĥph þ Ĥint, where
Ĥph contains the phonon frequency Ω0ðqÞ and Ĥint describes
the electron-phonon interaction, one obtains for the frequency
~Ω, renormalized by the electron-phonon interaction, that
~Ω ¼ Ω0ð1 − 2λÞ1=2. One concludes that the lattice becomes
unstable at a value of the coupling constant λ ¼ 0.5, and
therefore the value Tc ≤ 0.1 ~Ω [see Eq. (1.1), ~Ω ≈ ΩD]
provides the upper limit of the critical temperature. At the
same time, there exist many superconductors with λ > 0.5
(e.g., Sn, Pb, Hg). To clarify this point, an analysis based on
rigorous adiabatic theory was carried out (Browman and
Kagan, 1967; Geilikman, 1971). It was shown that the use
of the experimentally observable acoustic law for Ω0ðqÞ is not
self-consistent. The electron-ion interaction participates in the
formation of the phonon spectrum in the system, so that one is
dealing with a double counting.
Starting from the adiabatic theory with the Hamiltonian

Ĥ ¼ T̂r⃗ þ T̂R⃗ þ Vðr⃗; R⃗Þ [T̂r⃗ and T̂R⃗ are kinetic energy oper-
ators for electrons and ions, and Vðr⃗; R⃗Þ is the sum of the
Coulomb interactions] one can evaluate the electron-phonon
interaction and the phonon spectrum rigorously. The electron-
phonon interaction, indeed, leads to the formation of the
experimentally observed phonon spectrum, and the afore-
mentioned limitation on the value of the coupling constant is
absent.
There are superconductors with large values of the coupling

constant (e.g., λ ≈ 2.6 for Am-Pb0.45Bi0.55) (Wolf, 2012).
The combination of high characteristic phonon frequency
and large coupling constant can provide the high temperature
superconducting state. This is the case for the sulfur hydrides,
where such combination leads to a high value of Tc (see
Sec. IV).
Note also that the complex structure of the phonon spectra

requires a modification of the usual methods as discussed in
Sec. IV.B.

B. Function α2ðΩÞFðΩÞ: Tunneling spectroscopy

Tunneling spectroscopy of ordinary metals is the uniquely
powerful tool allowing us to obtain important information
about the energy spectrum of a superconductor. To be more
concrete, with the use of this technique, one can measure
the value of the energy gap, which includes the case of the
multigap structure of the spectrum (the case is relevant to the
hydrides, see Sec. VI.D). Moreover, it allows one to evaluate
such an important quantity as the function α2ðΩÞFðΩÞ; see
Eqs. (3.1)–(3.4).
The tunneling contact contains two electrodes separated by

a barrier. For the most interesting case of the S-I-N system
(S stands for a superconductor, N for a normal metal, and I for
an insulator), one can obtain the following relation [Schrieffer,

Scalapino, and Wilkins, 1963; see also the review by
Scalapino (1969)]:

σs=σN ¼ jωj½jωj2 − Δ2ðωÞ�−1=2. ð3:11Þ
Here σs is the tunneling conductivity, σs ¼ ∂j=∂V, j is the
tunneling current, and V is the applied voltage. ΔðωÞ
corresponds to the analytical continuation of ΔðωnÞ to the
real axis, and σN is the conductivity for the N-I-N junction.
The value of the energy gap ε0 is determined by ω ¼ ΔðiωÞ.
The quantity σs=σN can be measured experimentally [see

Eq. (3.11)]. Since this quantity has a sharp peak at ω ¼ ε0, the
tunneling can be used for measuring the value of the energy
gap that corresponds to the peak in the density of states. Note
that the observation, say, of two peaks would manifest the
presence of the two energy gaps (see Sec. VI.D).
The special inversion procedure, allowing one to recon-

struct the function α2ðΩÞFðΩÞ and the value of μ� was
developed by McMillan and Rowell (1965) [see Rowell
(1969) and Wolf (2012)]. Usually the function α2ðΩÞFðΩÞ
contains peaks; they correspond to peaks in phonon density of
states. Note that, in turn, the function FðΩÞ can be measured
independently by the neutron scattering technique. The
coincidence of the peaks obtained by these two methods
(i.e., tunneling spectroscopy and neutron scattering) is crucial
evidence of the fact that the pairing, indeed, is caused by the
phonon mechanism.
For the sulfur hydrides the tunneling spectroscopy has not

been performed yet. It would be interesting to develop
tunneling spectroscopy and determine the important function
α2ðΩÞFðΩÞ for these new materials.
Note that the tunneling measurements under pressure were

performed by Zavaritskii, Itskevich, and Voronovskii (1971) to
study properties of Pb. Asmentioned, this method has not been
used so far for sulfur hydride and the function α2ðΩÞFðΩÞ and
the energy gap have not been determined experimentally. In
what follows we are using the results of several theoretical
papers describing the calculations of α2ðΩÞFðΩÞ performed
with use of the density-functional formalism (see Sec. IV.A).

IV. SULFUR HYDRIDES

A. Phonon spectrum and the electron-phonon interaction

Let us now turn our attention to the material of interest,
sulfur hydride. As noted, the Cooper pairing in the super-
conducting state is provided by the electron-phonon inter-
action and the main role is played by high-frequency optical
modes. This mechanism is manifested in the large value of the
isotope coefficient for substitution of deuterium for hydrogen
(see Sec. V).
In principle, the value of the critical temperature can be

evaluated with the help of Eqs. (3.1) and (3.3), which contain
the function α2ðΩÞFðΩÞ. As mentioned, the tunneling mea-
surements allowing one to reconstruct this function have not
been performed yet. Instead, we use results of the calculations
carried out by several groups. For example, Fig. 6 shows the
function α2ðΩÞFðΩÞ calculated by Duan et al. (2014) both for
the high-Tc phase (Tc ¼ 203 K) and for the structure with the
lower value of the critical temperature (Tc ≈ 120 K). For

comparison, one can see the pictures for Pb, the conventional
superconductor (Fig. 5). The lattice dynamics and super-
conducting properties were treated with use of the density-
functional theory ( Baroni et al., 2001) and the quantum
expresso code (Paolo, 2009). Results for the function
α2ðΩÞFðΩÞ are also given by Durajski, Szczesniak, and Li
(2015), Errea et al. (2015), and Sano et al. (2016). As
mentioned, all these calculations are based on the density-
functional formalism, but because of using different codes
they differ in details, which lead to some spread in the
numerical results. Nevertheless, the calculated density of
states FðΩÞ and the functions α2ðΩÞFðΩÞ are rather similar.
One can see from Fig. 6 that for sulfur hydride the function

α2ðΩÞFðΩÞ has a rather complicated structure. Indeed, in
addition to acoustic modes, it contains a number of optical
phonons. Moreover, because of high frequencies of optical
modes, the phonon spectrum is broad and extended up to
200 meV [Fig. 5(c)].
As mentioned in Sec. III.A, the value of the critical

temperature can be found without invoking the coupling
constant concept (Akashi et al., 2015; Errea et al., 2015;
Flores-Livas, Sanna, and Gross, 2016; Sano et al., 2016). Such
a program was carried out in the framework of the super-
conducting density-functional theory (Luders et al., 2005).
Errea et al. (2015) used the equation, similar to Eq. (3.1) with
the replacementjωnj → ½ω2n þ Δ2ðωnÞ�1=2 in the denominator
of the integrand. This equation is valid at any temperature. The
value of Tc was calculated from such a nonlinear equation by
successive approximations. With each iteration the value of

order parameter ΔðωnÞ decreases, and Tc was identified as the
point (after up to 512 iterations) where the order parameter
approaches zero.
According to Errea et al. (2015) and Sano et al. (2016), an

important role is played by anharmonicity. For example,
taking anharmonicity into account noticeably shifts the value
of Tc by as much as up to ∼60 K: from Tc ≈ 260 K to Tc ≈
200 K in the high-Tc phase. The role of anharmonicity and
quantum effects was analyzed with the use of the so-called
stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation, developed
by Errea, Calandra, and Mauri (2014). The impact of the zero
point motion was analyzed by Bianconi and Jarlborg (2015a)
and Sano et al. (2016). The effects of anharmonicity and zero
point motion could be essential, because of the small mass of
the hydrogen ions. The problems raised in the aforementioned
papers deserve further study.
As noticed in the previous section, the concept of the

coupling constant was fruitful for studying conventional
superconductors. A similar approach was used by Li et al.
(2014) and Papaconstantopoulos et al. (2015) to calculate Tc
for sulfur hydrides. Since the value of the total coupling
constant is large λ ≳ 2 (see Fig. 6), they did not use Eq. (3.8),
but a more general expression (Allen and Dynes, 1975):

Tc ¼
f1f2 ~Ωlog

1.2
exp

�
− 1.04ð1þ λÞ
λ − μ� − 0.62λμ�

�
. ð4:1Þ

Equation (4.1) is similar to Eq. (3.8), but the preexponential
factor is multiplied by the product f1f2; the functions f1 and
f2 are numerically fit for the solution valid at larger λ and have
the following form:

f1 ¼ ½1þ ðλ=Λ1Þ3=2�1=3;
f2 ¼ 1þ λ2ð ~Ω=Ωlog − 1Þðλ2 þΛ22Þ−1;
Λ1 ¼ 2.46ð1þ 3.8μ∗Þ;
Λ2 ¼ 1.82ð1þ 6.3μ∗Þð ~Ω=ΩlogÞ.

The large value of the constant for the coupling to character-
istic phonon frequency leads to a high Tc close to that
observed experimentally.
The phonon spectrum of the sulfur hydrides is broad and

rather complex: it contains a number of optical and acoustic
branches. On the other hand, these branches are well sepa-
rated, and this separation allows us to develop a different
approach, which will be described in the next section.

B. Generalized equation and two coupling constants

In a more general approach (Gor’kov and Kresin, 2016) the
value of Tc was evaluated analytically. As will be shown, it
allows us to compare the relative contributions of the optical
and acoustic modes for different parts of the phase diagram.
The phonon spectrum contains two well-separated fre-

quency intervals for the optical and acoustic branches. Let
us introduce the coupling constants λopt and λac for each of

these regions and the corresponding average frequencies ~Ωopt
and ~Ωac. Then the equation for the order parameter at T ¼ Tc
takes the following form [cf. Eq. (3.5)]:

FIG. 6. The spectral function α2ðΩÞFðΩÞ and the electron-
phonon coupling constant λðΩÞ (dashed lines) for the low-Tc and
high-Tc phases of the sulfur hydride. The function λðΩÞ is
defined by Eq. (3.4) with the phonon frequency Ω as the upper
limit: (a) the functions α2ðΩÞFðΩÞ and λðΩÞ for the low-Tc
phase. (b) The functions α2ðΩÞFðΩÞ and λðΩÞ for the high-Tc
phase. Units: dimensionless quantities α2ðΩÞFðΩÞ and λðΩÞ
(horizontal axis) and the phonon frequency (vertical axis). The
acoustic and optical branches are separated at ∼15 THZ. From
Duan et al., 2014.

The critical temperature must be calculated with the use of
Eq. (4.2). This equation is the generalization of Eq. (3.5) for
the presence of two phonon groups, the acoustic and opti-
cal modes.

C. Critical temperatures for different phases

Let us assume that in the high Tc phase (Im-3m) λopt ≫ λac.
We also suppose that λopt ≲ 1.5. As will be shown, these
conditions are indeed satisfied. From Eqs. (4.2) and (4.2’) one
can obtain expressions for Tc in an analytical form and, hence,
evaluate the value of the critical temperature for the sulfur
hydrides.
Let us write Tc as

Tc ¼ T0c þ ΔTacc ; T0c ≡ Toptc ; ð4:3Þ
and assume that ΔTacc ≪ T0c. Based on Eq. (4.2), with the use
of these assumptions, one can obtain the following analytical
expression for the critical temperature of the high-Tc phase
(Gor’kov and Kresin, 2016):

Tc ¼
�
1þ 2 λac

λopt − μ�

1þ ðπT0c=ΩacÞ2

T0c. ð4:4Þ

For T0c, one can use the McMillan-Dynes expression
[Eq. (3.8)], which is valid for λopt ≲ 1.5:

T0c ¼ ð ~Ωopt=1.2Þ exp
�
− 1.04ð1þ λoptÞ
λopt − μ�ð1þ 0.62λoptÞ

One can use the close expression, obtained analytically by
Geilikman, Kresin, and Masharov (1975), valid also for
λopt ≲ 1.5:

T0c ≈ ~Ωopt exp
�
− 1þ 1.5λopt
λopt − μ�ð1þ 0.5λoptÞ

�
. ð4:6Þ

As is known the coefficients in Eq. (4.5) were selected to fit
the data for Nb. As for Eq. (4.6), it was obtained using the
analytical solution of Eq. (3.5). Note that these expressions are
rather similar. Indeed, by neglecting μ� for simplicity, one can
write Eqs. (4.5) and (4.6) in the form Tc ≈ A expð−1=λoptÞ,
with close values of the preexponential factor.

For ordinary superconductors the values of the coupling
constants and μ� (usually μ � ≈0.1–0.15) can be determined
from tunneling spectroscopy measurements ( Wolf, 2012). For
sulfur hydride, we deduce the coupling constants λopt and λac
from several theoretical calculations of α2ðΩÞFðΩÞ. Although
the corresponding theoretical results differ somewhat, they are
relatively close. The values of λopt and λac can be directly
determined from λðΩÞ (Fig. 6).We estimate λopt ≈ 1.5 and
λac ≈ 0.5; see Fig. 6(b). We assumed that λopt ≲ 1.5 and
λopt ≫ λac. One can see that the obtained values are consistent
with these approximations. Using these coupling constants
and taking the values ~Ωopt ¼ 1700 K and ~Ωac ¼ 450 K
[μ� ≈ 0.14, which is close to that for usual superconductors
and was also calculated by Flores-Livas, Sanna, and Gross
(2016)], we obtain T0c ≡ Toptc ¼ 170 K and ΔTacc ¼ 45 K, so
that in total Tc ≈ 215 K, in quite good agreement with the
value of Tc ≈ 203 K observed by Drozdov et al. (2015). The
main contribution comes from the optical phonons; this
confirms the self-consistency of our approach.
The fact that the coupling constant λopt in the cubic phase is

so large is the key factor underlying the observed high
Tc ≈ 203 K. Qualitatively, this comes about due to the ability
of sulfur to retain several hydrogen atoms in its proximity, that
is, to the presence of many light ligands near the S atoms.
There are six ligands in the high-Tc phase [see Fig. 3(c)].
To demonstrate the importance of this point, let us evaluate

the value of Tc for the low-Tc phase (R3m structure). One can
see from Fig. 6(a) (Duan et al., 2014) that the coupling
constants for this phase are λopt ≈ λac ≈ 1. It is interesting that
in this case the value of the total coupling constant λT ¼
λopt þ λac ≈ 2 and is close to that in the high-Tc phase.
However, the relative contributions are shifted toward low
frequencies; the value of λac is larger for the low-Tc phase. In
this case Tc < ~Ωac ≪ ~Ωopt, and one can estimate Tc within the
usual BCS logarithmic approximation while adding the
renormalization function Z ≈ 1þ λT into the exponent
(Grimvall, 1981)

Tc ≈ ð ~ΩoptÞλopt=λT ð ~ΩacÞλac=λT exp
�
− 1þ λT
λT − μ�

�
. ð4:7Þ

With ~Ωopt ≈ 105 meV, ~Ωac ≈ 26 meV (Duan et al., 2014), we
obtain Tc ≈ 120 K.
The transition into the high-Tc phase is accompanied by the

redistribution of the interaction of electrons with optical
phonons and their interaction with acoustic branches. This
redistribution is manifested in an increase in a number of
hydrogen ligands, caused by the structural transition. This is a
key factor determining a record high value of Tc.
Dividing the phonon spectrum and, correspondingly, the

electron-phonon interaction into two parts turns out to be
rather fruitful. First, the value of λopt is within the range of
applicability of Eq. (4.5). Moreover, one can evaluate the
relative contribution of the optical and acoustic branches of
the phonon spectrum to Tc. For the high-Tc phase the
contribution from the optical phonons comprises ∼80% and
only ∼20% is due to the acoustic part. The impact of acoustic

phonons is noticeably smaller than that of optical branches
(45 vs 170 K), but still is essential.
The method proposed can be of relevance for other

materials as well. A promising example is calcium hydride
CaH6 (see Sec. VII.A).
It is known that for a number of superconductors the value of

the electron-phonon coupling constant is large, among them Pb
(λ ≈ 1.55), Hg (λ ≈ 1.6), and AmPb0.45Bi0.55 (λ ≈ 2.6); see,
e.g.,Wolf (2012). However, because of low values of character-
istic phonon frequencies, the values of the critical temperature
for them are not large. A uniqueness of the hydrides is that they
combine the strong coupling, especially to optical modes, with
high values of the characteristic frequencies.

V. ISOTOPE EFFECT

According to Drozdov et al. (2015), the substitution of
deuterium for hydrogen noticeably affects the value of the
critical temperature. Observation of this isotope effect is of
fundamental importance, since it proves (a) that the high-Tc
state is caused by the electron-phonon interaction, and (b) that
the high frequency hydrogen modes determine the value of Tc.
Indeed, the optical modes are mainly due to the motion of
hydrogen, whereas for the acoustic modes the participation of
sulfur ions prevails. Therefore the magnitude of the isotope
shift for the deuterium for hydrogen substitution indirectly
reflects the relative contributions of each group (the optical
versus acoustic ones) into the observed Tc. Defining the
isotope coefficient via Tc ∝ M−α one can obtain the following
expression for α (Gor’kov and Kresin, 2016):

α ¼ −ðM=TcÞð∂Tc=∂ ~ΩÞð∂ ~Ω=∂MÞ. ð5:1Þ
Since the deuterium substitution affects the optical modes,

one can write Eq. (5.1) in the following form (in the harmonic
approximation, ~Ω ∝ M−1=2):

α ¼ 0.5ð ~Ωopt=TcÞð∂Tc=∂ ~ΩoptÞ. ð5:2Þ
The value of the isotope coefficient in the high-Tc phase can
be calculated with the use of Eqs. (4.4) and (5.2). As a result,
we obtain

α ≈
1

2

�
1 − 4 λac

λopt

ðρ2 þ 1Þ2
�
. ð5:3Þ

Here ρ¼ ~Ωac=πT0c. With λopt≈1.5, λac≈0.5, and ~Ωac≈450K,
we obtain α ≈ 0.35, in a good agreement with the exper-
imental data in Fig. 4.
One should use a different expression, Eq. (4.7), for Tc in

the low-Tc phase. Then, with the use of Eq. (5.2), one can find
α ≈ 0.25, which is noticeably smaller than that for the high-Tc
phase. Note that the agreement between the value obtained
from Eq. (5.3) and the experimental data is rather good for the
high-Tc phase. As for the low-Tc phase, the data are not so
well determined. It would be interesting to perform the
measurements at lower pressures, at the values more distant
from the region of the transition into the high-Tc phase. As
mentioned in Sec. II.B, at low pressures a formation of the
H3S phase occurs [see Eq. (2.1)]. According to Akashi et al.
(2016), the transformation occurs through intermediate

structures. In other words, we are dealing with the coexistence
of phases and the percolation scenario, so the percolation
threshold corresponds to the formation of the so-called infinite
cluster, that is, to the metallic state. As a result, the R3m phase
contains some inclusions. Then one can expect the pressure
dependence of the isotope coefficient inside of the R3m phase.
Note that the usual analytical derivation of the value of the

isotope coefficient is carried out under the assumption that
the ionic mass is a continuous variable. It is essential that the
obtained value of α appears to be independent of M. It allows
one to use it for different values of the ionic mass, even though
the latest has discrete values. Qualitatively this means that the
shift in the value of Tc stays the same within the phase, so that
the dependences Tc (P) for different isotopes are parallel to
each other. For example, in our case the shift is described by
THc =TDc ¼ ðMD=MHÞα. In the high-Tc phase α ≈ 0.35, and,
therefore, THc =TDc ≈ 1.25. Since THc ¼ 203 K, we obtain
TDc ≈ 165 K. This value is in rather good agreement with
the measurements by Drozdov et al. (2015).
The value of the isotope coefficient in the high-Tc phase is

relatively large and it reflects the fact that the pairing in this
phase is dominated by the optical H modes, whereas in the
low-Tc phase the contributions of the optical and acoustic
modes are comparable. The impact of the isotopic substitution
in the region of smaller Tc is weaker than in the high-Tc phase.
A smaller α is in agreement with the larger role played by the
optical phonons in the cubic high-Tc phase
Note that the value of α can be affected by the anharmo-

nicity (Errea et al., 2015) and by the dependence of μ� on ~Ωopt,
although the last contribution is of the order of ðμ�=λoptÞ2 and
is small. However, the main conclusion that the value of the
isotope coefficient depends on pressure and is different in
different phases remains valid and reflects the relative con-
tributions of the optical and acoustic modes.

VI. ENERGY SPECTRUM OF THE HIGH-Tc PHASE:
TWO-GAP STRUCTURE AND NONMONOTONIC
DEPENDENCE OF Tc

A. Structural transition: High-Tc phase

Asmentioned, the pressure dependence is highly asymmetric
relative to its maximum value Tc;max ¼ 203 K. The value of
Tc ≈ 120 K atP ≈ 125 GPa sharply increases toTc ≈ 200 K at
P ≈ 150 GPa (Drozdov et al., 2015; Einaga et al., 2016).
A rapid increase in Tc is followed by a slow decrease at
P > Pcr ≈ 150 GPa (Fig. 4). Remarkably, the structural tran-
sition into the high Tc phase takes place somewhere in the same
pressure interval where it is accompanied by a sharp increase in
the value of the critical temperature. Currently, it is generally
accepted that the Bravais lattices of the high Tc and low Tc
phases belong to different symmetries (the Im-3m group for the
high-Tc cubic phase and the trigonal R3m symmetry group for
the low Tc phase) and that the structural phase transition
between them occurs at a pressure somewhere in between
P ≤ 150 and P ≥ 125 GPa. The sharpness of the increase
prompts the question whether transition into the high Tc phase
could be a first-order transition. This scenario was discussed by
Gor’kov and Kresin (2017) with the use of the group theory and

Lev P. Gor’kov and Vladimir Z. Kresin: Colloquium: High pressure and road to room …

Rev. Mod. Phys., Vol. 90, No. 1, January–March 2018 011001-10



taking into consideration the impact of lattice deformations.
The picture is similar to those considered by Larkin and Pikin
(1969) and later by Barzykin and Gor’kov (2009): the coupling
to lattice can transform the second-order transition into the
transition of the first order. The idea of the first-order transition
allows us to explain self-consistently the slow decrease in Tc
with an increase in pressure above the pressure Pcr correspond-
ing to the maximum of Tc ¼ 203 K. The appearance of the
two-gap spectrum is an important ingredient of the picture (see
Sec. VI.D).
According to the band structure calculations (Duan et al.,

2014; Akashi et al., 2015; Errea et al., 2015, 2016; Heil and
Boeri, 2015; Flores-Livas, Sanna, and Gross, 2016), the high-
Tc compound is characterized by broad energy bands (large
Fermi surface) and strong interaction between electrons and
high-frequency optical phonons. The calculated values of Tc
and the isotope coefficient are in good agreement with the
experimental data (see Secs. IV.C and V).
Meanwhile, the calculations also revealed the presence in

the high Tc phase of small Fermi pockets. The importance of
their existence was emphasized by Bianconi and Jarlborg
(2015a, 2015b), who suggested that the pockets play a special
role in increasing Tc. Note, however, that the analysis of the
electron-phonon mediated pairing on pockets should be
carried out with considerable care. Let us discuss this point
in more detail.

B. Migdal adiabaticity criterion and small pockets

The complex structure of the Fermi surface with small
pockets emerging in addition to several large Fermi sheets is
not uncommon for many novel superconductors such, for
instance, as the high Tc oxides, low-dimensional organic
conductors, the so-called heavy fermions (Gor’kov, 2012).
Here we focus on the possible impact of small pockets on the
superconductivity in hydrides.
The main equation, Eq. (3.1) is valid if the so-called

adiabatic parameter ð ~Ω=EFÞ is small ( ~Ω=EF ≪ 1) [Migdal
(1958), see also the review by Scalapino (1969)]. Then one
can neglect all higher order corrections (the so-called “vertex
corrections”), containing the products of the matrix elements
of the electron-phonon interaction. Then the right-hand side of
the equation for the order parameter is linear in the coupling
constant λ [see Eq. (3.5) and also Eq. (3.6)].The value of the
coupling constant is expressed by Eq. (3.10). According to
Migdal (1958), the correction to Eq. (3.1) contains an addi-
tional term ∝ λ3ð ~Ω=EFÞ.
Therefore, the inequality ~Ω ≪ EF allows us to neglect the

higher order corrections. If ~Ω≳ EF, one should include the
contribution of all higher terms. But the rigorous calculations
of even the second term (Grimaldi, Pietronero, and Strassler,
1995) appear to be a nontrivial task. At this point we meet with
the problem, which at the present time remains unresolved.
The case of the weak electron-phonon coupling (λ ≪ 1) is

the exception (Gor’kov, 2016). Because of the smallness of λ,
the vortex corrections can be neglected.
The condition ~Ω=EF ≪ 1 is satisfied for most conventional

superconductors, since usually in metals the Fermi energy is
large compared with the Debye energy EF ≫ ~Ω ∼ ΩD.

However, this is not the case for pockets in the sulfur
hydrides, since for these materials the characteristic frequency
of optical modes ~Ωopt ≈ ð1.5–2Þ100 meV, whereas the Fermi
energy of a pocket is of the order of ≈40–50 meV. The
electron-phonon interaction on the pockets can be rigorously
treated only in the case of weak coupling, that is, if the
corresponding coupling constant λP ≪ 1.

C. Wide energy bands and pockets

The calculated spectra of electrons display small pockets
only inside of the high Tc phase and it may be tempting to
relate the high value of Tc to the appearance of the pockets
(Bianconi and Jarlborg, 2015a, 2015b; Quan and Pickett,
2016). In this scenario, the major pairing interaction occurs on
the pockets. As for the electron-phonon interaction on the
larger bands, it is weak and plays only a secondary role.
At this point it is worth noting that the calculations of Tc

performed assuming the prevailing role of the large bands and
sufficiently strong coupling are in good agreement with the
experimental data (see Sec. IV), so that there is no special need
for modifying the picture. Besides that, if one is trying to
assign the leading role to pockets, then it is clear that the on-
pocket interactions should be rather strong in order to provide
high Tc. However, in this case the rigorous treatment is not
known, because of the violation of the Migdal theorem. On the
other hand, if the main contributions into the interaction were
coming from the large bands, then the contribution of the
pockets could be assumed weak, and the case could be
analyzed self-consistently.
Note also, and this is a strong argument, that if the leading

role of pockets were due to a peak in their density of states,
this would produce a prefactor in the expression for Tc of an
electronic origin. However, such a prefactor cannot depend on
the ionic mass in strong contradiction with the observed
isotope effect (Drozdov et al., 2015).

D. Two-gap spectrum: Slow decrease in Tc at P > Pcr

In the superconducting state the pockets are characterized
by the energy gaps in their electronic spectrum. Next we
consider such a two-gap model with one gap corresponding to
the wide band and the second gap describing the excitations
on the pocket.
The two-gap model was introduced shortly after the

creation of the BCS theory (Suhl, Matthias, and Walker,
1959; Moskalenko, 1959). From what follows, we stipulated
that under the notion of the two-gap spectrum we mean the
presence of two peaks in the density of states.
Each band has its own set of Cooper pairs. Since a single

pair is formed by two electrons with equal and opposite
momenta, one can neglect pairing between electrons belong-
ing to different bands. Indeed, in general, the electrons on the
Fermi level, which belong to different bands, have different
values of the momenta. However, in the two-band model, the
absence of the interband pairing does not mean that the pairing
within each band is insensitive to the presence of the other
band. Indeed, the presence of the second band gives rise to an
additional pairing channel. Namely, the electron originally
located on the first band can radiate a phonon and make the

Rev. Mod. Phys., Vol. 90, No. 1, January–March 2018 011001-11



virtual transition into the second band. The second electron
can absorb the phonon and also make a transition into the
second band forming the pair with the first electron.
Therefore, owing to the interband electron-phonon scattering
the on-the-pocket electrons can form the Cooper pairs on the
large Fermi surface and vice versa.
Let us stress one important point. As noted, the two-gap

model was introduced shortly after the creation of the BCS
theory. Nevertheless, the two-gap phenomenon has not been
essential for the conventional superconductors. This is due to
the large coherence length; more specifically, the inequality
l ≪ ξ (l is the mean free path), which holds for the usual
superconductors, leads to the averaging caused by the inter-
band impurity scattering. As a result, the two-gap picture is
washed out and the usual one-gap picture is applicable.
The two-gap spectrum was observed for the first time in the

Nb-doped SrTiO3 system (Binnig et al., 1980) with the use of
the scanning tunneling microscope technique. The second gap
appears as a result of doping and filling the second gap. At
present, the two-gap picture is an important feature of the
novel superconducting systems, and this is due to their short
coherence length. It was observed in the cuprates (Geerk,
Xi, and Linder, 1988), in MgB2 (Uchiyama et al., 2002;
Tsuda et al., 2003); see the review by Kresin, Morawitz, and
Wolf (2014).
At the formulation of the two-gap model for the high-Tc

phase of sulfur hydrides one can introduce three coupling
constants: λL, responsible for strong electron-phonon inter-
actions on the large band, λP ≪ 1 (weak coupling on the
pockets), and λLP ≪ 1, describing the transitions from large
band electrons to the pairing states on the pockets. The
coupling constants λL, λP, and λLP are described by
Eq. (3.10); the constant λLP contains the matrix element
describing the interband transitions caused by the electron-
phonon interaction. Note also that, because of the interband
transitions, the system has the common temperature of the
superconducting transition Tc. In addition, their presence is
beneficial for superconductivity.
Performing the calculations (Gor’kov and Kresin, 2016),

one can show that the shift in Tc caused by the presence of
pockets is proportional to the density of the states on the
pockets ΔTc ∝ νPðEFÞ
We now return to the problem of the strong asymmetry in

the pressure dependence of Tc relative to the position of its
maximum value at Tc;max ≃ 203 K (at Pcr ≃ 150 GPa) posed
in Sec. II.C. Assume that the sharp increase in Tc (from Tc ≈
120 K to Tc;max ≈ 200 K) is the result of the first-order
structural transition into the high-Tc cubic phase. This phase
is characterized by the coexistence of wide band (responsible
for the large part of the Fermi surface) and small pockets.
As mentioned, the interaction between the large band and

the pocket leads to the shift in the temperature of transition
ΔTc ¼ Tc − Tc0, which is proportional to the density of states
on the pocket νPðEFÞ ∝ mPPF;poc, where mP and PF;poc are
the effective mass and momentum for the pocket’s states, and
Tc0 is the value of the critical temperature in the absence of the
pockets. It is essential that the pockets appear instantly, as a
result of the discontinuous first-order transition or the tran-
sition into the high-Tc phase either is of the second order or is

of a topological nature at which the pocket’s size would grow
continuously with the further increase in pressure.
We have given arguments in favor of the first-order tran-

sition, which is accompanied by the emerging singularity in the
density of states in the form of pockets. The further increase in
pressure leads to shrinking of the pocket with an effective
decrease in their Fermi momentum pF;poc and the correspond-
ing depression of the two-gap picture. Since the two-gap
scenario is beneficial for superconductivity, such a depression
leads to a decrease in Tc. This explains the observed slow
decrease in Tc after the transition; the small scale of the
decrease inTc atP > Pcr is related to small values of λP and λLP
The two-gap spectrum and its evolution with pressure

including the decrease in the amplitude of the second gap
at P > Pcr must be confirmed by future tunneling experi-
ments. The presence of the second energy gap will be
manifested as the second peak in the density of states.

VII. OTHER HYDRIDES

The S-H system appears to be the first hydride which
displays a record high value of Tc. We described (Sec. II) the
development of the field. Let us discuss here several other
studied hydrides, which display interesting and promising
properties.
As was emphasized in the Introduction and Sec. IV,

the theoretical studies containing predictions of specific
hydrides along with values of Tc and the pressures deserve
special credit. In this section we will be talking about
promising compounds. As mentioned, the group of Y. Ma
made a very important prediction related to sulfur hydrides
(Li et al., 2014). This group made several other interesting
predictions, which are waiting their future confirmations
[Peng et al., 2017; see the review by Zhang et al. (2017)].
They predicted the high-Tc superconducting state for calcium
hydride (Tc ≈ 240 K) (Wang et al., 2012; Wang and Ma,
2014) and for YH6 (Tc ≈ 264 K) (Li et al., 2015). Note that
the compound MgH6 similar to CaH6 was also studied (Feng
et al., 2015) and the values of Tc ≈ 260 K at P≳ 300 GPa
were predicted. Even higher values of Tc were obtained by
Szczesniak and Durajski (2016). The next section contains the
description of the calcium hydride and MgH6; these are
examples of the future high-Tc compounds.

A. Calcium hydride, MgH6

Calcium hydride CaH6 was analyzed by Wang et al. (2012)
and looks very promising. Wang et al. evaluated its structure
and the function α2ðΩÞFðΩÞ (Fig. 7). Based on the numerical
solution of Eqs. (3.1) and (3.3), they predicted that at
pressures P ≈ 150 GPa the value of Tc will be higher than
that for H3S.
The value of Tc for CaH6 can be evaluated with use of

Eqs. (4.2) and (4.4). Indeed, in accordance with an approach
described in Sec. IV.B, the electron-phonon interaction can be
separated into two parts. From Fig. 7 one can determine that
λopt ≈ 2.1, λac ≈ 0.6, ~Ωac ¼ 350 sm−1, and ~Ωopt ¼ 820 sm−1.
Correspondingly, one can write Tc ¼ T0c þ ΔTacc , where
T0c ≡ Toptc is determined by the contribution of the optical

Rev. Mod. Phys., Vol. 90, No. 1, January–March 2018 011001-12



modes. However, because of the large value of λopt, the
MacMillan-Dynes expression for T0c [Eq. (4.5)] is not appli-
cable (it is valid for λopt ≲ 1.5). One can use the modified
MacMillan equation, Eq. (4.1), valid for larger λ. Another
option is to use the analytical expression, valid for any value of
the coupling constant (Kresin, 1987; Kresin and Wolf, 2009):

T0c ¼
0.25 ~Ωopt

½e2=λeff − 1�1=2 ;
λeff ¼ ðλopt − μ�Þ½1þ 2μ� þ λoptμ�tðλoptÞ�−1;
tðxÞ ¼ 1.5 expð−0.28xÞ. ð7:1Þ

With the use of Eq. (7.1) and the parameters for CaH6, we
obtain Tc ≈ 230 K. This value contains the contributions of
the optical (T0c) and acoustic (ΔTc) modes: T0c ≈ 180 K and
ΔTc ≈ 50 K. Therefore, the optical and acoustic modes
contribute 78% and 22% to the total value of the critical
temperature, correspondingly. As for the isotope coefficient,
one can obtain from Eq. (5.3) the value α ≈ 0.36; it is close to
that for the high phase of the sulfur hydrides.
The hydride MgH6 studied by Feng et al. (2015) and

Szczesniak and Durajski (2016) has properties similar to those
for the calcium hydride. The structure contains the sodalitelike
hydrogen cage with interstitial Ca (Mg) atoms (Fig. 7). This is
not occasional, since the Mg and Ca atoms have similar
chemical properties. As mentioned, the predicted values of Tc
are even higher than for sulfur hydrides.

B. Palladium hydride

In principle, palladium hydride (Pd-H) is not a new
superconductor. It was discovered by Stritzer and Buckel
(1972); its Tc ≈ 8–10 K. This hydride was known by the value
of the isotope coefficient, which appears to be negative.
This phenomenon was explained by strong anharmonicity
(Ganzuly, 1973; Klein and Cohen, 1992), namely, by the
peculiar dependence of the phonon frequency on ionic mass.

According to the study by Syed et al. (2016), one can
observe the superconducting state of Pd-H at higher temper-
atures (Tc ≈ 54 K for Pd-H and Tc ≈ 60 K for Pd-D; the
isotope coefficient is negative, as for the usual compound). It
is important that such an increase in Tc has been observed at
the ambient pressure. It occurs, thanks to a special sample
preparation, namely, because of fast cooling of the hydride.
The result looks interesting, because the superconducting

state persists up to high temperature at ambient pressure. They
observed a drastic drop in resistance. However, the Meissner
effect has not been demonstrated yet, as well as the impact of
the magnetic field on Tc. Of course, it would be interesting if
future experiments confirm the presence of superconductivity
at elevated temperatures.

C. Transition of ice under high pressure and by doping

In general, the transition of an insulator into a metallic state
can proceed through two channels: either via doping (e.g.,
high-Tc cuprates, fullerides) or by an increase in pressure
(e.g., hydrides). The recent paper by Flores-Livas, Sanna et al.
(2016) is interesting, because they considered theoretically the
transition, caused by a combination of these channels. They
studied the properties of H2O, which can be transferred into a
solid phase (ice) by applied pressure (up to P ≈ 150 GPa).
The crystal continues to be an insulator at this pressure. It was
proposed that the sample in the solid phase can be doped by
nitrogen. The calculation demonstrates that, as a result of such
a doping under pressure, the material becomes metallic and
even superconducting with a rather high value of Tc ≈ 60 K.
Note that at ambient pressure and also at low pressure (up to

P ≈ 110 GPa) the oxygen ion has four hydrogen neighbors
(so-called phase I). Two of these neighbors are covalently
bonded with oxygen and form the H2O molecule, and the
other two ions formed additional hydrogen bonds. The lengths
of the bonds are different and the structure is asymmetric.
However, at higher pressures (of the order of P ≈ 300 GPa)
the so-called ice X phase is formed and it is characterized by
symmetric O-H bonds (Goncharov et al., 1999).
As noted, at P ≈ 150 GPa the ice crystal is still in the

insulating state. To prompt a transition into a metallic state one
needs to use doping and it turns out that nitrogen is the best
dopant. The nitrogen for the oxygen substitution leads to the
hole conductivity. Moreover, the transition into a metallic state
is accompanied by changes in the phonon spectrum. All these
changes provide the transition into a superconducting state.
The calculations show that the best value of the superconduct-
ing parameters correspond to relatively low doping (4%–6%).
The calculated α2ðΩÞFðΩÞ function leads to the value
of Tc ≈ 60 K. Of course, this value is below Tc ≈ 203 K
observed for the H3S phase of sulfur hydride, but still is rather
high.
The idea of combining high pressure and doping is elegant

and looks promising. One has to wait and see whether the
future experiments will confirm this interesting prediction.

D. Organic hydrides

The presence of hydrogen and corresponding high vibra-
tional frequency is beneficial for the formation of the

FIG. 7. Superconducting calcium hydride: (a) structure of
CaH6; (b) the spectral function α2ðΩÞFðΩÞ for CaH6. From

superconducting state. As noted in the previous section,
it can be manifested even at ambient pressure. In conne-
ction with this, the recent discovery of superconductivity
in the organic compound, consisting of C and H elements,
so-called poly(p-phenylene) and doped with potassium
(Wang et al., 2017) looks promising. The value of Tc is
rather high (Tc ≈ 120 K); this value is the highest among
organic superconductors. Organics is a relatively young
family of superconducting materials. The first organic
superconductor was discovered by Jerome et al. (1980):
the complex material ðTMTSFÞ2PF6 displayed the property
at Tc ≈ 0.9 K under the pressure of around 9 kbar. The
recent discovery was made by Wang et al. in the high-
pressure laboratory, but the effect was observed at ambient
pressure. The mechanism of superconductivity in this new
material and an impact of the hydrogen bonding and high-
frequency modes should be studied in full detail. As a
whole, this new class of organic hydrides looks important
and deserves further study.

VIII. MAIN CHALLENGES

The recent discovery of the record-breaking high-Tc com-
pound, sulfur hydride, signifies the arrival of a novel family of
high temperature superconductors: the hydrides. Even higher
values of Tc can be expected. That is, it finally becomes
realistic to envision the detection of superconductivity at room
temperatures. The search for novel hydrides with still higher
values of Tc (including CaH6, YH6) is an important direction
of future research.
More detailed x-ray diffraction of sulfur hydrides will

establish the position of the sulfur atoms with high accuracy
and clarify the nature of the phase transition between the
low-Tc and high-Tc phases.
Development of tunneling spectroscopy of the high-Tc

hydrides is another important forthcoming task. Because of
the large values of Tc and the energy gap, the tunneling IðVÞ
characteristic needs to be measured for a wider energy interval
as compared to that for conventional superconductors. But
similar measurements have been performed for the high-Tc
cuprates by Aminov et al. (1994) and Ponomarev et al. (1999)
with the use of the break junction technique, and by Lee et al.
(2006) with scanning tunneling spectroscopy; see the review
by Kresin and Wolf (2009). Therefore tunneling spectroscopy
should be successfully applicable for sulfur hydrides as well.
As a result, it will be possible to reconstruct the α2ðΩÞFðΩÞ
function as well as to determine the Coulomb pseudopotential
μ�. Tunneling spectroscopy can also be employed for meas-
uring other important parameters of the system, including the
energy gap, and for observing the multigap structure and its
evolution with pressure (see Sec. VI).
And, of course, following detailed studies of the structure of

the high-Tc phase under pressure, there remains the most
intriguing question: Is it possible to create analogous struc-
tures stable at ambient pressure?

IX. CONCLUDING REMARKS

The discovery of pressure-induced superconductivity in the
hydride family opens new prospects in research on high

temperature superconductivity. In this Colloquium we
focused mainly on the theoretical aspects of this new
development.
From a fundamental point of view, it is remarkable that the

high-Tc superconducting state manifests itself under such
extreme experimental conditions. Sulfur hydrides offer a
remarkable combination of strong electron-phonon coupling
and high optical-phonon frequencies. As long as the
Migdal adiabaticity criterion is not violated, observations of
superconductivity at even higher temperatures now can be
anticipated.
There are, however, novel features which necessitate

significant deviations from the conventional Migdal-
Eliashberg approach. First, the hydride phonon spectra are
quite broad (up to 200 meV) and contain both optical and
acoustic modes. We propose that the electron-phonon inter-
action can be treated with the use of the general equation (4.2)
by employing two coupling constants λopt and λac together
with two corresponding average frequencies. This leads to an
analytical expression for Tc applicable to a number of cases
and permits analysis of other relevant factors for different
phases, Eq. (4.4).
The experimentally observed isotope effect (deuterium-

hydrogen substitution) turns out to be not universal in the
sense that the isotope coefficient depends on the pressure and
has distinct values for different phases. We show that this
reflects the relative contributions of optical and acoustic
modes.
We point out that the sharp increase in Tc (from ≈120 up to

≈200 K over a narrow pressure interval near ≈150 GPa) is a
signature of a first-order structural transition into the high-Tc
phase. This picture also explains the curiously slow decrease
in Tc at P > Pcr.
It was predicted in a number of theoretical papers that the

transition into the high-Tc phase is accompanied by the
appearance of additional small Fermi pockets. As a conse-
quence, a two-gap structure appears. It should be observable
by tunneling spectroscopy, which also will be useful for
determination of the characteristic function α2ðΩÞFðΩÞ.
It may be expected that there should exist other hydrides

capable of displaying a high-Tc superconducting state under
pressure, possibly with even higher values of Tc all the way up
to room temperature. But the most challenging question
relates to the possibility of creating superconducting structures
stable at ambient pressure. In this regard, we are encouraged
by the recent observation by Syed et al. (2016) of the
superconducting state of Pd-H at temperatures ≈ 54 and
≈60 K for Pd-D.
