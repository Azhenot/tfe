Magnetic memory cells associated with the stress-mediated magnetoelectric effect promise extremely

low bit-writing energies. Most investigations have focused on the process of writing information in

memory cells, and very few on readout schemes. The usual assumption is that the readout will be

achieved using magnetoresistive structures such as Giant Magneto-Resistive stacks or Magnetic

Tunnel Junctions. Since the writing energy is very low in the magnetoelectric systems, the readout

energy using magnetoresistive approaches becomes non negligible. Incidentally, the magneto-electric

interaction itself contains the potentiality of the readout of the information encoded in the magnetic

subsystem. In this letter, the principle of magnetoelectric readout of the information by an electric

field in a composite multiferroic heterostructure is considered theoretically and demonstrated

experimentally using ½N � ðTbCo2=FeCoÞ�/½PbðMg1=3Nb2=3ÞO3�ð1�xÞ � ½PbTiO3�x stress-mediated
ME heterostructures. Published by AIP Publishing. [http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4983717]

The new generation of data storage technology requires

high speed, high density, low power, and nonvolatile random

access memory (RAM).1,2 Prospective RAMs using different

physical principles (Ferroelectric-RAM, Magnetic-RAM,

Spin Torque Transfer-RAM, Resistive-RAM, Conductive

Bridge RAM, and Phase Change RAM) have been widely

discussed in the last few years,3 and for a decade, magnetic

RAMs have been foreseen as the strongest contender, espe-

cially with the advent of Spin Transfer Torque (STT) and

Spin Orbit Torque (SOT)-RAMs.4,5 However, these two tech-

nologies require large current densities to switch the magneti-

zation between memory states and are therefore far from being

optimum.6 For this reason, the control of magnetization with

electric fields is of prime interest,7,8 and a number of works

were related on multiferroics and magnetoelectric (ME) effects

and compounds for memory applications.9–12

Among the different solutions to achieve the ME

effect, it has been shown that coupling the magnetoelastic

and piezolectric materials through mechanical interaction13

could yield very energy-efficient memory devices14–19 with

simulated energy consumptions as low as a few tens of atto-

joules per written bit.20–23 Because of the symmetry of the

Joule magnetostriction, which is the main phenomenon at

play, many proposed devices rely on the anisotropic nature

of the piezo-strain generated by the electric field, and

½PbðMg1=3Nb2=3ÞO3�ð1�xÞ � ½PbTiO3�x (PMN-PT) compounds
in the h011i cut are often chosen as an electroactive sub-
strate.24,25 Another approach uses nonspecific piezoelectric

materials in which an anisotropic stress distribution can be tai-

lored using planar electrodes.14,22,26,27 In any of those

configurations of stress-mediated magnetoelectric memory,

most investigations have focused on the process of writing

information in the memory cell, and very few on the readout

schemes. The usual assumption is that the readout will be

achieved using magnetoresistive structures such as Giant

Magneto-Resistive (GMR) stacks28 or Magnetic Tunnel

Junctions (MTJ).27 Although they have been experimentally

demonstrated, the integration of these complex elements at a

very low scale together with “exotic” electro-active substrates

such as PMN-PT and the control micro-electronics remains a

challenge. It is also worth noting that, since the writing energy

is potentially very low in the ME systems, the readout energy

using magnetoresistive approaches becomes non negligible.29

In this respect, alternative readout ways are of high interest.

Incidentally, the ME interaction itself contains the

potentiality of the readout of the information encoded in the

magnetic subsystem. Because the system is fully coupled,

the reorientation of magnetic moments by electric field indu-

ces an elastic stress in the piezoelectric layer and generates a

piezoelectric potential in the structure. This ME potential

depends on the initial state of the magnetic subsystem. If the

magnetic state is not modified by the applied electric field,

no ME voltage is induced on the piezoelectric layer. On the

other hand, if the polarity of the applied electric field corre-

sponds to the reorientation of the magnetic moments, a ME

potential should appear. Like the ME writing, the advantage

of a ME readout is that it is performed through an electric

field and therefore does not require any current going

through highly resistive tunnel junctions. Because it relies on

the same physical principle, the ME readout requires an

energy as low as the ME writing. In previous theoretical

studies, we have demonstrated that the required energy for

writing a bit in a 50 nm stress-mediated memory cell is in the

2� 10�16 J/bit range, which is mainly due to the dissipated
energy during the charge/discharge of the capacitor formed

by the PbðZrxTi1�xÞO3(PZT) piezoelectric material between
the driving electrodes.23 For PMN-PT with four times higher

piezoelectric constants the expected energy consumption is

one order of value smaller. As a comparison, a typical 45 nm

Spin Torque Transfer Magnetic memory (STT-RAM) based

on a Magnetic Tunnel Junction (MTJ) with a resistance-area

product of 10 X lm2 leads to a MTJ resistance of 5 kX. For
sense currents in the lowest end of the required values, that is to

say, 10 lA, and an optimistic readout time of 1 ns (those values
are usually higher for an accurate readout of the stored informa-

tion), the reading energy lost in Joule heating will still be of

5� 10�16 J/bit30,31 which is more or at best comparable with
what could be achieved using the ME readout. In the present

paper, we theoretically describe and experimentally demon-

strate the principle of both writing and reading information

using an electric field in ½N � ðTbCo2=FeCoÞ�/PMN-PT stress-
mediated ME heterostructures.

sists of a uniaxial magnetostrictive multilayered structure

with N layers of TbCo2=FeCo deposited on a PMN-PT pie-
zoelectric crystal in the h011i cut.25 A magnetic field with a
strength H is applied in the plane of the structure normally to
the anisotropy axis EA directed at an angle p=4 with respect
to the x axis. If the value of H is smaller than the anisotropy
field HA, the equilibrium state of the magnetic subsystem is
bistable. This bistability results from the symmetry of the

thermodynamic potential Fm of the magnetic subsystem

the potential energy Fm has two minima corresponding to the
angles of magnetization u ¼ 6p=4. These two equilibrium

states are associated with the bit states “0” and “1”. The

switch between these states, corresponding to the informa-

tion recording, is achievable by an anisotropic in-plane stress

within the film associated with the magnetoelastic interaction

and described by the energy density

where the index m indicates the magnetic film, Tmij is the
stress tensor in the magnetic film, Cmij are its elastic moduli,
and B is the magnetoelastic constant. An applied anisotropic
stress breaks the symmetry of the thermodynamic potential

and results in only one equilibrium state for the magnetiza-

tion depending on the sign of the stress. If the magnetic sys-

tem was already in the corresponding state prior to the

application of the stress, it will remain unchanged. In the

opposite case, the system will switch to the new state upon

application of the stress and remain stable in the said state

after the stress is released. The dynamics of the magnetic

switch in the system under consideration have already been

described in detail.14,20,21,23 The energy efficient way for the

creation of the stress in a magnetic film is the application of

an electric field to the piezoelectric crystal that is elastically

coupled to the film. For this purpose, and as it follows from

Eq. (2), the in-plane stress should be anisotropic. From a

memory cell design point of view, the most appropriate ori-

entation of the electric field ~E is normal to the plane of the
structure. This requirement is satisfied, for example, by using

a PMN-PT ferroelectric relaxor in the h011i cut. The corre-
spondent piezoelectric energy density for such a crystal is

Equation (12) describes the magnetic feedback on the elec-

tric polarization that allows for the detection of the switch

between different magnetic states defined by the magneti-

zation directions. In the simplest electrical scheme shown

where s ¼ RC with C being the cell capacity and e33 is the z

Consequently, this ME signal indicates the magnetiza-

tion switch induced by the electric field and reveals the

initial state of the magnetic subsystem. For example, if the

applied voltage V0 is positive, the switch is possible only if
the initial state corresponds to “0”. If it corresponds to “1”

no switch and therefore no ME signal are expected. On the

other hand, for a negative voltage the signal can be measured

if the initial state is “1.” Thus, the magneto-electric interac-

tion is applicable not only for recording a bit but also for

reading the information via an electric field in the MELRAM
cell.

The experiments were carried out on a cell consisting of

a nanostructured magnetostrictive film of 25 bilayers

ðTbCo2Þ4nm=ðFeCoÞ4nm deposited by RF sputtering on a
10� 10� 0:3 mm3 commercial PMN-PT h011i crystalline
substrate. The measurements were made using the electrical

scheme shown in Fig. 1. The results are presented in Fig. 2.

Figure 2(a) shows the sequence of electric pulses V0ðtÞ
applied to the scheme. After each pulse, the cell capacity is

discharged. Fig. 2(b) displays the VR voltage pulses that are
detected across the resistance R. Figure 2(c) shows the ME
signal VME ¼ VRðHÞ � VRð0Þ obtained by subtraction of the
signals measured when the magnetizing field was equal to

H ¼ HA=

and H¼ 0. In the last case, where H¼ 0, no
switch of magnetization is possible independently of the sign

of the applied electric voltage. The application of the pri-

mary “writing” electric pulse results in the orientation of the

magnetization according to the pulse polarity. The applica-

tion of the “reading” electric pulse with the same polarity

does not change the magnetic state and no ME response is

detected. However, if the “reading” pulse polarity is

changed, a magnetization switch is induced and the ME

response is observed. Figure 2(d) shows the corresponding

behavior of the magnetization projection on the easy axis of

the cell. The last measurements were made using the

magneto-optic Kerr effect.

The maximum value of the observed ME signal is equal

to VME ¼ 75 mV. The theoretical value predicted by Eq. (14)
can be estimated using the thickness of the magnetic layer

hm ¼ 200 nm, magnetoelastic constant B ¼ �7 MPa,33 and
the following parameters of PMN-PT:34 d31 ¼ 610 C=N;
d32 ¼ �1883 C=N; e33 ¼ 4033. The estimated signal VME
¼ 98 mV is close to the experimental value.

The obtained theoretical and experimental results show

the feasibility of the two basic operations of recording and

reading of information stored in the magnetic subsystem

using electric field pulses applied to the MELRAM cell. The

main challenge for the implementation of the ME readout

lies in the separation of the magneto-electrically induced

potential VME from the V0 applied voltage for the magnetic
state identification. Here, the VME signal was extracted by a
mathematical subtraction of the experimental data. In a real

cell, the separation can be achieved by using a Wheatstone

bridge scheme with a passive nonmagnetic capacitor in the

branch parallel to the cell. Moreover, the experiment under

consideration was performed on a cell of a millimetric size.

Nevertheless, according to Eq. (8), the ME potential does not

depend on the thickness of the piezoelectric layer when

hp � hm nor on the in-plane cell dimensions (except for the
lateral effects from the fringing field35). It means that the

ME readout principle allows for the cell down-scaling with-

out any visible decrease of the ME signals. A drawback of

this energy efficient readout approach is that it is a destruc-

tive one when the readout voltage pulse switches the magne-

tization. Nevertheless, by using the output electric signal

generated by the switch to trigger a delayed writing pulse

with an opposite polarity, the initial state of the magnetic

system can be restored automatically.
