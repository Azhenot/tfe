Abstract

We consider the emergence from quantum entanglement of spacetime geometry in a bulk region.

For certain classes of quantum states in an appropriately factorized Hilbert space, a spatial ge-

ometry can be defined by associating areas along codimension-one surfaces with the entanglement

entropy between either side. We show how Radon transforms can be used to convert this data into

a spatial metric. Under a particular set of assumptions, the time evolution of such a state traces

out a four-dimensional spacetime geometry, and we argue using a modified version of Jacobson’s

“entanglement equilibrium” that the geometry should obey Einstein’s equation in the weak-field

limit. We also discuss how entanglement equilibrium is related to a generalization of the Ryu-

Takayanagi formula in more general settings, and how quantum error correction can help specify

the emergence map between the full quantum-gravity Hilbert space and the semiclassical limit of

quantum fields propagating on a classical spacetime.

I. INTRODUCTION

There has been considerable recent interest in the idea of deriving an emergent spacetime
geometry from the entanglement properties of a quantum state [1–6]. Much of this work has
taken place within the context of the Anti-de Sitter/Conformal Field Theory (AdS/CFT)
correspondence [7]. In particular, various results related to emergent gravity [4, 5, 8] have
yielded not only confidence in the program, but also helpful insights in understanding quan-
tum gravity itself [9, 10]. Moreover, the idea need not be restricted to the context of
holographic duality. Indeed, as it was originally proposed [2], it can in principle be gener-
alized to derive other geometries closer to our own physical universe [11–15]. Entanglement
also plays a role in entropic/thermodynamic gravity [16–21] and the holographic-spacetime
approaches of Banks and Fishler [22–24] and of Nomura et al. [25, 26].

The real world, needless to say, does not seem to have anti-de Sitter boundary condi-
tions. It is therefore interesting to ask whether we can derive spacetime and gravitational
field equations directly in the bulk from the entanglement properties of quantum states. The
emergence of a semiclassical spacetime description from a quantum state, thought of as an
abstract vector in Hilbert space, is essentially inevitable if we think that such an evolving
quantum state provides a sufficient and complete description of physical reality. Our ap-
proach is to take the quantum state as fundamental and search for an appropriate classical
limit, rather than quantizing any particular classical model.

In this work we tackle this problem, building on previous work on deriving emergent
spatial geometry from entanglement of a quantum state [12]. There we investigated how
a spatial metric (distance along curves) could be derived from a quantum state using the
mutual information between different factors in Hilbert space. Our interest here is dynamical
rather than static: to model the universe as a quantum state evolving in Hilbert space, show
how the geometry of spacetime can emerge from the entanglement features of such a state
in an appropriate factorization, and derive Einstein’s equation in the semiclassical limit,
an approach we label Bulk Entanglement Gravity (BEG). This requires us to consider a
somewhat generic quantum system (or operator algebra), and examine which properties of
a complex quantum system may be important in emerging spacetime geometry and gravity.

To concretely implement aspects of BEG, we will restrict ourselves in this paper to
quantum states corresponding to emergent spacetimes in the weak-field regime, small per-
turbations of Minkowski space. (Since boundary conditions play no role in our analysis,
the results will apply equally well to spacetimes with a nonzero cosmological constant, as
long as we consider regions much smaller than the background curvature scale.) This repre-
sents a significant departure from the AdS/CFT version of the geometry-from-entanglement
program. That approach may be thought of as “maximally holographic,” with all of the
bulk data encoded directly on the conformal boundary, and in particular the entanglement
from which geometry emerges is that of the CFT state. Our regime is “anti-holographic,”
considering a small region that is a weak perturbation of flat spacetime. We are therefore
interested in the entanglement of quantum states in Hilbert spaces that can be decomposed
directly into factors corresponding to local regions of bulk spacetime (or equivalent ways of
encoding entanglement data).

We will consider three different aspects of the BEG program. The first involves deriving
emergent spatial geometry from entanglement data. Using assumptions (A1), (A2) and (A3)
below, one may start from an appropriate quantum state and obtain an emergent geometry
and its best-fit dimensionality. Rather than deriving distances from mutual information, it is

3



more natural to derive areas of surfaces using the entanglement entropy across them. We will
show in section III that for some class of geometries, the metric tensor can be obtained from
these data using the tensor Radon transform [27]. In the case of AdS/CFT, a procedure like
this would correspond to directly recovering the bulk geometry (plus matter) from a state of
the fundamental theory, such as that of a CFT, but without relying on the knowledge that
it has a flat geometry or that it can be interpreted to reside on the asymptotic boundary of
the emergent geometry. In general, we still refer to this emergent spatial geometry as the
“bulk” geometry, even when no boundary theory is available.

The second aspect is the emergence of gravitational dynamics. In section IV, we show
that the linearized Einstein’s equation can be derived from a background-free approach using
quantum entanglement when a set of assumptions outlined in the next section are satisfied.
In particular, one can derive the Hamiltonian constraint IV A from assumptions (A1) through
(A5). Our approach is closely related to the entanglement-equilibrium proposal of [19]. It
differs from [19] in that the analogous entanglement condition is valid across global cuts,
instead of small local spherical surfaces. In addition, it is valid for all matter fields and
does not rely on CFT modular Hamiltonians, which require matter fields to have UV fixed
points. The main difference is that we derive our results directly from an abstract quantum
state, rather than starting with quantum fields on an existing classical spacetime.

The third aspect deals with the “emergence map”: the map from abstract quantum states
in Hilbert space to quantum fields on a semiclassical background geometry. Part of this task
can be thought of as determining which quantum degrees of freedom are responsible for
emergent geometry as opposed to matter fields. This is important for the emergence of
Einstein’s equation with sources. To this end, we elaborate the relations with entanglement
equilibrium and the Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) formula in section V. In particular, we will discuss
how one can distinguish the semiclassical geometry from quantum fields on that geometry
solely from the features in a general background-free setting. Following Harlow [28], we
argue that this can be done purely from the entanglement structure of the state or from the
properties of a quantum error-correction code (QECC). It seems that quantum error correc-
tion properties can naturally provide a separation between geometric and matter degrees of
freedom.

Our framework, partly inspired by [29], uses the Radon transform to tie together previ-
ous work on the thermodynamics of spacetime [16, 19], AdS/CFT approaches to emergent
gravity [4], and kinematic space [30]. The Radon transform can also be used to construct
emergent geometries for quantum error correction codes or tensor networks in general.

For the sake of concreteness, we will use the specific language of entanglement as com-
puted from a quantum state in a Hilbert space. However, this work only relies on a configu-
ration that defines subsystems and entanglement entropy data. Consequently, it also applies
to more general formulations.

II. THE ROAD TO BULK ENTANGLEMENT GRAVITY

Our derivation of Einstein’s equation from entanglement in the bulk of spacetime can be
considered axiomatically: we can specify a list of explicit assumptions allowing us to start
with an abstract quantum state and derive a semiclassical spacetime geometry with the
appropriate dynamics. Here we briefly list the assumptions, before discussing them in detail
in subsequent sections. Some of these assumptions will seem prima facie reasonable, while

4



others are more conjectural. We will present arguments for their validity where available,
and sketch a roadmap for the future work to complete this kind of program.

Our assumptions are as follows:

(A1) Factorization. Hilbert space H comes equipped with a preferred tensor product de-
composition into individual factors,

H =
⊗
i

Hi. (1)

The individual factors Hi will correspond roughly to local points or small regions of
space. The decomposition may be defined by the dynamics of the theory, as in [31].

(A2) Redundancy constraint. We are given a state |Ψ〉 in this decomposition with a very
specific behavior of the entanglement entropy: the entanglement entropies of individual
factors (or groups thereof) are approximately “redundancy constrained” (RC). Given
a collection B of factors of H and its complement B̄, a state is RC if its entropy can
be written as a sum over the mutual informations of the individual factors,

S(B) :=
1

2

∑
i∈B,j∈B̄

I(i : j). (2)

(Details of our notation are given in Section III A.) Thus, RC states generalize the
notion of area-law states. In an approximately RC state, the entanglement entropy of
a subsystem B can be written as

S(B) = SRC + Ssub, (3)

where SRC is the leading order contribution that satisfies the RC condition, and Ssub
is a subleading correction.

(A3) Area from mutual information. For states that define an emergent geometry, the
mutual information I between subsystems is proportional to the interface area A
between corresponding subregions in that geometry,

A(B, B̄) = 1
2α
I(B : B̄). (4)

(A4) Entanglement equilibrium. Entanglement perturbations of this configuration satisfy a
modified entanglement equilibrium condition (MEEC), following Jacobson [19]. That
is, under small perturbations, the total entropy perturbation δS(R) of certain subsys-
tems vanish, so that

0 = δSRC + δSsub. (5)

(A5) Emergent field theory. The variation of the subleading correction can be generated by

5



the entanglement variation of a state in some emergent effective field theory (EFT),

δSsub = δSEFT. (6)

Here by SEFT we mean the vacuum-subtracted or Casini entropy, representing entan-
glement over and above the divergent contribution of the QFT vacuum [32–34].

(A6) Dynamics. There exists a consistent dynamical theory, e.g., a Hamiltonian or a quan-
tum circuit, that generates a sequence of such configurations, each admitting an emer-
gent spatial geometry. Furthermore, there is a way to organize these emergent geome-
tries to create a consistent Lorentzian spacetime geometry via time evolution.

(A7) Lorentz invariance. The above assumptions hold for any constant-time slice of the
emergent Minkowski space, and the overall theory is Lorentz-invariant in an appropri-
ate limit.

In the sections that follow we will show how to weave together these assumptions to
derive geometry and Einstein’s equation in the weak-field regime.

III. EMERGENT SPATIAL GEOMETRIES AND RADON TRANSFORMS

In our earlier work on emergent space [12] we derived a spatial metric by using the
quantum mutual information of two factors of Hilbert space to define a distance measure,
based on our intuition from quantum field theory that the entanglement of low-energy states
decreases monotonically with distance. If entanglement is our main quantity of interest,
however, it is more natural to directly derive areas from the entanglement across a boundary
separating two regions, rather than to derive distances between any two small regions. We
expect the entropy across such a boundary to be proportional to the geometric area, plus
some subdominant correction. In this section we explore the Radon transform as a natural
tool for characterizing this data, and converting the entanglement of a quantum state into
the metric tensor of a spatial slice.

A. Space from Hilbert Space

Here we briefly review the emergence of spatial geometry from appropriate quantum
states [12]. Following assumption (A1), we are given a quantum state and a tensor product
decomposition of the Hilbert space, |ψ〉 ∈ H =

⊗
iHi. The individual factors Hi correspond

roughly to the degrees of freedom (geometric and field-theoretic) associated with a small
local region of space. In the back of our minds we are thinking of these factors as finite-
dimensional vector spaces [35], though this doesn’t play a crucial role in our analysis. While
this local picture of degrees of freedom runs against the spirit of holography, our interest
here is in the weak-gravity regime, where it should be sufficient to think of gravity as a
theory of local degrees of freedom.

One can generate an “information graph” G = (V,E) based on this structure. The graph
vertices in V = {i} label each individual Hilbert space factors in {Hi}, and the edges E

6



between any two vertices i, j are weighted by the quantum mutual information between
those factors,

I(i : j) = S(i) + S(j)− S(i ∪ j). (7)

An example graph is shown in Figure 1. For convenience, when we talk about quantities
associated with the quantum state or the Hilbert space, we will use graph vertices and sets
of vertices to denote tensor factors of the Hilbert space and products of the tensor factors,
respectively. Note that we are not given the graph as a fundamental piece of information; it is
derived from the quantum state in this particular factorization. The factorization itself could
be derived, for example, from the requirement that the Hamiltonian look approximately local
[31].

We say that the state |ψ〉 (or more generally, the entanglement data) is “redundancy
constrained” (RC) if the entanglement entropy of any subsystem B ⊂ V can be computed by
summing over the weights of all edges that connect vertices in B with those in its complement
B̄, as in assumption (A2). More precisely, the entanglement entropy of a subsystem B in a
redundancy-constrained state is given by the cut function [36],

S(B) = SRC(B) :=
1

2

∑
i∈B,j∈B̄

I(i : j). (8)

Other than the familiar examples, such as area-law states [37] in certain condensed matter
systems, a wider class of states such as Projected Entangled-Pair states [38], holographic
quantum error correction code [39], and (bulk) random tensor network states [40] are also
(approximately) redundancy constrained. Note that a generic state in Hilbert space will be
very far from RC, and the information graph will be highly connected rather than taking
the sparse form suggested by locality; the states we have in mind resemble low-energy states
of approximately-local Hamiltonians.

In states that are only approximately RC, (8) holds to leading order, and the exact
entanglement entropy takes on a subleading correction

S(B) = SRC(B) + Ssub(B), (9)

where Ssub � SRC. There are two natural sources for such corrections. One is long-range
entanglement even in the vacuum, which we expect to be present but subdominant. The
other is entanglement between excited degrees of freedom over and above the vacuum. An
EPR pair, for example, can have an entanglement that is independent of the distance between
the two particles; however in a quantum field theory such entanglement is a very small
correction to the huge entanglement between the vacuum modes. (For discussions of vacuum-
subtracted entropy in quantum field theory, see [32–34].)

In order to obtain an emergent space, one has to make certain assumptions about the
connection between entanglement and geometry. A natural identification can be motivated
by area-law systems, where the entanglement entropy of a region scales as the interface
area that separates the region and its complement. To leading order, this implies that
the interface area is proportional to the mutual information between the region and its
complement. Because RC states generalize area-law states, a natural definition is to define
the “interface area” of an emergent geometry as the mutual information between a system

FIG. 1. This shows an example of the information graph in which vertices represent factors in a

decomposition of Hilbert space, and edges are weighted by the mutual information between the

factors. In redundancy-constrained states, the entropy of a group of factors (such as the shaded

region B containing H1 ⊗ H2 ⊗ H3 ⊗ H4 ⊗ H5.) can be calculated by summing over the mutual
information of the cut edges, as in (8).

and its complement, as in assumption (A3). That is,

A(B, B̄) := 1
2α
I(B : B̄). (10)

See also [41, 42]. At this level α serves as an undetermined constant of proportionality; we
will later relate it to Newton’s gravitational constant via α = 1/4GN .

Given the information graph, however, it is more convenient to work with the length
measure between factors, instead of their mutual interface areas. To derive the approximate
geometry that may be encoded by the graph, [12] defines an ad hoc distance function between
vertices from the edge weights. This, together with the set V , generate a metric space,
which is isometrically embedded in to a manifold. We define the embedding manifold as
the emergent geometry of the graph. The technique of classical multi-dimensional scaling
(MDS) [43–47] can be used for this purpose to determine the best-fit dimensionality of the
geometry, as well as the embedding coordinates for the elements of V .

B. Metric tensor from the inverse tensor Radon transform

While straightforward in an approximate recovery of geometry, the correct “transform”
function from an area quantity to distances can, in principle, be non-local. A simple local
function from area to distance is expected to yield a distortion unless we operate in the case
with a high degree of symmetry. To address this deficiency, we seek an improved method to

8



directly transform (dualize) the area quantity, which is proportional to mutual information,
to a measure of distances via a global transformation. In this section, we reconstruct the
spatial metric tensor directly from entanglement data.

In cases of interest where the emergent geometry is not highly symmetric, we can imagine
a two-part procedure, in which we use MDS to emerge a symmetric “background” geometry,
and then recover the metric perturbation from an inverse tensor Radon transform. (In fact
the background geometries of interest to us will generally be flat Euclidean spaces.) The
recovery procedure is valid as long as the tensor Radon transform has a unique inverse. Such
is the case for simple manifolds in 2 dimensions [48], which have been extensively studied in
the context of the boundary-rigidity problem. In higher dimensions, similar inversions are
also possible in Riemannian geometries that are close to flat space or hyperbolic space [49].

Intuitively, the Radon transform maps a function on a space to a function on a set of
surfaces embedded in that space, by integrating the function over the surface [27, 29, 50].
More formally, consider an n-dimensional Riemannian manifold M and a totally-geodesic
codimension-1 submanifold S, where “totally geodesic” means that the geodesics of the
submanifold with respect to its induced metric are also geodesics of the original manifold.1

Most geometries will not admit any totally-geodesic submanifolds, but they are plentiful
in the highly-symmetric backgrounds of interest to us here, e.g. hyperplanes in Euclidean
spaces. The Radon transform of a function f on M at S is defined as the integral

R[f ](S) =
∫
S
f dσ (11)

over S with area element dσ. Clearly, a well-defined transform requires the function to be
regularized in some way, e.g., by setting f = 0 outside some domain. If the geometry on
M is Euclidean (in the sense of flat), an appropriate set of surfaces S is given by planes
specified by a distance and angle from the origin, as shown in Figure 2.

We can also perform the Radon transform of a tensor field. Such tensor Radon transforms
were used in [29] to derive the linearized Einstein’s equation in the context AdS/CFT. We
will employ analogous techniques, but directly in the bulk, without reference to kinematic
space or holography.

Let gij be the metric tensor onM and let wij be the induced metric of the submanifold S.
(Our notation follows [29], and differs from the more common notation in the mathematical
literature.) The longitudinal tensor Radon transform of sij on M is defined as

R‖[sij] =

∫
S
wijsij dσ. (12)

(Henceforth we will drop the explicit appearance of the submanifold S on the right-hand
side.) Similarly, the transverse tensor Radon transform is

R⊥[sij] =

∫
S
(gij − wij)sij dσ. (13)

1 Analogous transforms along n − k dimensional submanifolds can also be defined. Here we only discuss
the case when k = 1.

FIG. 2. The Radon transform of a scalar function f(x, y) defined on some compact domain (shaded

area) is done by integrating the function over the submanifold S, which is a line in 2-dimensional
flat space. The transformed data R[f ](p, α) corresponds to the value at a point in the space of S
(the space of lines in this case). p is the perpendicular distance between the plane and the origin

and α parametrizes the direction of the unit normal n̂.

Indices are raised and lowered with the spatial metric. Since at this point we are only
considering spatial geometry and related tensors, we do not discuss metrics with Lorentzian
signatures. A process to invert the above transform and obtain the tensor sij is referred to
as inverse tensor Radon transform.

The inversion problem in n = 2 has been mostly studied in the context of the boundary-
rigidity problem [51, 52], which examines if the bulk geometry of a manifold can be recovered
knowing only the pair-wise geodesic distances between all its boundary points. A manifold
for which this is possible is called boundary-rigid. This problem has been shown [27] to
be equivalent to the tensor geodesic X-ray transform problem [27, 52, 53], which coincides
with the tensor Radon transform in 2 dimensions. An earlier classification of boundary-rigid
manifolds is now known as the Michel’s conjecture [54], where so-called simple manifolds are
boundary-rigid. (A Riemannian manifoldM is simple if, given any two points, there exists
a unique geodesic joining the points, and if the second fundamental form is positive definite
at every point on ∂M.) A proof has been given in n = 2 [48], although some other higher-
dimensional results are also known [55]. See [52, 56, 57] and references therein. Results
related to applying the inverse were explored both analytically [58, 59] and numerically [60].
The inverse problem of the higher-dimensional tensor Radon transform has remained largely
unexplored until recently, where a proof on invertibility was produced [49], but an explicit
inversion formula and numerical results are still unknown, to the best of our knowledge.
Henceforth we will simply assume that the appropriate tensor-transform inversion can be
performed.

C. Spatial metric from entanglement

We now describe how to use the Radon transform to obtain an emergent spatial geometry
from the quantum state. Suppose we begin with a quantum state |ψ〉 from which, following
[12], we may use MDS to find a best-fit maximally-symmetric geometry gij on a spatial
manifold {M}, which we will refer to as the background. We now would like to consider a
perturbed state,

|Ψ〉 = |ψ〉+ δ|ψ〉. (14)

The perturbed entanglement entropy δS associated with each subsystem also changes the
associated emergent geometry. Using these perturbed data δS for different subsystems, we
will show that the inverse tensor Radon transform allows us to recover a perturbed metric
δhij on the background.

2

We are thus considering a situation in which we attempt to recover δhij when we are given
a background metric gij and an entanglement perturbation δS that can be computed from
the state itself. For discrete finite-dimensional quantum systems, such as some condensed
matter models [61–63] or the ones we considered in [12], we will also assume a continuum
limit or a smoothing process over the data δS such that the usual Radon transform is
well-defined and can be performed. Alternatively, a discrete version may also be applied
[64].

We illustrate the reconstruction of δhij with an example in flat space, although the
procedure can be easily generalized to other backgrounds, as long as an inverse transform
exists. Consider the case where one determined the exact geometry encoded in the state |ψ〉
to be an n-dimensional flat space with metric gij = δij. For any codimension-1 hyperplane
C(p, n̂) that separates the space into two adjacent regions Σ, Σ̄, one can compute the interface
area A(C) using the flat metric of the embedding space. This follows from assumption (A3),
that area is proportional to mutual information,3

A(C) = 1
2α
I(ΣC : Σ̄C). (15)

Given the RC assumption (A2), I(ΣC : Σ̄C) is determined by the sum of mutual infor-
mations along all edges that are cut by C [36]. Adding a perturbation δ|ψ〉 in general
also perturbs the mutual information across different bipartitions. For the same bipar-
tition along the cut, the perturbed area is now given by perturbed mutual information
A′ = (1/2α)I ′(ΣC : Σ̄C), and one can define the area perturbation

δA = A′ −A = 1
2α
δI =

1

2α
(I ′ − I)(ΣC : Σ̄C), (16)

so that
δI(C) = 2αδA(C). (17)

Let w̃ij be the induced metric of C in the perturbed geometry, where wij is the induced
2 A similar procedure may be used when MDS itself gives an imperfect embedding of the background

geometry.
3 With MDS, we are considering only a geometry that is finite in extent. In the case where the space is

infinite, we restrict ourselves to a particular finite region for analysis.

11



metric in the background,
w̃ij = wij + δwij. (18)

The area is then

A′(C) =
∫
C

√
det w̃ij dσ, (19)

and the area perturbation is

δA =
∫
C

(√
det w̃ij −

√
detwij

)
dσ. (20)

Using det(I + �M) = 1 + �Tr[M ] +O(�2) for any symmetric matrix M , this becomes

δA = 1
2

∫
C

Tr(δw) dσ, (21)

where Tr(δw) = wijδwij. Comparing to (12), we see that the area perturbation is directly
related to the longitudinal Radon transform of the induced metric perturbation,

δA = 1
2
R‖[δwij]. (22)

It is straightforward to show, for example by choosing an appropriate coordinate system, that
R‖[δwij] = R‖[δhij]. We therefore see that the mutual information across the bipartition is
proportional to the Radon transform of the metric perturbation,

δI(C) = αR‖[δhij]. (23)

Given the entanglement data δI(C) = 2αδA(C) over all such cuts C(p, n̂), we can perform
the inverse tensor Radon transform of R‖[δhij], thus completing the metric reconstruction
procedure, so that the full spatial metric gij + δhij is obtained from entanglement data of a
quantum state in a background-free approach.

We therefore need assurance that the tensor Radon transform of interest is indeed invert-
ible. At first sight, this requirement of invertibility to recover a tensor from a scalar function
seem unlikely, simply from counting degrees of freedom; there are several components of the
metric, and only one value each of R⊥ and R‖. However, this is indeed uniquely invert-
ible for a certain set of manifolds, up to natural obstructions that are not simply fixed by
the data. In this case, the degrees of freedom that are undetermined by entanglement are
manifested as gauge transformations of the δhij field by an arbitrary vector field ξ,

δhij → δhij + ∂iξj + ∂jξi, (24)

for the simple reason that the longitudinal tensor Radon transform vanishes for tensors of
the form ∂(jξi) .

From the existing mathematical literature, we conclude that for n = 2, an inverse trans-

12



form can be explicitly implemented to obtain δhij from an entanglement perturbation as
long as the background manifold M is boundary-rigid. Current knowledge classifies simple
manifolds and certain quotients [65] as boundary-rigid, although other particulate examples
such as tori have also been given [57, 66, 67]. For n > 2, an inverse, if it exists, can also be
uniquely obtained near flat or hyperbolic geometries. Recently, [68] also proposes a recovery
of the metric for certain types of Riemannian manifolds at n = 3. However, an explicit
reconstruction algorithm for general dimensions is still contingent on further progress in the
mathematical community.4

IV. EMERGENT GRAVITY FROM QUANTUM ENTANGLEMENT

We now turn to the gravitational dynamics of our emergent geometries, and explain how
assumptions (A1) through (A7) allow us to derive the linearized Einstein equation in the
weak-field limit. In the first subsection we look at classical spacetime, using the Radon
transform to write the terms appearing in Einstein’s equation in a convenient form. In the
following subsection we use the results to derive a modified entanglement equilibrium con-
dition, and in the final subsection we derive Einstein’s equation for an emergent Lorentzian
spacetime geometry from the quantum state.

A. The Hamiltonian Constraint and its Radon transform

Let us momentarily set aside spacetime emerging from quantum mechanics and instead
consider the conventional classical Einstein’s equation linearized around a Minkowski back-
ground.

Given a spacetime with a parameterized set of time slices Mt with timelike unit nor-
mal vectors tµ, the classical Hamiltonian constraint of general relativity corresponds to the
condition

Gµνt
µtν = 8πGNTµνt

µtν . (25)

In the following derivation, we work in the linearized regime where we consider metric
perturbations on a Minkowski background: gµν = ηµν + δhµν . As such, we can consider
the constant-time slices of Minkowski space. The (background) extrinsic curvature vanishes
on each of these time slices. At the linearized level we can then relate the Einstein tensor
to the spatial curvature scalar via R = 2Gtt [70]. Therefore, for linearized equations, the
Hamiltonian constraint reads

δR = 16πGNδTtt. (26)

Because we are specializing to flat backgrounds, for each such constant time slice, let
the background spatial metric be δij and the perturbation be δhij, which is a tensor-valued

4 The boundary-rigidity problem is intimately related to that of reconstructing bulk geometry from bound-

ary data in the context of AdS/CFT. The existence of a manifold that is not boundary-rigid may be

indicative of the limitations of the Ryu-Takayanagi formula in AdS3/CFT2 for constructing bulk geome-

tries. Similar conclusions also apply to certain reconstruction schemes in higher dimensions, which use

correlation functions to estimate geodesic lengths [69]. For instance, consider the back-reacted geometry

of a single massive particle in AdS. The spatial geometry of a time slice is not boundary-rigid.

where ∇2 is the Laplacian in n-dimensional flat space, with n being the dimension of the
constant-time slice. Now consider taking the Radon transform of both sides of equation (27)
along (n− 1)-dimensional hyperplanes. We can derive5

R[δR] = −R‖[∇2δhij]. (28)

Radon transforms obey an intertwinement relation [50],

R[∇2f ] = ∂

where p is the distance from the origin to the hyperplane. From this and the fact that
R‖[δhij] = 2δA, we find a relation between the spatial curvature and the area perturbation,

R[δR] = −2 ∂

Comparing to (26), we end up with

δA = 8πGNR[δTtt]. (31)

To solve (31) for δA, we convolve the source with the Green function,6

G(p, q) = (q − p)θ(q − p). (32)

This yields

B. Emergent entanglement equilibrium

We can now connect these classical GR concepts to entanglement data of an underlying
quantum state in an abstract Hilbert space. Although the physical meaning of equation
(34) is unambiguous in the classical theory, these quantities should ultimately be derived
from the quantum state if space is emergent from entanglement. On the left-hand side, as
we know from previous constructions [12], the area perturbation δA can be identified with
the sum of mutual information δI/2α along the cut C in an RC state. In the case where the
overall state is pure,

δI(ΣC : Σ̄C) = 2δS(ΣC). (35)

On the right-hand side of (34), in a semiclassical theory we interpret the classical quantity

δTtt as the expectation value of a quantum operator T̂tt in some particular state of a quantum
field theory on curved spacetime. We then recognize that the integral in (34) is related to
the modular Hamiltonian of the right Rindler wedge for a quantum field theory, translated
spatially by p. More explicitly, take p = 0 and identify the normal of C with the direction in
which the Rindler observer accelerates, which we take to be the x-axis. We then have the
QFT expression for the Rindler modular Hamiltonian,

Ĥmod = 2π

∫ ∫
x>0

xT̂tt d
nx. (36)

We therefore consider the right-hand side of (34) to represent the expectation value of the
modular Hamiltonian of some effective field theory on a flat background, evaluated with
respect to some linearized perturbation of a quantum state δρEFT, such that

δTtt = Tr[δρEFTT̂tt]. (37)

In the linearized regime, it must also be proportional to the entanglement entropy pertur-
bation δSEFT(C) of the same half-space demarcated by C, via the entanglement first law
[71],

δ〈Ĥmod〉 = δSEFT(C). (38)

Substituting these new variables and using (15), (34) becomes

1

2
δI(ΣC : Σ̄C) + 4GαδSEFT(C) = 0 (pure state), (39)

or using the RC relation (2),

δS(ΣC) + 4GNαδSEFT(C) = 0. (40)

Let us try to understand this relation in the context of deriving geometry from a quantum

15



state. By construction, δS(ΣC), which is proportional to the area perturbation, is the
contribution that we have consistently identified with the RC part of the entanglement. The
more difficult question is how δSEFT should be identified. Recall that from assumption (A2),
in ground states of systems satisfying an area law [37] or other approximately-redundancy-
constrained states, one can write the total entanglement entropy associated with a subsystem
Σ as

Stotal(Σ) = SRC(Σ) + Ssub(Σ), (41)

where the RC contribution SRC, or the area-scaling contribution when there is a well-defined
geometry, dominates over the subleading correction Ssub. Motivated by the RT formula
with subleading corrections, we claim in assumption (A5) that SEFT can be interpreted as
originating from the subleading corrections Ssub to the RC entropy contribution. We will
further discuss this claim and its similarities with a generalized form of the RT formula in
section V.

Jacobson [19] derived Einstein’s equation in a semiclassical bulk spacetime from the
concept of entanglement equilibrium. This is the assumption that the total entanglement
entropy of a small ball in some maximally-symmetric background spacetime is extremal,
i.e., δStotal = 0 when a small perturbation is added. To complete the derivation, one has to
separate the entanglement into UV and IR contributions, such that δStotal = δSUV + δSIR.
In [19], δSUV ∼ δA is assumed to be the area variation in some background geometry and
δSIR is identified with the entanglement entropy of a field theory regulated in some way.

Our equation (40) relating geometric entropy to the entropy perturbation of an emergent
EFT can be thought of as a version of the modified entanglement equilibrium condition
(MEEC) from assumption (A4). The geometric term corresponds to the UV contribution,
while the EFT (matter) term corresponds to the infrared,

δS(ΣC)↔ δSUV ↔ δSRC, (42)

4GNαδSEFT(C)↔ δSIR ↔ δSsub, (43)

and the condition (40) states that these sum to zero near the background. A crucial dif-
ference, however, is instead of entanglement across some small ball centered at a point, the
condition now has to hold across all cuts C made by (n − 1)-dimensional totally-geodesic
submanifolds in the background space. This also differs from [19] in that one no longer has
to rely on CFT modular Hamiltonians by assuming the special property of the matter field
theory having an UV fixed point. The result holds for a generic QFT with the corresponding
Rindler Hamiltonian.

For now, we will proceed with the identification δSsub = δSEFT. This fixes the constant
α = 1/4GN , the value required for the consistency of Einstein’s equation and the holographic
bound. Consequently, MEEC translates into a more general relation, whereby UV and IR
portions of the entropy are identified not based on assumptions in semiclassical physics, but

16



rather on the properties of quantum entanglement,

0 = δStotal

= δSRC + δSsub

= αδA+ δSEFT. (44)

With this identification, the above relation is a necessary condition for a state to have
emergent properties consistent with general relativity at low energies.

Therefore, by making the identification that the subleading entropy to RC with matter
field entropy, similar to the vacuum-subtracted (Casini) entropy [32–34], we establish an
equivalence between the modified entanglement equilibrium condition (44) and the Radon
transform of the linearized Hamiltonian constraint (31). This argument can also be used
to generalize the result of [4] in AdS/CFT to other (non-flat) geometries, as long as the
function is invertible under Radon transform in the background Riemannian manifold.

C. Linearized Einstein Equation from entanglement

We can now put the picture together to derive dynamics for the emergent spacetime
geometry, in a way similar to [19]. For the sake of convenience, let’s assume that from our
previous results one has already emerged a flat background geometry from MDS or tensor
Radon transform techniques. Similar to the AdS/CFT case considered in [4], we now wish to
determine if the geometric deformation from entanglement perturbations responds in a way
consistent with Einstein gravity. A similar conclusion can also be generalized to hyperbolic
spaces using MDS with a best fit curvature parameter following the procedure of [29], but
we will not consider that case here.

Consider the quantum system from which flat space is emergent. For concreteness, the
total system could be described by a quantum state |ψ〉 ∈ H =

⊗
iHi, as in assumption

(A1). A subsystem is thus described by the reduced density operator associated with some
Hilbert subspace. Any cut C that corresponds to a codimension-1 hyperplane in the emergent
geometry will bipartition the system into two adjacent non-overlapping regions. One can
compute the entanglement entropy for either region Σ, which reads S(Σ) = SRC(Σ)+Ssub(Σ),
as in (A2). Now we add a perturbation to obtain |Ψ〉 = |ψ〉 + δ|ψ〉. The perturbation will
modify the entanglement, which in turn changes the emergent geometry, following the area
perturbation defined by (A3).

The MEEC assumption (A4) relates perturbations in the RC and subdominant contri-
butions to the entropy across C,

0 = δSRC + δSsub. (45)

Using assumption (A5) to relate the subdominant term to the vacuum-subtracted entropy
of an effective field theory, the MEEC is equivalent to the (scalar) Radon transform of the
classical Hamiltonian constraint linearized against a flat background,

R[δR] = 16πGNR[δTtt], (46)

17



as argued in the previous subsection. Here δR is the spatial curvature perturbation and
δTtt is the linear perturbation of the stress-energy associated with an effective field theory
living on the background. Because this relation holds for all such cuts in the flat background
space, equation (46) uniquely determines the linearized Hamiltonian constraint,

δR = 16πGNδTtt, (47)

provided the inverse is well-defined.
Following assumption (A6) about dynamics, we consider a sequence of states |Ψ(t)〉 la-

beled by a single parameter t, which together describe a Lorentzian spacetime. The corre-
sponding emergent spatial geometries can be thought of as embedded spacelike slices in a
spacetime with coordinates in synchronous gauge. In terms of a unit timelike vector field tµ

normal to these slices, the Hamiltonian constraint (47) can be written as

δGµνt
µtν = 8πGNδTµνt

µtν . (48)

Under the Lorentz-invariance assumption (A7), this must be valid for arbitrary normal tµ.
We therefore have the full linearized Einstein’s equation,

δGµν = 8πGNδTµν . (49)

While the number of conjectural assumptions needed to reach the result is admittedly consid-
erable, we find the path we’ve outlined to be a promising route to deriving bulk gravitational
dynamics directly from the evolution of an abstract wave function in Hilbert space.

V. ENTANGLEMENT RT FORMULA AND QUANTUM ERROR CORRECTION

It would be useful to have a more systematic approach to decomposing an abstract
quantum state into geometric (UV) and matter (IR) degrees of freedom. In the previous
section we proposed one such procedure, identifying SRC = αA and Ssub = SEFT when
the state is approximately RC and admits an emergent geometry. This identification also
proposes a background-free way of understanding these “UV” and “IR” entropies purely
from the characteristics of entanglement, which can be done for arbitrary quantum states.

In this section, we will connect these observations with the Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) formula
from AdS/CFT. We will also argue that more general emergent geometries can be assigned to
quantum error correction codes, where the code subspace naturally separates the geometric
and matter contributions to entanglement entropy. Our considerations here are tentative
(even by the standards of the rest of the paper), and would require more elaboration to
make precise.

Let’s first recall the RT entropy relation in the case of AdS/CFT with a subleading N0

correction [72],

SCFT(A) =
Aext(A)

4GN
+ Sbulk. (50)

Here, SCFT(A) is the entanglement entropy of a subregion A in the boundary field theory,

18



Aext(A) denotes the area of a bulk extremal surface homologous to A, and Sbulk is a correction
representing contributions from bulk matter fields.

The RT formula relates boundary quantities to bulk quantities in a holographic setting.
But there is an obvious analogy to the BEG relation

Stotal = SRC + Ssub (51)

=
A(C)
4G

+ SEFT(C) (52)

for a cut C by a totally geodesic codimension-1 submanifold of an emergent spacetime. In this
case, the MEEC is an infinitesimal version of (52), and can be interpreted as a perturbative
version of an RT-like relation for which δSCFT = 0. It may be possible to understand this
relation from a more general perspective, in which AdS/CFT is a special case manifested as
a duality.

If we interpret the bulk AdS as an emergent entity from the boundary conformal field
theory, we can think of the CFT to be the fundamental theory, from which we reconstruct
a theory in the IR that describes bulk gravity. In this emergent limit, different parts of the
entanglement entropy of the supposed fundamental theory take on other physical meanings
related to geometry and matter. In [73], Lin proposed that such a separation of entanglement
may also be understood in a more general setting, where the “fundamental” theory, whose
Hilbert space factorizes and does not have a gauge symmetry, has an emergent gauge theory
in the IR.7 As such, the entanglement entropy Sfund of a subregion in the fundamental theory
can be written in a form Sfund = Sedge +SIR. Here Sedge, which depends on the UV regulator
such as a lattice cutoff, takes on the meaning of the analogous area-law term in RT. The IR
entropy SIR corresponds to the entanglement of the emergent gauge theory

8.
Therefore, we may also speculate that a geometry other than AdS emerges from a funda-

mental theory that is amorphous, in the sense that there are no pre-determined geometric
elements. In this case, a generalization of the RT formula (50) should still provide a natural
separation between UV and IR and identification of the geometric and matter parts of the
entanglement without something like a 1/N expansion. It’s worth investigating the prospect
that this can be done directly from the state and its associated Hilbert space.

Here we point out another possible construction proposed by Harlow [28] making use of
quantum error correction codes (QECC), or more specifically, the erasure correction codes.
A similar RT-like formula is derived in the context of quantum error correction, without
having to rely on a background geometry. For the sake of clarity we briefly review some
findings of [28].

A typical way to protect states against quantum errors is to encode the information non-
locally, such that local errors will not easily contaminate the protected information. For
instance, let |φ〉 ∈ Hφ be a qudit worth of quantum information. One can encode it in a
larger Hilbert space

H = (Hφ)⊗N . (53)

A basis for H can be formed from the tensor product of basis vectors |ij〉 of each copy j of
7 A gauge theory is emergent if the low energy behavior of the fundamental theory can be identified with

that of a gauge theory. We refer the readers to the original reference for the precise definition used in the

derivations.
8 Similar ideas appear in the study of emergent gravity in condensed matter models [74] with emergent

gauge theories [75].
19



Hφ. To encode the original state

|φ〉 =
∑
i

Ci|i〉 ∈ Hφ (54)

by mapping it to H, we first map each basis element by some fixed rule,

|i〉 → |̃i〉 =
∑

i1,i2...iN

µĩi1i2...iN |i1, i2 . . . iN〉 (55)

for some coefficients µĩi1i2...iN . The encoding then takes the form

|φ〉 → |φ̃〉 =
∑
ĩ

Cĩ |̃i〉 ∈ H. (56)

The vector subspace of H spanned by {|̃i〉} is the code subspace, Hcode.

To be consistent with the notation in the literature, we will refer to the N qudits making
up H as the physical qudits. Let A be a subsystem consisting of a subset of the physical
qudits, and Ā its complement, so that

H = HA ⊗HĀ. (57)

The encoded information is said to be protected against erasure on Ā if for all

|φ̃〉 ∈ Hcode ⊂ H, (58)

there exists an operator UA ⊗ IĀ such that

UA ⊗ IĀ|φ̃〉A∪Ā = |φ〉j∈A ⊗ |χ〉A∪Ā\{j} (59)

for some state |χ〉 ∈ ⊗i 6=jHφ. Intuitively, this property allows one to recover the encoded
quantum information even though degrees of freedom in HĀ are inaccessible.

Now consider the scenario in which the code subspace can encode many qudits. One
construction is to consider a QECC in which the code subspace factorizes

Hcode = Ha ⊗Hā. (60)

We want the subset a of these code-subspace qudits to be recoverable from the subsystem
A of the larger Hilbert space, and similarly the complementary set ā to be recoverable from
Ā. Assume each of HA,HĀ is further factorizable:

HA = HA1 ⊗HA2 , HĀ = HĀ1 ⊗HĀ2 , (61)

20



where dimHA1 = dimHĀ1 = dimHcode. As demonstrated by Harlow, a QECC that performs
the desired complementary recovery, which satisfies

|̃i〉|j̃〉 = UAUĀ(|i〉A1|j〉Ā1 |χ〉A2Ā2) (62)

for some entangled state |χ〉A2Ā2 and unitaries UA⊗IĀ, IA⊗UĀ, will also satisfy an analogous
RT relation. Here, |̃i〉, |j̃〉,|i〉A1 , |j〉Ā1 are orthonormal basis vectors for the Hilbert spaces
Ha, Hā, HA1 and HĀ1 respectively.

Given a density operator in the code subspace

ρ̃ = |φ̃〉〈φ̃| ∈ L(Hcode) ⊂ L(H), (63)

define reduced density matrices

ρ̃A = TrĀ ρ̃ (64)

ρ̃a = Trā ρ̃ (65)

ρχ = TrĀ2 |χ〉〈χ|. (66)

The resulting RT-like relation for the entropies then takes the form,

S(ρ̃A) = S(ρχ) + S(ρ̃a)

S(ρ̃Ā) = S(ρχ) + S(ρ̃ā), (67)

In the familiar examples of holographic tensor networks and quantum error correction
codes [39, 40], the term S(ρχ) is proportional to the area of the minimal RT surface anchored
at the boundary of A.9 Consequently, the term S(ρχ) can be understood as the geometric
entanglement contribution, while S(ρ̃a) is naturally identified with the “matter” contribution
to bulk entropy. The sum of these two quantities is equal to S(ρ̃A), which is the entanglement
entropy of the boundary subregion A.

This generalized RT-like formula can be compared to our equation for the entanglement
entropy of a subsystem (41) as the sum of an RC contribution and a subdominant correction.
In particular, the emergent entanglement equilibrium relation (40) can be thought of as the
first-order variation of this formula, with the first term representing an area and the second
the contribution from the emergent EFT. In this sense, the entropy formulae underlying
BEG can be found more generally in the context of quantum error-correcting codes. This
relation helps shed light on the decomposition of the entanglement entropy into UV geometric
contributions and IR contributions from matter fields.

The derivation leading to (67) makes no reference to a pre-existing geometry or holog-
raphy. Indeed, it is reasonable to expect such properties to apply to contexts more general

9 For example, the entropy S(χ) is computed by a distillation process and counting the Bell pairs in Sec 4

of [39]. The cut along the Bell pairs is precisely the bulk minimal surface γAĀ anchored at the boundary

of A and Ā.

21



than AdS/CFT. In particular, conventional QECC as well as the operator-algebra quan-
tum error correction seem directly applicable to bulk entanglement gravity. In fact, they
can be used to reconstruct a geometry as long as a notion of entanglement entropy can be
consistently defined and computed.

In the case we are currently interested in, the overall finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces H
in BEG can be identified with the physical Hilbert space in QECC. A state |ψ〉 that encodes
geometric information corresponds to the code state |φ̃〉 ∈ H above. The subsystem A in the
form of physical qudits can be identified with some collection of Hilbert space factors (graph
vertices) in BEG. In addition, the code comes equipped with a code subspace Hcode ⊂ H
which is now identified with the IR subspace of the emergent matter fields. Thus, a natural
separation of UV (geometric) and IR (matter) degrees of freedom is simply provided by the
subspace or subalgebra associated with a QECC.

Hence, a spatial geometry can be obtained and assigned to quantum error correction
codes that do not presume a geometrical interpretation a priori. BEG can be particularly
useful in the case when one considers deviations from maximally symmetric spaces. For a
dynamical theory that preserves the code subspace and Lorentz invariance, the linearized
Einstein’s equation may emerge as a more generic property, rather than coming from a
special theory.

VI. DISCUSSION

In this work, we have extended the “space from Hilbert space” program of [12], which
posits that spatial geometry can emerge from the entanglement features of appropriate quan-
tum states, to consider the gravitational dynamics of spacetime. By suggesting a modified
entanglement equilibrium condition as well as other assumptions, we are able to sketch how
the spacetime metric can be reconstructed from entanglement using the Radon transform,
and it how it naturally obeys Einstein’s equation at the linearized level. Our analysis was
carried out entirely in (what emerges as) the bulk of spacetime; the entanglement we consider
is between Hilbert-space factors representing local degrees of freedom, without reference to
AdS/CFT or any other holographic boundary construction. Colloquially, this bulk entan-
glement gravity approach can be thought of as finding gravity within quantum mechanics,
as opposed to the more conventional approach of quantizing a particular model of spacetime
structure. It also seems to indicate the plausibility of discovering gravitational features from
more generic complex quantum systems.

Further work will clearly be required to flesh out this program and put the necessary
assumptions on a firmer footing. We can list a few of the biggest looming questions.

• One is to explore the feasibility of developing a specific theory of quantum gravity using
quantum information beyond the context of AdS/CFT, for example by specifying
an explicit Hamiltonian, but perhaps by less direct means. For instance, a set of
constraints on the quantum dynamics could be derived by requiring the emergence of
classical general relativity.

• Geometry from entanglement is an interesting program all by itself, even without
the emergence of gravity. It is important to understand how and if more general
emergent geometries, possibly along with their metric tensors, can be reconstructed
from entanglement data.

22



• It is also important to address the hope that Lorentz symmetry can be emergent.
While there have been discussions mostly in the loop quantum gravity and condensed
matter communities, a clear understanding of its feasibility is still lacking.

• Given the recent interest in emergent gauge theories in condensed matter models, it
may be possible to understand if certain condensed matter models can be “gravitized”
by emerging the geometry through entanglement of a state, instead of using the pre-
existing geometry provided by the lattice structure or Hamiltonian. This may yield
interesting toy models that exhibit (analogous) features of gravity.

• It would be useful to contemplate the emergence of holography from this perspective,
going beyond the weak-field gravity context considered here.

In addition, one can point to a few more circumscribed and well-defined challenges.

• The BEG framework is natural for assigning emergent geometries to tensor networks
directly from entanglement. It is also useful for deriving emergent geometry for con-
ventional QECCs as well as their generalizations in the form of operator-algebras. It
may be interesting to construct toy models using these concrete tool sets to improve
our intuition for the program.

• Generalizing the tensor Radon transform approach to other Riemannian backgrounds.
One particular direction is to make contact with AdS/CFT by considering asymptot-
ically hyperbolic spaces.

• Another task is to further understand the UV/IR separation. Since QECC provides
a natural separation and a concrete testing ground, specific toy models may be con-
structed that have non-trivial dynamical properties [76]. Efforts in this direction would
also improve our understanding in adding backreaction and incorporating general ge-
ometries in a tensor network model. On the other hand, geometric characterizations
may also help categorize entanglement and code properties.

• It would be useful to understand how general the MEEC is in quantum systems near
equilibrium, and what physical interpretation can be attached to the two terms.

This work has been guided by the conviction that quantum mechanics is the most fun-
damental theory we have, and implicitly by the Everettian formulation of the theory (the
wave function is the only physical variable, and it evolves smoothly and deterministically
over time). In that context, one can argue informally that quantum gravity must emerge in
roughly the way outlined here. We human beings generally construct quantum theories by
starting with classical theories and quantizing them, but presumably nature doesn’t work
that way. There simply is a quantum state, represented by a vector in Hilbert space, evolv-
ing according to the Schrödinger equation with some particular Hamiltonian. (For these
purposes we take time as fundamental, but it is also conceivable that time itself is emer-
gent, arising through the entanglement of “system” and “clock” factors of Hilbert space.)
Familiar classical concepts such as “locations in space” and “fields” are necessarily emergent
from this basic structure. Here we have sketched how space and its geometry may plausibly
emerge from the entanglement between discrete Hilbert-space factors, and how gravitational
dynamics obeying Einstein’s equation can be related to entanglement equilibrium. The is a
promising route to a perspective on quantum gravity that puts “quantum” first.
