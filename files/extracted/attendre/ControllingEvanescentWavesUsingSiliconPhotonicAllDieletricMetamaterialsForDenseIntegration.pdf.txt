Ultra-compact, densely integrated optical components manufactured on a CMOS-foundry

platform are highly desirable for optical information processing and electronic-photonic co-

integration. However, the large spatial extent of evanescent waves arising from nanoscale

confinement, ubiquitous in silicon photonic devices, causes significant cross-talk and scat-

tering loss. Here, we demonstrate that anisotropic all-dielectric metamaterials open a new

degree of freedom in total internal reflection to shorten the decay length of evanescent

waves. We experimentally show the reduction of cross-talk by greater than 30 times and the

bending loss by greater than 3 times in densely integrated, ultra-compact photonic circuit

blocks. Our prototype all-dielectric metamaterial-waveguide achieves a low propagation loss

of approximately 3.7±1.0 dB/cm, comparable to those of silicon strip waveguides. Our

approach marks a departure from interference-based confinement as in photonic crystals or

slot waveguides, which utilize nanoscale field enhancement. Its ability to suppress evanescent

waves without substantially increasing the propagation loss shall pave the way for all-

dielectric metamaterial-based dense integration.

One of the long-standing goals of nanophotonics is theintegration of electronic and photonic circuitry on asingle CMOS chip for applications ranging from infor-
mation processing and data centers to massively parallel sen-
sing1–11. This necessarily requires miniaturization with low power
consumption in optical interconnects, active as well as passive
photonic devices. There are two major figures of merit in
designing photonic devices for a densely integrated circuit. One is
the cross-talk, which occurs due to the field overlap of two
adjacent photonic waveguides, and the second is the radiation
loss at sharp bends which limits the integration density6.

Plasmonic waveguides can strongly reduce cross-talk and
bending loss owing to the sub-diffraction nature of light coupling
to the free electrons of metals12–19. However, the large ohmic loss
of metals restricts the application of plasmonic structures for
photonic integration20,21. Over the last decade, many efforts have
been made to miniaturize photonic components using all-
dielectric structures22–36. Figure 1 illustrates a few classes of
dielectric waveguides for light confinement in photonic chips.
Strip waveguides, the most common type of waveguides for
routing light in a silicon chip, are composed of a silicon channel
surrounded by silicon oxide6 (Fig. 1a). Owing to the high contrast
between the refractive index of the core and the cladding, light is
confined inside the core as a result of total internal reflection
(TIR). However, the mode size is seen to increase as we reduce
the core size which hampers the use of strip waveguides to further
miniaturize photonic circuits37. Photonic crystal waveguides can
confine light inside a line defect due to Bragg reflection40

(Fig. 1b). These waveguides perform efficiently at very sharp
bends41, however, the integration density is limited as the peri-
odicity of Bragg reflectors is on the order of the wavelength and it
cannot be perturbed by another waveguide nearby42. Addition-
ally, slot waveguides have been proposed to confine light inside a
sub-wavelength low-index gap surrounded by high-index

dielectric rods43 (Fig. 1c). To satisfy the continuity of the normal
component of the displacement current at the high-contrast
interface, the electric field peaks inside the gap, leading to light
confinement but at the cost of skin-depth expansion in the
cladding. This causes cross-talk between adjacent waveguides and
radiation loss at sharp bends in dense photonic-integrated
circuits.

Several alternative approaches inspired from atomic phy-
sics44,45, transformation optics46, and inverse design algo-
rithms47,48 have also been proposed to minimize the cross-talk
and the bending loss. However, these techniques add design
complexity and often require modification of the core as well as
cladding46. They are not implementable on a large-scale and
cause propagation loss fundamentally limiting device perfor-
mance. Thus, a new low-loss and scalable platform is needed for
CMOS-foundry compatible dense photonic integration with low
cross-talk and reduced bending loss.

In this paper, we demonstrate a platform that is fundamentally
different from the existing approaches for designing CMOS
compatible, ultra-compact, and low-loss waveguides using all-
dielectric anisotropic metamaterials. Our approach works based
on photonic skin-depth engineering of evanescent waves in the
cladding using a recently proposed degree of freedom in TIR37,49.
To describe the light confinement mechanism in our waveguides,
first, we experimentally demonstrate the phenomenon of relaxed
TIR in anisotropic metamaterials. These relaxed conditions allow
the control of evanescent wave decay, which is the fundamental
origin of cross-talk and bending loss in silicon photonic devices.
As illustrated in Fig. 1d, we use these anisotropic metamaterials as
a cladding for on-chip dielectric waveguides fabricated on a
monolithic silicon-on-insulator (SOI) platform. As a result, cross-
talk is reduced down to −30 dB in the photonic circuit. Fur-
thermore, we use a transformation optics approach to show that
the radiation loss at sharp bends is strongly influenced by the
skin-depth in the cladding. We experimentally show that the
anisotropic metamaterial cladding can simultaneously reduce the
bending loss at sharp bends up to three times compared with
conventional silicon strip waveguides. We clarify the counter-
intuitive nature of light confinement in our approach compared
with existing photonic crystal, slot waveguide, and graded index
waveguide methods38,43,50–53. Our work shows that all-dielectric
anisotropy on-chip presents a scalable route to simultaneously
improve cross-talk and bending loss with propagation loss as low
as ≈3.67 dB/cm. For completeness, we show the improvements in
figures of merit of our achieved platform with recent state-of-the-
art photonic designs (see Table 1).

Results
Relaxed TIR. We demonstrate that only a single component of
the dielectric tensor governs TIR in anisotropic media opening a
new degree of freedom to control evanescent waves. In

conventional TIR, if n1>n2 (n1 and n2 are the refractive index of
the medium 1 and medium 2, respectively) and the incident angle
is greater than the critical angle (θc ¼ sin�1 n2=n1ð Þ), light is
reflected back to the first medium and decays evanescently in the
second medium. However, we have recently found that the TIR
conditions at the interface of an isotropic and an anisotropic
dielectric are relaxed to37,54:

We emphasize that these relaxed conditions for p polarized
incident light allow us to arbitrarily increase or decrease the
permittivity in the z direction, whereas still preserving TIR. This

hitherto un-utilized degree of freedom can thus be used to control
the skin-depth of evanescent waves. If ε2z � 1, evanescent waves
decay faster than in vacuum allowing for strong light confinement
inside dielectric waveguides37,49. In this limit, note that the
averaged index in anisotropic medium 2 can be larger than the
refractive index in isotropic medium 1 yet the light will be totally
reflected above the critical angle.

We implement this anisotropy using Si/SiO2 multilayers with
subwavelength thicknesses (Fig. 2a) at the telecommunication
wavelength (λ= 1550 nm). Figure 2 highlights the contrast
between relaxed TIR and conventional TIR, showing the
measured light reflection at the interface of a hemi-cylindrical
Si prism and the anisotropic multilayer metamaterial. The
periodicity of the multilayer is Λ= 100 nm and five periods
have been deposited on the prism. The Maxwell–Garnett effective
medium theory (EMT)55 predicts that the multilayer with
subwavelength periodicity demonstrates strong anisotropy37,56–
59 at the operating wavelength (ε2y ¼ ε2z ¼ εSiρþ εSiO2ð1� ρÞ
and 1=ε2x ¼ ρ=εSi þ ð1� ρÞ=εSiO2 where ρ is the fill fraction of
silicon). Note we are in the effective medium metamaterial limit
Λ � λð Þ away from the photonic crystal regime Λ � λð Þ.
Reflection occurs on two interfaces, the primary silicon-
metamaterial interface and the secondary metamaterial-air inter-
face. We have deposited a thin tungsten layer on top of the

Fig. 2 Relaxed total internal reflection. a Schematic of the relaxed TIR experiment. We measure the reflection from the Si prism and Si/SiO2 multilayer
interface for both s and p polarizations at λ=1550 nm. Multiple samples with different ρ have been fabricated. The periodicity for all samples is 100 nm and
the total thickness of the multilayer is 500 nm. A 200 nm layer of tungsten is deposited on top of the multilayer (brown) to suppress the reflection from
the air interface. b The measured critical angle for s and p polarizations vs. the silicon filling fraction in comparison with effective medium theory (EMT)

multilayer from the critical angle measurements show strong anisotropy in agreement with EMT. The refractive index of Si and SiO2 are taken to be 3.4 and

claddings strongly affect the decay of the evanescent wave in the cladding. The practical multilayer structure performs close to an ideal anisotropic case

multilayer metamaterial to attenuate the unwanted reflection
from the secondary metamaterial/air interface. Figure 2b displays
different measured critical angles for s and p polarizations.
Various samples with different fill fractions have been fabricated.
As ρ deviates from 0 and 1, the multilayer displays effective
anisotropy and the critical angle for s and p polarized incidences
are separated in agreement with relaxed TIR theory in Eq. (2).
The effective permittivity of the multilayer structure (extracted
from the critical angle) shows strong anisotropy and is in good
agreement with EMT (Fig. 2c). It is clearly seen that the critical
angle depends on only one component of the permittivity tensor
for each polarization irrespective of the fill fraction. With the
extra degree of freedom afforded by the other components of the
dielectric tensor, this anisotropic structure can be used as a
cladding for conventional dielectric waveguides to control the
evanescent waves and skin-depth in the cladding37,60. Figure 2d
displays the effect of the multilayer anisotropic cladding on
reducing of the evanescent wave skin-depth as compared to a
conventional slab waveguide. Note that this evanescent wave
engineering approach in extreme skin-depth (e-skid) waveguides
is owing to the fast variation of the evanescent fields in a

subwavelength high-index-contrast superlattice (Fig. 2d). This is
fundamentally different from other light confinement strategies
which function on interference of propagating waves (photonic
crystals) or field enhancement in a slot38,43,51–53.

On-chip e-skid waveguides. To impact the field of silicon pho-
tonics, the one-dimensional e-skid waveguide (Fig. 2d) has to be
implemented on an SOI platform. This places stringent restric-
tions on monolithic fabrication, minimum feature sizes, and
deviations in field profiles due to quasi-2D behavior. Our design
to adapt relaxed TIR and skin-depth engineering δ � λð Þ on-
chip is shown in Fig. 3. Here the conventional quasi-2D strip
waveguide is surrounded by a cladding made of alternating
vacuum-silicon sub-wavelength ridges which achieves strong
anisotropy (ε2x<εcore and ε2z � 1). Our goal is to confine the TE-
like mode (its dominant electric field component is Ex) used in
conventional silicon strip waveguides. Since the TM-like mode is
polarized in the y direction, the electric field does not probe/feel
the anisotropy of the cladding. Hence, the metamaterial cladding
does not play any role in TM mode confinement. For more details
about the polarization effect, see Supplementary Figures 6 and 7.

Figure 3a emphasizes the counterintuitive nature of the
confinement caused by anisotropic media which beats the
confinement of conventional high index-contrast interface
consisting of silicon surrounded by vacuum (blue curve in
Fig. 3a). As it is seen in Fig. 3a, if we increase the index of the
cladding only in the z direction, whereas the index in the other
directions are fixed, the evanescent wave decays faster in the
cladding and the skin-depth reduces drastically. Note, the average
cladding index increases but the mode decay length decreases.
This behavior is in fundamental contrast to confinement in
conventional strip waveguides with isotropic claddings or graded
index claddings53 where decreasing the contrast between the core
index and cladding index results in slow decay of evanescent
waves, not faster decay49.

Figure 3b shows the field profile of a practical e-skid waveguide
with the multilayer metamaterial cladding Λ � λð Þ. We can see
the practical multilayer cladding shows strong effective aniso-
tropy to ensure the fast decay of the evanescent wave in the
cladding. The 2D field profiles in a plane perpendicular to the
propagation direction and comparison of the practical e-skid
waveguide with a homogeneous anisotropic cladding are shown
in Figs. 3c and 3d. A good agreement with the effective medium
approximation is seen. Figures 3e-h illustrate the effective modal
index and the decay constant in the cladding for a wide range of
core sizes and the fill fractions of silicon in the multilayer
cladding. First, a strong agreement is seen between EMT and
practical multilayer structures, indicating that the cladding indeed
achieves effective all-dielectric anisotropy. Second, the effective
modal index is below the core index indicative of relaxed TIR as
the mechanism of confinement. As expected, simulations prove
that the primary role of the on-chip multilayer cladding is to
increase the decay constant of evanescent waves kx′′=k0ð Þ, as
shown in Figs. 3f, h, and it does not significantly change the
effective modal index of propagating waves kz′=k0ð Þ, as shown in
Figs. 3e, g. It is seen that the largest decay constant is achieved at
ρ � 0:5 where the strongest anisotropy is attained. Note that ρ=

0 corresponds to the case of no cladding. We also emphasize that
the power in the core is not compromised by the presence of the
skin-depth engineering cladding and increased anisotropy causes
an enhancement in power confinement.

This light confinement strategy in e-skid waveguides is
fundamentally different from that in photonic crystal waveguides.
Our multilayer structures function in the deep subwavelength
limit Λ � λð Þ, not the photonic crystal limit Λ � λð Þ and the
performance of the e-skid waveguide is independent of the
multilayer periodicity or disorder (see Supplementary note 2).
Furthermore, there are no Dyakonov wave solutions in e-skid
waveguides as the optical axis of the anisotropic cladding is
perpendicular to the interface and the direction of propaga-
tion22,61–65. It is also important to note that the main goal of the
anisotropic multilayer cladding is to control the decay constant of
evanescent waves on-chip, not to achieve birefringence in the
effective modal index of propagating waves as achieved previously
in sub-wavelength grating structures26,50,51,66, multi-slotted
waveguides52, or nonlinear phase matching applications67.

Cross-talk in e-skid waveguides. The skin-depth of evanescent
waves is the fundamental origin of cross-talk between waveguides
that hinders dense photonic integration. Cross-talk, or power
coupling between photonic devices, arises owing to the pertur-
bation of the optical mode when the evanescent tail of one
waveguide overlaps with a nearby waveguide. However, if we
control the skin-depth in the cladding, we can reduce the per-
turbation due to the adjacent waveguide, subsequently reducing
the cross-talk to surpass the integration limit in current silicon
photonics.

We now demonstrate this drastic reduction in the cross-talk
made possible with the anisotropy in the cladding (Fig. 4a). The
top view image of coupled e-skid waveguides fabricated on an
SOI chip is shown in Fig. 4b. The power exchanged between two

between the two waveguides (s), and Λ are 220 nm, 1000 nm, and 120 nm, respectively. A cladding oxide is also added on the top of the waveguides. The
number of ridges between the waveguides is dictated by the waveguide core size. b Top view SEM image of the coupled e-skid waveguides. c The
experimental setup to measure the cross-talk between the two waveguides at the telecommunication wavelength (λ=1550 nm). Light is in-coupled to the
first waveguide through the middle grating coupler. The second waveguide is coupled to the first waveguide for a length of L. In this experiment, the
bending radius is 5 μm, hence, we can ignore the bending loss. d The ratio between the measured output powers for strip waveguide and e-skid waveguide
vs. L at the telecommunication wavelength. The ratio for the e-skid waveguide is two orders of magnitude lower, indicating that far less power is coupled to
the second waveguide. The inset shows the ratio for the waveguides without the top cladding oxide. In this case, the metamaterial cladding can increase
the coupling length up to 30 times or reduce the cross-talk -30 dB. See Supplementary Figure 8 for more details. e Comparison of the simulated and
measured coupling length for e-skid waveguides and strip waveguides. The coupling length is normalized to the wavelength. Error bars represent the
standard deviation of the fitting curves. The optimum match between the simulation and experiment is achieved when ρ= 0.6 for the cladding of e-skid
waveguides. The coupling length for e-skid waveguides is an order of magnitude larger in comparison with strip waveguides (shaded region). The coupling
length for strip waveguides with larger core size decreases because the overlap between the evanescent tails is increased although more power is confined
inside the core (unshaded region)

where I0 is the input power, L is the distance for which the two
waveguides are coupled, and Lc is the coupling length. Note Lc is
defined such that if the waveguides are coupled for a distance
L=Lc, complete power transfer occurs from the first waveguide to
the adjacent waveguide. Figure 4c illustrates the experimental
setup to measure the coupling length. Light is in-coupled to the
first waveguide through the grating coupler68 and the second
waveguide is coupled to the first waveguide over a distance of L.
The center-to-center separation between the two waveguides is
only 1000 nm. The output power of the two waveguides is out-
coupled by the two grating couplers at the ends of each
waveguide. Note that we can ignore the propagation loss in this
experiment as the total length does not exceed a few hundred
microns, whereas the propagation loss is 3.67 dB/cm at the
operating wavelength λ=1550 nm (see Supplementary Note 6 for
details about the characterization of the propagation loss). The
ratio between the measured powers for strip waveguides and e-
skid waveguides are shown in Fig. 4d. This highlights that the
analytical expression I2=I1 ¼ tan2 πL=2Lcð Þð Þ matches the experi-
mental data. It is clearly seen that the coupled power to the
second waveguide is almost two orders of magnitude lower for

the e-skid waveguide. The measured and simulated69 coupling
length normalized to the wavelength for different core sizes is
plotted in Fig. 4e for waveguides with the same separation
distance of 1000 nm. It is seen that the coupling length for the
TE-like mode of e-skid waveguides is an order of magnitude
higher than that for strip waveguides allowing miniaturization of
photonic-integrated circuits without considerable cross-talk
between the waveguides. Note that increasing the core size in
conventional strip waveguides, which corresponds to higher
power confinement inside the core, does not guarantee the
reduction in cross-talk (unshaded region Fig. 4e) as the
evanescent tails are not controlled. These drastically increased
Lc are due to the reduced skin-depth with a higher anisotropy,
reducing the waveguide cross-talk significantly in comparison
with other dielectric structures, which have been proposed to
reduce the cross-talk (Table 1). Note that as the TM-like mode
has a negligible electric field component in the x direction, it does
not probe/feel the dielectric anisotropy of the cladding. As
expected, this results in higher cross-talk for TM-modes
compared with strip waveguides (see Supplementary Figures 6
and 7 for more details about the polarization effect and the
proposed design to control the skin-depth of the TM-like mode).

Bending loss in e-skid waveguides. The critical phenomenon of
bending loss70–72 can also be reduced by adding the anisotropic
metamaterial cladding. The counterintuitive connection of
bending loss and skin-depth is revealed by an approach adapted
from transformation optics70,73. Here, we consider a curved
waveguide in the xz plane with a 90° bend and a bending radius of
R R � δð Þ. The center of the curved waveguide is at the origin
(Figs. 5b, d (inset)). If we apply the transformation:
uþ iw ¼ Rln xþizR ; v ¼ y70,73, the curved waveguide is mapped to
a straight waveguide in the uw plane (Figs. 5b, d). This causes the
refractive index of the transformed waveguide to become inho-
mogeneous in the new coordinate system as70,73:
n′ uð Þ ¼ n xðuÞð Þeu=R, where n x uð Þð Þ is the refractive index of the
straight waveguide as shown in Figs. 5a, b. Bending loss or
radiative power leakage from the core occurs in this straight
inhomogeneous index waveguide when the local index of the
cladding exceeds the effective modal index (neff). Hence, if we
suppress the field near and beyond this radiation condition point
(Figs. 5b, d), we can reduce the bending loss. Note that due to the
spatial transformation of coordinates, the electromagnetic fields
are also transformed causing the expansion of the skin-depth (δ)
on the right-hand side of the waveguide and shrinkage of it on the
left-hand side (Figs. 5b, d):

δright � δ þ 2δ2=R;

δleft � δ � 2δ2=R: ð4Þ

However, if we add the anisotropic metamaterial cladding, we can
reduce the skin-depth. As a result, less power will be radiated at
the radiation condition point, leading to reduced bending loss.

To confirm the effect of the anisotropic metamaterial claddings
on the bending loss, we have investigated the bending losses of
the e-skid and strip waveguides, both experimentally and
numerically74. To characterize the bending losses, we have
cascaded 90° bent waveguides sequentially with different numbers
of turns (Fig. 6a and Supplementary note 4), then characterized
the bending loss per turn by comparing the transmissions.
Figures 6b, c shows the measured bending losses vs. the core size
and the bending radius. In all cases, the bending losses with the e-
skid waveguide is lower than that with the strip waveguide, which
is due to the reduced skin-depth with the anisotropic

radiation condition point denoted by black arrows. The multilayer
metamaterial cladding in e-skid waveguides suppresses the evanescent

conventional bent waveguides, lesser power is radiated owing to curvature
effects

metamaterial claddings. Note that if the fabrication advancements
on the CMOS platform allowed us to reduce the feature size and
approach an ideal anisotropic cladding Λ ! 0ð Þ, we would
achieve further reduction of the bending loss for TE-like modes in
e-skid waveguides (See Supplementary note 4 for more details as
well as the bending loss calculation for TM-like modes). Our
simulations account for all sources of bending loss including
radiation and mode-mismatch.

Discussion
In summary, we have introduced a photonic platform that can
add the critical but overlooked functionality of controlling eva-
nescent waves to the CMOS foundry. We have shown that high-
index contrast grating structures in the deep sub-wavelength limit
can act as an all-dielectric metamaterial cladding for simulta-
neously achieving TIR and controlling the skin-depth of eva-
nescent waves. The coupling length is improved more than an
order of magnitude and the bending loss is improved three times
compared with conventional on-chip waveguides with an average
propagation loss of 3.67 dB/cm at telecommunication wave-
lengths. The decreased photonic skin-depth regime has not been
realized till date but has been attempted in initial studies75. This is
because an anisotropic all-dielectric metamaterial response
requires more than one period of the unit cell to control eva-
nescent wave decay37,49,54. Although we use electron-beam
lithography (EBL) as a convenient prototyping technique for
the sub-wavelength structures, these devices can in principle be
fabricated using deep ultraviolet CMOS foundries; specifically,
advanced 193 nm immersion lithography technology has been
used to fabricate silicon photonic devices with feature sizes down
to 50 nm76. Our work paves the way for all-dielectric metama-
terials to enter the practical realm of CMOS-foundry photonics to
achieve improved photonic-integrated circuits.

Methods
Relaxed total internal reflection. Si/SiO2 multilayers were fabricated using
magnetron sputtering and magnetron reactive sputtering, respectively. Silicon and
silica were both deposited at a power of 150 W using a pulsed power supply at a
frequency of 150 kHz and off time of 0.5 μs for silicon and 0.8 μs for silica. A
special substrate holder was built to hold the prisms during deposition. With the
new substrate holder and the large thickness of the prism, the film properties would
change as the substrate was much closer to the target, producing films with higher
loss. Reducing the deposition power produced lower loss films. A 200 nm thick
layer of tungsten was deposited at 300W, 150 kHz, and 0.5 μs on top of the
multilayer structure at each fill fraction. The prism was illuminated with a 1530 nm

narrow line width laser. A broadband linear polarizer placed in the beam path
created s and p polarized light. The incident angle was increased in increments of 2°
from 10° to 80°. A Newport Optics Optical Power Meter calibrated to a wavelength
of 1530 nm was then used to measure the reflected power. The two reflections at
the prism/air interface in the optical path were accounted for when comparing
experiment with EMT simulations.

On-chip platform 1. The on-chip devices for measuring cross-talk in the main text
and bending loss in Supplementary Figure 9 were fabricated using a JEOL JBX-
6300FS EBL system77 operated at 100 keV energy, 8 nA beam current, and 500 μm
exposure field size. A silicon-on-insulator wafer (220 nm thick silicon on 3 μm
thick silicon dioxide) has been used. A solvent rinse and hot-plate dehydration
baked. Then, hydrogen silsesquioxane resist (HSQ, Dow-Corning XP-1541-006)
was spin-coated at 4000 rpm, and then hot-plate baked at 80 °C for 4 min Shape
placement by the machine grid, the beam stepping grid, and the spacing between
dwell points during the shape writing, were 1 nm, 6 nm, and 6 nm, respectively. An
exposure dose of 2800 μC/cm2 was used. The resist was developed by immersion in
25% tetramethylammonium hydroxide for 4 min., followed by a flowing deionized
water rinse for 60 s, an isopropanol rinse for 10 s. Then blown dry with nitrogen.
The inductively coupled plasma etching in an Oxford Plasmalab System 100 was
used to remove silicon from unexposed areas, with a chlorine gas flow of 20 sccm,
ICP power of 800 W, pressure of 12 mT, bias power of 40 W, and a platen
temperature of 20 °C, resulting in a bias voltage of 185 V. During etching, per-
fluoropolyether vacuum oil was used to mount chips on a 100 mm silicon carrier
wafer. Cladding oxide was deposited using plasma enhanced chemical vapor
deposition in an Oxford Plasmalab System 100 with nitrous oxide flow of
1000.0 sccm, a silane flow of 13.0 sccm, high-purity nitrogen flow of 500.0 sccm,
high-frequency RF power of 120 W, pressure at 1400 mT, and a platen temperature
of 350 °C. Chips rest directly on a silicon carrier wafer during deposition and are
buffered by silicon pieces on all sides to aid uniformity.

To characterize the on-chip devices, a custom-built automated test setup was
used6. An Agilent 81635A optical power sensor was used as the output detector and
Agilent 81600B tunable laser as the input source. The wavelength was swept in 10
pm steps from 1500 to 1600 nm. To maintain the polarization state of the light, a
polarization maintaining fiber was used for coupling the TE polarization into the
grating couplers68. A polarization maintaining fiber array was used to couple light
in/out of the chip.

On-chip platform 2. For the bending loss experiment in the main text, the cross-
talk experiment in Supplementary Figure 8, the insertion loss experiments in
Supplementary Figure 13, and the propagation loss experiment in Supplementary
Figure 14, a standard SOI wafer is used as a substrate with 2 μm buried oxide and
220 nm top silicon layer. Diluted HSQ with methyl isobutyl ketone was spun on the
substrate as a negative-tone electron-beam resist layer. The resist layer was exposed
by a 100 kV EBL system, VB6-UHR (Raith), which is capable of 2 nm beam step
resolution. After the development of the resist, the top silicon layer was etched by
Cl2/O2 based reactive-ion plasma etching tool (Panasonic P610) to transfer the
waveguide pattern from the resist to the silicon layer.

deviation of the fitting curves. Other parameters (h0;Λ; ρ;N, and λ) are the same as in Fig. 3. Confinement of the evanescent waves in e-skid waveguides
due to the metamaterial cladding helps to reduce the bending loss at sharp bends in photonic-integrated circuits. This effect is stronger for waveguides
with smaller core sizes, as a considerable amount of the power lies outside the core and decays slowly
