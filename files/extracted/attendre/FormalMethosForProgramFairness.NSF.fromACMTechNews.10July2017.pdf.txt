ABSTRACT

As software permeates our personal lives, corporate world, and bureaucracy, more and
more of our critical decisions are being delegated to opaque algorithms. These algorithms
have thus become powerful arbitrators of a range of significant decisions with far-reaching
societal impact. However, an algorithm carrying out a sensitive task could potentially
discriminate ? advertently or inadvertently ? against certain groups. The overarching goal
of this project is to enable automated reasoning about fairness of such decision-making
programs. The results from this project are integrated in teaching curricula, thus raising
awareness about fairness in automated decision making. The project trains graduate
students in a unique and inter-disciplinary environment.

This project investigates various notions of fairness, inspired by the law and recent works
in the area, and casts them through the formal lens of program verification. The project
develops techniques for certifying that a program is fair under a given population, and
techniques for automatically repairing unfair programs to make them fair. From a technical
viewpoint, this project develops novel probabilistic program verification and synthesis
technologies that, while focusing on the problem of fairness, are general and expand the
reach of current technologies. Specifically, the project develops novel probabilistic
verification techniques based on volume computation. Furthermore, the project develops
program repair and debugging techniques for probabilistic programs.
