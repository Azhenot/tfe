prejudice against atheists

Mounting evidence supports long-standing claims that reli-
gions can extend cooperative networks1–9. However, religious 
prosociality may have a strongly parochial component5. 
Moreover, aspects of religion may promote or exacerbate 
conflict with those outside a given religious group, promot-
ing regional violence10, intergroup conflict11 and tacit preju-
dice against non-believers12,13. Anti-atheist prejudice—a 
growing concern in increasingly secular societies14—affects 
employment, elections, family life and broader social inclu-
sion12,13. Preliminary work in the United States suggests that 
anti-atheist prejudice stems, in part, from deeply rooted intu-
itions about religion’s putatively necessary role in morality. 
However, the cross-cultural prevalence and magnitude—as 
well as intracultural demographic stability—of such intuitions, 
as manifested in intuitive associations of immorality with 
atheists, remain unclear. Here, we quantify moral distrust of 
atheists by applying well-tested measures in a large global 
sample (N = 3,256; 13 diverse countries). Consistent with cul-
tural evolutionary theories of religion and morality, people in 
most—but not all— of these countries viewed extreme moral 
violations as representative of atheists. Notably, anti-atheist 
prejudice was even evident among atheist participants around 
the world. The results contrast with recent polls that do not 
find self-reported moral prejudice against atheists in highly 
secular countries15, and imply that the recent rise in secularism 
in Western countries has not overwritten intuitive anti-atheist 
prejudice. Entrenched moral suspicion of atheists suggests 
that religion’s powerful influence on moral judgements per-
sists, even among non-believers in secular societies.

Speculation about whether morality depends on religious belief 
has a long history. The ancient Chinese philosopher Mozi claimed 
that belief in ghosts was essential for moral restraint16. In Plato’s 
Euthyphro17, Socrates debated whether morality can even be prop-
erly defined without reference to divine preference. Dostoevsky18 
famously questioned whether moral prohibitions could carry 
weight without belief in a deity. Modern investigations reflect this 
perceived link between belief in god(s) and morality, as recent small 
sample studies in North America suggest deep moral suspicion of 
individuals who do not believe in god(s)13,19.

Evolutionary theories of religion predict that prejudice against 
atheists may persist even in secular cultures, either as part of a 
suite of adaptations linking belief to within-group cooperation20 or 

as a consequence of culturally transmitted21 and entrenched pro-
religious norms5. Indeed, recent studies suggest religions evolved in 
part by supporting trust and cooperation among coreligionists15,22,23. 
Signals of religiosity can even extend trust across religions among 
believers, though not to non-believers24. In contrast, classic social 
psychological work25 predicts that only believers will be prejudiced 
against atheists and that distrust of atheists would not be apparent 
in secular societies. To date, these two perspectives have not been 
directly contrasted, and the global prevalence of intuitive anti-
atheist prejudice and its persistence among atheists themselves is 
currently unknown. A recent Pew survey suggests a relationship 
between country-wide levels of religious belief and explicit judge-
ments that morality requires religion15. However, people often 
lack introspective access to their intuitions, and respond to appear 
socially desirable. As such, little is known about the potential cross-
cultural ubiquity of intuitions linking religion and morality.

Here, we rigorously test a prediction derived from a cultural 
evolutionary model of religion5: that anti-atheist prejudice remains 
globally prevalent, even in secular societies and among atheists. In 
contrast to previous studies, we quantify levels of anti-atheist dis-
trust using well-tested measures of intuitive information processing 
that can be adapted for studying prejudice in a large and diverse 
cross-cultural sample, while adjusting for individual differences in 
level of religious belief, demographic covariates and country-level 
dependencies in responses. Our sample is drawn from 13 countries 
on 5 continents. We chose these countries because they: (1) exhibit 
substantial country-level variability in average religious belief 
including both highly secular societies (for example, Netherlands, 
Czech Republic, Finland, China) and highly religious ones (for 
example, United Arab Emirates, Mauritius, India; Supplementary 
Table 3 shows average belief in god(s) across countries); (2) rep-
resent diverse dominant religions and religious histories, including 
countries with Christian, Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist and secular 
majorities; and (3) represent diverse cultural, political, socioeco-
nomic, historical and geographical contexts. This diverse sample 
allowed us to extend our investigation well beyond the WEIRD 
(Western, educated, industrialized, rich, democratic) samples that 
predominate the social sciences26.

We developed a measure to assess extreme anti-atheist prejudice 
by using a simple experimental design that targets intuitive biases19. 
In this task, participants read a description of a man who tortures 
animals as a child then as an adult exhibits escalating violence

culminating with the murder and mutilation of five homeless people. 
Then, participants are judged whether it is more probable that the vil-
lain is (A) a teacher or (B) a teacher who either (manipulated between  
subjects) is a religious believer or does not believe in god(s). Thus, 
no individual participant is directly asked whether they think the 
perpetrator is or is not a believer. Instead, the conjunction fallacy27 
rates (choosing option B—a logically incorrect answer) between 
conditions can be used to infer indirectly the degree to which a 
description of a serial murderer is intuitively seen as more represen-
tative of religious people or atheists, respectively. Full stimuli appear 
in the Supplementary Information. In our preregistration of meth-
ods and hypotheses before data collection commenced (https://osf.
io/f6tcr/), we hypothesized both universality and variability across 
countries, such that moral distrust of atheists would be evident in 
all sites, but the strongest intuitive religion–morality links would be 
observed in the most strongly religious samples.

We conducted identical experiments in all 13 sites. We targeted 
at least 100 participants per experimental condition (anti-atheist 
bias versus anti-religious bias). After filtering out inattentive par-
ticipants (13%) and incomplete responses, there were a total of 
3,256 participants for final analysis (69% female, age 16–70 years: 
mean =  25.07, s.d. =  7.84), with a median of 162 participants per 
country (range: 129–993). Participants came from diverse societ-
ies and included both student and general population samples 
(Supplementary Information).

Because our data represent a shared experimental design across 
sites with participants nested within countries, we used a multilevel 
(hierarchical) modelling approach. Specifically, our hierarchical 
Bayesian model28 quantifies the extent to which people view gross 
immorality (animal torture, serial murder and mutilation) as more 
representative of atheists than of believers, both overall and within 
each country, adjusting for individual levels of belief in God, gen-
der, age and perceived socioeconomic status (all standardized). 

Additionally, the model adjusts for country-level dependencies by 
modelling the intercept and slope of anti-atheist prejudice as random 
across countries (Supplementary Information). Full model coeffi-
cients appear in Table  1. We observed substantial heterogeneity in 
overall conjunction fallacy performance across countries. Because 
our primary focus was on degrees of intuitive moral distrust of athe-
ists (in contrast to believers) across countries, we do not speculate 
further about sources of heterogeneity in overall performance, and 
instead focus on experimental condition differences within countries.

Our results offer strong evidence of extreme intuitive moral 
prejudice against atheists. Our model predicts an overall conjunc-
tion error rate probability of 0.58 for atheist targets (95% highest  
posterior density interval (HPDI) 0.48, 0.68), but only 0.30 (95%

HPDI 0.25, 0.34) for religious targets; relative risk  is  1.96 (95% 
HPDI 1.53, 2.37) (posterior probability of atheist target errors 
exceeding religious target errors (henceforth ‘posterior probability’)  
exceeds 0.999). Thus, people overall are roughly twice as likely 
to view extreme immorality as representative of atheists, relative 
to believers. Importantly, the effects hold even after adjusting for 
country variability in the strength of intuitive moral prejudice and 
individual-level variability in demographics. Figure 1 and Table 2 
summarize model-predicted conjunction error probabilities across 
sites for atheist and religious targets. Consistent with predictions, 
extreme intuitive moral distrust of atheists is both globally evident 
and variable in its magnitude across countries.

Surprisingly, after adjusting for substantial latent country-level 
dependencies between sites, the within-country interaction between 
individual belief in God and conjunction error rates across targets is 
weak (posterior probability =  0.88; Table 1). Thus, while anti-atheist 
prejudice varies strongly by country, such prejudice is largely robust 
across the spectrum of participant religiosity within countries; both 
high and low believers are about twice as likely to commit con-
junction errors for atheist targets than for religious targets (Fig. 2). 
Furthermore, we examined posterior model predictions for atheists 
(those rating their belief in God at 0 out of 100). Among atheists, our 
model predicts an overall conjunction error rate probability of 0.52 
for atheist targets (95% HPDI 0.40, 0.64), but only 0.28 (95% HPDI 
0.22, 0.33) for religious targets; relative risk is 1.91 (95% HPDI 1.41, 
2.48) (posterior probability  >   0.999). Effects hold even in highly 
secular countries such as Australia, China, the Czech Republic, the 
Netherlands and the United Kingdom: even atheists are predicted 
to intuitively associate serial murder more with atheists than with 
believers in these countries (all posterior probabilities exceeding 
0.98). Indeed, only in Finland (posterior probability =  0.48) and to 
a lesser extent New Zealand (posterior probability =  0.90) is the evi-
dence of intuitive anti-atheist prejudice among atheists less conclu-
sive. (Full inferences at both minimum and maximum belief appear 
in the Supplementary Information.) To check robustness of intuitive 
moral distrust of atheists among atheists, we conducted a second 
analysis isolating all participants across sites who rated their belief 
in God at zero (N =  553) and explored overall atheist intuitive moral 
distrust of atheists (experimental condition treated as fixed) across 
sites (varying intercepts of country). Again, atheist participants 
showed higher conjunction error rates for atheist targets, 0.61 (95% 
HPDI 0.23, 0.95), than for religious targets, 0.50 (95% HPDI 0.12, 
0.88) (posterior probability =  0.999). Thus, consistent with theoreti-
cal predictions, even atheists intuitively associate immorality more 
with atheists than with believers.

To address potential methodological confounds and alternative 
explanations for our findings, we conducted three additional exper-
iments (note that, although our primary cross-cultural investigation 
was preregistered, the follow-up studies were not). Full details of 
all three studies appear in the Supplementary Information, but they 
are briefly summarized here. First, our cross-cultural experimen-
tal manipulation tested only extreme moral violations and pitted a 
target who ‘does not believe in god(s)’ against a ‘religious believer’, 
perhaps confounding notions of belief in god(s) and the broader 
construct of religiosity. Supplementary Study S1 found that, even 
when the experiment more symmetrically manipulates belief ver-
sus disbelief in god(s) and tests a more minor moral violation (for 
example, not paying for dinner in a restaurant), people still associate 
immorality more with atheists than with believers (posterior prob-
ability =  0.981).

Second, our primary cross-cultural tests pitted a disbeliever in 
god(s) against a religious believer. It is possible, however, that peo-
ple are morally distrustful of disbelievers in general, rather than of 
people who disbelieve in god(s) specifically. Supplementary Study 
S2 used the same extreme moral violation as our main analysis 
and found that people are more likely to assume intuitively that a 

perpetrator of moral evil is someone who disbelieves in God than 
someone who disbelieves in evolution, the accuracy of horoscopes, 
the safety of vaccines or the reality of global warming (all posterior 
probabilities between 0.956 and 0.9997).

Finally, it is possible that people may intuitively associate certain 
specific moral violations, such as child molestation, with religious 
individuals rather than with atheists. However, Supplementary 
Study S3 found that people intuitively assume that a priest who 
molests young boys for decades is more likely to be a priest who 
does not believe in God than a priest who does believe in God (pos-
terior probability =  0.998).

In summary, participants intuitively assume that the perpetra-
tors of immoral acts are probably atheists. These effects appeared 
across religiously diverse societies, including countries with 
Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Muslim and non-religious majorities, 
showing that intuitive moral prejudice against atheists is not exclu-
sive to Abrahamic or monotheistic majority societies. To the con-
trary, intuitive anti-atheist prejudice generalizes to largely secular 
societies and appears globally evident even among atheists. Notably, 
our primary experimental paradigm used extreme examples of 
immorality where anti-atheist prejudice would presumably be less 
explicitly defensible. We tested moral prejudice using vicious acts 
of cruelty (animal torture, serial murder and mutilation), which 
participants—including atheist participants—nonetheless intui-
tively associated with atheists. Combined, these results show that 
across the world, religious belief is intuitively viewed as a necessary 
safeguard against the temptations of grossly immoral conduct, and 
atheists are broadly perceived as potentially morally depraved and 
dangerous. Viewed differently, people perceive belief in a god as a 
sufficient moral buffer to inhibit immoral behaviour.

Our results highlight a stark divergence between lay and scien-
tific perceptions of the relationship between religion and morality. 
Although religion probably influences many moral outcomes and

judgements3,22,23, core moral instincts appear to emerge largely inde-
pendent of religion29,30. Additionally, highly secular societies are 
among the most stable and cooperative on Earth14. Nonetheless, our 
findings reveal widespread suspicion that morality requires belief 
in a god. For many people, including many atheists, the answer to 
Dostoevsky’s18 question “Without God …  It means everything is 
permitted now, one can do anything?” is “Yes”, inasmuch as ‘every-
thing’ refers to acts of extreme immorality.

Religions underpin large-scale intragroup cooperation3, but they 
also promote distrust of non-believers13,19 who are excluded from 
such religious moral communities3,24. Does rising secularism14,31 
moderate effects as atheist norms become stronger within societ-
ies? The present findings suggest that intuitive moral suspicion of 
atheists is culturally widespread, though not universal. Given that 
intuitive anti-atheist biases may transfer across moral domains19 
(Supplementary Studies S1 and S3), the resilience of moral preju-
dice against atheists reveals a potential barrier to the full acceptance 
of this growing segment31 of the global population. Consistent with 
predictions derived from cultural evolutionary theories of religion 
and morality5, extreme intuitive moral distrust of atheists is evident 
globally, among believers and atheists in both religious and secu-
lar societies. Even as secularism reduces overt religiosity in many 
places14, religion has apparently still left a deep and abiding mark on 
human moral intuitions.

Methods
Data collection proceeded among teams acting locally across all 13 countries.  
Local ethics approval was completed by individual research teams within  
each country.

The experiment used a version of the representativeness heuristic27. In the 
classic version of this task, participants are given a description of a politically 
liberal single woman. When asked whether it is more likely that she is (A) a bank 
cashier or (B) a bank cashier who is active in the feminist movement, participants 
tend erroneously to pick option B. Although logically incorrect (there are 
necessarily at least as many bank cashiers as bank cashiers who are feminists), the 
description seems more representative of the double identity provided in option B, 
leading people intuitively to choose that option (termed ‘the conjunction fallacy’). 
By independently varying the contents of the description and the identities implied 
by option B, researchers can assess the degree to which people intuitively view a 
given description as representative of different identities19.

We generated a representativeness heuristic task to quantify the degree to 
which people around the world intuitively view religion as necessary for the 
inhibition of grossly immoral behaviour. We provided a description of an immoral 
person who initially tortures animals and eventually kills people for thrills (see 
Supplementary Information), and then asked whether it was more probable that 

the perpetrator was (A) a teacher or (B) a teacher who either (manipulated between 
subjects) does not believe in God or is a religious believer. Higher conjunction 
fallacy rates (picking option B) in the atheist condition indicate that people 
intuitively view serial murder as more representative of atheists than of religious 
believers19. This manipulation allowed us to test the relationship between intuitive 
distrust of atheists and personal religious belief, while adjusting for country-wide 
variation in this relationship, as well as demographic covariates.

Analytic strategy. The nested structure of our data required a multilevel 
(hierarchical) modelling strategy to generate aggregate inferences. Failure to 
adopt such a strategy can lead to serious and potentially misleading inferential 
errors32. Our analyses relied on Bayesian hierarchical modelling28 using the 
rethinking package33 in R. Bayesian approaches provide researchers with a number 
of pragmatic benefits34, including the use of intuitive statements (posterior 
probabilities) about the probability of experimental manipulations producing 
effects across countries, as well as the relative credibility or plausibility of different 
potential parameter values28,35. In addition, hierarchical (multilevel) models can 
mitigate some problems associated with multiple comparisons36—comparisons 
that could be especially concerning in the present study, which evaluated intuitive 
moral distrust of atheists across 13 countries while adjusting for individual 
demographics. Furthermore, Bayesian estimation allowed us to represent the 
estimate uncertainty using HPDIs, which represent the range in which the most 
credible parameter values lie. This approach is in contrast to frequentist confidence 
intervals, which present only a range of possible values that would contain the 
true parameter value a known proportion of the time were this study repeated a 
very large number of times, although frequentist confidence intervals are often 
intuitively misunderstood as if they had the properties of Bayesian posterior 
density intervals37. Our primary inferences are drawn from probing samples 
from the posterior from a single hierarchical model. In it, we modelled random 
intercepts of country and modelled effects of target (atheist versus believer) as 
random across country, with all other factors fixed across country. Alternative 
model specifications did not appreciably change inferences.
