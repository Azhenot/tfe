Superconductivity in metallic nanowires is strongly influenced by fluctuations of the superconducting order parameter1. Thermally activated phase slips (TAPS) are dominant2 near 
the superconducting transition temperature, Tc. Well below Tc the 
phase of a homogeneous superconducting wire can slip by 2π  due 
to quantum tunnelling, a process analogous to Cooper-pair tun-
nelling in Josephson junctions3. The notion of coherent phase slips 
in nanowires proposed by Mooij and Nazarov4 was supported by 
experiments by Astafiev et al.5 with wires made of nominally homo-
geneous superconducting material. Such CQPS, carried by tun-
nelling of magnetic fluxons across a superconducting wire, enable 
devices based on quantum interference effects, opening a route 
towards a wide range of quantum devices dual to those that can be 
implemented with Josephson junctions4,6,7.

Quantum interference of Cooper pairs in flux-based supercon-
ducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) was demonstrated 
soon after the discovery of the Josephson effect8 and has since 
become a cornerstone of superconducting electronics. Another cor-
nerstone is the locking of the phase across the Josephson junction 
to an external microwave field, resulting in Shapiro steps at quan-
tized voltages9. This effect is used in high-frequency amplifiers and 
detectors, and as the basis for the quantum voltage standard, which 
today underpins the electronics industry10. The main motivation 
for studying CQPS and dual superconducting devices has so far 
been the promise of a robust quantum current standard based on 
so-called dual Shapiro steps4,11–13, complementary to the Josephson 
voltage standard. Although this particular goal has not yet been 
achieved, the experimental observation of CQPS in superconduct-
ing nanowires5 has advanced the understanding of one-dimensional 
superconductivity and coherence in disordered superconductors14,15 
to the level where dual superconducting electronics has now become 
a possibility.

Conventional d.c. SQUIDs can be viewed as a specific imple-
mentation of the Aharonov–Bohm (AB) effect16, where interference 
of the wavefunction of a moving charged particle occurs when it 
encircles a flux (Fig. 1a). In contrast, the Aharonov–Casher (AC) 
effect, where the interference of fluxon trajectories occurs around a 
static charge17, is dual to the AB effect. The AC effect has previously 

been observed in a variety of particle and solid-state systems18–21 
and in Josephson junction arrays22–26. Here we demonstrate the 
AC effect in a nominally continuous superconductor. Our device 
comprises two series CQPS junctions in which we achieve charge-
controlled interference of fluxon tunnelling in a device exactly dual 
to the SQUID. We call this device the charge quantum interference 
device (CQUID). This coherent charge-sensitive interferometer 
demonstrates the potential of CQPS devices previously explored 
only through the approximate4 self-duality of Josephson junction 
circuits12,22,27–31. Such arrays of Josephson junctions have been shown 
to be a challenging complementary route towards a quantum cur-
rent standard based on quantum phase slips32.

In the CQUID, schematically shown in Fig. 1b, flux coherently 
tunnels across two narrow constrictions in a superconducting 
wire that we conclude is continuous in the superconducting order 
parameter (see evidence in Supplementary Information). The two 
constrictions, of size ~30nm ×  50 nm, are connected in series and 
made out of a continuous ~3.3-nm-thick NbN film. These con-
strictions provide well-defined points with an increased phase slip 
amplitude15. The wider, ~100 nm, region (‘island’) between the con-
strictions is coupled through the capacitance Cg to a gate electrode. 
The island is made large enough to prohibit phase slips, but small 
enough to minimize its self-capacitance shunting the CQUID. Such 
a shunt capacitance would reduce the impedance and renormalize 
the phase-slip amplitude of the device.

The charge induced by the gate potential Vg controls the interfer-
ence of the phase-slip amplitudes, with a period of 2e, in much the 
same way as the effective Josephson energy in the SQUID is tuned 
by an external magnetic flux, with a period of Φ0, the flux quantum. 
Each interferometer becomes indistinguishable from its dual coun-
terpart by the dual single-particle exchange (Cooper pair or fluxon) 
with the following additional substitutions: current (Cooper-pair 
flow) ↔  voltage (flux flow), charge ↔  magnetic flux, Josephson 
energy ↔  phase-slip energy and insulator ↔  superconductor4. This 
also implies that the lack of flux quantization in the SQUID trans-
lates to the absence of charge quantization in the dual device, and 
the induced charge on the island (normalized to 2e) precisely fol-
lows q =  CgVg/2e.

The demonstration of coherent quantum phase slips (CQPS) in disordered superconductors has opened up a new route towards 
exploring the fundamental charge–phase duality in superconductors, with the promise of devices with new functionalities and 
a robust quantum current standard based on CQPS. Here we demonstrate a device that integrates several CQPS junctions: the 
charge quantum interference device. The charge quantum interference device becomes the dual of the well-known supercon-
ducting quantum interference device, and is a manifestation of the Aharonov–Casher effect in a continuous superconducting 
system devoid of dielectric barriers.

In much the same way as the insulator in a superconductor–
insulator–superconductor (SIS) junction provides a tunnel barrier 
for Cooper pairs (but not to fluxons), a continuous superconduc-
tor provides a tunnel barrier for fluxons (but not for Cooper pairs). 
Observation of CQPS requires a low barrier for flux tunnelling 
across the superconductor, realized by a high kinetic inductance. 
This is achieved in highly disordered superconducting films close 
to the superconductor–insulator transition (SIT)14,15. The same 
magnitude of the phase-slip amplitude can be realized in a wider 
constriction for superconductors close to the SIT, easing fabrication 
requirements and increasing reproducibility due to the exponen-
tial dependence of phase-slip amplitude on constriction width14. 
By using atomic layer deposition (ALD)-grown NbN films33–35, we 
can now controllably make high-quality films that are very close to 
the SIT, enabling fabrication of multiple very similar CQPS con-
strictions in the same device using conventional nanofabrication 
techniques. We have verified the continuity of the superconduct-
ing order parameter in our films in independent measurements 
on microbridges. For the CQUID devices presented here we also 
confirmed that the phase-slip energy in the CQUID persists up to 
magnetic fields much larger than would be possible for a small-
area Josephson junction, confirming that our CQPS junctions are 
indeed constrictions in a continuous film. We refer the reader to the 
Supplementary Information for further details.

Direct current (d.c.) transport measurements are essential for the 
realization of a current standard based on CQPS4,13,31,36–38; however, 
these are often complicated by incoherent effects such as Coulomb 
blockade and dissipation. To demonstrate CQPS interference in the 
CQUID we instead follow the methodology of previous studies5,14,15 
and use microwave spectroscopy, which provides a tool for mea-
suring the tunnelling energy in quantum systems. In particular, the 
Cooper pair box connected to a reservoir via a SQUID allows one to 
control and measure the Cooper-pair tunnelling energy (Josephson 
energy) of the SQUID39. We develop an exact dual measurement 
circuit: the CQUID is implemented in a loop with a high but finite 
inductance. The resulting flux states provides a degree of freedom 
orthogonal to the energy spectrum of the CQUID and the fluxon 
flow due to CQPS. The circuit allows us to directly measure the  

tunnelling energy of the CQUID (tunnelling energy of fluxons); see 
Supplementary Information for details. In addition, a high-imped-
ance environment for flux tunnelling is achieved by embedding the 
loop in a λ/2 superconducting resonator, made from the same NbN 
film. The resonator allows for direct readout of the energy spectrum 
of the device by dispersive microwave spectroscopy5,14,15.

The reduced Hamiltonian describing our device in the flux basis 
is H =  − ELσz/2 −  Esσx/2 (refs 6,40), where σi are the Pauli matrices, 

ν= ∣ ∣E hs tot  is the coupling energy due to the phase-slip ampli-
tude νtot and EL =  2IpδΦ is the inductive energy due to the persis-
tent current Ip =  Φ0/2Lk in the loop with kinetic inductance Lk and 
δΦ =  Φext −  (N +  1/2)Φ0. N is the number of magnetic flux quanta Φ0 
in the loop subjected to a magnetic flux Φext tuned by an external sole-
noid. The energy difference between the ground and the first excited 
state of the diagonalized Hamiltonian is δΦΔ = + ∕E I E((2 ) )p

where we use νtot =  ν1 +  ν2ei2πq (refs 22,30,41). ν1 and ν2 are the bare phase-
slip amplitudes for the two junctions, respectively. Importantly, the 
phase-slip rate depends only on the gate-induced charge. This is a 
direct result of the non-quantized charge, and Cooper pairs are not 
localized on the island. The expected 2e-periodic oscillations due 
to the induced charge on the island are a result of the phase-slip 
amplitude interference across the two junctions. We note that equa-
tion (1) applies to both CQPS and Josephson junction chains, and 
a distinction of the underlying physics could not be based solely on 
equation (1). We refer the reader to our Supplementary Information 
for a thorough discussion on the nature and homogeneity of our 
CQPS junctions.

The case of symmetric phase slip amplitudes (ν1 =  ν2) reduces for 
δΦ =  0 to πΔ ∝ ∣ ∣E qcos , in exact duality to the flux-modulated criti-
cal current of a magnetic SQUID with two identical Josephson junc-
tions. For certain values of q we would thus expect the transition

energy to be suppressed to zero. For largely dissimilar phase-slip 
amplitudes (ν ν≫1 2), or in the presence of non-trivial flux bias 
δΦ ≠  nΦ0 (where n is an integer number), the variation in Δ E due 
to the induced charge instead resembles a sinusoidal dependence, 
as sketched in Fig. 1c. We now proceed to the measurements of our 
device, which are in very good agreement with these expectations.

Figure 2a,b shows the measured energy level spectroscopy data 
as a function of magnetic flux for two different applied gate voltages. 
From the asymptotically linear dependence of the energy level tran-
sitions on magnetic flux, we extract Ip =  30 nA and Lk =  33 nH, corre-
sponding to the inductance per square of the NbN film L◻ =  1.35 nH. 
Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer (BCS) theory underestimates Lk near 
the SIT42. From the normal state per square resistance R◻ =  2.3 kΩ  
measured above Tc, we get L◻ =  ħR◻/(π Δ bcs) =  0.67 nH for Tc =  4.7 K, 
different by a factor of two. Figure 2c shows the full response of 
the energy levels due to the induced charge on the island at δΦ =  0. 
Notably, for each gate voltage we find two spectroscopic lines that 
deviate in phase from each other in gate voltage. These lines are 
shifted in charge by exactly half-a-period, which is explained by 
charge interference (AC effect) and the presence of non-equilibrium 
quasiparticles. A change in the number of non-equilibrium quasi-
particles (Nqp) present on the island will chan ge the overall island 
charge by 1e and the AC phase by π . Depending on the charge num-
ber parity of the island43,44, we observe two different parity bands 
according to ν ν ν= + − π( 1) eN i qtot 1 2

2qp . This is similar to what has been 
observed in charge qubits45. In the complex-amplitude representa-
tion of the phase-slip amplitude of equation (1) shown in Fig. 2e,  
such parity shifts result in two phase-slip amplitudes rotated by 
exactly π . The two bands are maximally separated at an induced 
island charge of precisely q =  ne, where n is an integer.

The oscillations provide compelling evidence for flux interfer-
ence, the fundamental mechanism on which the CQUID is based, 
and are a demonstration of the AC effect in a solid-state system 

without insulating tunnelling barriers18,22. This is further shown by 
Fig. 2d, showing the fit of the data in Fig. 2c to equation (1). We 
extract the two phase-slip amplitudes ν1 =  9.2 GHz and ν2 =  3.3 GHz. 
This strong similarity in phase-slip amplitudes allows us to accu-
rately compare the CQUID operation with theoretical predictions.

We may express the phase-slip energy of a single constriction 
in terms of the dimensionless conductance gξ =  Rq/Rξ of a wire seg-
ment of length ξ, where Rq =  h/4e2 is the superconducting resistance 
quantum1: Es =  (Δ gξ) exp(− agξ). Here the dimensionless parameter6,46 
a ≈  0.3 is only weakly dependent on the environment of the phase-
slip junction. For the measured phase-slip amplitudes of 3.3 GHz and 
9.2 GHz and for junction dimensions of 46 nm ×  30 nm and 
39 nm ×  30 nm, respectively, we obtain a ≈  0.29, in excellent agree-
ment with the observed dimensions and the expected value for a.

As we move the flux bias away from the degeneracy point we 
expect that the variation in transition energy with induced charge 
on the island is suppressed. In Fig. 3a we show the difference in tran-
sition energy at the maximum and minimum of equation (1) with 
respect to the gate-induced charge q as a function of flux detuning 
δΦ0, and in Fig. 3b we show the measured and expected deviation 
of equation (1) from a pure sinusoidal dependence of Δ E on q. Both 
data sets are in exceptionally good agreement with equation (1). The 
transition linewidth is δE/h =  200 MHz in the weak-drive limit for 
both the even and odd parity modes, and their occupation probabil-
ities are the same (Fig. 3c). This linewidth is similar to that obtained 
in previous experiments where CQPS has been studied5,14,15.

The origin of the parity fluctuations can be understood by con-
sidering the nature of the junctions in the device. We may intro-
duce an arbitrary number of quasiparticles on the CQUID island 
without incurring any additional electrostatic energy. Instead, the 
normal-state resistance determines the time that a non-equilibrium 
quasiparticle spends on the island (in the absence of recombina-
tion, which is parity-conserving). We may estimate the shortest

quasiparticle residence time on the island as τqp ≈  e2R◻Vρ ≈  2 ns, 
where ρ =  3.8 ×  1047 J−1 m−3 (ref. 47) is the density of states in NbN 
at the Fermi energy and V ≈  10−22 m3 is the volume of the island. 
Thus, in the presence of non-equilibrium quasiparticles in the 
leads, we expect to have a rapidly fluctuating number of quasipar-
ticles Nqp on the CQUID island, leading to the observed behaviour 
of equal probabilities for the two parities over the much longer  
measurement timescale.

The quasiparticle dwell time is comparable to the coherence time 
τ ≃  5 ns we observe in our time-averaged measurements, extracted 
from the transition linewidth.

In addition to parity fluctuations, we observe large fractional 
charge jumps on a timescale of ~1 hour due to charge fluctuators 
in the surrounding dielectrics, a clear indication that offset charge 
fluctuations in long wires will affect the coherences and phase-slip 
amplitudes, analogous to what has been found for Josephson junc-
tion chains32,48.

We have demonstrated control of the interference of coherent 
quantum phase-slip amplitudes in a charge quantum interference 
device comprised of two CQPS junctions. The excellent agreement 
with theory and large response due to the induced island charge 
is compelling evidence for the AC effect in a continuous highly 
disordered superconducting system. This demonstration of dual-
ity and the CQUID is an important step towards a future quantum 
current standard based on CQPS; however, the observed strong 
quasiparticle poisoning may provide an additional obstacle towards 
its realization. Quasiparticle poisoning may lead to a spurious qua-
siparticle current and perturbations to the phase locking of Bloch 
oscillations48. Quasiparticle poisoning is thus an engineering chal-
lenge that needs to be addressed using quasiparticle trapping and 
elimination techniques. By placing the coherent CQUID in a high-

impedance environment for d.c. measurements it could be used as a 
route towards a CQPS-based current standard.

Methods
Thin-film technology. The NbN thin films were deposited on undoped Si(100) 
by plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD). An OpAL ALD system 
from Oxford Instruments Plasma Technology upgraded with a remote plasma 
source (ICP) and a nitrogen glove box were used. The metal–organic compound 
(tertbutylimido)-tris (diethylamino)-niobium (TBTDEN) and an hydrogen plasma 
were applied as precursors. The NbN ALD process is based on a self-limiting 
surface reaction principle with a well-controlled layer growth of 0.46 Å per cycle. 
Thus, for the CQUID experiments, superconducting NbN layers of only 3.3 nm 
thickness were prepared within an ALD process of 72 cycles. The prepared 
layers have a granular film structure. More details are given in refs 33,35 and the 
Supplementary Material. The precise adjustment of chemical composition, crystal 
structure and film thickness allows production of NbN layers with the above-
reported high values of Tc, R◻ and L◻, which are essential for realizing the CQUID.

Device fabrication. To pattern the CQUID device we used electron beam (e-beam) 
lithography. A 50 nm layer of the negative e-beam resist hydrogen silsesquioxane 
(HSQ) was exposed to a 50 keV beam in a JEOL JBX-5500ZD e-beam lithography 
system. The resonator, the loops and the islands, as well as the gate electrodes, 
are exposed to a dose of 900 μ C cm−2 while the constrictions are defined by doses 
between 8.6 mC cm−2 and 31.5 mC cm−2. This gives constriction widths in the 
range 50–70 nm. After the HSQ development (MicroChemicals AZ 726 MIF), 
the coplanar ground-planes and the microwave and bias gate pads are defined by 
optical lithography using a standard lift-off technique. The ground planes and 
contact pads are made by thermal evaporation of a 5 nm titanium (Ti) adhesion 
layer and an 80 nm gold (Au) layer in a Plassys MEB 550 S evaporator. During this 
step, the resonator and the loops with constrictions are protected by the optical 
resist. After lift-off, the resonator and the loops with constrictions, islands and 
gates are defined in the NbN film by reactive ion etching (RIE) using an Oxford 

Instruments Plasmalab 80 Plus. The HSQ acts as a hard mask against the reactant 
fluorine (CF4:Ar, 10:1) in the RIE process, which etches the NbN much faster than 
the HSQ. All Au-covered areas are protected since Au is inert against fluorine RIE. 
Test structures for d.c. measurements were co-fabricated on the same films, from 
which we extract values for Tc and R◻ measured just above Tc.

Measurements. Samples were mounted in a dilution refrigerator with a base 
temperature of 20 mK, essential for maximizing the coherence of the device and 
minimizing the effect of thermally activated phase slips. Samples were shielded 
by both superconducting and Cryoperm shields to minimize noise in the flux 
threading the loops. Heavily attenuated coaxial lines were used for microwave 
excitation and the transmitted signal was passed through two cryogenic isolators 
before being amplified by a cryogenic high-electron-mobility transistor amplifier 
at 4 K. The gate voltages were applied through low-pass filtering Thermocoax 
lines, with additional low-pass filtering at the mixing chamber stage. The 
measured gate period (2e) at the sample was 60.1 mV, giving an effective 
gate capacitance of 5 aF, in good agreement with finite-element electrostatic 
calculations of the total capacitance as seen by the island of 20 aF, which also 
includes the contributions from the gate capacitance. The dispersive readout of 
the resonator is performed by applying a weak probe tone at the fundamental 
resonance frequency of 3.74 GHz that monitors the phase shift of the resonator 
(using a vector network analyser) in response to a strong tone that induces 
transitions in the loop’s energy spectrum. The particular loop presented in this 
manuscript was identified by its flux periodicity, matched to the designed loop 
area. This particular sample had six loops with working constrictions, allowing 
for easy identification.
