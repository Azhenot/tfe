						Income Inequality and Its Effect on Political Inequality

						February 19th, 2015 by Kara in Case Studies
					
					The third in SPI’s series on Inequality

By: Remy Smith

Political races are expensive. Candidates are pressed by consultants 
and campaign management to raise exorbitant amounts of money to create 
lit pieces and other advertisements that may sway potential voters. 
Recently, the advent of SuperPACs allows large donors to circumvent 
campaign contributions.

Though limited in direct contributions to a campaign (so called hard 
money), any individual can donate unlimited sums to a SuperPAC or soft 
money. The latter is used for issue advocacy or support of a candidate. 
SuperPACs are controversial because they allow a few wealthy citizens to
 dominate political outcomes by filling a candidate’s SuperPAC with 
large amounts of money. Some argue SuperPACs are a major cause of 
inequality in America’s political system. A small percentage of 
Americans control vast sums of funds and they now have a 
disproportionate degree of political influence. Is this political 
inequality permissible and does it pose a threat to the political 
system?

The Importance of Opportunity

Political inequality is, in many ways, akin to economic inequality. 
Both appear to be growing problems in the US and their solutions require
 some level of equal opportunity. Inequality of outcome is justified and
 even beneficial to any system as it incentivizes hard work and rewards 
individuals based on merit. Inequality of opportunity, in contrast, is 
not only unjust but also perilous.

Opportunity is arguably a right. Everyone deserves a chance to succeed and none should be denied opportunity. Polls
 suggest a majority of Americans support the idea of equality of 
opportunity. The concept of equality of opportunity is may be applied to
 political inequality.

Virtues of Equality of Political Opportunity

Democracy relies on and is defined by equal political opportunity. It
 is a basic principle of democracy that citizens who meet rudimentary 
requirements (like age and national birth) are able to run for elected 
office. This implies a fundamental equality in democracy: the equality 
of opportunity to declare candidacy for an elected position.

When all members of society can run for office, it increases 
representation from all segments of society, from farmers to industrial 
workers to financiers. A community leader from a minority group will not
 be barred from candidacy for, say, not owning property or for belonging
 to a certain racial group. This notion runs is true 
from  municipal level to the federal level. People have a say 
in governance through the election of those who best serve the 
their interests.

Ability to Run for Office

Prior to the Progressive Era, the U.S. had a system that restricted 
candidacy for political office. The U.S. Senate, instead of being 
elected by the people, comprised of individuals selected by state 
senates. America’s founders intended such a system because they wanted 
to restrict the power of the people (Jefferson and others feared the 
tyranny of the masses), but it resulted in a congressional body that did
 not serve the will of citizens and thus faced no accountability to
 the people.

Not everyone had an equal chance to become senator. In this early 
America, being born to a poor family who did not own land, or to an 
ethnic minority meant the individual would not have the connections or 
power to be elected by a state senate. It was a select few who were 
wealthy enough to attend high school or college and could become 
involved in matters of state that were most likely to be elected. That 
system closed off equal opportunity.

Importance of the Vote

The most common means by which inequality of political opportunity 
occurs is through voter suppression or limiting the electorate. Voting 
is inherently equalizing. A citizen has one vote to cast for the 
candidate she believes will best represent and better her interest. One 
person, one vote – completely equal. When this principle is corrupted 
voices are silenced and political inequality results.

Returning to the early-American example, it is obvious how the voices
 of certain groups were stifled: there were significant impediments 
voting. Preventing certain segments of society from voting largely 
prevented the interests of the poor and the working class from being 
pursued in government. This neglect contributed to many Americans 
working in dire conditions. Few elected officials found it in their 
self-interest to go against business and property owners i.e., voters, 
in favor of policies that favored Americans without significant 
political heft. It took a populist movement and dedicated reformers to 
change American politics to favor, or at least be receptive to labor. 
Voter suppression is clearly a force that drives inequality.

Virtues of Political Inequality

Political inequality is not necessarily detrimental. On the contrary,
 some elements of political inequality are necessary for a 
well-structured and incentivized political system. Much like economic 
outcomes, inequality in result is justifiable. Those who actively engage
 in the political system and seek to shape political outcomes rightfully
 have a louder voice in politics.

There are many ways to be politically engaged and doing so is 
necessary to be heard: “equal consideration of the preferences and needs
 of all citizens is fostered by equal political activity among citizens”
 (Sidney Verba).
 To influence policymakers, voters can, for instance, work on campaigns,
 contact congress members, participate in protests, and vote.

Studies find that policymakers are overwhelmingly responsive
 to the whims and wants of the highest income earners. Naturally, many 
people are offended by this reality. Is it really an equal democracy 
when the will of the majority is disregarded? Yet, democracy reflects 
those who engage in the democratic process. Political inequality, if a 
result of unequal engagement, is beneficial to the system and offers 
justifiable reason for the more influential will of the affluent.

Engagement

Politicians, while swayed by money, also are responsive to those who 
seek to influence political outcomes. A recent study done by Page, Bartels and Seawright  finds that
 the views of American politicians are increasingly reflective of those 
of the affluent. This is partly because of substantial campaign 
donations, but it is also due to the political engagement of wealthy 
voters. Politicians respond to those who are engaged.

In 1990, nearly 50% of the top quintile income earners contacted a 
congress member versus 25% of the poor. The study by Bartels et 
al finds that 47% of the wealthy made “at least one contact with a 
congressional office”, 40% contacted their own senator, 37% their own 
House member, and “about one quarter contacted a representative or 
senator from another district or state”. The wealthy are not afraid to 
take to the streets either. Protests, “which demand little in the way of
 skills or money and which is often thought of as ‘the weapon of the 
weak’” (Schlozman et al),
 are also dominated by the wealthy. The 1990 survey finds more than 
twice as many of those from the top income quintile than the bottom 
quintile engage in protests. While working on campaigns, contacting 
political officials, and protesting do not necessarily influence policy 
outcomes, they are an opportunity to aid the campaign of sympathetic 
politicians and to make one’s voice heard.

The Importance of the Vote, Part 2

Perhaps the easiest and most effective way to exert political opinion
 is to vote. Voting, the basic tenet of a democracy, holds elected 
officials accountable to the public. But for many, the right to vote is 
wasted. The two graphs below depict an alarming trend in American 
politics: the discrepancy of voter registration and turnout between the 
affluent and the poor.

The first graph demonstrates the lower voter registration of those in
 the lowest income quintile. For the majority of the years covered by 
the survey, voter registration was below 50% for the lowest quintile and
 it rose in the first Obama campaign to get out the minority vote. 
 As income increases, so does the percentage of those who register 
to vote.  The second graph is for the 2008 election and shows 
the increase in actual voting as income rises. For families earning less
 than $50,000, which was about the median family income in 2008, only 
between 50 and 75% voted – worrying especially considering this was a 
presidential election and the Obama campaign’s focus on bringing 
minority voters to the polls. Of note: 99% of the wealthiest Americans 
(the test group had a median wealth of $7.5 million) surveyed by Page, 
Bartels, and Seawright voted in the 2008 election.

Why do large numbers of low- and medium-income voting-age citizens 
neglect to vote? One explanation is lack of time. Low-income Americans 
often find themselves working multiple jobs to make ends meet and 
therefore may not have time to make it to the polls. An easy solution to
 this would be to make Election Day a national holiday so no voter has 
to compromise work in order to vote. Another theory is that low- and 
medium-income voters find political outcomes, both in elections and 
policy, so skewed to the will of the affluent they do not find it 
worthwhile to vote. This of course creates a perpetual cycle whereby 
outcomes will be even more dependent upon the desires of the wealthy and
 other voters will be even more disincentivized to vote. A new trend 
emerging in conservative states is also damaging voter turnout. Voter ID
 laws and the limitation of absentee voting in some states negatively 
impacts turnout for poor and minority voters. Often seen as racially 
motivated, this move is thought to be designed to keep the Republican 
Party in power in state legislatures because the new requirements make 
it more difficult for some segments of the population to vote.

Influence of the Politically Active

It is no wonder wealthy Americans have a strong say in policy outcome
 – they vote presumably, for candidates who best represent their 
interests. Benjamin Page and Martin Gilens, in a new study called “Testing Theories of American Politics: Elites, Interest Groups, and Average Citizens”,
 find that “it makes very little difference [in policy] what the general
 public thinks.” Such results are caused by inequality in political 
activity. In this way, the potential for unequal outcomes incentivizes 
political engagement and, at the least, awareness in order to assure 
responsive governance.

The Role of Money

One of the most divisive issues in campaign finance and in the theory
 of equality of political opportunity is the role of money. Opponents of
 hard, soft, and shadow money contend the ability to contribute 
unlimited sums has a corrupting effect on politicians. Proponents of 
unlimited financial contributions argue political funding is a provision
 of the freedom of speech: a person makes a political statement when 
donating money to a campaign or to an organization supporting a certain 
candidate.

Whatever the case, unlimited campaign contributions, in the form of 
hard, soft, or shadow money, create inequality of political opportunity.
 Those who are well positioned in the economic hierarchy immediately 
have a resource advantage versus those who are poorly placed.

Three Categories of Political Activity

We can divide political activity into three categories:

(1) Voting

(2) Political engagement

(3) Monetary donations

Categories (1) and (2) are necessarily equal in that everyone has one
 vote and everyone has the ability to volunteer in a campaign. Money, 
however, is a not an equalizer. Assuming unlimited contributions, there 
is no initial equality. Take this example: there are two voting 
citizens, Rob and Joe, both of whom vote in every election and volunteer
 on the campaign of their favorite candidates (who happen to be 
competing). Rob has an income of $200,000 a year with a large savings 
account and is willing to donate a substantial portion of this year’s 
income to candidate R. Joe, on the other hand, only makes $30,000 a year
 and needs to save all that he can in order to put his son through 
college and thus cannot contribute as much as he would like. That is not
 equality of opportunity. Rob’s opportunity is 6 times that of Joe’s 
because of his income and, taking account Joe’s need to save, Rob’s 
opportunity is even higher. Even if each person were limited to 
contributing 15% of total income, Rob’s opportunity to sway political 
outcomes is much higher than Joe’s. The problem with campaign 
contributions is a person’s financial success determines his ability to 
alter political outcomes.

Willingness and Ability

With monetary contributions, there are two variables affecting 
equality: willingness and ability to donate. Categories (1) and (2) are 
limited to the sole variable of willingness. In contrast, not everyone 
has the equal ability to donate. Unlimited campaign contributions 
prohibit true equality of opportunity. There are some who argue 
political engagement is also subject to the variable of ability – in 
this case, the ability to allocate time to political engagement. This 
argument has merits. After all, retirees and the affluent can afford to 
spend more time volunteering on campaigns. However, with the advent of 
the internet and social media, it is a quick and easy process to be 
politically engaged. Volunteering can be done remotely in the form of 
phone banking which can be done remotely at any reasonable time. With 
candidate and office-holder websites, it is relatively easy and takes 
minutes to write a message to a politician. The same applies for 
Facebook and Twitter. Statuses or tweets explaining one’s support of a 
candidate are simple and easy ways to voice support. These technological
 advances have helped in reducing the use of time for political 
engagement.

Campaign Contributions

To assure true equality in the ability to donate, contributions must 
be limited to a level equal to the lowest amount voters are willing to 
give, a number that almost certainly will be $0. Eliminating campaign 
contributions restricts freedom of speech, necessarily limiting one’s 
ability to impact political outcomes. It seems equality of opportunity 
and justifiable unequal outcomes cannot be attained at the same time.

Perfect equality is perhaps unattainable, but we cannot cease trying 
to create equality in the political system. A contribution limit should 
be enacted and soft and shadow money banned as they create overwhelming 
inequality of opportunity. The new limit may be based on any number of 
factors. One possible means by which the limit is determined is to use 
the average of the median contribution across a variety of contests. 
Another way is to survey a consortium of voters who reflect the 
demographics of active voters and use the median of their willingness to
 donate as the contribution limit. Some public money should also be made
 available to all candidates and parties that achieve a certain 
threshold in the previous election.

There are many benefits to imposing a limit on campaign contributions
 besides equality of opportunity. One other benefit is a political 
candidate will tend to court more voters. Limiting campaign 
contributions has a populist effect.

Equality of political opportunity is a basic tenet of democracy. It 
allows for all citizens to have equal potential to sway political 
outcomes though the actual effect on political outcomes will vary based 
on political activity. The introduction of money into the political 
system opens the possibility of destroying the equality of political 
opportunity. A limit in political contributions can actually have a 
populist effect because politicians need to reach and appeal to more 
people in order to raise necessary funds.

However, failing to ban soft and shadow money and establishing more 
stringent regulations on hard money can have a very negative effect on 
the political system. The continuation of SuperPACs and the infiltration
 of money into America’s democracy have adverse effects. An 
extrapolation of Benjamin Page’s study points to the U.S. slowly 
evolving into an oligarchy. The continuation of increasing money into 
the political system leads to barriers to entry in political activity, 
either through dollars needed to have a voice heard or through the 
election of officials acting in accord to the will of the wealthy. These
 elected officials may enact legislation that further obstructs 
political engagement. This facet of politics is evident in some states 
where barriers to voting already have been erected. The effects of not 
limiting money in politics could be dire.
