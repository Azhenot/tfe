 higher-level information

processing occurs in the neocortex, neural tissue that

forms the outer layer of the cerebral cortex. In its

intricate folds, brain cells work together to interpret

sensory information and to form thoughts and plans.

The neocortex is divided into regions that take the

lead on different types of processing. However, much

of today’s neuroscience research focuses on mapping

the connectome: the neural connections between

regions.

In the human brain,
