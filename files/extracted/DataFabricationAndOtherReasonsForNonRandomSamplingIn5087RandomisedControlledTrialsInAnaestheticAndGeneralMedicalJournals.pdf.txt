Summary

Randomised, controlled trials have been retracted after publication because of data fabrication and inadequate ethical approval. Fabricated data

have included baseline variables, for instance, age, height or weight. Statistical tests can determine the probability of the distribution of means,

given their standard deviation and the number of participants in each group. Randomised, controlled trials have been retracted after the data

distributions have been calculated as improbable. Most retracted trials have been written by anaesthetists and published by specialist anaesthetic

journals. I wanted to explore whether the distribution of baseline data in trials was consistent with the expected distribution. I wanted to determine

whether trials retracted after publication had distributions different to trials that have not been retracted. I wanted to determine whether data

distributions in trials published in specialist anaesthetic journals have been different to distributions in non-specialist medical journals. I analysed

the distribution of 72,261 means of 29,789 variables in 5087 randomised, controlled trials published in eight journals between January 2000 and

December 2015: Anaesthesia (399); Anesthesia and Analgesia (1288); Anesthesiology (541); British Journal of Anaesthesia (618); Canadian

Journal of Anesthesia (384); European Journal of Anaesthesiology (404); Journal of the American Medical Association (518) and New England

Journal of Medicine (935). I chose these journals as I had electronic access to the full text. Trial p values were distorted by an excess of baseline

means that were similar and an excess that were dissimilar: 763/5015 (15.2%) trials that had not been retracted from publication had p values that

were within 0.05 of 0 or 1 (expected 10%), that is, a 5.2% excess, p = 1.2 × 10 . The p values of 31/72 (43%) trials that had been retracted after

publication were within 0.05 of 0 or 1, a rate different to that for unretracted trials, p = 1.03 × 10 . The difference between the distributions of

these two subgroups was confirmed by comparison of their overall distributions, p = 5.3 × 10 . Each journal exhibited the same abnormal

distribution of baseline means. There was no difference in distributions of baseline means for 1453 trials in non-anaesthetic journals and 3634

trials in anaesthetic journals, p = 0.30. The rate of retractions from JAMA and NEJM, 6/1453 or 1 in 242, was one-quarter the rate from the six

anaesthetic journals, 66/3634 or 1 in 55, relative risk (99%CI) 0.23 (0.08–0.68), p = 0.00022. A probability threshold of 1 in 10,000 identified 8/72

(11%) retracted trials (7 by Fujii et al.) and 82/5015 (1.6%) unretracted trials. Some p values were so extreme that the baseline data could not be

correct: for instance, for 43/5015 unretracted trials the probability was less than 1 in 10  (equivalent to one drop of water in 20,000 Olympic-sized

swimming pools). A probability threshold of 1 in 100 for two or more trials by the same author identified three authors of retracted trials (Boldt, Fujii

and Reuben) and 21 first or corresponding authors of 65 unretracted trials. Fraud, unintentional error, correlation, stratified allocation and poor

methodology might have contributed to the excess of randomised, controlled trials with similar or dissimilar means, a pattern that was common to

all the surveyed journals. It is likely that this work will lead to the identification, correction and retraction of hitherto unretracted randomised,

controlled trials.
