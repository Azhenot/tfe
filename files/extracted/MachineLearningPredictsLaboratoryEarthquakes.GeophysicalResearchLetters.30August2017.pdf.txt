Abstract. We apply machine learning to data sets from shear laboratory

experiments, with the goal of identifying hidden signals that precede earth-

quakes. Here we show that by listening to the acoustic signal emitted by a

laboratory fault, machine learning can predict the time remaining before it

fails with great accuracy. These predictions are based solely on the instan-

taneous physical characteristics of the acoustical signal, and do not make use

of its history. Surprisingly, machine learning identifies a signal emitted from

the fault zone previously thought to be low-amplitude noise that enables fail-

ure forecasting throughout the laboratory quake cycle. We infer that this sig-

nal originates from continuous grain motions of the fault gouge as the fault

blocks displace. We posit that applying this approach to continuous seismic

data may lead to significant advances in identifying currently unknown sig-

nals, in providing new insights into fault physics, and in placing bounds on

fault failure times.

Keypoints:

• Machine learning appears to discern the frictional state when applied to

laboratory seismic data recorded during a shear experiment

• Machine learning uses statistical characteristics of the recorded seismic

signal to accurately predict slip failure time

• The work has import to identifying new geophysical signals of all kinds

and potentially to earthquake forecasting, and is applicable to potentially

1. Introduction

A classical approach to determining that an earthquake may be looming is based on

the inter-event time (recurrence interval) for characteristic earthquakes, earthquakes that

repeat periodically [Schwartz and Coppersmith [1984]]. For instance, analysis of turbidite

stratigraphy deposited during successive earthquakes dating back 10,000 years suggests

the Cascadia subduction zone is ripe for a megaquake [Goldfinger et al. [2017]]. The idea

behind characteristic, repeating earthquakes was the basis of the well-known Parkfield

prediction based strictly on seismic data. Similar earthquakes occurring between 1857

and 1966 suggested a recurrence interval of 21.9±3.1 years and thus an earthquake was

expected between 1988-1993 [Bakun and Lindh [1985]], but ultimately took place in 2004.

With this approach, as earthquake recurrence is not constant for a given fault, event oc-

currence can only be inferred within large error bounds. Over the last 15 years, there has

been renewed hope that progress can be made regarding forecasting owing to tremendous

advances in instrumentation quality and density. These advances have led to exciting

discoveries of previously unidentified slip processes that include slow slip [Melbourne and

Webb [2003]], Low Frequency Earthquakes and Earth tremor [Shelly et al. [2007]; Obara

[2002]; Brown et al. [2009]] that occur deep in faults. These discoveries inform a new

understanding of fault slip and may well lead to advances in forecasting impending fault

failure if the coupling of deep faults to the seismogenic zone can be unraveled. The

advances in instrumentation sensitivity and density also provide new means to record

small events that may be precursors. Acoustic/seismic precursors to failure appear to

be a nearly universal phenomenon in materials. For instance, it is well established that

failure in granular materials [Michlmayr et al. [2013]] and in avalanche [Pradhan et al.

[2006]] is frequently accompanied by impulsive acoustic/seismic precursors, many of them

very small. Precursors are also routinely observed in brittle failure of a spectrum of in-

dustrial [Huang et al. [1998]] and Earth materials [Schubnel et al. [2013]; Jaeger et al.

[2007]]. Precursors are observed in laboratory faults [Johnson et al. [2013]; W. Goebel

et al. [2013]] and are widely but not systematically observed preceding earthquakes [Bou-

chon et al. [2013, 2016]; McGuire et al. [2015]; Mignan [2014]; Wyss and Booth [1997];

Geller [1997]]. Seismic swarm activity which exhibits very different statistical character-

istics than classical impulsive precursors may or may not precede large earthquakes but

can mask classical precursors (e.g., Ishibashi [1988]). The International Commission on

Earthquake Forecasting for Civil Protection concluded in 2011 there was “considerable

room for methodological improvements in this type of [precursor-based failure forecast-

ing] research” [International Commission on Earthquake Forecasting for Civil Protection,

2011: Jordan et al. [2011]]. The commission also concluded that published results may

be biased toward positive observations. We hypothesize that precursors are a manifesta-

tion of critical stress conditions preceding shear failure. We posit that seismic precursor

magnitudes can be very small and thus frequently go unrecorded or unidentified. As

instrumentation improves, precursors may ultimately be found to exist for most or all

earthquakes [Delorey et al. [2017]]. Furthermore, it is plausible that other signals exist

that presage failure.

2. Materials and Methods

Here we apply recent advances in machine learning to data from a well characterized

laboratory system [Johnson et al. [2013]; Marone [1998]; Niemeijer et al. [2010]; Scuderi

et al. [2014]]. Our laboratory system is a two-fault configuration that contains fault

gouge material submitted to double direct shear (see text S1, Fig. S1). The driving

piston displaces at a very constant velocity of 5 microns/sec during the inter-event time,

and accelerates briefly during slip with a calibrated accuracy of 0.1 micron/sec. An

accelerometer records the acoustic emission (AE) emanating from the shearing layers.

The shear stress imposed by the driving block is also monitored (Figs. 1, 2a, S1), as well

as other physical parameters such as the shearing rate, gouge layer thickness, friction and

the applied load [Johnson et al. [2013]; Marone [1998]; Niemeijer et al. [2010]]. The steel

blocks are extremely stiff (order 160 GPa) so the deformation takes place largely in the

gouge. Following a stick-slip frictional failure (laboratory earthquake), the shearing block

displaces while the gouge material simultaneously dilates and strengthens, as manifested

by increasing shear stress (Figs. 1a, S1) and friction. As the material approaches failure,

it exhibits characteristics of a critical stress regime, including many small shear failures

that emit impulsive AEs [Johnson et al. [2013]]. This unstable state concludes with a

laboratory earthquake, in which the shearing block rapidly displaces, the friction and

shear stress decrease precipitously due to the gouge failure (Fig. S1, top), and the gouge

layers simultaneously compact. Under a broad range of load and shear velocity conditions,

the apparatus stick-slips quasi-periodically for hundreds of stress cycles during a single

experiment [Marone [1998]; Niemeijer et al. [2010]], and in general follows predictions from

rate and state friction [e.g., Marone [1998]]. The rate of impulsive precursors accelerates as

failure approaches [Johnson et al. [2013]], suggesting that upcoming laboratory earthquake

timing could be predicted. In this work, we ask: can the failure time of an upcoming

laboratory earthquake be predicted using characteristics of only the continuously recorded

acoustic signal?

Our goal is to predict the time remaining before the next failure (Fig. 1a, bottom)

using only local, moving time windows of the AE data (Fig. 1b, top). We apply a

machine learning technique, the random forest (RF) [Breiman [2001]; Pedregosa et al.

[2011]; Louppe et al. [2013]], to the continuous acoustic time series data recorded from

the fault (see Fig. 1 and text S2, S3). The RF model is an average over a set of decision

trees (Fig. 1c). Each decision tree predicts the time remaining before the next failure

using a sequence of decisions based on statistical features derived from the time windows.

Figure 1a, top, shows the laboratory shear stress exhibiting multiple failure events during

an experiment.

From each time window, we compute a set of approximately 100 potentially relevant

statistical features (e.g. mean, variance, kurtosis, autocorrelation, etc.). The most useful

features are then selected recursively [Gregorutti et al. [2017]]. The RF uses these selected

features to predict the time remaining before the next failure (text S4). Fig. 1b shows

four of these features on the same time scale as in Fig. 1a, through multiple failure

cycles. Some features are sensitive to changes in signal characteristics early in time during

the stress cycle, just following a laboratory earthquake. All features shown are strongly

sensitive to signal characteristics just preceding failure, as the system approaches shear-

stress criticality.

or future information considered when making a prediction (blue curve): each prediction

uses only the information within one single time window of the acoustic signal. Thus,

by listening to the acoustic signal currently emitted by the system, we predict the time

remaining before it fails-a ‘now’ prediction based on the instantaneous physical charac-

teristics of the system that does not make use of its history. We quantify the accuracy of

our model using R2, the coefficient of determination.

A näıve model based exclusively on the periodicity of the events (average inter-event

time) only achieves an R2 performance of 0.3 (See Fig. S2). In comparison, the time

to failure predictions from the RF model are highly accurate, with an R2 value of 0.89.

Surprisingly, the RF model accurately predicts failure not only when failure is imminent,

but throughout the entire laboratory earthquake cycle, demonstrating that the system

continuously progresses towards failure. This is unexpected, as impulsive precursors are

only observed while the system is in a critical stress state. We find that statistics quanti-

fying the signal amplitude distribution (e.g. its variance and higher order moments) are

highly effective at forecasting failure. The variance, which characterizes overall signal am-

plitude fluctuation, is the strongest single feature early in time (Fig. 1b). As the system

nears failure, other outlier statistics such as the kurtosis and thresholds become predictive

as well. These outlier statistics are responding to the impulsive precursor AE (Fig. 3c)

typically observed as a material approaches failure [Huang et al. [1998]], including those

under shear conditions in the laboratory [Johnson et al. [2013]] and in Earth [Bouchon

et al. [2013, 2016]; Wyss and Booth [1997]]. These signals are due to small, observable

shear failures within the gouge immediately preceding the laboratory earthquake [Johnson

et al. [2013]].

Our machine learning analysis provides new insight into the slip physics. Specifically,

the AE signal occurring long before failure was previously assumed to be noise and thus

overlooked, illustrating human bias that ML can overcome [Johnson et al. [2013]]. This

signal bears resemblance to non-volcanic tremor [Shelly et al. [2007]; Obara [2002]; Brown

et al. [2009]] associated with slow slip [Rogers and Dragert [2003]; Rubinstein et al. [2009]],

that exhibits ringing characteristics over long periods of time. An important difference is

that tremor is isolated in time. In the laboratory experiments, the central block (Fig. S1)

slowly slips throughout the stress cycle, briefly accelerating at the time of failure. Fig. (3b)

shows a raw time series far from failure. The signal exhibits small modulations that are

challenging to identify by eye and persist throughout the stress cycle. These modulations

increase in amplitude as failure is approached, as measured by the increase in signal

variance. This increase in signal variance shows that the energy carried by the acoustic

signal steadily increases throughout the stress cycle. We posit that these variations are

due to systematic groaning, creaking and chattering from continuous grain motions of the

fault gouge due to slow slipping of the block (Discrete Element Modeling of this system

[Ferdowsi et al. [2014]; Dorostkar et al., 2017]] is ongoing to further investigate the origin

of this new found signal). Our ML-driven analysis suggests that the system emits a

small but progressively increasing amount of energy throughout the stress cycle, before

abruptly releasing the accumulated energy when a slip event takes place (Figs. S3, S4).

The predictions of our model generalize across experimental conditions. To demonstrate

this, we trained the system at one applied load level, and then tested it on data from

different load levels, exhibiting different inter-event times between failures. We observe

that the model predictions retain their accuracy across load levels and correctly predicts

clear outliers (see Fig. S5). The fact that timing prediction can be made under conditions

the RF has never seen suggests that the time series signal is capturing fundamental physics

that lead to the prediction. Further, when the stress-cycle periodicity is disrupted by a

shorter recurrence time as shown in the inset of Fig. 2, the RF still does an excellent

job in predicting failure time, showing that the approach can be generalized to aperiodic

fault cycles. The fact that timing prediction can be made under conditions the RF has

never seen suggests that the time series signal is capturing fundamental physics that

lead to the prediction. Our physical interpretation is that the chattering signal variance

and higher order moments are a fingerprint of the instantaneous friction and shear-stress

state, the variance and other features of the time series carry quantitative frictional state

information (see Figs. S3-S4), informing the RF of when the next slip event will occur. If

true, this is a remarkable observation in itself. We are currently working on the relation

between the signal variance and friction to determine if indeed there is a direct link.

There are a number of issues to consider in applying what we have learned to Earth.

The laboratory shear rates are orders of magnitude larger than Earth (5 microns/sec

vs mms-cms/year). The laboratory temperature conditions in no way resemble those in

Earth, while the pressures could be representative of in situ pressures when fluid pressures

are large. While it is a significant leap linking the laboratory studies to Earth scale, we

know from past work [Johnson et al. [2013]; W. Goebel et al. [2013]] that the fundamental

scaling relation in fault physics, the Gutenberg-Richter relation calculated from the labo-

ratory precursors [Gutenberg and Richter [1949]], is within the bounds observed in Earth

[Johnson et al. [2013]; W. Goebel et al. [2013]]. This similarity implies that some of the

important fault frictional physics scale. A laboratory experiment clearly cannot capture

all of the physics of a complex rupture in Earth. Nevertheless, the machine learning ex-

pertise we are developing as we move from the laboratory to Earth will ultimately guide

further work at large scale.

4. Conclusion

To summarize, we show that ML applied to this experiment provides accurate failure

forecasts based on the instantaneous analysis of the acoustic signal at any time in the

slip cycle, and reveals a signal previously unidentified. These results should suffice to

encourage ML analysis of seismic signals in Earth. To our knowledge, this is the first

application of ML to continuous acoustic/seismic data with the goal of inferring failure

times. These results suggest that previous analyses based exclusively on earthquake cat-

alogs [Keilis-Borok et al. [1988]; Liu et al. [2005]; Alves [2006]; Alexandridis et al. [2014]]

may be incomplete. In particular, ML-based approaches mitigate human bias by auto-

matically searching for patterns in a large space of potentially relevant variables. Our

current approach is to progressively scale from the laboratory to the Earth by applying

this approach to Earth problems that most resemble the laboratory system. An inter-

esting analogy to the laboratory may be faults that exhibit small repeating earthquakes.

For instance, fault patches located on the San Andreas Fault near Parkfield [Nadeau and

McEvilly [1999]; Zechar and Nadeau [2012]] exhibit such behavior. Repeaters at these

fault patches may be emitting chattering in analogy to the laboratory. If so, can this

signal be recorded by borehole and surface instruments? We are currently studying this

problem. Whether ML approaches applied to continuous seismic or other geophysical

data succeed in providing information on timing of earthquakes (not to mention the chal-

lenge of predicting earthquake magnitude), this approach may reveal unidentified signals

associated with undiscovered fault physics. Furthermore, this method may be useful for

failure prediction in a broad spectrum of industrial and natural materials. Technology

is at a confluence of dramatic advances in instrumentation, machine learning, the abil-

ity to handle massive data sets and faster computers. Thus, the stage has been set for

potentially marked advances in earthquake science.

Figure 1. Random Forest (RF) approach for predicting time remaining before failure.
(a) Shear stress (black curve) exhibits sharp drops, indicating failure events (laboratory earthquakes).
We wish to predict the time remaining before the next failure derived from the shear stress drops (red
curve), using only the acoustic emission (dynamic strain) data (b). The dashed rectangle represents a
moving time window; each window generates a single point on each feature curve below (e.g., variance,
kurtosis, etc.). (c) The RF model predicts the time remaining before the next failure by averaging the
predictions of 1000 decision trees for each time window. Each tree makes its prediction (white leaf
node), following a series of decisions (colored nodes) based on features of the acoustic signal during
the current window (see Supplementary Materials). (d) The RF prediction (blue line) on data it has
never seen (testing data) with 90% confidence intervals (blue shaded region). The predictions agree
remarkably well with the actual remaining times before failure (red curve). We emphasize that the
testing data is entirely independent of the training data, and was not used to construct the model. Data
from experiment number p2394.

Figure 2. Time remaining before the next failure predicted by the Random Forest.
As in Fig. 1a, the red lines show the actual time before failure (Y-axis) versus experimental run time
(X-axis). The red dashed line shows the time remaining before the next failure (derived from the shear
stress data), and the blue line shows the corresponding prediction of the RF regression model (derived
exclusively from the ‘instantaneous’ acoustic data). The blue shaded region indicates the 5th and 95th
percentiles of the forecast-that is, 90 percent of the trees that comprise the forest made a forecast within
these bounds. The inset emphasizes predictions on aperiodic slip behavior. The RF does a remarkable
job of forecasting slip times even with aperiodic data. The RF was trained on ≈150 seconds of data
(≈10 slip events), and tested on the following ≈150 seconds, shown here. We stress that the predictions
from each time are entirely independent of past and future history-each blue point is a ‘now’ prediction.
The data points can be scrambled in time and the predictions remain the same. Data from experiment
number p2394.

Figure 3. The physics of failure. The RF identifies two classes of signals and uses them to

predict failure. (a) Shear stress and dynamic strain encompassing two failure events. (b) Zoom

of dynamic strain when failure is in the distant future. This newly identified signal, termed

‘laboratory tremor’ offers precise predictive capability of the next failure time. (c) Zoom of a

classic, impulsive acoustic emission observed in the critically stressed region just preceding failure

(note vertical scale is different for two signals). Such signals are routinely identified preceding

failure in the shear apparatus, in brittle failure in most materials and in some earthquakes. Data

from experiment number p2394.
