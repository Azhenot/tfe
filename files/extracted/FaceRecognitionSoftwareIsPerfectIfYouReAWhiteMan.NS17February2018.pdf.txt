Face-recognition software can guess your gender with amazing

accuracy – if you are a white man.

Joy Buolamwini at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology tested

three commercially available face-recognition systems, created by

Microsoft, IBM and the Chinese company Megvii.

The systems correctly identified the gender of white men 99 per cent of

the time. But the error rate rose for people with darker skin, reaching

nearly 35 per cent for women. The results will be presented at the

Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency in New York

later this month

Face-recognition software is already being used in many different

situations, including by police to identify suspects in a crowd and to

automatically tag photos.

This means inaccuracies could have consequences, such as

systematically ingraining biases in police stop and searches.

Biases in artificial intelligence systems tend to come from biases in the

data they are trained on. According to one study, a widely used data set

is around 75 per cent male and more than 80 per cent white.
