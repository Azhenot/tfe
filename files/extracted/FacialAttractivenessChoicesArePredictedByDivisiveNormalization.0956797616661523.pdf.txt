It is sometimes assumed that one face appears more 
attractive than another because of its physical attributes, 
not because of when, where, or with whom it is seen. 
Indeed, classical decision-making theories assume ratio-
nal agents who assign values to decision options (Luce, 
1959) and assume that these values are fixed, regardless 
of any other alternatives that are encountered (i.e., 
regardless of context). These assumptions may contribute 
to the dearth of theory predicting context effects on facial 
evaluations (e.g., facial attractiveness). One candidate 
theory for predicting context effects—normalization—
draws support from decision-making studies showing 
context effects (Rangel & Clithero, 2012). For decisions 
among multiple options, divisively normalized represen-
tations of option values can be obtained by dividing each 
option’s value (assessed without context) by the sum of 
all available option values (Louie & Glimcher, 2012; 
Louie, Khaw, & Glimcher, 2013). For example, when an 
option having a value of 3 is presented together with 

options having values of 2 and 1, its value after divisive 
normalization is 0.5 (i.e., 3/(3 + 2 + 1)).

Normalization may mediate context effects on attrac-
tiveness decisions. It typifies neural responses through-
out the brain and can be considered a putative canonical 
neural computation (Carandini & Heeger, 2012). Normal-
ization proliferates in the brain because it ensures that 
neural firing rates optimally span prevailing stimulus 
ranges. Divisive normalization is well-studied for vision 
and explains nonlinear neural responses, including pho-
toreceptor normalization to light intensity (Boynton & 
 Whitten, 1970), contrast normalization and saturation 
effects (Bonin, Mante, & Carandini, 2005), cross-orienta-
tion suppression (Carandini, Heeger, & Movshon, 1997),

Facial-Attractiveness Choices Are Predicted 
by Divisive Normalization

Nicholas Furl
Department of Psychology, Royal Holloway, University of London

Abstract
Do people appear more attractive or less attractive depending on the company they keep? A divisive-normalization 
account—in which representation of stimulus intensity is normalized (divided) by concurrent stimulus intensities—
predicts that choice preferences among options increase with the range of option values. In the first experiment reported 
here, I manipulated the range of attractiveness of the faces presented on each trial by varying the attractiveness of an 
undesirable distractor face that was presented simultaneously with two attractive targets, and participants were asked 
to choose the most attractive face. I used normalization models to predict the context dependence of preferences 
regarding facial attractiveness. The more unattractive the distractor, the more one of the targets was preferred over 
the other target, which suggests that divisive normalization (a potential canonical computation in the brain) influences 
social evaluations. I obtained the same result when I manipulated faces’ averageness and participants chose the 
most average face. This finding suggests that divisive normalization is not restricted to value-based decisions (e.g., 
attractiveness). This new application to social evaluation of normalization, a classic theory, opens possibilities for 
predicting social decisions in naturalistic contexts such as advertising or dating.

and neural responses to motion (Simoncelli & Heeger, 
1998) and multiple objects (Zoccolan, Cox, & DiCarlo, 
2005). Normalization outside vision includes nonlinear 
neural responses to auditory contrast (Rabinowitz,  
Willmore, Schnupp, & King, 2011) and cross-modality 
normalization in multisensory integration (Ohshiro, 
Angelaki, & DeAngelis, 2011).

Representations of reward value are also normalized. 
Brain responses encoding the values of choice options 
adapt to the ranges of option values (Cox & Kable, 2014; 
Padoa-Schioppa, 2009; Rangel & Clithero, 2012). This 
normalization affects human choice behavior, too. An 
undesirable option modulates the choice between two 
other options (Soltani, De Martino, & Camerer, 2012), for 
example, when monkeys choose among juice rewards 
and humans choose among snack foods (Louie et al., 
2013). In Louie et al. (2013), lower-value distractor items 
(i.e., a wider range of option values) increased prefer-
ence for the better of two desirable options, a finding 
predicted by computer simulations of divisive normaliza-
tion. Thus, divisive normalization effectively expands or 
contracts the dynamic range of value representations to 
match the range of option values.

Normalization could mediate similar context effects in 
the social domain too, but a theory to predict context 
effects for social evaluations is lacking. In an attractive-
ness experiment, I tested whether normalization predicts 
facial attractiveness. Participants evaluated facial attrac-
tiveness without context in a first phase; in a second 
phase, they performed a trinary-choice task to assess 
attractiveness preferences. When two highly attractive 
targets and a low-attractiveness distractor are choice 
options, participants’ choices should become more sensi-
tive to differences in attractiveness of the two targets. In 
a control experiment (i.e., averageness experiment), I 
tested for the same effects using a task in which partici-
pants chose the most average-appearing face. These 
averageness choices may share some perceptual bases 
with attractiveness choices (Langlois & Roggman, 1990) 
but have no overt value-based connotation. This control 
task could therefore show whether normalization is 
restricted to value-based judgments such as attractiveness 
or affects high-level facial judgments in general.

Method

Participants

I enrolled two samples of 40 participants each, selecting 
a sample size equivalent to that used by Louie et al. 
(2013). For the attractiveness experiment, all 40 (age 
range = 18−23; 25 women) contributed data for analysis. 
For the averageness experiment (approximate age  

range = 18−55, 28 women), data for 1 participant were 
removed from analysis because her responses suggested 
that the instructions were not followed. Participants were 
students or staff at Royal Holloway, University of London, 
and had normal or corrected-to-normal vision.

For the attractiveness experiment, participants were 
entered into a drawing for one £25 Amazon voucher. For 
the averageness experiment, participants were compen-
sated £8. The attractiveness experiment was approved by 
the psychology department ethics committee, and the aver-
ageness experiment was approved by the college ethics 
committee, both at Royal Holloway, University of London.

Procedure

Stimuli included color photographs of 15 male and 15 
female neutral faces sampled from the Karolinska 
Directed Emotional Faces (KDEF) face set (Lundqvist, 
Flykt, & Öhman, 1998). In Phase 1 (Fig. 1a, left), partici-
pants rated either the attractiveness or the averageness of 
the 30 faces, two times each, sequentially and in a pseu-
dorandom order.

On each trial, participants saw a face and below that a 
horizontal line representing a continuum of values 
(between 0 and 1). They used the mouse to choose a 
value. The next trial appeared after the mouse click. The 
two ratings recorded for each face during Phase 1 were 
averaged for each participant. These averaged Phase 1 
ratings were taken as estimates of each participant’s judg-
ment without context or normalization. In the attractive-
ness experiment, faces were selected for Phase 2 based 
on each participant’s attractiveness ratings. In the aver-
ageness experiment, faces were selected for Phase 2 
based on each participant’s averageness ratings. On the 
basis of these averages, the lowest-rated (least attractive 
or least average) 10 male faces and 10 female faces were 
selected as distractors (Fig. 1b), and the highest-rated 5 
male faces and 5 female faces were selected as targets 
(Fig. 1c) for Phase 2.

In each trial of Phase 2, three faces (two targets and a 
distractor) appeared on the screen at the left, center, and 
right (Fig. 1a, right). The faces were presented in pseudo-
random order, and the faces’ screen locations were 
assigned randomly. The faces came from the 10 possible 
pairs of five targets for each gender, matched to the 10 
same-gender distractors. The participant indicated which 
of the faces was most attractive or most average by press-
ing a button on a computer keyboard, which triggered the 
next trial. I measured which target was chosen on each 
trial and whether the chosen target was the more attrac-
tive target (or more average target) according to the rat-
ings from Phase 1. Each participant completed 200 trials.

faces that were presented without context. In Phase 2 (a, right), participants completed a trinary-choice task in 
which they chose the most attractive of three faces (two targets and a distractor). In Phase 2 of the attractiveness 
experiment, distractors were the 10 male faces and 10 female faces with the lowest attractiveness ratings, and

Results

Attractiveness and averageness ratings in Phase 1 were 
submitted to an analysis of variance (ANOVA) with fac-
tors of distractor, face’s gender, and participant’s gender. 
Attractiveness ratings (Fig. 1b) were significantly greater 
for targets than for distractors, F(1, 38) = 320.06, p < .001, 
ηp2 = .89, and for female faces than for male faces, F(1, 
38) = 40.52, p < .001, ηp2 = .52. There were no effects of 
participant’s gender or any interactions among the three 
factors. Averageness ratings (Fig. 1c) were also signifi-
cantly greater for targets than for distractors, F(1, 37) = 
349.78, p < .001, ηp2 = .90. Neither the effect of face’s 
gender (p = .08) nor any other effect reached significance 
for averageness ratings. Because the distractors were 
always given low ratings compared with the targets, dis-
tractors were never chosen as the most attractive or most 
average faces in Phase 2.

A divisive-normalization account would predict that 
distractor faces that received lower Phase 1 ratings would 
be associated with greater differences in the proportion 
of choices between the two target faces in Phase 2. 
Because each participant provided his or her own rat-
ings, I standardized ratings across participants by ranking 
the distractors (attractiveness experiment, Fig. 2a; aver-
ageness experiment, Fig. 2c); the lowest-rated distractor 
of each gender had the lowest rank (i.e., a 1). Visual 
inspection of Figure 2 reveals that distractors with a lower 
rank were associated with more choices of the more 
attractive target (Fig. 2a) and with more choices of the 
more average target (Fig. 2c). For the attractiveness 
experiment, an unexpected result was that male partici-
pants were more likely to choose the more attractive tar-
get face when it was male than when it was female, 
whereas female participants showed this pattern to a 
lesser degree (Fig. 2b).

Several analyses focusing on the hypothesized effects 
of distractor rating confirmed these patterns. For the attrac-
tiveness experiment, an ANOVA on the proportion of 
choices of the more attractive target, with distractor’s rank, 
face’s gender, and participant’s gender as factors, showed 
a significant main effect of distractor’s rank, F(9, 342) = 
3.79, p < .001, ηp2 = .09, and face’s gender, F(1, 38) = 15.03, 
p < .001, ηp2 = .28, and a significant interaction between 
face’s gender and participant’s gender, F(1, 38) = 4.22, p = 
.047, ηp2 = .10. The averageness experiment replicated the 
significant main effect of distractor’s rank, F(9, 333) = 4.27, 
p < .001, with a similar effect size, ηp2 = .10, although there 
were no other significant effects for this ANOVA.

The effects of distractor’s rank in both the attractive-
ness and the averageness experiments were confirmed 
by multiple linear regression. Separately for each partici-
pant, I quantitatively tested for the predicted negative 
direction of the effect of distractor’s rank on choice 
behavior. The predictors in these models were distrac-
tor’s rank, face’s gender, and their interaction, and the 
outcome was the proportion of choices of the higher-
rated (more attractive or more average) target. The result-
ing participant-specific β values were tested for 
significance across the sample in the second level of a 
hierarchical analysis that treated participant as a random 
effect. For the attractiveness experiment, a negative rela-
tionship between distractor’s rank and the proportion of 
choices of the more attractive target was confirmed by a 
significant left-sided t test, mean β = −0.006, confidence 
bound = −0.003, t(39) = −4.02, p < .001. The same analy-
sis replicated this effect for the averageness experiment, 
mean β = −0.01, confidence bound = −0.007, t(39) = 
−5.30, p < .001. This shift in proportion of higher target 
ratings was associated with an effect size conventionally 
regarded as large (attractiveness: Cohen’s d = 1.29; aver-
ageness: Cohen’s d = 1.72), and the shift in relative choice

as a function of distractor value was within the range of 
previous reports of other decision-making paradigms (for 
an example that investigates dominance effects for visual 
stimulus dimensions, see Trueblood, Brown, Heathcote, 
& Busemeyer, 2013).

Further confirmation for influences of distractor rating 
on choice behavior was provided by an analysis that 
directly predicted the choice on each trial (as opposed to 
proportions of choices in different conditions) using a 
binomial generalized linear model with a logistic link 
function (for a similar analysis, see Louie et al., 2013). For 
each participant, a generalized linear model predicted a 
binary variable encoding whether the participant chose 
the higher rated (more attractive or more average) target 
on each trial using, as regressors, the Phase 1 rating of 
the leftmost target, the Phase 1 rating of the rightmost 
target, the Phase 1 rating of the distractor, the gender of 
the face, and the interaction between distractor rating and  
face gender. Again, magnitudes of the participant-specific 
β values for distractor attractiveness were tested for sig-
nificance across the sample at a second level, treating 
participant as a random variable. For the attractiveness 
experiment, the hypothesis was confirmed by a negative 
relationship between distractor’s attractiveness and fre-
quency of choices of the more attractive target, mean  
β = −1.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) = [−2.46, −0.50], 
t(39) = −2.9, p = .006, Cohen’s d = 0.93. Thus, on a given 
trial, the more attractive the distractor, the less likely it 
was that one target would be chosen over the other. The 
averageness experiment replicated this negative relation-
ship between the distractor’s rating and proportion of 
choice of the higher rated target (more average, in this 
case), mean β = −1.37, 95% CI = [−1.916, −0.819], t(38) = 
−5.0, p < .001, Cohen’s d = 1.64.

Louie et al. (2013), using the same paradigm that we 
used in the current study, showed that the psychometric 
function that predicts the probability of choosing a par-
ticular target on the basis of differences between the val-
ues of the two targets exhibits a larger slope for distractors 
with lower reward values. This psychometric function 
can have a sigmoid shape. When Target 2 is considerably 
more valuable than Target 1 (i.e., target-value difference 
is negative), participants never choose Target 1. As the 
value of Target 1 increases relative to Target 2, the pro-
portion of Target 1 choices will increase. When Target 1 
becomes considerably more valuable than Target 2, par-
ticipants will always choose Target 1. The slope of this 
sigmoid function measures how sensitive choice prefer-
ence is to differences between the two targets. In the 
current study, target values were measured as Phase 1 
ratings and so we assessed choice as a function of target-
rating differences. If attractiveness or averageness repre-
sentations are divisively normalized, then low-rated 
distractors should increase participants’ sensitivity to 

target-rating differences in attractiveness or averageness 
and thereby increase the slope of the sigmoid function. 
Hence, a divisive-normalization account predicts that dis-
tractor rank will be negatively related to the slope of the 
psychometric function.

This prediction was tested by fitting to the data the 
logistic curve y = 1/(1 + exp(−β1 × (x − β2))), where y val-
ues are the predicted proportion of Target 1 choices (taken 
in the current study as the leftmost target on the screen), x 
values are the target-rating differences, β1 represents the 
slope parameter, and β2 represents the inflection-point 
parameter. Because target-rating differences and distractor 
ratings were different for each participant, there were no 
fixed values across participants. To facilitate summarizing 
data over participants (Fig. 3) and to ensure a sufficient 
number of averaged trials for fitting, I binned the distrac-
tor ranks (5 bins) and target-rating-difference ranks (12 
bins) and then fitted logistic functions to data in these 
bins. This yielded separate logistic function parameters 
(nlimfit.m in MATLAB; The MathWorks, Natick, MA) for 
each participant and distractor bin. Although logistic 
slope values were computed from individual participant 
logistic fits, for visualization purposes, Figures 3a, 3b, 3d, 
and 3e show functions fit to group data. A reduction in 
slope that changes continuously across distractor bins is 
apparent for both attractiveness and averageness choices.

For analysis of logistic slopes, poor curve fitting 
occurred on occasion. For the attractiveness experiment, 
2 outlying slopes out of 200 (40 participants × 5 distractor 
bins) were removed because they were more than 6 stan-
dard deviations from their distractor-bin means and were 
greater than 30 although all other values were less than 
1. For the averageness experiment, 8 out of 195 slopes 
were removed because they were more than 2.5 standard 
deviations from their distractor-bin means and were 
greater than 14 although all other values were less than 
1. Next, I used linear regression to ascertain whether dis-
tractor bin was negatively associated with logistic slope, 
by fitting a line to the five logistic slopes separately for 
each participant (Figs. 3c and 3f). These participant- 
specific linear regression β values were submitted to a 
second-level, one-sample t test. Because we had an a 
priori hypothesis predicting a decrease in slope as a 
function of distractor bin, and because a similar decrease 
had been reported by previous research (Louie et al., 
2013), we tested for decreasing slopes by implementing 
left-sided t tests. The results confirmed the prediction of 
normalization for both the attractiveness and the average-
ness experiments. Across participants, logistic slopes 
were negatively related to distractor’s attractiveness, 
mean β = −0.02, confidence bound = −0.003, t(39) = 
−2.00, p = .027, Cohen’s d = 0.32, and to distractor’s aver-
ageness, mean β = −0.02, confidence bound = −0.001, 
t(38) = −1.8, p = .04, Cohen’s d = 0.38.

Divisive Normalization and Facial Attractiveness 1385

Discussion

The attractiveness experiment showed that participants 
were more likely to find one target more attractive than 
another, depending on the unattractiveness of the dis-
tractor (Fig. 2a), even though distractors were too unat-
tractive to be chosen (Fig. 1b). Moreover, less attractive 
distractors increased participants’ choice sensitivity to dif-
ferences in target attractiveness (Fig. 3). The same results 
occurred when the experiment was repeated for average-
ness choices (Fig. 2c, Fig. 3). These findings could arise 
from divisive normalization (Carandini & Heeger, 2012), 
in which neural firing rates adapt to span the range of 
options. For the attractiveness experiment, less attractive 
distractors widened the attractiveness range of options, 
and so normalization to this wider range pulled apart the 
representations of the two targets. The result was an 
increase in choice frequency of the more attractive target 
(Fig. 2) and more sensitivity of choices to differences in 
target attractiveness (Fig. 3). These findings support the 
notion that normalization proliferates throughout the ner-
vous system, given that similar effects arise for monkey’s 
preferences for juice reward and humans’ preferences for 
snack foods (Louie et al., 2013). Divisive normalization, 
moreover, explains neural responses throughout the 
visual and auditory systems and contributes to sensory 
integration and decision making (Carandini & Heeger, 
2012). The attractiveness and averageness experiments 
demonstrated that normalization affects people’s choices 
and perceptions in higher-level social domains as well.

Although the normalization account provides a basis 
for predicting context effects on social evaluations, tim-
ing effects still need to be explained. Context can also be 
manipulated using repetitive presentation of stimuli. 
Adaptation (prolonged exposure) to facial distortions, for 
example, increases attractiveness of similarly distorted 
faces (Rhodes, Jeffery, Watson, Clifford, & Nakayama, 
2003; Winkler & Rhodes, 2005). Assimilative effects for 
sequential faces can occur for attractiveness (Taubert, 
Van der Burg, & Alais, 2016) and identity (Liberman, 
Fischer, & Whitney, 2014) and may arise from processes 
that maintain visual continuity. A different finding, the 
contrast effect, occurs when successive presentations of 
attractive faces renders faces less attractive (Wedell, 
 Parducci, & Geiselman, 1987) and has been associated 
with range-frequency normalization (Parducci, 1965; 
Wedell et al., 1987). I found that range frequency theory 
was not a viable alternative to divisive normalization 
using a simulation of the trinary-choice paradigm follow-
ing methods reported in Louie et al. (2013). Although this 
simulation replicated the results of Louie et al. for divi-
sive normalization, range-frequency theory produced an 
opposite result: Relative choices between targets become 
more confusable, not more distinct, for lower distractor 

values. Whether instantaneous presentation and repeti-
tive successive presentations draw on different mecha-
nisms remains to be tested.

Although contrastive adaptation to sequences and 
normalization share the goal of adjusting neural firing to 
match prevailing stimulus conditions (Webster, Kaping, 
Mizokami, & Duhamel, 2004), in trinary choice, the con-
text changes on each trial more quickly than in adapta-
tion experiments. In addition, in the brain, some types of 
normalization are best observed after blocking many tri-
als (Rangel & Clithero, 2012). This slow time course may 
be better suited for measuring adaptation and contrast 
effects than the faster context changes associated with 
trinary-choice tasks. Louie and Glimcher (2012) have 
already noted a distinction between normalization by 
more immediate spatial context versus a temporal con-
text, which is dependent instead on the history of previ-
ous stimuli. Results from the attractiveness and averageness 
experiments therefore highlight the time scale of context 
effects as a variable requiring further study.

Compared with sequence-dependent ratings tasks, 
trinary-choice tasks have an advantageous feature. Mul-
tiple target options reveal additional effects of stretching 
or contraction to adjust to stimulus range by showing 
how distractors pull target choices apart or push them 
together, a finding difficult to infer from sequential Likert 
ratings. Trinary choice also forms the basis for many deci-
sion-making effects (Kowal & Faulkner, 2016) including 
the similarity effect (Tversky, 1972), the attraction effect 
(Huber, Payne, & Puto, 1982) and the compromise effect 
(Simonson, 1989). These effects involve selectively 
manipulating a distractor’s similarity to the targets along 
specific stimulus attributes. Such studies are used to 
examine multiattribute decision making and are often 
couched as commodity purchases (rather than as social 
evaluations) in which multiple-valued attributes can be 
experimentally manipulated (e.g., choosing between 
used cars that vary in both mileage and price). The cur-
rent experiments used photographs of natural faces and 
manipulated only overall attractiveness (or averageness) 
rather than select attributes. However, facial attributes 
could, in principle, be manipulated in trinary-choice 
tasks to study multiattribute decision-making phenomena 
in social contexts.

The attractiveness and averageness experiments also 
engendered new research questions about which repre-
sentations are normalized. Many potentially normalized 
representations could contribute to attractiveness deci-
sions, including visual representations of facial attributes. 
If attractiveness decisions arise from evaluation of visual 
information, then they will be influenced when visual 
representations are normalized. For example, Wedell and 
Pettibone (1999) manipulated the range of eye and nose 
widths on schematic faces to induce contrast effects on

eye- and nose-width perception, and they found corre-
sponding shifts in judgments of face pleasantness. The 
averageness experiment explored a similar possibility by 
examining a high-level facial judgment that might resem-
ble some of the perceptual assessment involved in attrac-
tiveness perception, although averageness choices lack 
the same overt reward-based assessment as attractiveness 
choices. The finding of normalization for averageness 
decisions suggests that normalization is not limited to 
reward-based judgments (Louie et al., 2013) and might 
operate on high-level visual assessments. However, many 
potential visual contributions to attractiveness decisions 
could be normalized. Evidence already exists for normal-
ization of low-level visual responses to luminance, con-
trast, and motion in the visual cortex (Carandini & Heeger, 
2012), and imaging evidence exists for normalization in 
visual areas for object representation (Zoccolan et al., 
2005). Behavioral and brain-response measurements are 
still needed to fully assess the roles of visual normaliza-
tion in social evaluation of faces.

Attractiveness decisions are also decisions about 
potential rewards, and the averageness experiment can-
not exclude the possibility of additional normalization of 
reward-based representations (Louie et al., 2013). More-
over, the situation is further complicated by evidence of 
multiple brain representations of reward-related value, 
any of which might be susceptible to normalization. For 
faces, several brain areas (e.g., amygdala, prefrontal 
areas, ventral striatum) are associated with reward value 
(Bzdok et al., 2012; Kampe, Frith, Dolan, & Frith, 2001; 
Pegors, Kable, Chatterjee, & Epstein, 2015; Smith et al., 
2010; Winston, O’Doherty, Kilner, Perrett, & Dolan, 2007). 
Moreover, ventromedial prefrontal cortex may map dif-
ferently scaled values from different stimulus domains 
onto a single reward-value representation (i.e., a common 
currency; Pegors et al., 2015; Smith et al., 2010; Vessel, 
Stahl, Purton, & Starr, 2015). In the monkey, a similar area 
in the orbitofrontal cortex has already been shown to 
exhibit normalized responses to reward (Cox & Kable, 
2014; Padoa-Schioppa, 2009). Behavioral and brain-
response measurements are needed also to fully assess 
the roles of normalization of reward-based representa-
tions in social evaluation of faces.

Normalization theories (e.g., divisive normalization) 
motivate new quantitative predictions, such as those 
tested here. The fact that normalization explains prefer-
ences in the social domain suggests new applications to 
applied or naturalistic settings. The ability to predict 
social evaluations in context might generalize to adver-
tising, Web site design, consumer behavior, and so forth. 
Context effects on social decisions also challenge com-
mon assumptions, including those of classical econom-
ics, that relative values, such as attractiveness, are 
constant over time. Although people alter their faces 

through makeup, hairstyles, and the like to appear attrac-
tive, in fact, faces appear more or less attractive depend-
ing on context. Indeed, people may even socially 
evaluate a person differently depending on who is stand-
ing nearby.
