Abstract

We develop an algorithm that can detect
pneumonia from chest X-rays at a level ex-
ceeding practicing radiologists. Our algo-
rithm, CheXNet, is a 121-layer convolutional
neural network trained on ChestX-ray14, cur-
rently the largest publicly available chest X-
ray dataset, containing over 100,000 frontal-
view X-ray images with 14 diseases. Four
practicing academic radiologists annotate a
test set, on which we compare the perfor-
mance of CheXNet to that of radiologists.
We find that CheXNet exceeds average radi-
ologist performance on pneumonia detection
on both sensitivity and specificity. We extend
CheXNet to detect all 14 diseases in ChestX-
ray14 and achieve state of the art results on
all 14 diseases.

1. Introduction

More than 1 million adults are hospitalized with pneu-
monia and around 50,000 die from the disease every
year in the US alone (CDC, 2017). Chest X-rays
are currently the best available method for diagnosing
pneumonia (WHO, 2001), playing a crucial role in clin-
ical care (Franquet, 2001) and epidemiological studies
(Cherian et al., 2005). However, detecting pneumo-
nia in chest X-rays is a challenging task that relies on
the availability of expert radiologists. In this work, we
present a model that can automatically detect pneu-
monia from chest X-rays at a level exceeding practicing

Figure 2. CheXNet outperforms the average of the radiologists at pneuomonia detection using X-ray images. ChexNet
is tested against 4 practicing radiologists on sensitivity (which measures the proportion of positives that are correctly
identified as such) and specificity (which measures the proportion of negatives that are correctly identified as such). A
single radiologist’s performance is represented by an orange marker, while the average is represented by green. CheXNet
outputs the probability of detecting pneumonia in a Chest X-ray, and the blue curve is generated by varying the thresholds
used for the classification boundary. The sensitivity-specificity point for each radiologist and for the average lie below the
blue curve, signifying that CheXNet is able to detect pneumonia at a level matching or exceeding radiologists.

et al., 2017), which contains 112,120 frontal-view chest
X-ray images individually labeled with up to 14 differ-
ent thoracic diseases, including pneumonia. We use
dense connections (Huang et al., 2016) and batch nor-
malization (Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015) to make the opti-
mization of such a deep network tractable.

Detecting pneumonia in chest radiography can be diffi-
cult for radiologists. The appearance of pneumonia in
X-ray images is often vague, can overlap with other di-
agnoses, and can mimic many other benign abnormal-
ities. These discrepancies cause considerable variabil-
ity among radiologists in the diagnosis of pneumonia
(Neuman et al., 2012; Davies et al., 1996; Hopstaken
et al., 2004). To estimate radiologist performance, we
collect annotations from four practicing academic radi-
ologists on a subset of 420 images from ChestX-ray14.
On these 420 images, we measure performance of in-
dividual radiologists using the majority vote of other
radiologists as ground truth, and similarly measure
model performance.

We find that the model exceeds the average radiolo-
gist performance at the pneumonia detection task on
both sensitivity and specificity. To compare CheXNet
against previous work using ChestX-ray14, we make
simple modifications to ChexNet to detect all 14 dis-

eases in ChestX-ray14, and find that we outperform
best published results on all 14 diseases. Automated
detection of diseases from chest X-rays at the level of
expert radiologists would not only have tremendous
benefit in clinical settings, it would be invaluable in
delivery of health care to populations with inadequate
access to diagnostic imaging specialists.

2. CheXNet

2.1. Problem Formulation

The pneumonia detection task is a binary classification
problem, where the input is a frontal frontal-view chest
X-ray image X and the output is a binary label t ∈
{0, 1} indicating the absence or presence of pneumonia
respectively. For a single example in the training set,
we optimize the binary cross entropy loss

L(X, t) = −t log p(T = 1|X)− (1− t) log p(T = 0|X)

where p(T = i|X) is the probability that the network
assigns to the label i.

2.2. Model Architecture and Training

CheXNet is a 121-layer Dense Convolutional Net-
work (DenseNet) (Huang et al., 2016) trained on the



CheXNet: Radiologist-Level Pneumonia Detection on Chest X-Rays with Deep Learning

ChestX-ray 14 dataset. DenseNets improve flow of in-
formation and gradients through the network, making
the optimization of very deep networks tractable. We
replace the final fully connected layer with one that
has a single output, after which we apply a sigmoid
nonlinearity, outputting the probability that the im-
age contains pneumonia.

The weights of the network are randomly initialized
and trained end-to-end using Adam with standard pa-
rameters (β1 = 0.9 and β2 = 0.999) (Kingma & Ba,
2014). We train the model using minibatches of size
16, where we oversample the minority (positive) class
(Buda et al., 2017). We use an initial learning rate of
0.01 that is decayed by a factor of 10 each time the
validation loss plateaus after an epoch, and pick the
model with the lowest validation loss.

3. Data

3.1. Training

We use the ChestX-ray14 dataset released by Wang
et al. (2017) which contains 112,120 frontal-view X-ray
images of 30,805 unique patients. Wang et al. (2017)
annotate each image with up to 14 different thoracic
pathology labels using automatic extraction methods
on radiology reports. We label images that have pneu-
monia as one of the annotated pathologies as positive
examples and label all other images as negative exam-
ples for the pneumonia detection task. We randomly
split the entire dataset into 80% training, and 20%
validation.

Before inputting the images into the network, we
downscale the images to 224×224 and normalize based
on the mean and standard deviation of images in the
ImageNet training set. We also augment the training
data with random horizontal flipping.

3.2. Test

We collected a test set of 420 frontal chest X-rays. An-
notations were obtained independently from four prac-
ticing radiologists at Stanford University, who were
asked to label all 14 pathologies in Wang et al. (2017).
The radiologists had 4, 7, 25, and 28 years of experi-
ence, and one of the radiologists is a sub-specialty fel-
lowship trained thoracic radiologist. Radiologists did
not have access to any patient information or knowl-
edge of disease prevalence in the data. Labels were
entered into a standardized data entry program.

4. CheXNet vs. Radiologist
Performance

We assess radiologist performance on the test set on
the pneumonia detection task. Recall that each of the
images in test420 has a ground truth label from 4 prac-
ticing radiologists. We evaluate the performance of an
individual radiologist by using the majority vote of
the other 3 radiologists as ground truth. Similarly, we
evaluate CheXNet using the majority vote of 3 of 4
radiologists, repeated four times to cover all groups of
3.

We compare CheXNet against radiologists on the Re-
ceiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, which
plots model sensitivity against 1 - specificity. Figure 2
illustrates the model ROC curve as well as the four
radiologist and average radiologist operating points: a
single radiologist’s performance is represented by an
orange marker, while the average is represented by
green. CheXNet outputs the probability of detect-
ing pneumonia in a Chest X-ray, and the ROC curve
is generated by varying the thresholds used for the
classification boundary. CheXNet has an AUROC of
0.788. The sensitivity-specificity point for each radi-
ologist and for the average lie below the ROC curve,
signifying that CheXNet is able to detect pneumonia
at a level matching or exceeding radiologists.

We identify two limitations of this setup. First, nei-
ther the model nor the radiologists were permitted
to use prior examinations or patient history, which
have been shown to decrease radiologist performance
(Berbaum et al., 1985; Potchen et al., 1979). Second,
only frontal radiographs were presented to the radi-
ologists and model during diagnosis, but it has been
shown that up to 15% of accurate diagnoses require the
lateral view (Raoof et al., 2012). We thus expect that
this setup provides a conservative estimate of human
radiologist performance.

5. ChexNet vs. Previous State of the
Art on the ChestX-ray14 Dataset

We extend the algorithm to classify multiple thoracic
pathologies by making three changes. First, instead of
outputting one binary label, ChexNet outputs a vec-
tor t of binary labels indicating the absence or presence
of each of the following 14 pathology classes: Atelec-
tasis, Cardiomegaly, Consolidation, Edema, Effusion,
Emphysema, Fibrosis, Hernia, Infiltration, Mass, Nod-
ule, Pleural Thickening, Pneumonia, and Pneumotho-
rax. Second, we replace the final fully connected layer
in CheXNet with a fully connected layer producing a
14-dimensional output, after which we apply an ele-

mentwise sigmoid nonlinearity. The final output is the
predicted probability of the presence of each pathology
class. Third, we modify the loss function to optimize
the sum of binary cross entropy losses

L(X, t) =

14∑
c=1

[−tc log p(Tc = 1|X)

−(1− tc) log p(Tc = 0|X)],

where p(Tc = 1|X) is the predicted probability that
the image contains the pathology c and p(Tc = 0|X)
is the predicted probability that the image does not
contain the pathology c.

Following previous work on ChestX-ray14 (Wang
et al., 2017; Yao et al., 2017), we randomly split the
dataset into training (70%), validation (10%), and test
(20%) sets; the choice of split has been shown to have
insignificant effect on performance. We compare the
per-class Area Under the ROC Curve (AUROC) of the
model against the previous state of the art held by Yao
et al. (2017) on 13 classes and Wang et al. (2017) on
the remaining 1 class.

We find that CheXNet achieves state of the art results
on all 14 pathology classes. Table 1 illustrates the
per-class AUROC comparison on the test set. On At-
electasis, Mass, Nodule, Pneumonia, and Emphysema,
we outperform previous state of the art considerably
(> 0.05 increase in AUROC).

6. Model Interpretation

To interpret the network predictions, we also produce
heatmaps to visualize the areas of the image most in-
dicative of the disease using class activation mappings
(CAMs) (Zhou et al., 2016). To generate the CAMs,
we feed an image into the fully trained network and
extract the feature maps that are output by the final
convolutional layer. Let fk be the kth feature map and
let wc,k be the weight in the final classification layer
for feature map k leading to pathology c. We obtain
a map Mc of the most salient features used in classi-
fying the image as having pathology c by taking the
weighted sum of the feature maps using their associ-
ated weights. Formally,

Mc =
∑
k

wc,kfk.

We identify the most important features used by the
model in its prediction of the pathology c by upscal-
ing the map Mc to the dimensions of the image and
overlaying the image.

Figure 3 shows several examples of CAMs on the pneu-
monia detection task as well as the 14-class pathology
classification task.

Recent advancements in deep learning and large

tion (Esteva et al., 2017), arrhythmia detection (Ra-
jpurkar et al., 2017), and hemorrhage identification
(Grewal et al., 2017).

Automated diagnosis from chest radiographs has re-
ceived increasing attention with algorithms for pul-
monary tuberculosis classification (Lakhani & Sun-
daram, 2017) and lung nodule detection (Huang et al.,
2017). Islam et al. (2017) studied the performance
of various convolutional architectures on different ab-
normalities using the publicly available OpenI dataset
(Demner-Fushman et al., 2015). Wang et al. (2017)
released ChestX-ray-14, an order of magnitude larger
than previous datasets of its kind, and also bench-
marked different convolutional neural network archi-

tectures pre-trained on ImageNet. Recently Yao et al.
(2017) exploited statistical dependencies between la-
bels in order make more accurate predictions, outper-
forming Wang et al. (2017) on 13 of 14 classes.

8. Conclusion

Pneumonia accounts for a significant proportion of
patient morbidity and mortality (Gonçalves-Pereira
et al., 2013). Early diagnosis and treatment of pneu-
monia is critical to preventing complications including
death (Aydogdu et al., 2010). With approximately 2
billion procedures per year, chest X-rays are the most
common imaging examination tool used in practice,
critical for screening, diagnosis, and management of a

variety of diseases including pneumonia (Raoof et al.,
2012). However, two thirds of the global population
lacks access to radiology diagnostics, according to an
estimate by the World Health Organization (Mollura
et al., 2010). There is a shortage of experts who can in-
terpret X-rays, even when imaging equipment is avail-
able, leading to increased mortality from treatable dis-
eases (Kesselman et al., 2016).

We develop an algorithm which exceeds the perfor-
mance of radiologists in detecting pneumonia from
frontal-view chest X-ray images. We also show that
a simple extension of our algorithm to detect multi-
ple diseases outperforms previous state of the art on
ChestX-ray14, the largest publicly available chest X-
ray dataset. With automation at the level of experts,
we hope that this technology can improve healthcare
delivery and increase access to medical imaging ex-
pertise in parts of the world where access to skilled
radiologists is limited.
