Education and Health:
Redrawing the Preston
Curve

WOLFGANG LUTZ

PROGRESS IN HUMAN health and life expectancy is closely associated with
socioeconomic development. Better nutrition and greater affordability of
health care associated with higher income have been widely considered as
primary determinants of historical and contemporary mortality declines.
McKeown’s (1976) influential book on the modern rise of population at-
tributed the secular mortality decline largely to improving standards of liv-
ing. Reviewing mortality improvements in Britain during the second half of
the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth, he argued that
medical discoveries were of little consequence for the significant gains in
survival during this period. His analysis served as a reference point of Pre-
ston’s (1975) article, which is the focus of the present study. Preston showed
that the global pattern over the twentieth century indicates an upward shift
of the curve that links GDP per person on the horizontal axis and life ex-
pectancy on the vertical (Figure 1).1 Preston interpreted this shift as the
effect of medical progress and health care over and above the effect of in-
come. In many of the studies of this issue that followed Preston’s lead, the
assumption that income is the most important driver of mortality decline
has been an unquestioned starting point.

A very different picture was drawn by Caldwell in a 1986 article on
routes to low mortality in poor countries. Based on a major Rockefeller
Foundation study on Kerala (India), Sri Lanka, and Costa Rica, Caldwell
discussed the factors that led to breakthrough mortality declines in those
populations as opposed to others and identified “female autonomy,” which
he saw largely as a function of female education, as the single most im-
portant factor, together with efficient local health services. He also stated
that his conclusion that low mortality does not come as an unplanned
spinoff from economic growth was “out of step with today’s dominant eco-
nomic and political ideologies in the development field” (Caldwell 1986,

p. 209). And this still seems to be the case three decades later, despite the
fact that more recent research points to the overriding importance of educa-
tion and the associated cognitive changes affecting risk perception, planning
horizon, and access to information promoting health-related behaviors and
use of health care facilities (Baker et al. 2011; Lutz and Skirbekk 2014).

The question whether income or education is the more important de-
terminant of global health and mortality decline is relevant for setting pol-
icy priorities in both developing and industrialized countries. The answer is
of immediate concern in choosing between programs that directly promote
economic growth and those that focus on enhancing school enrollment and
quality of schooling. In an ideal world one would choose both in addition
to good local health services but, in reality, even in rich countries there are
budgetary constraints that require policymakers to set priorities. For help-
ing to set these priorities, it is necessary to assess the relative importance of
both factors. The question of relative importance is the focus of what fol-
lows. We address the issue at the macro level by plotting a modification of
the Preston curve in which GDP per person is replaced by mean years of
schooling among the adult population. This is done both for life expectancy
at birth and for child mortality, and in both cases educational attainment ex-
plains the pattern better than GDP per person. This redrawing of the curve
is complemented by a multivariate analysis to quantitatively assess the
relative difference of the two effects.

The Preston curve and its perception

In 1975 Samuel Preston published an influential paper, “The changing re-
lation between mortality and level of economic development,” in which he
plots the global relationship between GDP per capita and life expectancy at
different points in time. He finds that over time the curve that depicts the
relationship has moved upward, implying that a similar level of income is
associated with higher life expectancy at later points in time (Preston 1975).
He attributes this extra gain to medical progress. This view of the relation-
ship, known as the Preston curve, has since become widely cited. Although
Preston was cautious in interpreting this relationship as an association and
not necessarily a causal one, subsequent interpretations of this relation of-
ten had no doubt that it was based on direct causation (e.g., Pritchett and
Summers 1996).

In a more elaborate follow-up study, Preston (1980) introduced liter-
acy and calorie supply in addition to GDP per person into regression models
to explain differences in levels of life expectancy for 36 countries in 1940
and 120 countries in 1970. The estimated coefficients showed similar pat-
terns for both times, and literacy was highly significant. In Preston’s words:
“The coefficients indicate that a 10 percentage point increase in literacy is
associated at both points with a gain in life expectancy of approximately 2



4 EDUCAT ION AND HEALTH

years, and that a 10% gain in national income by itself increases life ex-
pectancy by approximately one-half year” (Preston 1980, p. 306). These
interesting findings, however, were largely overlooked in subsequent re-
search on development and mortality.

This apparent positive association between income and health has
given rise to the widespread view among development economists that in-
creased wealth leads causally to increased health. In the extreme, Pritchett
and Summers (1996) argue that focusing on economic growth in develop-
ing countries will lead directly to reductions in infant mortality rates and
gains in life expectancy. While many other economists hold a less defini-
tive position and acknowledge drivers in addition to income, the possibility
that the apparent empirical association between income and health could
be largely spurious and not of a causal nature has not been considered in
this body of economic literature.

In 2007 an issue of the International Journal of Epidemiologywas devoted
to a reprint of Preston’s 1975 article and several comments by distinguished
scholars in the field (IEA 2007). In the contribution most relevant for our
analysis, Bloom and Canning (2007) revisit the Preston curve and state
that his paper “remains a cornerstone of both global public health policy
and academic discussion of public health. Preston’s paper illuminates two
central ‘stylized facts’. The first is a strong, positive relationship between
national income levels and life expectancy in poorer countries, though
the relationship is non-linear as life expectancy levels in richer countries
are less sensitive to variations in average income. The second is that the
relationship is changing, with life expectancy increasing over time at all
income levels. … Although the basic facts set out by Preston are generally
accepted, there is still a great deal of dispute about the mechanisms that
lie behind the relationships and the policy implications we can draw from
them” (p. 498).

Bloom and Canning also point to another body of literature in pub-
lic health in which, for example, Cutler, Deaton, and Lleras-Muney (2006)
conclude that scientific and technical advances should be seen as “the ul-
timate determinant of health.” A further argument against focusing on in-
come growth as the primary method of reducing the burden of ill health
lies in the apparently very weak temporal association between periods of
economic growth and periods of improvement in population health, sug-
gesting that if the relationship were causal, it has long and variable lags.
While rising incomes imply greater resources for society, these resources
need not necessarily be spent in ways that improve health. While Bloom
and Canning do not question the basic assumption that income growth and
health are closely linked, they add a cautionary sentence that is the starting
point for our study: “Although there is a strong case for the direct effect
of income on health due to nutrition and health interventions becoming
more affordable, it may be that income is also acting as a proxy for a wider



WOLFGANG LUTZ / ENDALE KEBEDE 5

measure of socioeconomic status and development and that the causal effect
is due to other mechanisms, for example, education” (p. 498).

In a more recent assessment of the Preston curve, Mackenbach and
Looman (2013) find that for European countries increases in life expectancy
after 1960 have been accompanied by a much smaller upward shift in the
curve than previously. They attribute this to a changing pattern of causes
of death away from infectious diseases and conclude that “declines in mor-
tality from cardiovascular disease were mainly attributable to increases in
national income.” This conclusion seems to be reached simply by eliminat-
ing medical progress as a dominating reason and assuming that the only
other possible determinant of mortality was income, which thus should be
the cause of this decline. The possibility of another driver that jointly deter-
mines income and health and causes their correlation was not considered.

In this article, we address the hypothesis that the apparent statisti-
cal association between income and health—as described by the Preston
curve—could in fact be a largely spurious association resulting from the fact
that improving educational attainment is a key determinant of both better
health and rising incomes. Before doing so, we discuss the issue of causality.

On causality

The question of the causal nature of the effects of education and income
on health has attracted much attention and controversy. It is a question
that needs to be addressed in order to rule out the possibility that the as-
sociations that are being interpreted could also be spurious. The question
has important policy implications. If, for instance, the empirical association
between income and health is not directly causal but rather due to a third
factor such as education, then an increase in income—e.g., through poli-
cies directly aiming at economic growth—would not result in the expected
health improvements unless educational attainment also improved simul-
taneously. The same is true mutatis mutandis for the association between
educational attainment and health.

Causality in the social sciences has to be viewed differently than in
the natural sciences because human behavior is culturally embedded and
what is found to be direct causation of behavior in a given setting cannot be
assumed to have universal predictive power for all societies and all times.
Inspired by the comprehensive review of causality in demography by Ní
Bhrolcháin and Dyson (2007), Lutz and Skirbekk (2014) introduced the no-
tion of “functional causality” in the context of “intervention sciences” (Lutz
and Striessnig 2015; Pearl 2000). Intervention sciences are the social and
economic sciences that try to understand how the most important forces
of change in a society function in order to predict the future evolution of
the social system. Such conditional predictions about future trends can be



6 EDUCAT ION AND HEALTH

based on the assumption of no intervention or of alternative interventions
and their likely consequences.

To establish functional causality, three criteria have to be met: (i) there
must be strong empirically observed associations between the two factors
studied; (ii) there must be a plausible narrative about the mechanisms
through which one force influences the other; and (iii) other obvious
competing explanations of the observed association should be ruled out.
Examples of such competing explanations are self-selection, reverse causal-
ity, and joint determination by a third force (Lutz and KC 2011; Lutz
and Skirbekk 2014). Lutz and Skirbekk (2014) give a comprehensive
overview of dozens of relevant studies on the topic and conclude that it
is justified to assume functional causality for the global-level relationship
between educational attainment and health/mortality over the twentieth
and twenty-first centuries.

Several global assessments of the relationship between health and
mortality (Baker et al. 2011; KC and Lentzner 2010; Pamuk, Fuchs, and
Lutz 2011) show that, on all continents and at different levels of socio-
economic development, the less-educated segments of the population have
significantly higher mortality and morbidity than those who are better ed-
ucated. In virtually all countries, children of better-educated mothers ex-
perience lower mortality. But since better-educated people also tend to
live in richer households, the question arises: what is more important for
child survival in developing countries, mothers’ education or household in-
come/wealth? This question has been the focus of studies using the largest
available individual-level data set by pooling the samples of Demographic
and Health Surveys (DHS) in 43 developing countries (Fuchs, Pamuk, and
Lutz 2010; Pamuk, Fuchs, and Lutz 2011). Using multi-level regression
models, analysis of the relative effects of mother’s education and economic
resources on infant mortality at the family, community, and country levels
shows that the effect of education clearly dominates over income/wealth
at all levels. The empirical evidence is equally compelling for the effect of
education on adult mortality. In virtually all countries for which data exist,
better-educated people have higher life expectancies (Caselli et al. 2014).
The differences vary in extent among countries and are generally greater
for men than for women. Among industrialized countries, differences tend
to be lowest in Southern European countries and are highest in Eastern
Europe. In Russia, the difference between the highest and lowest education
groups among adult men is up to 12 years (Caselli et al. 2014). It has also
been shown that the overall decline in life expectancy that Russian men ex-
perienced over the 1990s was driven by a strong decline among the lower
education groups whereas the highest groups continued to enjoy moderate
increases (Shkolnikov et al. 2006). In virtually all industrialized countries
for which data are available, the education differentials in adultmortality in-
creased over time despite improving health care coverage in most countries



WOLFGANG LUTZ / ENDALE KEBEDE 7

(Caselli et al. 2014). One explanation for this pattern lies in the increasing
importance of lifestyle-related factors for which education seems to be more
important than the health care system.

There is a plausible narrative of causation that is founded in brain re-
search. It has been demonstrated that literacy and education in general en-
hance the synaptic density in relevant parts of our brains and thus makes
us physiologically different for the rest of our lives (Kandel 2007). It has
also been shown in a controlled experiment among illiterate Indian young
adult men that the sub-sample who was taught how to read and write
had lasting structural changes in their brains after six months of learn-
ing that are associated with executive functioning and cognitive abilities
(Baker, Salinas, and Eslinger 2012; Blair et al. 2005; Brinch and Galloway
2012; Skeide et al. 2017). Neurocognitive and neuroimaging studies have
shown strong associations between adaptive changes in the brain and learn-
ing experiences in the classroom (Lewis et al. 2009; Welberg 2009). These
changes have been shown to be associated with ability for abstract thinking,
time preference, and the capacity to plan for the future (Cutler and Lleras-
Muney 2010; Kenkel 1991; Van der Pol 2011; Heckman, Humphries, and
Veramendi 2017). These cognitive changes and resulting changes in behav-
ior have relevance for health outcomes. In this context, it should also be
stressed that the large number of studies that focus on natural experiments
for the education/health link by looking at changes in compulsory school-
ing by a year do not seem to be a promising route because they do not
refer to a plausible causal pathway. When young people are forced to stay
in school against their will for ten rather than nine years, this is unlikely to
result in a significant change in their overall brain functioning that would
be expected to have direct health effects. But such relevant changes have
been shown for major cognitive transitions such as from illiterate to literate
or from compulsory to post-secondary education (Cutler and Lleras-Muney
2010; Peters et al. 2006; Skeide et al. 2017).

Another concern in the context of assessing functional causality is the
possibility of reverse causality, which is also implicit in the notion of simul-
taneity. This can pose a difficult challenge if there is reason to assume simul-
taneous influences going in both directions. Models of Granger causality can
be used to sort out the temporal sequence of possible effects that can then be
the basis of causal inference based on the principle that the cause needs to
precede the effect. But in the case of education suchmodels are unnecessary
because the temporal sequence can be identified a priori. Schooling tends to
happen early in the life course, and it is only the human capital (education
stock) at adult ages that is expected to have consequences for health-related
behavior. The time lag between when the schooling happens (education
flow) and when the resulting stock of human capital influences health can
be many decades and, when we study the education/health differentials for
people above age 70, even half a century. Hence, once a proper distinction is



8 EDUCAT ION AND HEALTH

FIGURE 2 Triangular interactions between education flows and stocks,
health, and income

made between education flow and educational attainment, there is no way
in which period conditions at time t (including income, medical inventions,
etc.) can influence the schooling that occurred decades before.

With respect to the possibility that the empirical association is caused
by a third factor, different pathways of causation need to be distinguished.
Figure 2 shows the possible interactions between education, health, and in-
come in the form of a triangle with education and health at the base and
income at the top. The cognitive skills associated with adult educational
attainment and a person’s health status are closely interwoven and both
embodied in individuals. A certain minimum level of physical health is nec-
essary for a child to develop mentally and to be able to attend school. Partic-
ularly in developing countries, school absenteeism due to poor health of the
children themselves or of family members for whom they must care or for
whose lost economic output they must compensate is a serious handicap for
improving levels of education and, consequently, the building of key cog-
nitive skills and raising learning outcomes. Similarly, children often bring
home from school knowledge, attitudes, and access to information relevant
to the health and even survival of themselves and their family members.

Better health and longer lives are not only closely linked to educa-
tion and cognitive capacity but also in turn directly affect economic growth.
A growing literature shows that health is both a direct source of human
welfare and a driver of income growth (Bloom and Canning 2008). In
particular, three mechanisms have been defined: better health leading to
higher labor productivity, better childhood health leading to better school



WOLFGANG LUTZ / ENDALE KEBEDE 9

attendance and cognitive development, and a longer expected life span lead-
ing to more savings and investment. Empirical studies also find that good
health has a positive, sizable, and statistically significant effect on aggre-
gate output, even controlling for the experience of the work force (Bloom,
Canning, and Sevilla 2003). TheWHO-sponsored report of the Commission
on Macroeconomics and Health (Sachs 2001) also highlighted the impor-
tance of basic health for poverty reduction by showing how the burden of
diseases in some low-income countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa,
is a barrier to economic growth and therefore should be addressed in any
comprehensive development strategy.

Finally, the effect of improving educational attainment and quality of
education has long been a part of economic growth theory. Past empirical
efforts to demonstrate this effect on the basis of aggregate time series have
been hampered by the lack of appropriate data on educational attainment
(de la Fuente and Doménech 2006). More recent assessments based on full
educational attainment distributions by age cohorts demonstrate the consis-
tently positive and significant effect of human capital on economic growth
(Crespo Cuaresma, Lutz, and Sanderson 2014; Lutz, Crespo Cuaresma, and
Sanderson 2008). The same has been shown with respect to quality of ed-
ucation for countries where such data exist (Hanushek and Woessmann
2008).

Updating the global empirical analysis
for 1970–2010

To explore the association between educational attainment, income, and
mortality across time and space, we employ a balanced panel of 174 coun-
tries (both developed and developing) over the period 1970–2010 in five-
year intervals. Following the logic of Preston’s 1975 and 1980 papers, we
first present graphical presentations of the bi-variate relationship between
GDP per person and life expectancy, followed by multivariate statistical
analyses. We also study the pattern with respect to child mortality. While
the dichotomous variable of literacy was the only one available to Preston,
we use mean years of schooling of the adult population aged 15 and older
in the case of life expectancy and of women aged 20–39 in the case of child
mortality.

Data

Data were obtained mainly from two sources. Country-level indicators of
educational attainment for the years 1970–2015 were extracted from the
Wittgenstein Centre Data Explorer (WIC 2015). Panel data on income and
mortality were obtained from the World Development Indicators (World
Bank 2017). Merging the two datasets gave us our panel of data with



10 EDUCAT ION AND HEALTH

only a few missing data for some countries in earlier years. Following
Preston’s original design, income is measured as GDP per person (2010 con-
stant USD). For themultivariate analysis, we also performed sensitivity runs
where PPP (purchasing power parity) per person was used instead of con-
stant 2010 USD.

Descriptive analysis

Figure 3 presents a visual analysis of the cross-country associations be-
tween income, educational attainment, and life expectancy for the years
1970, 1990, and 2010, similar to the way in which Preston (1975) plot-
ted life expectancy against GDP per person for the 1930s and 1960s. In
Panel A, the plot of life expectancy at birth against GDP per person for 1970,
1990, and 2010 closely resembles the pattern of the original Preston curve
(Figure 1). The curve clearly continues to move upward over time. This,
according to Preston, is due to the factors other than income that he as-
sumed to be mostly related to medical progress and health care. Panel B
of the figure shows an isomorphic curve with the only difference that GDP
per person is replaced by mean years of schooling of the adult population
(MYS15+). The resulting pattern, however, differs considerably in that ris-
ing educational attainment seems to explain rising life expectancy much
better than GDP per person. The association looks much more linear with-
out a leveling off at higher levels, and there is very little upward shift that
would indicate an unexplained gap that needs to be explained by medical
progress.

Figure 4 shows the corresponding pair of curves in which life ex-
pectancy is replaced by child mortality (aged 0–4) in order to see whether
the previous pattern also holds for this mortality rate, which is often more
easily influenced by targeted health interventions than is overall life ex-
pectancy. Here, mean years of schooling of women aged 20–39 is used as
the education indicator. In Panel A, the plot of child mortality against GDP
per person shows essentially the same pattern as for life expectancy vs GDP
per person in Panel A of Figure 3. Panel B of the figure reveals that the rela-
tionship looksmuchmore linear for education than for GDP per person; and
for 1970–1990 there is no shift in the curves, with changes in mothers’ edu-
cation evidently explaining declining child mortality much better than GDP
per person. For 1990–2010, however, there is an interesting deviation from
this general pattern, as child mortality in the high-mortality/low-education
countries declines more rapidly than would be expected from the gains in
mothers’ education over the same period. Evidently, this is the consequence
of the massive international child health interventions in those countries
over the past two decades. This shows that, at least with respect to child
mortality, concerted public health efforts can lower mortality more than
social development alone would predict.

Multivariate analysis

Multivariate statistical analyses were conducted to explore the relative ef-
fects of education and income in explaining changing global mortality pat-
terns. After conducting a Hausman test to choose between fixed-effect and
random-effect specification for country-level unobserved effects, the pre-
ferred fixed-effect model was fitted and specified as follows:

Mit = Ui + β1Educationit + β2GDP per personit + α(t ) + εit (1)

α(t ) = α1 year1970 + α2year1975 + α3year1980 + · · · + α9year2010 + α10 (2)
where Mit is the mortality indicator (life expectancy at birth and child mor-
tality) for country i at time t, Ui represent unobservable individual (coun-
try) heterogeneities, Educationit is the education indicator (mean years of
schooling for age 15+) for country i at time t, GDP per personit is GDP per
person (at constant 2010 USD) for country i at time t; and α(t ) controls for
the year fixed-effect and is specified as a binary variable for each year of
observation.

A number of different models were estimated and, in addition to the
main models shown in Tables 1 and 2, sensitivity analysis was performed as
described below. For the sake of comparison, all variables were standardized
(Z-scores were calculated) before we fit models. The coefficients are thus
interpreted, within a given country, as the gain in health (in standard de-
viation) for a standard deviation change in the independent variable. First,
we estimated a country fixed-effect panel model by including each explana-
tory variable separately: the unadjusted effect of each predictor is estimated
and shown in column (1). Second, we estimated a model with both edu-
cation and income indicators as shown in column (2). Finally, column (3)

gives the full model with income, education, and both country and period
fixed-effects.

The results for life expectancy given in Table 1 show high and signifi-
cant unadjusted parameters for both income and education after controlling
for country fixed-effects, with the standardized education coefficient being
somewhat higher. The picture changes substantially when income and ed-
ucation are entered in the same model, with the education coefficient be-
coming almost three times as large as the one for income. In the full model,
which includes time fixed-effects, income becomes insignificant while the
education effect remains robust and highly significant.

The results with respect to infant mortality shown in Table 2 are quite
similar to those for life expectancy. The difference is that income is already
insignificant in the mutually adjusted model in column (2), and the coeffi-
cients for women’s education (for ages 20–39) in that model and in the full
model in column (3) are much higher than the comparable ones in Table
1 for overall mean years of schooling. Sensitivity runs using PPP income
instead of constant USD (as in the original Preston paper) only marginally
improved the coefficients for income, while the education effects remained
robust and highly significant. In addition to the population-weighted regres-
sions shown here, we also ran themodel giving every country equal weight.
Since our dependent variables here—life expectancy and child mortality—
reflect the averages of individual experiences and health-related behaviors,
the independent agents whose experience we are studying are individuals
rather than countries, which makes population weighting more appropri-
ate. In either case, the results of the unweighted regressions are qualita-
tively very similar, with the education coefficients slightly lower but still
highly significant.



WOLFGANG LUTZ / ENDALE KEBEDE 15

These multivariate results strongly confirm what the visual analysis
above suggested: raising educational attainment is a much more important
driver of increasing life expectancy and falling child mortality than income.
As we discussed in the introduction, this finding should have significant im-
plications for prioritizing policies aimed at improving health and longevity.
Under a global perspective over the last half century, increasing educational
attainment clearly has been the key factor in improving health, rather than
increasing income as has frequently been claimed.

Summary and conclusions

We revisited the influential 1975 paper by Preston on the relationship be-
tween income and life expectancy across most countries of the world for
the 1930s and 1960s and extended the analysis to the period 1970–2015.
We demonstrated that the distinct pattern identified by Preston, show-
ing a strongly concave relationship and an upward shift of the curves,
continued over the subsequent half century as assessed at the global
level.

We then plotted the same kind of relationship replacing GDP per per-
son with the mean years of schooling of the adult population to see whether
educational attainment could be a better predictor of life expectancy than
income. The associations turn out to be very different, with the curves
becoming largely linear and overlapping. This suggests that educational
attainment is a better predictor in the sense that its effect on life ex-
pectancy does not diminish at higher levels and, in particular, it does not
leave an unexplained shift over time that has to be explained by other
factors.

To validate this visual analysis, we conducted multivariate analyses on
a balanced panel of 174 countries for 1970–2015, which in addition to GDP
per person and mean years of schooling of the adult population included
country and period fixed-effects, and we performed sensitivity runs with
alternative income indicators and weighting schemes. In all of the models
the effect of educational attainment on life expectancy is highly significant
in the expected direction, and the standardized coefficients are clearly larger
than those of income.

To consider the possibility of a different pattern for the determinants
of child mortality, we carried out the analysis separately for under-5 mor-
tality. Again, for the association with GDP per person there was strong non-
linearity and a shift of the curve over time that was particularly pronounced
between 1970 and 1990. Viewed in relation to mean years of schooling
of women aged 20–39, the relationship again was much more linear with
virtually no shift between 1970 and 1990. Between 1990 and 2010 child
mortality in the highest-mortality countries declinedmore rapidly than sug-
gested by the gains in mothers’ education. This is an indication that massive



16 EDUCAT ION AND HEALTH

efforts by the international community and private donors in recent years to
lower child mortality in some of the least developed countries were success-
ful in doing so to a greater extent than would be expected from improving
educational attainment alone. This was not equally the case with respect to
adult mortality.

Where does this empirical evidence leave us with respect to testing the
hypothesis that the empirical association between GDP and life expectancy
depicted by the Preston curve and widely assumed in the literature is a spu-
rious one, with education in fact driving both changes? The macro-level
evidence presented here strongly supports the view that this is a plausible
hypothesis that deserves further elaboration. In our section on causality,
we also assessed the different specified criteria for functional causality, in-
cluding a strong empirical association, a valid narrative of the causal mecha-
nism, and ruling out alternative explanations such as selectivity and reverse
causality. This strong aggregate-level finding should be further explored at
the individual and community level under different cultural, social, and
economic conditions.

Studies at the micro level are more easily conducted for child mortality
than for adult mortality since the information can be provided in surveys by
mothers. Multi-level analyses of the determinants of child mortality across a
large number of developing countries have shown that mothers’ education
at every level of attainment was more important than wealth/income, was
the dominating factor at the household and community level, and played
a key role at the national level (Pamuk, Fuchs, and Lutz 2011). A compa-
rable individual-level study for adult mortality is much more difficult be-
cause there are no consistent data on adult deaths by education, income,
and other relevant characteristics. Even in most industrialized countries
with efficient vital registration systems, such micro-level analysis will be
difficult unless a comprehensive population register exists. With some ex-
tra effort, census data that have information on these characteristics can
be linked with information about subsequent deaths. Where such match-
ing studies have been conducted, they all show significant mortality dif-
ferentials by level of education (Caselli et al. 2014). But such studies often
lack the income information for comparative analysis. For developing coun-
tries, the data challenges are much greater and—possibly except for the
cases of demographic surveillance systems—probably insurmountable at
present.

The global time series analysis of national data strongly suggests that
the apparent positive association between health and income can largely
be attributed to increasing educational attainment, which at the same time
leads to rising incomes (Lutz, Crespo Cuaresma, and Sanderson 2008) and
better health outcomes. While additional individual-level analysis of this
issue is needed, the patterns presented here suggest that education should
be considered a policy priority for improving global health.
