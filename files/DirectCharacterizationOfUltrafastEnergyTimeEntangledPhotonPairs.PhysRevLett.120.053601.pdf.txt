Energy-time entangled photons are critical in many quantum optical phenomena and have emerged as
important elements in quantum information protocols. Entanglement in this degree of freedom often
manifests itself on ultrafast time scales, making it very difficult to detect, whether one employs direct or
interferometric techniques, as photon-counting detectors have insufficient time resolution. Here, we
implement ultrafast photon counters based on nonlinear interactions and strong femtosecond laser pulses to
probe energy-time entanglement in this important regime. Using this technique and single-photon
spectrometers, we characterize all the spectral and temporal correlations of two entangled photons with
femtosecond resolution. This enables the witnessing of energy-time entanglement using uncertainty
relations and the direct observation of nonlocal dispersion cancellation on ultrafast time scales. These
techniques are essential to understand and control the energy-time degree of freedom of light for ultrafast
quantum optics.

The energy-time degree of freedom of nonclassical light
is of great interest for quantum information, as it supports
various encodings, including frequency bins [1], time bins
[2], and broadband temporal modes [3], and is intrinsically
robust for propagation through long-distance fiber links [4].
Applications which harness quantum correlations in this
degree of freedom, referred to as energy-time entanglement
[5], include dispersion cancellation [6,7], high-dimensional
quantum key distribution [8,9], and quantum-enhanced
clock synchronization [10]. In ultrafast optics and atto-
second physics, the ability to measure both frequency and
temporal features has led to important innovations in
electric field reconstruction techniques [11,12] and pulse
characterization on very short time scales, enabling
advances in spectroscopy [13], laser physics [14], nonlinear
optics [15], and imaging [16]. In order to characterize and
control energy-time entangled photons and advance bipho-
ton pulse shaping, similar measurement capabilities are
essential in the quantum regime.
Experimental signatures of entanglement can arise in

correlation measurements of complementary variables [17],
or through nonlocal quantum effects [5,6]. With the energy-
time degree of freedom, one complementary set consists of
measuring the intensity correlations as a function of the
photon frequencies and as a function of their time of arrival.
These have been individually realized for different photonic
systems with measurements in frequency [18,19] or in time
[20–22]. Certifying the presence of entanglement with
direct measurements requires both spectral and temporal
correlations, since acquiring only one remains insufficient
to uniquely specify the other due to the ambiguity of the

spectral phase. Depending on the platform, this can be
challenging. Narrow-band photons from atomic systems
can be readily measured in time but are difficult to
spectrally resolve [22]. THz-bandwidth photons produced
in spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) are
often characterized spectrally, but they can have features
on femtosecond time scales below current detector reso-
lution [23].
Other techniques can be employed to infer the presence

of energy-time entanglement. High-order interference
effects with Franson interferometers have been used to
illustrate entanglement between two [24] and three photons
[25]. Nonlocal dispersion cancellation [6], whereby the
temporal spread in coincidences remains unchanged when
equal and opposite dispersion is applied to each photon, can
also be used to witness entanglement [26,27]. For either
method to be effective, the detector resolution must be
shorter than the time scales of the correlations. Strong
energy-time entanglement can nonetheless exist when the
time scales of the correlations are shorter. Certain obser-
vations have pointed to nonlocal dispersion cancellation in
this regime, but they either required introducing a very
large amount of dispersion such that temporal resolution
could be achieved with standard detectors [28], or used
sum-frequency generation (SFG) between the photon pairs
[29], which, unlike measurements with fast and indepen-
dent detectors, has a close classical analogue [30]. Directly
measuring ultrafast quantum effects requires new methods
to control and analyze single photons in the time domain.
In nonlinear optics and laser physics, optical gating is

widely used to overcome limitations with detectors which

are too slow to observe features on subpicosecond time
scales. The gating is achieved by combining the signal with
a short gate pulse in a nonlinear medium and measuring the
up-conversion signal on the detector. With fast gates and
slow detectors, an effective fast detector can be engineered
to temporally resolve single photons [31,32] and photon
pairs [20]. In this Letter, we develop fast optical gating to
achieve subpicosecond timing resolution for spatially
separated pairs of single photons. We use this technique
in conjunction with single-photon spectrometers to explic-
itly measure both the spectral and temporal correlations of
broadband photons, as well as the cross-correlations
between the frequency of one photon and the time of
arrival of the other. Furthermore, by controlling the
dispersion of each photon, our high-resolution joint tem-
poral measurements make it possible to directly observe
nonlocal dispersion cancellation on femtosecond time
scales.
Through spectral and temporal measurements, energy-

time entanglement can be witnessed by violating uncer-
tainty relations [33,34]. Two separable photons or classical
pulses must satisfy the following inequality [17,21]:

Δðωs þ ωiÞΔðts − tiÞ ≥ 1; ð1Þ

where each photon, labeled signal, and idler is described by
its frequencyω and its time of arrival t, andΔ represents the
standard deviation in the joint spectrum or joint temporal
intensity. In other words, there is a nontrivial limit to the
strength of the product of correlations between the sum of
the frequencies and the difference in time of arrival if the
photons are separable. However, this is not the case for
energy-time entangled photons, where the right side of

Eq. (1) can approach zero. Thus, the uncertainty relation is
an entanglement witness.
Two-photon states produced via SPDC are usually

energy-time entangled. In down-conversion, energy con-
servation tends to lead to entangled states with frequency
anticorrelations, although dispersion engineered SPDC
sources have been explored to produce photon pairs with
uncorrelated [35,36] or even positively correlated frequen-
cies [37–41]. For a pure state with no spectral phase, strong
frequency correlations imply strong correlations in the time
of arrival of the photons. Under these conditions, Eq. (1)
can be violated, provided one has sufficient resolution in
the measurements.
Our experimental setup is shown in Fig. 1. The laser

output at 775 nm is frequency-doubled to 387.5 nm in
2 mm of bismuth-borate (BiBO). The resulting pump light
is spectrally narrowed using a 0.085 nm ð1= ffiffiffiep Þ bandpass
filter. Signal and idler photon pairs are created through
type-I SPDC of the pump in 5 mm of BiBO with central
wavelengths of 729 nm and 827 nm, respectively. The
bandwidths are controlled using tunable spectral edge
filters, after which the photons are coupled to single-mode
fibers. The fibers allow for easy switching between spectral
measurement, temporal measurement, and direct detection.
The dispersion of the fiber links is then compensated with
grating-based pulse compressors. Spectral measurements
are performed with grating-based scanning monochroma-
tors with a resolution of about 0.1 nm. Temporal measure-
ments are performed through sum-frequency generation in
1 mm of type-I BiBO with a strong gate laser pulse with an
intensity temporal width of 120 fs (1=

FIG. 1. Experimental setup. (a) Frequency-entangled photons are created through spontaneous parametric down-conversion of an
ultrafast pulse from a frequency-doubled Ti:sapphire laser. Measurements of either the frequency or the time of arrival of each photon
can be performed in coincidence. (b) Spectral measurements are made with dual single-photon monochromators. Temporal
measurements are performed using optically gated single-photon detection. The gating is implemented via noncollinear sum-frequency
generation between a strong gate pulse from the Ti:Sapph laser and the signal or idler. The dispersion of the signal and idler photons is
controlled with a combination of single-mode fibers and grating compressors before the up-conversion. The up-converted signal is
filtered with bandpass filters which remove the background second harmonic generation from the gate pulse. Temporal and frequency
measurements are performed in coincidence to observe the spectral and temporal features of the photons.

spectral bandpass filters which remove the second har-
monic background of the gate pulse. Detection events for
the signal and idler are measured in coincidence after they
have passed through either both spectrometers, both tem-
poral gates, or one of each. The corresponding measured
joint spectrum, joint temporal intensity, and time-frequency
plots, which measure the frequency of one photon in
coincidence with the arrival time of the other, are shown
in Fig. 2. Background subtraction has not been employed in
the data [42].
The SFG employed in the temporal measurements can

approach unit efficiency when the temporal duration of the
photon is approximately the same length in time or shorter
than the gate pulse [45]. However, in the present experi-
ment, the photons are much longer than the gate, and
consequently, we estimate a maximum up-conversion
efficiency of approximately 30% [46]. The absolute effi-
ciency of the temporal measurement apparatus at the

cross-correlation peak, including fiber coupling, chirp
compensation, and up-conversion, is found to be approx-
imately 2% of this maximum.
For each joint measurement of Fig. 2, the marginal width

is obtained by fitting the marginals to a one-dimensional
Gaussian, while the heralded width is obtained by taking
the average of several slices of the data when the frequency
or time of one photon is fixed. The statistical correlation, ρ,
is obtained by finding the value that best fits a two-
dimensional Gaussian with the measured marginals.
Since the finite resolution of both spectral and temporal
measurements are of the same order of magnitude as the
spectral and temporal distributions, the measured features
will be broadened. To account for this, the fit parameters are
deconvolved assuming a Gaussian response function [41],
and these values for the joint spectrum and joint temporal
distribution of Figs. 2(a) and 2(d) are presented in Table I.
The measured joint spectrum shown in Fig. 2(a)

exhibits strong anticorrelation (−0.9951� 0.0001) in
the signal and idler frequencies, while the joint temporal
intensity of Fig. 2(d) shows strong positive correlations
(0.987� 0.004) in the arrival times of the photons. We
can witness the effect of the spectral phase in Figs. 2(b)
and 2(c), which show weak correlations between the
frequency of one photon and the time of arrival of the
other. Low correlations in the time-frequency plots may
indicate little uncompensated dispersion in the experiment
(see Supplemental Material [42]).
The spectral and timing correlations are further analyzed

by binning the data presented in Figs. 2(a) and 2(d) into
histograms based on ω1 þ ω2 and ts − ti, as well as ωs − ωi
and ts þ ti for comparison, as shown in Fig. 3. The bin
size was selected to match the step size of the measu-
rement apparatus. Gaussian fits to the histograms
give a joint uncertainty product Δðωs þωiÞΔðts − tiÞ ¼
ð1.429� 0.006 ps−1Þð0.203� 0.005 psÞ ¼ 0.290� 0.007,
which violates the inequality of Eq. (1) by about 100

standard deviations. Error bars are obtained via
Monte Carlo simulations assuming Poissonian noise.
When deconvolved, we find ΔðωsþωiÞΔðts− tiÞ¼
ð1.329�0.007 ps−1Þð0.110�0.010 psÞ¼0.15�0.01. The
measured uncertainty products thus provide a clear witness
of energy-time entanglement on ultrafast time scales.
We now turn to the problem of measuring the impact of

dispersion on our energy-time entangled state. We directly
observe the effect of applied dispersion on the temporal
correlations, as presented in the joint temporal intensities of
Fig. 4. We control the spectral phase of the photons,
ϕðωs;ωiÞ ≈ Asðωs − ωs0Þ2 þ Aiðωi − ωi0Þ2, with two gra-
ting compressors, where the chirp parameters As and Ai are
for the signal and idler fields, respectively. We estimate the
magnitude of the applied dispersion from the geometry of
the compressor and the relative position of the gratings
[47], and measure the standard deviation Δðts − tiÞ of a
Gaussian fit from histograms of ts − ti.
Starting from the case with no dispersion [Fig. 4(a)], we

apply positive dispersion As ¼ ð0.0373� 0.0015Þ ps2 to
only the signal [Fig. 4(b)] and negative dispersion Ai ¼
−ð0.0359� 0.0014Þ ps2 to only the idler [Fig. 4(c)]. In
these two cases, we observe a large increase in the timing
uncertainty Δðts − tiÞ and a vertical or horizontal shear of
the joint-temporal intensity along the corresponding axis.
We then apply the same amount of positive and negative
dispersion to the signal and idler as before [Fig. 4(d)],
where the dispersion applied to the idler is set to minimize
the timing uncertainty between the two photons. Here, the
timing uncertainty in arrival time Δðts − tiÞ is almost

unchanged. This is the signature of nonlocal dispersion
cancellation, limited by the finite correlations of the initial
two-photon state (see Supplemental Material [42]). The
temporal marginals in Fig. 4(d) still increase, since each
side remains exposed to a significant amount of dispersion.
For classical pulses, the effect of dispersion on

the correlations in arrival times can be expressed as an in-
equality [26], Δðts − tiÞ2F ≥ Δðts − tiÞ20 þ 4A2=Δðts − tiÞ20,
whereΔðts − tiÞ0 is the initial difference in detection times,
and Δðts − tiÞF is the final difference with equal and
opposite dispersion A applied on each side. Under the
assumption that the initial state is unchirped, taking the
measured initial value from Fig. 4(a), Δðts − tiÞ0 ¼
0.235 ps (0.162 ps when corrected for the gate resolution),
and using the average magnitude of the applied dispersion
A ¼ 0.0366 ps2, we calculate that the standard deviation in

compared to (c) with Δðts þ tiÞ ¼ 1.066� 0.016 ps
(1.052� 0.016 ps), corresponding to strong correlations in the

arrival times for classical pulses has to be at least Δðts −
tiÞF ≥ 0.390 ps (0.480 ps). However, the measured uncer-
tainty observed in Fig. 4(d),Δðts− tiÞ¼ð0.245�0.004Þ ps,
remains significantly smaller. The experimental apparatus
thus provides a direct way to detect this inherently quantum
effect in a regime inaccessible to current detectors.
We have directly measured both the temporal and

frequency correlations of an ultrafast biphoton pulse.
Optical gating employed here was critical for realizing
ultrafast coincidence detection and correspondingly high-
resolution temporal measurements. We observe energy-
time entanglement via a joint time-bandwidth inequality
and demonstrate ultrafast nonlocal dispersion cancellation
of the biphotons with direct and independent detection.
This work can be extended to quantum interference
measurements on ultrafast time scales, and can be com-
bined with temporal imaging to greatly increase the
versatility of energy-time entangled photons for quantum
information applications.
