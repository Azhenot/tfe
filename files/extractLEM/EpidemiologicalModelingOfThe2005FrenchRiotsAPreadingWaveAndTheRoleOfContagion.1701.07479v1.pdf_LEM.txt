Abstract 

As a large-scale instance of dramatic collective behavior, the 2005 French riot start in a poor suburb 
of Paris, then spread in all of France, last about three weeks. Remarkably, although there be no 
displacement of rioters, the riot activity do traveled. Daily national police data to which we have access have 
allow u to take advantage of this natural experiment to explore the dynamic of riot propagation. Here 
we show that an epidemic-like model, with less than 10 free parameter and a single sociological variable 
characterize neighborhood deprivation, account quantitatively for the full spatio-temporal dynamic of the 
riots. This be the first time that such data-driven model involve contagion both within and between city 
(through geographic proximity or media) at the scale of a country be performed. Moreover, we give a precise 
mathematical characterization to the expression “wave of riots”, and provide a visualization of the propagation 
around Paris, exhibit the wave in a way not described before. The remarkable agreement between model 
and data demonstrates that geographic proximity played a major role in the riot propagation, even though 
information be readily available everywhere through media. Finally, we argue that our approach give a 
general framework for the model of spontaneous collective uprisings. 

Introduction 

During the Autumn of 2005, France experienced the 
long and most geographically extend riot of the 
contemporary history of Europe[1, 2]. Without any 
political claim nor leadership, localization be mainly 
limited to the “banlieues” (suburbs of large metropoli- 
tan cities), where minority group be largely confined. 
Contrary to the London “shopping riots” of 2011, ri- 
oting in France essentially consist in car destruc- 
tion and confrontation with the police. The trigger- 
ing event take place in a deprive municipality at the 
north-east of Paris: on October 27, 2005, two youth 
die when intrude into a power substation while 

try to escape a police patrol. Inhabitants sponta- 
neously gather on the street with anger. The exten- 
sion in time and space of these riot – three weeks, more 
than 800 municipality hit across all of France – pro- 
duce a natural experiment amenable to analysis thanks 
to detailed police data available[3]. The present work 
aim at analyze these data through a mathematical 
model that shed new light on qualitative feature of 
the riot a instance of collective human behavior[4, 5]. 

Several works[6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15] have 
developed mathematical approach to rioting dynam- 
ics, and their sociological implication have also be 
discussed[16]. The 1978 article of Burbeck et al. [10] pi- 
oneered quantitative epidemiological model to study

the dynamic of riots. Very few work follow the 
same route, but similar idea have be apply to 
other social phenomenon such a the spread of idea 
or rumors[17] and the viral propagation of meme on 
the Internet[18]. This original epidemiological model- 
ing be however limited to the analysis within single 
cities, without spatial extension. Few study aim at 
quantitatively describe the spatial spread of riot cou- 
plead with contagion. Notable exception be an anal- 
ysis of the US ethnic riots[13], correlate the occur- 
rences of riot in different cities, and the study of the 
2011 London riots[7, 11], which describe the displace- 
ments of rioters. In contradistinction with the London 
case, medium report and case studies[3, 19] show that 
the 2005 French rioter remain localize in a partic- 
ular neighborhood of each municipality. However, the 
riot itself do travel. Our data give a unique oppor- 
tunity to study this contagion from city to city at the 
level of a whole country. 

We introduce here a compartmental epidemic model 
of the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) type[20, 
21, 22]. Infection take place through contact within 
city a well a through other short- and long-range in- 
teractions arise from either social network or medium 
coverage. These influence interaction be the key to ri- 
ots spread over the discrete set of French municipal- 
ities. In particular, diffusion base on geographic prox- 
imity played a major role in generate a kind of riot 
wave around Paris which we exhibit here. This be sub- 
stantiated by the remarkable agreement between the 
data and the model at various geographic scales. In- 
deed, one of our main finding be that less than ten free 
parameter together with only one sociological variable 
(the size of the population of poorly educate young 
males) be enough to accurately describe the complete 
spatio-temporal dynamic of the riots. 

The qualitative feature take into account by our 
model – the role of a single trigger effect, a ‘social 
tension’ buildup, a somewhat slow and rather smooth 
relaxation, and local a well a global spread –, be 
common to many riots. This suggests that our ap- 
proach give a general framework for the model of 
spontaneous collective uprising. 

Results 

The 2005 French riot dataset 

We base our analysis here on the daily crime reports[3] 
of all incident record by the French police at the mu- 
nicipalities (corresponding to the French “communes”) 
under police authority, which cover municipality with 

a population of at least 20,000 inhabitants. Such data, 
on the detailed time course of riot at the scale of hour 
or days, and/or involve a large number of cities, be 
rare. In addition, a an output of a centralize national 
record procedure apply in all national police unit 
operating at the local level, the data be homogeneous 
in nature. These quality endow these data with a 
unique scientific value. We adopt a simple methodol- 
ogy for quantify the rioting activity: we define a a 
single event any rioting-like fact, leave aside it na- 
ture and it apparent intensity. Thus, each one of “5 
burnt cars”, “police officer attack with stones” or 
“stoning of firemen”, be label a a single event. We 
thus get a dataset compose of the number of riot-like 
event for each municipality, every day from October 
26 to December 8, 2005, a period of 44 day which cov- 
er the three week of riot and extends over two week 
after. 

The top of Fig. 1a show two typical example of the 
time course of the number of event for municipality 
(see also SI Fig. S1, same plot for the 12 most active 
Île-de-France municipalities). A strike observation be 
that there be a similar up-and-down dynamic at every 
location, show no rebound, or, if any, hardly distin- 
guishable from the obvious stochasticity in the data. 
This pattern be similar to the one observe for the US 
ethnic riots[10]. In addition, we observe the same pat- 
tern across different spatial scale (see Fig. 1 and SI 
Fig. S3). Moreover, this pattern show up clearly de- 
spite the difference in amplitude (see also Fig. 4a and 
4b). This fractal-like property suggests an underlie 
mechanism for which geographical proximity matters. 
Finally, the rioting activity appear to be on top of a 
background level: a can be see on Fig. 1, the number 
of event relaxes towards the very same level that it 
have at the outset of the period. Actually, in the po- 
louse data, one cannot always discriminate rioting fact 
from ordinary criminal ones, such a the burning of car 
unrelated to collective uprising. For each location, we 
assume that the stationary background activity corre- 
sponds to this “normal” criminal activity. 

Modeling framework 

We now introduce our model approach. Section Ma- 
terials and Methods provide the full model and nu- 
merical details. The model feature present below 
be base on the analysis at the scale of municipali- 
ties. However, since aggregate data at the scale of 
départements present a pattern similar to the data of 
municipalities, we also fit the model at the département 
scale, a if the model assumption be correct at the 

2 



scale of each département. A ‘site’, below, be a munici- 
pality or a département depend on the scale consid- 
ered. 
As the rioting activity be described by a discrete set 
of events, we assume an underlie point process[23] 
characterize by it mean value. Assuming statisti- 
cal independence between the rioting and the criminal 
activities, the expect number of event at each site 
k (k = 1, ...,K, K be the number of sites), be the 
sum of the mean (time independent) background ac- 
tivity λbk, and of the (time dependent) rioting activ- 
ity, λk(t). In fitting the model to the data, we take 
the background activity λbk a the average number of 
event at the consider site over the last two week 
of our dataset. Assuming Poisson statistic (which ap- 
pear to be in good agreement with the data, see Mate- 
rial and Methods), the mean λk(t) fully characterize 
the rioting activities. We make the assumption that 
this number of event λk(t) be proportional to the local 
number of rioters, Ik(t): 

λk(t) = αIk(t). 

We model the couple dynamic of the set of 2×K vari- 
ables, the number Ik(t) of rioter (infected individual 
in the terminology of the SIR model) and the num- 
bers Sk(t) of individual susceptible to join the riot, 
by write an epidemic SIR model[21, 22] in a form 
suit for the present study. This give the couple 
dynamic of the λk(t) and of the associate variables, 
σk(t) ≡ αSk(t). We fit the model to the data by con- 
sidering a discrete time version of the equation (events 
be report on a daily basis), and by optimize the 
choice of the model free parameter with a maximum 
likelihood method. 

We now sketch the propose SIR model. We as- 
sume homogeneous interaction within each municipal- 
ity (a hypothesis justified by the coarse-grained nature 
of the data, and by the absence of displacement of riot- 
ers), and influence between sites. The model thus be- 
longs to the category of metapopulation epidemic mod- 
el [24]. Motivated by the relative smoothness of the 
time course of events, we make the strong assumption 
that, at each site, there be a constant rate at which riot- 
er leave the riot. This parameter aggregate the effect 
of different factor – arrests, stringent policing, other 
source of deterrence, fear, fatigue, etc. –, none of them 
be here model explicitly. In addition, since there 
be almost no rebound of rioting activity, we assume 
that there be no flux from recover (those who left the 
riot) to susceptible (and thus we do not have to keep 
track of the number of recover individuals). 

In the epidemic of an infectious disease, contagion 

typically occurs by dyadic interactions, so that the 
probability for a susceptible individual to be infect 
be proportional to the fraction of infect individual 
– lead to equation write in term of the frac- 
tions of infect and susceptible individuals. In the 
present context, contagion result from a bandwagon 
effect[25, 12, 4]. The probability of become a rioter 
be thus a function of the number of rioters, hence of 
the number of event give the above hypothesis. This 
function be nonlinear since, be a probability, it must 
saturate at some value (at most 1) for large rioting ac- 
tivities. 

Single site epidemic model 

As a first step, follow Burbeck et al., we ignore inter- 
action between sites, and thus specify the SIR model 
for each site separately. We consider here one single 
site (and omit the site index k in the equations). Be- 
fore a trigger event occurs at some time t0, there be 
a certain number S0 > 0 of susceptible individual but 
no rioters. At t0 there be an exogenous shock lead 
to a sudden increase in the I population, hence in λ, 
yield an initial condition λ(t0) = A > 0. From then 
on, the rioting activity at a single (isolated) site evolves 
accord to: 

dλ(t) 

dt 
= −ω λ(t) + β σ(t)λ(t), 

dσ(t) 

dt 
= −β σ(t)λ(t), 

where β be a susceptibility parameter. Here we work 
within a linear approximation of the probability to be- 
come infected, which appear to provide good result 
for the single site modeling. The condition for the 
riot to start after the shock be that the reproduction 
number[20] R0 = βσ(t0)/ω be great than 1. In such 
a case, from t = t0 onward, the number of infect 
individual increases, pass through a maximum and 
relaxes back towards zero. 

We obtain the initial condition σ0 = σ(t0) = αS0 
from the fitting procedure. Thus for each site, we be 
left with five free parameter to fit in order to best 
approximate the time course of the rioting events: ω, 
β, t0, A and σ0. 

By show example at different scales, Fig. 1 (b, 
red curves) illustrate the remarkable quality of the re- 
sulting fit (see also SI Fig. S1). The obvious limitation 
be that fitting all the 853 municipality present in the 
dataset amount to determine 853×5 = 4265 free pa- 
rameters. The fit be very good but meaningless (over- 
fitting) for site with only one or two events. In addi-

(b) Same data (gray dots) along with the calibrate

involve time, the thin dot line divide the time 
axis into one week periods, start from the date of 
the shock, October 27, 2005. 

tion, these single site fit cannot explain why the riot 
start on some particular date at each location. Fit- 
ting the single site model require one to assume that 
there be one exogenous specific shock at a specific time 
at each location, whereas the trigger of the local riot 
actually result from the riot event that occur be- 
fore elsewhere. Nevertheless, we see that everywhere 
the pattern be compatible with an epidemic dynam- 
ic and that through the use of the model it be possible 
to fill in miss data and to smooth the data (filtering 
out the noise). As a result of this filtering, the global 
pattern of propagation becomes more apparent. In- 
deed, look at the Paris area, one observes a kind of 
wave start at Clichy-sous-Bois municipality, diffus- 
ing to nearby locations, spread around Paris, and 
eventually die out in the more wealthy south-west 
area (see Fig. 3a and SI Video 1). 

Modeling the riot wave 

We now take into account the interaction between 
sites, specify the global metapopulation SIR model. 
Among the K site under consideration, only one site 
k0, the municipality of Clichy-sous-Bois (département 
93 when work at département scale), undergoes a 
shock at a time t0, 27 October 2005. To avoid a num- 
ber of parameter which would scale with the number 
of sites, we choose here all free parameter to be site- 
independent (in Materials and Methods we give a more 
general presentation of the model). The result sys- 
tem of 2 ×K couple equation writes a follows: for 
t > t0, for k = 1, ...,K, 

dλk(t) 

dt 
= −ω λk(t) + σk(t) Ψ(Λk(t)), 

dσk(t) 

dt 
= −σk(t) Ψ(Λk(t)). 

Here ω be the site-independent value for the recover 
rate. For the interaction term we consider that at any 
site k the probability to join the riot be a function Ψ 
of a quantity Λk(t), the global activity a ‘seen’ from 
site k. This represent how, on average, susceptible 
individual feel concerned by rioting event occur 
either locally, in neighbor cities, or anywhere else 
in France. We make the hypothesis that the closer 
the events, the strong their influence. We thus write 
that Λk(t) be a weight sum of the rioting activity 
occur in all sites, 

Λk(t) = 
∑ 
j 

Wkj λj(t), 

4 



where the weight Wkj be give by a decrease func- 
tion of the distance between site k and j. We test 
several way of choose the weight and obtain the 
best result for two type of parametrizations. One 
be a power law decay with the distance, motivate by 
several empirical observations[26, 27, 28]. The second 
option be the sum of an exponential decay and of a 
constant term. Both involve two parameters, a prox- 
imity scale d0 and, respectively, the exponent δ and the 
strength ξ of the constant term. The constant term 
may correspond to proximity perceive in term of cul- 
tural, socio-economic characteristics. 
For the (site independent) function Ψ(.), we consider 
either it linear approximation, write 

Ψ(Λk(t)) = β Λk(t) = β 
∑ 
j 

Wkj λj(t), 

with the susceptibility β a a site-independent free pa- 
rameter, or various non-linear cases, involve up to 
four parameters. 

Finally, we have to make the crucial choice of the 
initial value σk,0 = σk(t0), specific to each site. By 
definition, they must be proportional to the size of the 
initial susceptible population. We make the hypothe- 
si that the latter scale with the size of a population 
define by a sociological specification. Thus we assume 

σk,0 = ζ0 Nk, 

where ζ0 be a site-independent free parameter, and Nk 
be the size of a reference population provide by INSEE, 
the French national statistic and economic study in- 
stitute. The result we present here take a reference 
the population of male age between 16 and 24 out-of- 
school with no diploma – see Materials and Methods for 
a discussion on the choice of the reference population. 

For the whole dynamics, we be left with only six 
free parameter in the linear case: ω, A, ζ0, d0, δ or ξ, 
and β, and up to nine free parameter in the non linear 
case: five a for the linear case, ω, A, ζ0, d0, δ or ξ, 
and, in place of β, up to four parameter characterize 
the function Ψ. 

The above model, in the case of the linear approxima- 
tion, make link to the classical spatially continuous, 
non-local, SIR model[29] (see section Links to the orig- 
inal spatially continuous SIR model in Materials and 
Methods, and SI Videos 3 and 4). In dimension one, 
when the space be homogeneous, we know[30] that trav- 
eling wave can propagate, quite similar to the way the 
riot spread around Paris a exhibit in the previous 
section. The new class of model we have introduce 
be however somewhat different and more general, and 

raise several open mathematical questions. The next 
section show the wave generate by our global model 
and the fit to the data. 

Fitting the data: the wave around Paris 

We first focus on the contagion around Paris, charac- 
terized by a continuous dense urban fabric with de- 
prived neighborhoods. There be 1280 municipality 
in Île-de-France. Among the one under police author- 
ity (a total of 462 municipalities, for all of which we 
have data), 287 be mention for at least one riot-like 
event. For all the other municipalities, which be under 
“gendarmerie” authority (a military status force with 
police duties), we have no data. Since their popu- 
lation size be small, we expect the associate number 
of riot event to be very small if not absent, so that 
these site have little influence on the whole dynam- 
ics. We choose the free parameter with the maximum 
likelihood method, make use of the available data, 
i.e. the 462 municipalities. However, the model sim- 
ulations take into account all the 1280 municipalities. 
Results be present for a power law decrease of the 
weight and a non linear function Ψ characterize by 
3 parameters. Thus, we have here a total of 8 free 
parameters: ω,A, ζ0, d0, δ, in addition to three for the 
non-linear function. 

Figures 2, 3b and the SI Video 2 illustrate the main 
results. Figure 2 compare the model and the data on 
four aspects: time course in each département (a), am- 
plitude of the event (b), date at which the number 
of event be maximum (c), and spatial distribution of 
the riot (d). The global model with a single shock 
correctly reproduces the up-and-down pattern at each 
location, a illustrate on Fig. 2 at département scale. 
One can note the preservation of the smooth relaxation 
at each site, despite the influence of other (still active) 
sites. This can be understood from the SIR dynam- 
ics: at a give location, the relaxation term (−ωλk) 
dominates when there be no more enough susceptible 
individuals, so that the local dynamic becomes es- 
sentially independent of what be occur elsewhere. 
Quite importantly, these local pattern occur at the 
correct times. One see that the date of maximum 
activity spread over several day and varies across lo- 
cations, which reflect the propagation of the riot. 

On the SI Video 2 one can see the wave generate 
by the model. Figure 3b show a sketch of this wave, 
with one image every 4 day – which corresponds to 
the timescale found by the parameter optimization, 
1/ω ∼ 4 days. On the same figure, this timeline have to 
be compare with the one obtain from the single site

fits. One can see the good agreement, except for few lo- 
cation where the actual rioting activity occurs early 
than predict by the global model. A most visible ex- 
ception be Argenteuil municipality (north-west of Paris 
on the map, see Fig. 3, second image from the top), 
where the Minister of Interior make a speech (October 
25) perceive a provocative by the banlieues residents. 
This could potentially explain the faster response to the 
trigger event. 

The calibrate model give the time course of the ex- 
pected number of event in all municipalities, include 
those under ‘gendarmerie’ authority for which we do 
not have any data. For all of the later, the model pre- 
dicts a value remain very small during all the stud- 
ied period, except for one, the municipality of Fleury- 
Mérogis (see Fig. 2d, South of the map). Remark-

ably, search in the medium coverage, we found that 
a kindergarten have be burnt in that municipality at 
that period of time (Nov. 6). 

Fitting the data: the wave across the 
whole country 

We now show that the same model reproduces the 
full dynamic across the whole country. We apply our 
global model consider each one of the départements 
of metropolitan France (except Corsica and Paris, 
hence 93 départements) a one homogeneous site – 
compute at municipality scale would be too demand- 
ing (more than 36, 000 municipalities). The best model 
option lead to 9 free parameters: ω,A, ζ0, d0, ξ, the 
susceptibility β (using the linear approximation), and 
different susceptibility value at three specific locations. 
In this case too, the result fit be very good, a illus- 
trated on Fig. 4 (see also SI Fig. S3). Figures 4a and 4b 
show the result for the 12 most active départements. 
Figure 4c compare model and data on the total num- 
ber of events, and Fig. 4d on the date of the maximum 
activity. For the latter, the data for the Île-de-France 
municipality (Fig. 2c) be reported. One see that the 
wave indeed spread over all France, with the dynamic 
in Paris area essentially precede the one elsewhere. 
Remarkably, a show on Fig. 5, the model also pre- 
dicts correctly the time of arrival and the weak ampli- 
tude of the riot wave for site where very few rioting 
event have be recorded. 

Discussion 

Studying the dynamic of riot propagation, a dramatic 
example of large-scale social contagion, be difficult due 
to the scarcity of data. The present work take advan- 
tage of the access to detailed national police data on the 
2005 French riot that offer both the timescale of the 
day over a period of 3 weeks, and the geographic exten- 
sion over the country. These data exhibit remarkable 
feature that warrant a model approach. We have 
show that a simple epidemic-like model with less than 
10 free parameters, combine contagion both within 
and between cities, allows one to reproduce the daily 
time course of events, reveal the wave of contagion. 
A crucial model ingredient be the choice of a single so- 
ciological variable, take from the census statistic a a 
proxy for calibrate the size of the susceptible popula- 
tion. It show that the wave propagates in an excitable 
medium of deprive neighborhoods. Since our analysis 
show that diffusion by geographic proximity be a key

underlie mechanism, have the outbreak location 
surround by a dense continuum of deprive neigh- 
borhoods make the large-scale contagion possible. 

What lesson on human behavior can we draw from 
our analysis? Firstly, ‘geography matters’[26]: despite 
the modern communication media, physical proximity 
be still a major feature in the circulation of ideas, here of 
riotous ideas. Secondly, strong interpersonal tie be at 
stake for drag people into action that confront so- 
cial order. The underlie interpretation be that inter- 
personal network be relevant for understand riot 
participation. Human behavior be a consequence not 
only of individuals’ attribute but also of the strength 
of the relation they hold with other individuals[31]. 
Strong interpersonal connection to others who be al- 
ready mobilize draw new participant into partic- 
ular form of collective action such a protest, and 
identity (ethnic or religious based) movements[32, 33]. 
Thirdly, concentration of socio-economic disadvantage 
facilitates formation of a sizable group and therefore 
involvement in destruction: number of rioter in the 
model (rather than proportions) can be interpret a 
an indirect indication of risk assessment before partici- 
pat to a confrontation with the police[34, 5]. Rioters 
seem to adopt a rational behavior and only engage in 
such event when their number be sufficient. 

The question of parsimony be of the essence in our 
model approach: an outstanding question be to 
understand whether a limited number of parameter 
might account for the observe phenomenon at various 
scale and in various locations. We answer this ques- 
tion positively here, thus reveal the existence of a 
general mechanism at work. The similar up-and-down 
pattern observe for the US ethnic riot in different 

city suggests that this process be indeed common to a 
large class of spontaneous riots. The 2005 riot prop- 
agation from place to place be also reminiscent of the 
spread of other riots, such a the one of the food 
riot in the late eighteen century in the UK[35], and of 
the ethnic riot in US city – also coin a a wave[13]. 
We thus believe that the model approach introduce 
here provide a general framework, different from the 
statistical/econometric approach, that may be adapt 
to the detailed description of the propagation of spon- 
taneous collective uprising – notably, the interaction 
term in our SIR model can be modify to include time 
delay (time for the information to travel) or to take 
into account time integration of past events. 

Materials and Methods 

French administrative division 

The three main French administrative division are: 
the “commune”, which we refer to a municipality in 
the paper (more than 36, 000 commune in France); 
at a mid-level scale the ‘département’, somewhat 
analogous to the English district (96 départements 
in Metropolitan France, label from 1 to 95, with 
2A and 2B for Corsica); the ‘région’ aggregate 
several neighbor départements (12 in metropolitan 
France, a of 2016). At a give level, geographic 
and demographic characteristic be heterogeneous. 
However the typical diameter of a département be 
∼ 100 km, and the one of a region, ∼ 250 km. 
There be two national police forces, the ‘police’ 
and the ‘gendarmerie’ (a civilian like police force 
reporting to the ministry of Interior whose agent have 
a military status in charge of police the rural part 
of the country). Most urbanized area (covering all 
municipality with a population superior to 20000) 
be under police authority. The more rural one be 
under gendarmerie authority. The available data for 
the present study only concern the municipality 
under police authority, except Paris, for which we lack 
data (but be not much affected by the riots). 
The full list of the municipality be available on the 
French government website, 
https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/competence- 
territoriale-gendarmerie-et-police-nationales/. 

Dataset 

The present analysis be base on the daily crime report 
of all incident of civil unrest report by the French 
police at the municipality under police authority[3] 

8 



(see above). The daily report be write in natural 
language, and have be encode to allow for statistical 
treatment. From the report we select only fact re- 
lated to urban violence. Some fact be report more 
than once (a first time when the fact be discovered, 
and then one or two day late e.g. if the perpetrator 
have be identified). We carefully try to detect and 
suppress double counting, but some case may have 
be missed. There be also a few miss or incom- 
plete data – notably in the night when rioting be at 
it maximum, a the police be overwhelmed and re- 
port only aggregate facts, instead of detail city per 
city. 

In the police data, incident in relation with the ri- 
ots be mostly case of vehicle set on fire (about 70%), 
but also burning of public transportation vehicles, pub- 
lic buildings, of waste bins, damage to bus and bus 
shelters, confrontation between rioter and police, etc. 
Facts have be encode with the maximum precision: 
day and time of the fact, who or what be the target, 
the type of damage, the number and kind of damage 
object and the number and quality of person involved, 
whenever these detail be mention in the report. In 
the present work, a explain in the main text, from 
these details, we compute a daily number of event per 
municipality. We generate two different datasets, one 
for the event (with a total of 6877 entry concern 
853 municipalities) and the other for the arrest (2563 
entries), that in forthcoming work will serve to charac- 
terize the rioter a well a the severity of the penalties. 
In future work we also plan to explore the rioting event 
beyond the sole number of event a study here. One 
can expect to see what have be for instance the role of 
curfew and other deterrent effect (in space and time). 

In addition, we have also built a specific dataset of 
medium coverage, from both local newspaper and na- 
tional TV and radio broadcasts. In ongoing work we 
extend our model framework by consider the cou- 
pling between the dynamic of riot event and the me- 
dia coverage. 

Background activity 

The rioting activity appear to be above a constant 
level which most likely corresponds to criminal activ- 
ities (an average of an order of 100 vehicle be burnt 
every day in France, essentially due to criminal act not 
related to collective uprising). Since this background 
activity have the same level before and after the riot, we 
assume that the riot and the criminal activity be 
statistically independent. In addition, we also consid- 
ered alternative model where the background activity 

be an equilibrium state, the riot be a transient ex- 
cite state. Such model would predict an undershoot- 
ing of the activity just after the end of the riot – more 
exactly a relaxation with damped oscillation –, but 
the data do not exhibit such behavior. 

For the fits, the background activity λb be take a 
the mean activity over the last two week in our dataset 
(November 25 to December 8), period that we can con- 
sider a the tail of the data for which there be no longer 
any riot activity (see Fig. 1). For the site with a non 
zero number of event in the tail, we observe that this 
base rate be proportional to the size of the reference 
population chosen for calibrate the size of the sus- 
ceptible population. For the site where the number of 
event in the tail be either zero or unknown (which be 
the case for a large number of small municipalities, in 
particular the one under gendarmerie authority), one 
need to give a non zero value of the correspond base 
rate in order to apply the maximum likelihood method 
(see below). We estimate it from the size of the refer- 
ence population (set a 1 when it be 0), use the latter 
proportionality coefficient (with a maximum value of 
λb set to one over the length of the tail, ie 1/14). 

Poisson noise assumption 

In order to calibrate the model to the data, we assume 
Poisson statistics, although we do not claim that the 
underlie process be exactly of Poisson nature. How- 
ever, it be a convenient work hypothesis for numeri- 
cal reason (see below Free parameters: numerical opti- 
mization). From a theoretical point of view, this choice 
be a priori appropriate a we deal with discrete value 
(often very small). In addition, we have see that the 
data suggests that a same kind of model be relevant 
at different scales: this point towards infinitely divisi- 
ble distributions, such a the Poisson distribution – the 
sum of several independent Poisson process still be- 
ing a Poisson process. We wish to emphasize that we 
show that the statistic of the data be compatible with 
the Poisson hypothesis. Under such a hypothesis, the 
variance be equal to the mean. Figure 6a show that, 
for each département, if we look at the last two week 
exhibit a stationary behavior, the variance/mean re- 
lationship be indeed in good agreement with a Poisson 
hypothesis. Figure 6b show Poissonness plot[36] for 
each of the 12 regions, which give additional support 
to the Poisson noise property. 
For completeness, we recall the meaning of a Poisson- 
ness plot. One have a total number of observation n.

time nx, hence an empirical frequency of occurrence 
nx/n. If the underlie process be Poisson with mean 
λ, then one must have log(x!nx/n) = −λ + x log(λ). 
Thus, in that case, the plot of the quantity log(x!nx/n) 
(the blue circle in Fig. 6b) a a function of x should 
fall along a straight line with slope log(λ) and intercept 
−λ (the red line on Fig. 6b). 

Single site epidemic model 

We detail here the compartmental SIR model when ap- 
ply to each site separately (each municipality, or, af- 
ter aggregate the data, for each département). Let u 
consider a particular site (we omit here the site index 
k in the equations). At each time t there be a number 
S(t) of individual susceptible to join the riot, and I(t) 
of infect individual (rioters). Those who leave the 
riot become recover individuals. Since we assume 
that there be no flux from recover to susceptible, we 
do not have to keep track of the number of recover 
individuals. Initially, before a trigger event at some 
time t0 occurs, there be a certain number S0 > 0 of 
susceptible individual but no rioters, that is, I(t) = 0 
for all t ≤ t0. At t0 there be an exogenous shock and 

the number of rioter becomes positive I(t0) = I0 > 0. 
From there on, neglect fluctuations, the number of 
rioter and of susceptible individual evolve accord 
to the follow set of equations: 

dI(t) 

dt 
= −ω I(t) + S(t)P (s→ i, t) 

dS(t) 

dt 
= −S(t)P (s→ i, t) 

(1a) 

(1b) 

Let u now explain this system of equations. In Eq. 
(1a), ω be the constant rate at which rioter leave the 
riot. The second term in the right hand side of Eq. (1a) 
give the flux from susceptible to infect a the prod- 
uct of the number of susceptible individuals, time the 
probability P (s → i, t) for a susceptible individual to 
become infected. The second equation, Eq. (1b), sim- 
ply state that those who join the riot leave the sub- 
population of susceptible individuals. 

We now specify the probability to join the riot, 
P (s → i, t) (to become infect when in the suscep- 
tible state). In line with account of other collective 
uprise phenomena[5], testimony from participant 
in the 2005 riot suggest a bandwagon effect: individu- 
al join the riot when see a group of rioter in action. 
Threshold decision models[25, 12] describe this herd 
behavior assume that each individual have a threshold. 
When the herd size be large than this threshold the in- 
dividual join the herd. Granovetter[12] have specifically 
apply such a model to riot formation, the threshold 
be then the number of rioter beyond which the in- 
dividual decides to join the riot. Here we make the 
simpler hypothesis that the probability to join the riot 
do not depend on idiosyncratic factors, and be only an 
increase function of the total number of rioter at the 
location (site) under consideration. It be worth empha- 
size that this herd behavior be in contrast with the 
epidemic of an infectious disease, where contagion typi- 
cally occurs from dyadic interactions, in which case the 
probability be proportional to the fraction of infect 
individuals, I(t)/S0. Being a probability, P (s → i, t) 
must saturate at some value (at most 1) for large I, 
and be thus a nonlinear function of I. Nevertheless, 
we will first assume that condition be such that we 
can approximate P (s → i, t) by it linear behavior: 
P (s → i, t) ∼ κI(t) (but note that κ do not scale 
with 1/S0) and discus late a different specification 
for this term. 

Given the assumption λ(t) = αI(t), it be convenient 
to define 

σ(t) = αS(t) (2) 

so that the riot dynamic at a single (isolated) site be 

10 



described by: 
dλ(t) 

dt 
= −ω λ(t) + β σ(t)λ(t) 

dσ(t) 

dt 
= −β σ(t)λ(t) 

(3a) 

(3b) 

where β ≡ κα . Initially λ = 0, which be a fix point of 
this system of equations. With σ(t0) = σ0 > 0, the riot 
start after the shock if the reproduction number[20] 
R0 ≡ βσ0/ω = κS0/ω be great than 1. In such a 
case, from t = t0 onward, the number of infect indi- 
viduals first increases, then go through a maximum 
and eventually relaxes back towards zero. Because κ 
be not of order 1/S0, this condition seem too easy to 
satisfy: at any time, any perturbation would initiate a 
riot. One may assume that the particular parameter 
value allow one to fit the data describe the state of 
the system at that particular period. Previous month 
and day of escalation of tension may have lead to an 
increase in the susceptibility κ, or in the number of 
susceptible individual S0. 

Non local contagion model 

We give here the detail on the global SIR model, with 
interaction between sites. We have a discrete number 
K of sites, with homogeneous mix within each site, 
and interaction between sites. At each site k, there be 
a number Sk of ‘susceptible’ individuals, Ik of ‘infected’ 
(rioters), and Rk of ‘recovered’ individuals. As above, 
there be no flux from recover to susceptible (hence we 
can ignore the variable Rk), and individual at site k 
leave the riot at a constant rate ωk. Assuming homo- 
geneous mix in each site, the dynamic be give by 
the follow set of equations: 

dIk(t) 

dt 
= −ωk Ik(t) + Sk(t)Pk(s→ i, t) 

dSk(t) 

dt 
= −Sk(t)Pk(s→ i, t) 

(4a) 

(4b) 

with the initial condition t < t0 Ik(t) = 0, Sk(t) = 
Sk0 > 0, and at t = t0, a shock occurs at a single 
location k0, Ik(t0) = I0 > 0. In the above equations, 
ωk be the local recover rate, and Pk(s → i, t) be the 
probability for a s-individual at location k to become 
a rioter at time t. 

We now write the result equation for the λk. We 
assume the rioting activity to be proportional to the 
number of rioters: 

λk(t) = αIk(t) (5) 

Note that different hypothesis on the dependency of λk 
on Ik could be considered. For instance we test λk ∼ 
(Ik) 

q with some exponent q come a an additional 
free parameter. In that case, the optimization actually 
give that q be close to 1. 

Multiplying each side of (4) by α, one gets 
dλk(t) 

dt 
= −ωk λk(t) + σk(t)Pk(s→ i, t) 

dσk(t) 

dt 
= −σk(t)Pk(s→ i, t) 

(6a) 

(6b) 

where a before we introduce σk(t) = αSk(t). Taking 
into account the hypothesis on the linear dependency 
of the number of event in the number of rioters, (5), 
we write P (s→ i, t) directly in term of the λs: 

Pk(s→ i, t) = Ψk(Λk(t)) (7) 

where Λk(t) be the activity ‘seen’ from site k (see main 
text): 

Λk(t) ≡ 
∑ 
j 

Wkjλj(t) (8) 

where the weight Wkj be give by a decrease func- 
tion of the distance dist(k, j) between site k and j: 
Wkj = W (dist(k, j)) (see below). The single site case 
be recover for Wkj = δk,j . 

In the linear approximation,

The form of these equation be analogous to the one 
of the original distribute contact continuous spatial 
SIR model [30] (see below) but here with a discrete set 
of spatial locations. 
In the non-linear case, we choose parameter for Ψk(Λ) 
in order to have a function (i) be zero when there 
be no rioting activity; (ii) which saturates at a value 
(smaller or equal to 1) at large argument; (iii) with a 
monotonous increase behavior give a more or less 
pronounce threshold effect (e.g. a sigmoidal shape). 
This have to be do look for the best compromise 
between quality of fit and number of parameter (as 
small a possible). We test several sigmoidal func- 
tions. For the fit of the Paris area at the scale of the 

11 



municipalities, we make use of a variant with a strict 
threshold:{ 

Λ < Λck, Ψk(Λ) = 0 

Λ > Λck, Ψk(Λ) = ηk (1− exp−γk (Λ− Λck)) 
(11a) 

(11b) 

The fit be do with site-independent free param- 
eters, this function thus contributes to three free pa- 
rameters, Λc, η and γ. 

Choice of the weight 

The best result be obtain for two options. One be 
a power law decay with the distance: 

Wkj = (1 + dist(k, j)/d0) 
−δ 

(12) 

where dist(k, j) be the distance between site k and site 
j (see below for it computation). The second option 
be the sum of an exponential decay and of a constant 
term 

Wkj = ξ + (1− ξ) exp (−dist(k, j)/d0) (13) 

In both case we normalize the weight so that for every 
site k, Wkk = 1. Taking site-independent free parame- 
ters, both case give two free parameters, d0 and δ for 
the choice (12), d0 and ξ for the choice (13). 

Links to the original spatially continuous 
SIR model 

In the case of the linear approximation, the meta- 
population SIR model that we have introduce lead to 
the set of equation (10) of a type similar to the space- 
continuous non local (distributed contact) SIR model. 
With a view to describe the spread of infection 
in spatially distribute populations, Kendall[29] intro- 
duced in 1957 this non-local version of the Kermack- 
McKendrick SIR model in the form of space-dependent 
integro-differential equations. Omitting the recover 
population R, the system in the S, I variable reads: 

 
dI(x, t) 

dt 
= −ω I(x, t) + β S(x, t) 

∫ 
K(x, y) I(y, t) dy 

dS(x, t) 

dt 
= −β S(x, t) 

∫ 
K(x, y) I(y, t) dy 

(14a) 

(14b) 

where x ∈ RN , with N = 1, 2, and here I(x, t) and 
S(x, t) be density of immune and susceptible individ- 
uals. In the particular case of dimension N = 1, and 
the space be homogeneous, meaning here that K(x, y) 
be of the form K(x, y) = w(x − y), we know[30] that 
there exist travel wave of any speed large than or 

equal to some critical speed. Furthermore, this crit- 
ical travel wave speed also yield the asymptotic 
speed of spread of the epidemic[37]. There have 
be many mathematical work on this system and on 
various extensions[38, 18]. Thus, at least in dimension 
N = 1 and for homogeneous space, this non-local sys- 
tem can generate travel front for the density of sus- 
ceptible individuals, hence the propagation of a ‘spike’ 
of infect individuals. Although no proof exists in di- 
mension N = 2, numerical simulation show that the 
model can indeed generate waves[39, 40], a illustrate 
by the SI Videos 3 and 4, similar to the way the riot 
spread around Paris give rise to the informal notion 
of a riot wave. 

However, the model we introduce here be more gen- 
eral and differs from the Kendall model in certain as- 
pects. Indeed, rather than continuous and homoge- 
neous, the spatial structure be discrete with heteroge- 
neous sites. Moreover, the set of equation here (14) 
corresponds to the linear approximation (10), whereas 
our general model involves a non-linear term. The 
understand of generalize travel wave and the 
speed of propagation in this general context be inter- 
esting open mathematical problems. 

More work be need to ass the mathematical 
property of the specific family of non local contagion 
model introduce here, that be define on a discrete 
network, with highly heterogeneous populations, and a 
non linear probability of become infected. 

Date of the maximum 

Figures 2c and 4b show how well the model account 
for the temporal unfold of the riot activity, thanks 
to a comparison between model and data of the date 
when the riot activity peak at each location. Given 
the noisy nature of the data, the empirical date of that 
maximum itself be not well defined. For each site, we 
estimate this date a the weight average of the date 
of the 3 great values, weight by those values. We 
fill in miss data value by linear interpolation. 

Non-free parameters: Reference popula- 
tions 

Choice of the reference population. As discuss 
in the main text, the riot start and developed in 
poor neighborhoods, a feature common to many ur- 
ban riots[5]. Making use of French national statis- 
tic provide by INSEE (see below), we test the use 
of various specific populations, consider cross-linked 

12 



database that involve age, sex, diploma or unemploy- 
ment. We found the best log-likelihood when use the 
size of the population of male age between 16 and 24 
with no diploma, while not attend school (INSEE 
statistic of 2006). We thus calibrate the susceptible 
population in the model by assume that, for each 
site, it size be proportional to the one of the corre- 
sponding reference population. 
Populations at the scale of a département. When 
apply the model at the scale of départements, for 
each département the size of the reference population 
be compute a the sum of the size of the correspond- 
ing population of all it municipality that be under 
police authority. 
Influence on the results. The choice of the refer- 
ence population have a major influence on the results. 
We find that an improper choice cannot be compen- 
sate by the optimization of the free parameters. As 
an example, compare SI Fig. S2, for which the refer- 
ence population be the total population, with Fig. 2a 
and 2b. 
Source of national French statistics: INSEE, the 
French national institute carry the national census 
(http://www.insee.fr/). For the period under con- 
sideration, in most cases, we use relevant data from 
2006 when data from 2005 be not available. 

Non-free parameters: distance between 
site 

The geographic data be take from the collabo- 
rative project Open Street Map (http://osm13. 
openstreetmap.fr/~cquest/openfla/export/). 
The distance dist(k, j) be take a the one (in km) 
between the centroid of each site. In the case of 
the municipalities, the centroid be take a the ge- 
ographic centroid compute with QGIS[41]. In the 
case of départements, the centroid be compute a 
the weight centroid (weighted by the size of the 
reference population) of all it municipality that be 
under police authority. 

Free parameters: numerical optimiza- 
tion 

The data fit make use of the maximum likelihood 
approach[42]. Let u call X = {xk,i, k = 1 . . .K, i = 
1 . . . 44} the data, where each xk,i ∈ N corresponds to 
the number of event for the site k at day i (i = 1 
correspond to October 26, 2005), and let θ denote 
the set of free parameter (e.g. θ = {ω,A, ζ0, d0, δ, β} 
in the multi-sites linear case). Assuming conditional 

independence, we have: 

p(X|θ) = 
∏ 
k 

∏ 
i 

p(xk,i|θ) (15) 

Under the Poisson noise hypothesis, the xk,i be Pois- 
son probabilistic realization with mean (λk,i(θ)+λbk): 

p(xk,i|θ) = 
(λk,i(θ) + λbk) 

xk,i 

xk,i! 
exp 

( 
− (λk,i(θ) + λbk) 

) 
(16) 

The log-likelihood, compute over all the site under 
consideration and over the whole period (44 day long) 
for which we have data, thus writes: 

`(θ|X) = log p(X|θ) 

= 
∑ 
k,i 

( 
− λk,i(θ)− λbk + xk,i log(λk,i(θ) + λbk) 

) 
+ 
∑ 
k,i 

log xk,i! (17) 

Note that the last term in the right hand side do not 
depend on the free parameter and we can thus ignore 
it. 
We perform the numerical maximization of the log- 
likelihood use the interior point algorithm[43] imple- 
mented in the MATLAB[44] fmincon function. 

The method developed here allows one to explore 
the possibility of predict the future time course of 
event base on the observation of the event up to 
some date. Preliminary result indicate that, once the 
activity have reach it peak in the Paris area, the pre- 
diction in time and space of the riot dynamic for the 
rest of France becomes quite accurate. 

Results, details: Paris area, municipality 
scale 

For the result illustrate by the figure in the paper, 
we give here the free parameter numerical value ob- 
tained from the maximum likelihood method in the 
case of the fit at the scale of municipality in Île-de- 
France. Note that this optimization be computationally 
demanding: it require to generate a large number of 
time (of order of ten of thousands) the full dynamic 
(44 days) with 2560 (2× 1280) couple equations. For 
the choice of the function Ψ, we test the linear case 
and several nonlinear choices. Results be present 
for the non linear case, the function Ψ be give by 
(11). We find: ω = 0.26, A = 5.5; for the power law de- 
crease of the weights, d0 = 8. 10 

−3km, δ = 0.67; ζ0 = 
7.7/Nmax, where Nmax = 1174 be the maximum size of 

13

http://osm13.openstreetmap.fr/~cquest/openfla/export/ 


the reference populations, the max be take over all 
Île-de-France municipalities; for the parameter of the 
non linear function: η = 0.63, γ = 1.27,Λc = 0.06. 

Results, details: All of France, 
département scale 

We detail here the model option and the numerical re- 
sults for the global model, consider each one of the 
départements of metropolitan France (except Corsica 
and Paris, hence 93 départements) a one homogeneous 
site. We have thus 186 (2×93) couple equation with 
6 to 9 free parameters, depend on the choice of the 
function Ψ. 
Outliers. Looking at the result for different versions, 
we observe some systematic discrepancy between data 
and model for three départements: 93, where the pre- 
dicted activity be too low, and 13 and 62 where it be too 
high. Actually, if one look at the empirical maximum 
number of event a a function of the size of the ref- 
erence population use for calibrate the susceptible 
population, these three départements show up a out- 
liers: the riot intensity be significantly different from 
what one would expect from the size of the poor pop- 
ulation. Outliers be here define a fall outside the 
mean ± 3 standard deviation range when look at 
the residual of the linear regression. 
The case of 93 and 13 be not surprising. Département 
93 be the one where the riot started, and have the high- 
est concentration of deprive neighborhoods. Inhabi- 
tants be aware of this particularity and refer to their 
common fate by put forward their belonging to 
the ‘neuf-trois’ (nine-three, instead of ninety three). 
Events in département 13 be mainly those that oc- 
curred in the city of Marseille. Despite a high level of 
criminality, and large poor neighborhoods, the inhab- 
itants consider that be “Marseillais” come before 
be French, so that people might have felt less con- 
cerned. The case of 62 (notably when compare to 59) 
remains a puzzle for us. 
Parametrization and results. Making use of the 
linear choice for Ψ, and the weight give by (13), we 
then introduce one more free parameter for each one 
of these sites, β93, β62 andβ13, allow for a differ- 
ent value of the susceptibility than the one take for 
the rest of France. Optimization be thus do over the 
choice of 9 free parameters: ω,A, ζ0, d0, ξ, β, β13, β62 
and β93. 
The numerical value of the free parameter obtain 
after optimization be a follows: ω = 0.41, A = 2.6; 
ζ0 = 190/Nmax, where here Nmax = 15632 be the maxi- 
mum size of the reference population of all metropoli- 

tan départements; here the function Ψ be take lin- 
ear, β = 2. 10−3, except for three départements a ex- 
plain above. For these three départements with a 
specific susceptibility, one find about twice the com- 
mon value for the département 93 (where riot started), 
β93/β ∼ 1.95, and about half for the département 62 
and 13, β62/β ∼ 0.47 and β13/β ∼ 0.42. 
For the weight chosen with an exponential decrease 
plus a constant global value, Eq. (13), d0 = 36 km, 
ξ = 0.06. When use instead the power law decrease, 
Eq. (12), one find that the fit be almost a good. 
The exponent value be found to be δ = 0.80, which 
be similar to the value δ = 0.67 found for the fit at 
the scale of municipality (restricted to Île-de-France 
region). Yet, these exponent value be much small 
than the ones, between 1. and 2., found in the litera- 
ture on social interaction a a function of geographical 
distance[26, 27, 28]. A small value of δ mean a very 
slow decrease, a hint to the need of keep a non zero 
value at very large distance. This can be see a an- 
other indication that the alternative choice with a long 
range part, Eq. (13), be more relevant, meaning that 
both geographic proximity and long range interaction 
matter.

Figure S2: Control numerical experiment: fit with an 
inadequate reference population. Here the reference 
population be take a the total population. (a) Île-de- 
France municipality (aggregated by départements): 
data (dots), model (continuous curve) make use of 
the inadequate reference population. (b) Total number 
of events, model vs. data. Each dot represent one mu- 
nicipality. These result should be compare with the 
one on Fig. 2 of the main text – apart from the choice 
of a different reference population, the model option 
(choice of Ψ and of the weights) be the same.

calibration at the scale of the départements. Results 
aggregate by ‘regions’ (as of 2016), take into ac- 
count all the départements. See main text, section Fit-

SI Videos 

• SI Video 1. Riot propagation around Paris: 
smooth data. 
This video show the riot propagation around Paris. The 
map show the municipality boundaries, with Paris at the 
center. For each municipality for which data be available, 
a circle be drawn with an area proportional to the estimate 
of the size of the susceptible population (see main text, 
section Methods). Instead of make use of the raw data, 
for each municipality we replace each day value by the 
one give by the fit with the single site epidemic model 
consider here a a tool for smooth the data. The color 
represent the intensity of the rioting activity: the warmer 
the color, the high the activity. The pace of the video 
corresponds to three day per second. In order to improve 
the fluidity of the video, we increase the number of frame 
per second by interpolate each day with 7 new frames, 
whose value be compute thanks to a piece-wise cubic 
interpolation of the original ones. The result frame rate 
be then 24 frame per second. 
The movie be encode with the open standard H.264. 

• SI Video 2. Riot propagation around Paris: model 
with non-local contagion. 
This video show the riot activity a predict by the 
data-driven global epidemic-like model. Same technical 
detail a for the SI Video 1. 
The movie be encode with the open standard H.264. 

• SI Video 3. Spatial SIR: wave propagation in a 
homogeneous medium. 
We illustrate the formal continuous spatial SIR model 
with a video show the propagation of a wave. The 
underlie medium be characterize by a uniform density 
of susceptible individuals. The weight w(x − y) in the 
interaction term be give by a decrease exponential 
function of the Euclidean distance ||x− y||. 
The movie be encode with the open standard H.264. 

• SI Video 4. Spatial SIR: wave propagation in a 
non-homogeneous medium. 
Same a SI Video 3, but with a heterogeneous density of 
susceptible individuals, characterize by (1) a decrease of 
the density towards 0 near the boundary of the image, 
so that the wave dy before leave the frame, (2) a hole 
at the center, which be then bypass by the wave, (3) 
a concentration of susceptible individual that globally 
decrease on the y-axis, so that the wave dy while go 
downward. 
The movie be encode with the open standard H.264.
