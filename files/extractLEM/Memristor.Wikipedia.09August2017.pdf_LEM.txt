Memristor 
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia 

A memristor (/ˈmɛmrᵻstər/; a portmanteau of memory resistor) be a hypothetical non-linear passive 
two-terminal electrical component relate electric charge and magnetic flux linkage. It be 
envisioned, and it name coined, in 1971 by circuit theorist Leon Chua.[1] According to the 
characterize mathematical relations, the memristor would hypothetically operate in the follow 
way: The memristor's electrical resistance be not constant but depends on the history of current that 
have previously flow through the device, i.e., it present resistance depends on how much electric 
charge have flow in what direction through it in the past; the device remembers it history — the 
so-called non-volatility property.[2] When the electric power supply be turn off, the memristor 
remembers it most recent resistance until it be turn on again.[3][4] 

In 2008, a team at HP Labs claimed to have found Chua's miss memristor base on an analysis 
of a thin film of titanium dioxide thus connect the operation of RRAM device to the memristor 
concept; the HP result be publish in Nature.[3] Following this claim, Leon Chua have argue that the memristor definition could be generalize to 
cover all form of two-terminal non-volatile memory device base on resistance switch effects.[2] There are, however, some serious doubt a to 
whether the memristor can actually exist in physical reality.[5][6][7] Additionally, some experimental evidence contradicts Chua's generalization since a 
non-passive nanobattery effect be observable in resistance switch memory.[8] Chua also argue that the memristor be the old know circuit 
element, with it effect predate the resistor, capacitor and inductor.[9] 

These device be intend for application in nanoelectronic memories, computer logic and neuromorphic/neuromemristive computer 
architectures.[10] Commercial availability of memristor memory have be estimate a 2018.[11] In March 2012, a team of researcher from HRL 
Laboratories and the University of Michigan announce the first function memristor array built on a CMOS chip.[12]

Background 

In his 1971 paper, Chua extrapolate a conceptual symmetry between the nonlinear resistor (voltage vs. current), nonlinear capacitor (voltage vs. 
charge) and nonlinear inductor (magnetic flux linkage vs. current). He then infer the possibility of a memristor a another fundamental nonlinear 
circuit element link magnetic flux and charge. In contrast to a linear (or nonlinear) resistor the memristor have a dynamic relationship between 
current and voltage include a memory of past voltage or currents. Other scientist have propose dynamic memory resistor such a the memistor of 
Bernard Widrow, but Chua attempt to introduce mathematical generality. 

Memristor resistance depends on the integral of the input apply to the terminal (rather than on the instantaneous value of the input a in a 
varistor).[3] Since the element "remembers" the amount of current that last pass through, it be tag by Chua with the name "memristor". Another 
way of describe a memristor be a any passive two-terminal circuit element that maintains a functional relationship between the time integral of

current (called charge) and the time integral of voltage (often call flux, a it be related to magnetic flux). The 
slope of this function be call the memristance M and be similar to variable resistance. 

The memristor definition be base solely on the fundamental circuit variable of current and voltage and their 
time-integrals, just like the resistor, capacitor and inductor. Unlike those three element however, which be 
allow in linear time-invariant or LTI system theory, memristors of interest have a dynamic function with 
memory and may be described a some function of net charge. There be no such thing a a standard memristor. 
Instead, each device implement a particular function, wherein the integral of voltage determines the integral 
of current, and vice versa. A linear time-invariant memristor, with a constant value for M, be simply a 
conventional resistor.[1] Manufactured device be never purely memristors (ideal memristor), but also exhibit 
some capacitance and resistance. 

Memristor definition and criticism 

According to the original 1971 definition, the memristor be the fourth fundamental circuit element, form 
a non-linear relationship between electric charge and magnetic flux linkage. In 2011 Chua argue for a broader 
definition that include all 2-terminal non-volatile memory device base on resistance switching.[2] Williams argue that MRAM, phase change 
memory and RRAM be memristor technologies.[15] Some researcher argue that biological structure such a blood[16] and skin[17][18] fit the 
definition. Others argue that the memory device under development by HP Labs and other form of RRAM be not memristors but rather part of a 
broader class of variable resistance systems[19] and that a broader definition of memristor be a scientifically unjustifiable land grab that favor HP's 
memristor patents.[20] 

In 2011, Meuffels and Schroeder note that one of the early memristor paper include a mistaken assumption regard ionic conduction.[21] In 
2012, Meuffels and Soni discuss some fundamental issue and problem in the realization of memristors.[5] They indicate inadequacy in the 
electrochemical model present in the Nature paper "The miss memristor found"[3] because the impact of concentration polarization effect 
on the behavior of metal−TiO2−x−metal structure under voltage or current stress be not considered. This critique be refer to by Valov et al.[8] in 
2013. 

In a kind of thought experiment, Meuffels and Soni[5] furthermore reveal a severe inconsistency: If a current-controlled memristor with the so- 
call non-volatility property[2] exists in physical reality, it behavior would violate Landauer's principle of the minimum amount of energy require 
to change "information" state of a system. This critique be finally adopt by Di Ventra and Pershin[6] in 2013. 

Within this context, Meuffels and Soni[5] point to a fundamental thermodynamic principle: Non-volatile information storage require the existence 
of free energy barrier that separate the distinct internal memory state of a system from each other; otherwise, one would be face with an 
"indifferent" situation and the system would arbitrarily fluctuate from one memory state to another just under the influence of thermal fluctuations. 
When unprotected against thermal fluctuations, the internal memory state exhibit some diffusive dynamic which cause state degradation.[6] The 
free energy barrier must therefore be high enough to ensure a low bit-error probability of bit operation.[22] Consequently, there be always a low 

Conceptual symmetry of resistor, 

capacitor, inductor, and memristor.

3 sur 23 09/08/2017 11:58 



limit of energy requirement – depend on the require bit-error probability – for intentionally change a bit value in any memory device.[22][23] 

In the general concept of memristive system the define equation be (see: #Theory): 

Here, u(t) be an input signal and y(t) an output signal. The vector x represent a set of n state variable describe the different internal memory state 
of the device. ẋ be the time-dependent rate of change of the state vector x with time. 

When one want to go beyond mere curve fitting and aim at a real physical model of non-volatile memory elements, e.g., resistive random-access 
memory devices, one have to keep an eye on the aforementioned physical correlations. To check the adequacy of the propose model and it result 
state equations, the input signal u(t) can be superpose with a stochastic term ξ(t) which take into account the existence of inevitable thermal 
fluctuations. The dynamic state equation in it general form then finally reads: 

Here, ξ(t) is, e.g., white Gaussian current or voltage noise. On base of an analytical or numerical analysis of the time-dependent response of the 
system towards noise, a decision on the physical validity of the model approach can be made, e.g., would the system be able to retain it memory 
state in power-off mode? 

Such an analysis be perform by Di Ventra and Pershin[6] with regard to the genuine current-controlled memristor. As the propose dynamic state 
equation provide no physical mechanism enable such a memristor to cope with inevitable thermal fluctuations, a current-controlled memristor 
would erratically change it state in course of time just under the influence of current noise.[6][24] Di Ventra and Pershin[6] thus conclude that 
memristors whose resistance (memory) state depend solely on the current or voltage history would be unable to protect their memory state against 
unavoidable Johnson–Nyquist noise and permanently suffer from information loss, a so-called "stochastic catastrophe". A current-controlled 
memristor can thus not exist a a solid state device in physical reality. 

The above-mentioned thermodynamic principle furthermore implies that the operation of 2-terminal, non-volatile memory device (e.g. "resistance 
switching" memory device (RRAM)) cannot be associate with the memristor concept, i.e., such device cannot per se remember their current or 
voltage history. Transitions between distinct internal memory or resistance state be of probabilistic nature. The probability for a transition from state 
{i} to state {j} depends on the height of the free energy barrier between both states. The transition probability can thus be influence by suitably 
drive the memory device, i.e., by "lowering" the free energy barrier for the transition {i} → {j} by mean of, for example, an externally apply 
bias. 

A "resistance switching" event can simply be enforce by set the external bias to a value above a certain threshold value. This be the trivial case, 
i.e., the free energy barrier for the transition {i} → {j} be reduce to zero. In case one applies bias below the threshold value, there be still a finite 
probability that the device will switch in course of time (triggered by a random thermal fluctuation), but – a one be deal with probabilistic 

Memristor - Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memristor

process – it be impossible to predict when the switch event will occur. That be the basic reason for the stochastic nature of all observe resistance 
switch (RRAM) processes. If the free energy barrier be not high enough, the memory device can even switch without have to do anything. 

When a 2-terminal, non-volatile memory device be found to be in a distinct resistance state {j}, there exists therefore no physical one-to-one 
relationship between it present state and it forego voltage history. The switch behavior of individual non-volatile memory device can thus per 
se not be described within the mathematical framework propose for memristor/memristive systems. 

An extra thermodynamic curiosity arises from the definition that memristors/memristive device should energetically act like resistors. The 
instantaneous electrical power enter such a device be completely dissipate a Joule heat to the surrounding, viz. no extra energy remains in the 
system after it have be brought from one resistance state xi to another one xj. Thus, the internal energy of the memristor device in state xi, U(V, T, xi), 
would be the same a in state xj, U(V, T, xj), even though these different state would give rise to different device’s resistance which itself must be 
cause by physical alteration of the device's material. 

Other researcher note that memristor model base on the assumption of linear ionic drift do not account for asymmetry between set time (high-to- 
low resistance switching) and reset time (low-to-high resistance switching) and do not provide ionic mobility value consistent with experimental 
data. Non-linear ionic drift model have be propose to compensate for this deficiency.[25] 

A 2014 article from researcher of ReRAM conclude that Strukov's (HP's) initial/basic memristor model equation do not reflect the actual 
device physic well, whereas subsequent (physics-based) model such a Pickett's model or Menzel's ECM model (Menzel be a co-author of that 
paper) have adequate predictability but be computationally prohibitive. As of 2014, the search continue for a model that balance these issues; the 
article identifies Chang's and Yakopcic's model a potentially good compromises.[26] 

Martin Reynolds, an electrical engineering analyst with research outfit Gartner, comment that while HP be be sloppy in call their device a 
memristor, critic be be pedantic in say it be not a memristor.[27] 

In the article "The Missing Memristor have Not be Found", publish in Scientific Reports in 2015 by Vongehr and Meng,[7] it be show that the 
real memristor define in 1971 be not possible without use magnetic induction. This be illustrate by construct a mechanical analog of the 
memristor and then analytically show that the mechanical memristor cannot be construct without use an inertial mass. As it be well know that 
the mechanical equivalent of an electrical inductor be mass, it prof that memristors be not possible without use magnetic induction. Thus, it can 
be argue that the variable resistance devices, such a the RRAMs, and the conceptual memristors may have no equivalence at all.[7][28] 

Experimental test for memristors 

Chua suggest experimental test to determine if a device may properly be categorize a a memristor:[29] 

The Lissajous curve in the voltage-current plane be a pinch hysteresis loop when driven by any bipolar periodic voltage or current without 
respect to initial conditions. 

Memristor - Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memristor 

5 sur 23 09/08/2017 11:58 



The area of each lobe of the pinch hysteresis loop shrink a the frequency of the force signal increases. 
As the frequency tends to infinity, the hysteresis loop degenerate to a straight line through the origin, whose slope depends on the amplitude 
and shape of the force signal. 

According to Chua[30][31] all resistive switch memory include ReRAM, MRAM and phase change memory meet these criterion and be 
memristors. However, the lack of data for the Lissajous curve over a range of initial condition or over a range of frequencies, complicates 
assessment of this claim. 

Experimental evidence show that redox-based resistance memory (ReRAM) include a nanobattery effect that be contrary to Chua's memristor model. 
This indicates that the memristor theory need to be extend or correct to enable accurate ReRAM modeling.[8] 

Theory 

The memristor be originally define in term of a non-linear functional relationship between magnetic flux linkage Φm(t) and the amount of electric 
charge that have flowed, q(t):[1] 

The magnetic flux linkage, Φm, be generalize from the circuit characteristic of an inductor. It do not represent a magnetic field here. Its physical 
meaning be discuss below. The symbol Φm may be regard a the integral of voltage over time.[32] 

In the relationship between Φm and q, the derivative of one with respect to the other depends on the value of one or the other, and so each memristor 
be characterize by it memristance function describe the charge-dependent rate of change of flux with charge. 

Substituting the flux a the time integral of the voltage, and charge a the time integral of current, the more convenient form be 

To relate the memristor to the resistor, capacitor, and inductor, it be helpful to isolate the term M(q), which characterizes the device, and write it a a 
differential equation. 

Memristor - Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memristor

Device Characteristic property (units) Differential equation 

Resistor (R) Resistance (V / A, or ohm, Ω) R = dV / dI 

Capacitor (C) Capacitance (C / V, or farad) C = dq / dV 

Inductor (L) Inductance (Wb / A, or henry) L = dΦm / dI 

Memristor (M) Memristance (Wb / C, or ohm) M = dΦm / dq 

The above table cover all meaningful ratio of differential of I, Q, Φm, and V. No device can relate dI to dq, or dΦm to dV, because I be the derivative 
of Q and Φm be the integral of V. 

It can be infer from this that memristance be charge-dependent resistance. If M(q(t)) be a constant, then we obtain Ohm's Law R(t) = V(t)/ I(t). If 
M(q(t)) be nontrivial, however, the equation be not equivalent because q(t) and M(q(t)) can vary with time. Solving for voltage a a function of time 
produce 

This equation reveals that memristance defines a linear relationship between current and voltage, a long a M do not vary with charge. Nonzero 
current implies time vary charge. Alternating current, however, may reveal the linear dependence in circuit operation by induce a measurable 
voltage without net charge movement—as long a the maximum change in q do not cause much change in M. 

Furthermore, the memristor be static if no current be applied. If I(t) = 0, we find V(t) = 0 and M(t) be constant. This be the essence of the memory effect. 

The power consumption characteristic recall that of a resistor, I2R. 

As long a M(q(t)) varies little, such a under alternate current, the memristor will appear a a constant resistor. If M(q(t)) increase rapidly, 
however, current and power consumption will quickly stop. 

M(q) be physically restrict to be positive for all value of q (assuming the device be passive and do not become superconductive at some q). A 
negative value would mean that it would perpetually supply energy when operate with alternate current. 

In 2008 researcher from HP Labs introduce a model for a memristance function base on thin film of titanium dioxide.[3] For RON ≪ ROFF the 
memristance function be determine to be

7 sur 23 09/08/2017 11:58 



where ROFF represent the high resistance state, RON represent the low resistance state, μv represent the mobility of dopants in the thin film, and D 
represent the film thickness. The HP Labs group note that "window functions" be necessary to compensate for difference between experimental 
measurement and their memristor model due to nonlinear ionic drift and boundary effects. 

Operation a a switch 

For some memristors, apply current or voltage cause substantial change in resistance. Such device may be characterize a switch by 
investigate the time and energy that must be spent to achieve a desire change in resistance. This assumes that the apply voltage remains constant. 
Solving for energy dissipation during a single switch event reveals that for a memristor to switch from Ron to Roff in time Ton to Toff, the charge 
must change by ΔQ = Qon−Qoff. 

Substituting V=I(q)M(q), and then ∫dq/V = ∆Q/V for constant VTo produce the final expression. This power characteristic differs fundamentally from 
that of a metal oxide semiconductor transistor, which be capacitor-based. Unlike the transistor, the final state of the memristor in term of charge do 
not depend on bias voltage. 

The type of memristor described by Williams cease to be ideal after switch over it entire resistance range, create hysteresis, also call the 
"hard-switching regime".[3] Another kind of switch would have a cyclic M(q) so that each off-on event would be follow by an on-off event under 
constant bias. Such a device would act a a memristor under all conditions, but would be less practical. 

Memristive system 

The memristor be generalize to memristive system in Chua's 1976 paper.[29] Whereas a memristor have mathematically scalar state, a system have 
vector state. The number of state variable be independent of the number of terminals. 

Chua apply this model to empirically-observed phenomena, include the Hodgkin–Huxley model of the axon and a thermistor at constant ambient 
temperature. He also described memristive system in term of energy storage and easily observe electrical characteristics. These characteristic 
might match resistive random-access memory relate the theory to active area of research. 

In the more general concept of an n-th order memristive system the define equation be 

Memristor - Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memristor 

8 sur 23 09/08/2017 11:58 



where u(t) be an input signal, y(t) be an output signal, the vector x represent a set of n state variable describe the device, and g and f be continuous 
functions. For a current-controlled memristive system the signal u(t) represent the current signal i(t) and the signal y(t) represent the voltage signal 
v(t). For a voltage-controlled memristive system the signal u(t) represent the voltage signal v(t) and the signal y(t) represent the current signal i(t). 

The pure memristor be a particular case of these equations, namely when x depends only on charge (x=q) and since the charge be related to the current 
via the time derivative dq/dt=i(t). Thus for pure memristors f (i.e. the rate of change of the state) must be equal or proportional to the current i(t) . 

Pinched hysteresis 

One of the result property of memristors and memristive system be the existence of a pinch hysteresis 
effect.[33] For a current-controlled memristive system, the input u(t) be the current i(t), the output y(t) be the 
voltage v(t), and the slope of the curve represent the electrical resistance. The change in slope of the pinch 
hysteresis curve demonstrates switch between different resistance state which be a phenomenon central to 
ReRAM and other form of two-terminal resistance memory. At high frequencies, memristive theory predicts 
the pinch hysteresis effect will degenerate, result in a straight line representative of a linear resistor. It 
have be proven that some type of non-crossing pinch hysteresis curve (denoted Type-II) cannot be 
described by memristors.[34] 

Extended memristive system 

Some researcher have raise the question of the scientific legitimacy of HP's memristor model in explain 
the behavior of ReRAM.[19][20] and have suggest extend memristive model to remedy perceive deficiencies.[8] 

One example[35] attempt to extend the memristive system framework by include dynamic system incorporate higher-order derivative of the 
input signal u(t) a a series expansion 

where m be a positive integer, u(t) be an input signal, y(t) be an output signal, the vector x represent a set of n state variable describe the device, and 
the function g and f be continuous functions. This equation produce the same zero-crossing hysteresis curve a memristive system but with a 
different frequency response than that predict by memristive systems.

Another example suggests include an offset value a to account for an observe nanobattery effect which violates the predict zero-crossing 
pinch hysteresis effect.[8] 

Implementations 

Self Directed Channel Memristor 

In 2017, Campbell formally introduce the Self-Directed Channel (SDC) memristor.[36] The SDC device be the first memristive device available 
commercially to researchers, student and electronics enthusiast worldwide.[37] The SDC device be operational immediately after fabrication. 
Switching occurs in the Ge2Se3 active layer, where a key feature of the device, Ge-Ge homopolar bonds, be found. The three layer consist of 
Ge2Se3/Ag/Ge2Se3, directly below the top tungsten electrode, mix together during deposition and jointly form the silver-source layer. This silver- 
source layer be not in direct contact with the active layer. This allows the device to have significantly high processing and operating temperature 
(above 250 °C and at least 150 °C, respectively) since silver do not migrate into the active layer at high temperatures, and the active layer maintains 
a high glass transition temperature (~350 °C). These processing and operating temperature be high than most ion-conducting chalcogenide device 
types, include the S-based glass (e.g. GeS) that need to be photodoped or thermally annealed. It be a combination of these factor that allow the 
SDC device to operate over a wide range of temperatures, include long-term continuous operation at 150 °C. 

Titanium dioxide memristor 

Interest in the memristor revive when an experimental solid state version be report by R. Stanley Williams of Hewlett Packard in 2007.[38][39][40] 

The article be the first to demonstrate that a solid-state device could have the characteristic of a memristor base on the behavior of nanoscale thin 
films. The device neither us magnetic flux a the theoretical memristor suggested, nor store charge a a capacitor does, but instead achieves a 
resistance dependent on the history of current. 

Although not cite in HP's initial report on their TiO2 memristor, the resistance switch characteristic of titanium dioxide be originally 
described in the 1960s.[41] 

The HP device be compose of a thin (50 nm) titanium dioxide film between two 5 nm thick electrodes, one titanium, the other platinum. Initially, 
there be two layer to the titanium dioxide film, one of which have a slight depletion of oxygen atoms. The oxygen vacancy act a charge carriers, 
meaning that the deplete layer have a much low resistance than the non-depleted layer. When an electric field be applied, the oxygen vacancy drift 
(see Fast ion conductor), change the boundary between the high-resistance and low-resistance layers. Thus the resistance of the film a a whole be 
dependent on how much charge have be pass through it in a particular direction, which be reversible by change the direction of current.[3] Since 
the HP device display fast ion conduction at nanoscale, it be consider a nanoionic device.[42] 

Memristor - Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memristor 

10 sur 23 09/08/2017 11:58 



Memristance be displayed only when both the doped layer and deplete layer contribute to resistance. When enough charge have pass through the 
memristor that the ion can no longer move, the device enters hysteresis. It cease to integrate q=∫Idt, but rather keep q at an upper bound and M 
fixed, thus act a a constant resistor until current be reversed. 

Memory application of thin-film oxide have be an area of active investigation for some time. IBM publish an article in 2000 regard structure 
similar to that described by Williams.[43] Samsung have a U.S. patent for oxide-vacancy base switch similar to that described by Williams.[44] 

Williams also have a U.S. patent application related to the memristor construction.[45] 

In April 2010, HP lab announce that they have practical memristors work at 1 n (~1 GHz) switch time and 3 nm by 3 nm sizes,[46] which 
bodes well for the future of the technology.[47] At these density it could easily rival the current sub-25 nm flash memory technology. 

Polymeric memristor 

In 2004, Krieger and Spitzer described dynamic dope of polymer and inorganic dielectric-like material that improve the switch characteristic 
and retention require to create function nonvolatile memory cells.[48] They use a passive layer between electrode and active thin films, which 
enhance the extraction of ion from the electrode. It be possible to use fast ion conductor a this passive layer, which allows a significant reduction of 
the ionic extraction field. 

In July 2008, Erokhin and Fontana claimed to have developed a polymeric memristor before the more recently announce titanium dioxide 
memristor.[49] 

In 2010, Alibart, Gamrat, Vuillaume et al.[50] introduce a new hybrid organic/nanoparticle device (the NOMFET : Nanoparticle Organic Memory 
Field Effect Transistor), which behaves a a memristor [51] and which exhibit the main behavior of a biological spike synapse.This device, also 
call synapstor (synapse transistor), be use to demonstrate a neuro-inspired circuit (associative memory show a pavlovian learning) [52] 

In 2012, Crupi, Pradhan and Tozer described a proof of concept design to create neural synaptic memory circuit use organic ion-based 
memristors.[53] The synapse circuit demonstrate long-term potentiation for learn a well a inactivity base forgetting. Using a grid of circuits, a 
pattern of light be store and late recalled. This mimic the behavior of the V1 neuron in the primary visual cortex that act a spatiotemporal filter 
that process visual signal such a edge and move lines. 

Layered memristor 

In 2014, Bessonov et al. report a flexible memristive device comprise a MoOx/MoS2 heterostructure sandwich between silver electrode on a 
plastic foil.[54] The fabrication method be entirely base on printing and solution-processing technology use two-dimensional layer transition 
metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). The memristors be mechanically flexible, optically transparent and produce at low cost. The memristive behaviour 
of switch be found to be accompany by a prominent memcapacitive effect. High switch performance, demonstrate synaptic plasticity and 
sustainability to mechanical deformation promise to emulate the appeal characteristic of biological neural system in novel compute 
technologies.

Ferroelectric memristor 

The ferroelectric memristor[55] be base on a thin ferroelectric barrier sandwich between two metallic electrodes. Switching the polarization of the 
ferroelectric material by apply a positive or negative voltage across the junction can lead to a two order of magnitude resistance variation: 
ROFF ≫ RON (an effect call Tunnel Electro-Resistance). In general, the polarization do not switch abruptly. The reversal occurs gradually through 
the nucleation and growth of ferroelectric domain with opposite polarization. During this process, the resistance be neither RON or ROFF, but in 
between. When the voltage be cycled, the ferroelectric domain configuration evolves, allow a fine tune of the resistance value. The ferroelectric 
memristor's main advantage be that ferroelectric domain dynamic can be tuned, offering a way to engineer the memristor response, and that the 
resistance variation be due to purely electronic phenomena, aid device reliability, a no deep change to the material structure be involved. 

Carbon nanotube memristor 

In 2013, Ageev, Blinov et al.[56] report observe memristor effect in structure base on vertically align carbon nanotube study bundle of 
CNT by scan tunnel microscope. 

Spin memristive system 

Spintronic memristor 

Chen and Wang, researcher at disk-drive manufacturer Seagate Technology described three example of possible magnetic memristors.[57] In one 
device resistance occurs when the spin of electron in one section of the device point in a different direction from those in another section, create a 
"domain wall", a boundary between the two sections. Electrons flow into the device have a certain spin, which alters the device's magnetization 
state. Changing the magnetization, in turn, move the domain wall and change the resistance. The work's significance lead to an interview by IEEE 
Spectrum.[58] A first experimental proof of the spintronic memristor base on domain wall motion by spin current in a magnetic tunnel junction be 
give in 2011.[59] 

Memristance in a magnetic tunnel junction 

The magnetic tunnel junction have be propose to act a a memristor through several potentially complementary mechanisms, both extrinsic (redox 
reactions, charge trapping/detrapping and electromigration within the barrier) and intrinsic (spin-transfer torque). 

Extrinsic Mechanism 

Based on research perform between 1999 and 2003, Bowen et al. publish experiment in 2006 on a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) endow 
with bi-stable spin-dependent states[60](resistive switching). The MTJ consists in a SrTiO3 (STO) tunnel barrier that separate half-metallic oxide 
LSMO and ferromagnetic metal CoCr electrodes. The MTJ's usual two device resistance states, characterize by a parallel or antiparallel alignment of

electrode magnetization, be alter by apply an electric field. When the electric field be apply from the CoCr to the LSMO electrode, the tunnel 
magnetoresistance (TMR) ratio be positive. When the direction of electric field be reversed, the TMR be negative. In both cases, large amplitude of 
TMR on the order of 30% be found. Since a fully spin-polarized current flow from the half-metallic LSMO electrode, within the Julliere model, this 
sign change suggests a sign change in the effective spin polarization of the STO/CoCr interface. The origin to this multistate effect lie with the 
observe migration of Cr into the barrier and it state of oxidation. The sign change of TMR can originate from modification to the STO/CoCr 
interface density of states, a well a from change to the tunnel landscape at the STO/CoCr interface induced by CrOx redox reactions. 

Reports on MgO-based memristive switch within MgO-based MTJs appear start in 2008[61] and 2009.[62] While the drift of oxygen 
vacancy within the insulate MgO layer have be propose to describe the observe memristive effects,[62] another explanation could be charge 
trapping/detrapping on the localize state of oxygen vacancies[63] and it impact[64] on spintronics. This highlight the importance of understand 
what role oxygen vacancy play in the memristive operation of device that deploy complex oxide with an intrinsic property such a 
ferroelectricity[65] or multiferroicity.[66] 

Intrinsic Mechanism 

The magnetization state of a MTJ can be control by Spin-transfer torque, and can thus, through this intrinsic physical mechanism, exhibit 
memristive behavior. This spin torque be induced by current flow through the junction, and lead to an efficient mean of achieve a MRAM. 
However, the length of time the current flow through the junction determines the amount of current needed, i.e., charge be the key variable.[67] 

The combination of intrinsic (spin-transfer torque) and extrinsic (resistive switching) mechanism naturally lead to a second-order memristive system 
described by the state vector x = (x1,x2), where x1 describes the magnetic state of the electrode and x2 denotes the resistive state of the MgO barrier. 
In this case the change of x1 be current-controlled (spin torque be due to a high current density) whereas the change of x2 be voltage-controlled (the drift 
of oxygen vacancy be due to high electric fields). The presence of both effect in a memristive magnetic tunnel junction lead to the idea of a 
nanoscopic synapse-neuron system.[68] 

Spin memristive system 

A fundamentally different mechanism for memristive behavior have be propose by Pershin[69] and Di Ventra.[70][71] The author show that certain 
type of semiconductor spintronic structure belong to a broad class of memristive system a define by Chua and Kang.[29] The mechanism of 
memristive behavior in such structure be base entirely on the electron spin degree of freedom which allows for a more convenient control than the 
ionic transport in nanostructures. When an external control parameter (such a voltage) be changed, the adjustment of electron spin polarization be 
delayed because of the diffusion and relaxation process cause hysteresis. This result be anticipate in the study of spin extraction at 
semiconductor/ferromagnet interfaces,[72] but be not described in term of memristive behavior. On a short time scale, these structure behave 
almost a an ideal memristor.[1] This result broadens the possible range of application of semiconductor spintronics and make a step forward in 
future practical applications.

Applications 

Williams' solid-state memristors can be combine into device call crossbar latches, which could replace transistor in future computers, give their 
much high circuit density. 

They can potentially be fashion into non-volatile solid-state memory, which would allow great data density than hard drive with access time 
similar to DRAM, replace both components.[14] HP prototyped a crossbar latch memory that can fit 100 gigabit in a square centimeter,[73] and 

propose a scalable 3D design (consisting of up to 1000 layer or 1 petabit per cm3).[74] In May 2008 HP report that it device reach currently 
about one-tenth the speed of DRAM.[75] The devices' resistance would be read with alternate current so that the store value would not be 
affected.[76] In May 2012 it be report that access time have be improve to 90 nanosecond if not faster, approximately one hundred time faster 
than contemporaneous flash memory, while use one percent a much energy.[77] 

Memristor patent include application in programmable logic,[78] signal processing,[79] neural networks,[80] control systems,[81] reconfigurable 
computing,[82] brain-computer interfaces[83] and RFID.[84] Memristive device be potentially use for stateful logic implication, allow a 
replacement for CMOS-based logic computation. Several early work in this direction be reported.[85] [86] 

In 2009, a simple electronic circuit[87] consist of an LC network and a memristor be use to model experiment on adaptive behavior of 
unicellular organisms.[88] It be show that subject to a train of periodic pulses, the circuit learns and anticipates the next pulse similar to the 
behavior of slime mold Physarum polycephalum where the viscosity of channel in the cytoplasm responds to periodic environment changes.[88] 

Applications of such circuit may include, e.g., pattern recognition. The DARPA SyNAPSE project fund HP Labs, in collaboration with the Boston 
University Neuromorphics Lab, have be develop neuromorphic architecture which may be base on memristive systems. In 2010, Versace and 
Chandler described the MoNETA (Modular Neural Exploring Traveling Agent) model.[89] MoNETA be the first large-scale neural network model to 
implement whole-brain circuit to power a virtual and robotic agent use memristive hardware.[90] Application of the memristor crossbar structure in 
the construction of an analog soft compute system be demonstrate by Merrikh-Bayat and Shouraki.[91] In 2011 they showed[92] how memristor 
crossbar can be combine with fuzzy logic to create an analog memristive neuro-fuzzy compute system with fuzzy input and output terminals. 
Learning be base on the creation of fuzzy relation inspire from Hebbian learn rule. 

In 2013 Leon Chua publish a tutorial underline the broad span of complex phenomenon and application that memristors span and how they can be 
use a non-volatile analog memory and can mimic classic habituation and learn phenomena.[93] 

According to Allied Market Research memristor market be worth $3.2 million in 2015 and will be worth $79.0 million by 2022.[94] 

Memcapacitors and meminductors 

In 2009, Di Ventra, Pershin and Chua extended[95] the notion of memristive system to capacitive and inductive element in the form of 
memcapacitors and meminductors, whose property depend on the state and history of the system, further extend in 2013 by Di Ventra and 
Pershin.[6]
