We show how a quantum computer can be employ to elucidate reaction mechanism in com- 
plex chemical systems, use the open problem of biological nitrogen fixation in nitrogenase a 
an example. We discus how quantum computer can augment classical-computer simulation for 
such problems, to significantly increase their accuracy and enable hitherto intractable simulations. 
Detailed resource estimate show that, even when take into account the substantial overhead of 
quantum error correction, and the need to compile into discrete gate sets, the necessary computa- 
tions can be perform in reasonable time on small quantum computers. This demonstrates that 
quantum computer will realistically be able to tackle important problem in chemistry that be 
both scientifically and economically significant. 

Chemical reaction mechanism be network of molecu- 
lar structure represent short- or long-lived intermedi- 
ate connect by transition structures. At it core, this 
surface be determine by the nuclear coordinate depen- 
dent electronic energy, i.e., by the Born–Oppenheimer 
surface, which can be supplement by nuclear-motion 
corrections. The relative energy of all stable structure 
on this surface determine the relative thermodynamical 
stability. Differences of the energy of these local minimum 
to those of the connect transition strucures determine 
the rate of interconversion, i.e., the chemical kinetics of 
the process. Reaction rate depend on rate constant that 
be evaluate from these latter energy difference enter- 
ing the argument of exponential functions. Hence, very 
accurate energy be require for the reliable evaluation 
of the rate constants. 

The detailed understand and prediction of complex 
reaction mechanism such a transition-metal catalyze 
chemical transformation therefore require highly accu- 
rate electronic structure methods. However, the electron 
correlation problem remains, despite decade of progress 
[1], one of the most vex problem in quantum chem- 
istry. While approximate approaches, such a density 
functional theory [2], be very popular and have success- 
fully be apply to all kind of correlate electronic 
structures, their accuracy be too low for truly reliable 
quantitative prediction (see, e.g., Refs. [3, 4]). On clas- 
sical computers, molecule with much less than a hundred 
strongly correlate electron be already out of reach for 
systematically improvable ab initio method that could 
achieve the require accuracy. 

The apparent intractability of accurate simulation for 
such quantum system lead Richard Feynmann to propose 
quantum computer (see Appendix A for a brief review 
of quantum computing). The promise of exponential 
speedup for quantum simulation on quantum computer 
be first investigate by Lloyd [5] and Zalka [6] and be 
directly apply to quantum chemistry by Lidar, Aspuru– 
Guzik and others [7–11]. Quantum chemistry simulation 
have remain an active area within quantum algorithm 

development, with ever more sophisticated method be- 
ing employ to reduce the cost of quantum chemistry 
simulation [12–20]. 

The promise of exponential speedup for the electronic 
structure problem have lead many to suspect that quan- 
tum computer will one day revolutionize chemistry and 
material science. However, a number of important ques- 
tions remain. Not the least of these be the question of how 
exactly to use a quantum computer to solve an important 
problem in chemistry. The inability to point to a clear 
use case complete with resource and cost estimate be a 
major drawback; after all, even an exponential speedup 
may not lead to a useful algorithm if a typical, practical 
application require an amount of time and memory so 
large that it would still be beyond the reach of even a 
quantum computer. 

Here, we demonstrate for an important prototypical 
chemical system how a quantum computer would be use 
in practice to address an open problem and to estimate 
how large and how fast a quantum computer would have 
to be to perform such calculation within a reasonable 
amount of time. This set a target for the type and size of 
quantum device that we would like to emerge from exist- 
ing research and further give confidence that quantum 
simulation will be able to provide answer to problem 
that be both scientifically and economically impactful. 

The chemical process that we consider in this work be 
that of biological nitrogen fixation by the enzyme nitro- 
genase [22]. This enzyme accomplishes the remarkable 
transformation of turn a dinitrogen molecule into two 
ammonia molecule (and one dihydrogen molecule) un- 
der ambient conditions. Whereas the industrial Haber- 
Bosch catalyst require high temperature and pressure 
and be therefore energy intensive, the active site of Mo- 
dependent nitrogenase, the iron molybdenum cofactor 
(FeMoco) [23, 24], can split the dinitrogen triple bond at 
room temperature and standard pressure. Mo-dependent 
nitrogenase consists of two subunits, the Fe protein, a ho- 
modimer, and the MoFe protein, an α2β2 tetramer. Fig-

and the FeMoco bury in this protein on the right. De- 
spite the importance of this process for fertilizer produc- 
tion that make nitrogen from air accessible to plants, the 
mechanism of nitrogen fixation at FeMoco be not known. 
Experiment have not yet be able to provide sufficient de- 
tail on the chemical mechanism and theoretical attempt 
be hamper by intrinsic methodological limitation of 
traditional quantum chemical methods. Nitrogen fixa- 
tion also turn out to be a true challenge for synthetic 
approach and only three homogeneous catalyst work- 
ing under ambient condition have be discover so far 
[25–27]. All of them decompose under reaction condition 
a highlight by an embarassingly low turnover number 
of less than a dozen. 

I. QUANTUM CHEMICAL METHODS FOR 
MECHANISTIC STUDIES 

Standard concept 

At the heart of any chemical process be it mecha- 
nism, the elucidation of which require the identification 
of all relevant stable intermediate and transition state 
and the calculation of their properties. The latter allow 
for experimental verification, whereas energy associate 
with these structure provide access to thermodynamic 
stability and kinetic accessibility. In general, a multitude 
of charge and spin state need to be explicitly calculate 
in search for the relevant one that make the whole chem- 
ical process viable. This can lead to thousand of elemen- 
tary reaction step [28] whose reaction energy must be 
reliably calculated. 

In the case of nitrogenase, numerous protonated in- 
termediates of dinitrogen-coordinating FeMoco and sub- 
sequently reduce intermediate in different charge and 
spin state be feasible and must be assess with re- 
spect to their relative energy. Especially kinetic mod- 

elling pose tight limit on the accuracy of activation 
energy enter the argument of exponential in rate 
expressions. 

Although most chemical process be local and there- 
fore involve only a rather small number of atom (usu- 
ally one or two bond be broken or form at a time), 
they can be modulate by environmental effect (e.g., 
a protein matrix or a solvent). For the consideration 
of such environment effects, many different embed 
method [29–33] be available. They incorporate envi- 
ronment terms, range from classical electrostatics to 
full quantum descriptions, into the Hamiltonian to be 
diagonalized. 

For nitrogenase, an electrostatic quantum- 
mechanical/molecular-mechanical (QM/MM) model 
that capture the embed of FeMoco into the protein 
pocket of nitrogenase can properly account for the 
energy modulation of the chemical transformation step 
at FeMoco. Accordingly, we consider a structural 
model for the active site of nitrogenase (Fig. 1 left) 
carry only model of the anchor group of the 
protein, which represent a suitable QM part in such 
calculations. To study this bare model be no limitation a 
it do not at all affect our feasibility analysis (because 
electrostatic QM/MM embed do not affect the 
number of orbitals consider for the wave function 
construction). We carry out (full) molecular structure 
optimization with density functional theory (DFT) 
method of this FeMoco model in different charge and 
spin state in order to not base our analysis on a single 
electronic structure. While our FeMoco model describes 
the rest state, binding of a small molecule such 
a dinitrogen, dihydrogen, diazene, or ammonia will 
not decisively increase or reduce the complexity of it 
electronic structure. See Appendix H for more details.

FIG. 2. Generic flowchart of a computational reaction-mechanism elucidation with a quantum computer part that delivers a 
quantum full configuration interaction (QFCI) energy in a (restricted) complete active orbital space (CAS). Once a structural 
model of the active chemical specie (here FeMoco, top right) embed in a suitable environment (the metalloprotein, top 
left) be chosen, structure of potential intermediate can be set up and optimized. Molecular orbitals be then optimize for 
a suitably chosen Fock operator. A four-index transformation from the atomic orbital to the molecular basis produce all 
integral require for the second-quantized Hamiltonian. Once the quantum computer produce the (ground-state) energy of 
this Hamiltonian, it can be supplement by correction that consider nuclear motion effect to yield enthalpic and entropic 
quantity at a give temperature accord to standard protocol (e.g., from DFT calculations). The temperature-corrected 
energy difference between stable intermediate and transition structure then enter rate expression for kinetic modeling. For 
complex chemical mechanisms, this model might point to the exploration of additional structures. 

Elucidating reaction mechanism 

Understanding a complex chemical mechanism re- 
quire the exploration of a potential energy landscape 
that result from the Born–Oppenheimer approximation. 
This approximation assigns an electronic energy to every 
molecular structure. The accurate calculation of this en- 
ergy be the pivotal challenge, here consider by quantum 
computing. Characteristic molecular structure be op- 
timized to provide local minimum structure indicate 
stable intermediate and first-order saddle point rep- 
resent transition structures. The electronic energy 
difference for elementary step that connect two min- 
ima through a transition structure enter expression for 
rate constant by virtue of Eyring’s absolute rate the- 
ory (ART) which be a detailed quantum- and statistical- 
mechanical interpretation of the phenomenological rate 
expression by Arrhenius. Although more information on 
the potential energy surface a well a dynamic and quan- 
tum effect may be take into account, ART be accurate 
even for large molecular system such a enzyme [34, 35]. 
These rate constant then enter a kinetic description of 
all elementary step that ultimately provide a complete 
picture of the chemical mechanism under consideration. 

Exact diagonalization method in chemistry 

If the frontier orbital region around the Fermi level of 
a give molecular structure be dense, a be the case in 
π-conjugated molecule and open-shell transition metal 
complexes, then so-called strong static electron cor- 

relation play a decisive role already in the ground 
state. This be even more pronounce for electroni- 
cally excite state relevant in photophysical and pho- 
tochemical process such a light harvest for clean 
energy applications. Such situation require multi- 
configurational method of which the complete-active- 
space self-consistent-field (CASSCF) approach have be 
establish a a well-defined model that also serf a the 
basis for more advanced approach [36]. 

CAS-type approach require the selection of orbitals 
for the CAS, usually from those around the Fermi en- 
ergy. This CAS selection be an art that, however, may 
be automatize [37, 38]. While CAS-type method well 
account for static electron correlation, the remain 
dynamic correlation be decisive for quantitative results. 
A remain major drawback of exact-diagonalization 
scheme therefore be to include the contribution of all 
neglect virtual orbitals. 

CASSCF be traditionally implement a an exact di- 
agonalization method, which limit it applicability to 18 
electron in 18 (spatial) orbitals because of the steep scal- 
ing of many-electron basis state with the number of elec- 
trons and orbitals [39]. The polynomially scale density 
matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm [40] 
can push this limit to about 100 spatial orbitals. This, 
however, also come at the cost of an iterative procedure 
whose convergence for strongly correlate molecule is, 
due to the matrix product state representation of the 
electronic wave function, neither easy to achieve nor be it 
guaranteed. The groundstate energy output by quan- 
tum computer simulation be not affected by these is- 
sues, but present other accuracy consideration that we 
quantify below.

Ways quantum computer will help solve these 
problem 

As long a molecular structure optimization cannot be 
efficiently implement on a quantum computer, this task 
can be accomplish with standard DFT approaches. 
DFT optimize molecular structure be in general re- 
liable, even if the correspond energy be affected 
by large uncontrollable errors. The latter problem can 
then be solve by a quantum computer that implement 
a multi-configurational (CAS-CI) wave function model 
to access truly large active orbital spaces. The or- 
bitals for this model do not necessarily need to be op- 
timized a natural orbitals can be take from an unre- 
stricted Hartree-Fock [41] or small-CAS CASSCF calcu- 
lation. Clearly, the miss dynamic correlation need 
to be implemented. This can be do in a ’perturb- 
then-digonalize’ fashion before the quantum computa- 
tions start or in a ’diagonalize-then-perturb’ fashion, 
where the quantum computer be use to produce the 
higher-order reduce density matrix required. The for- 
mer approach, i.e., built-in dynamic electron correlation, 
be considerably more advantageous a no wave-function- 
derive quantity need to be calculated. One option for 
this approach is, for example, to consider dynamic cor- 
relation through DFT that avoids any double counting 
effect by virtue of range separation a have already be 
successfully study for CASSCF and DMRG [42, 43]. 
Fig. 2 present a flowchart that describes the step of a 
quantum-computer assist chemical mechanism explo- 
ration. Moreover, the quantum computer result can be 
use for the validation and improvement of parametrized 
approach such a DFT in order to improve on the latter 
for the massive pre-screening of structure and energies. 

II. QUANTUM SIMULATION OF QUANTUM 
CHEMICAL SYSTEMS 

From among a number of different approach to de- 
termine energy of ground state on a quantum com- 
puter [13, 44], we focus on quantum phase estimation 
(QPE). If we take the time evolution of an eigenstate to 
be e−iHt|n〉 = e−iEnt|n〉 then the task of QPE be to learn 
the phase φ = Ent in a manner analogous to a Mach– 
Zehnder interferometer. If QPE be apply to a trial state 
that be a superposition of eigenvectors, it collapse the 
state to one of the eigenstates and will collapse it to the 
ground state with high probability if the trial state have a 
large overlap with the ground state. See Appendix F for 
a discussion of state preparation approach in quantum 
simulation. 

In practice, e−iHt must be decompose in QPE 
into elementary operations. There be several meth- 
od know for achieve this [45–47]; here we fo- 
cu on the Trotter–Suzuki (TS) decomposition and 
specifically the second-order TS formula, which for the 
second-quantized Coulomb Hamiltonian take the form 

e−iHt = 
(∏M 

j=1 e 
−iHjt/2r 

∏1 
j=M e 

−iHjt/2r 
)r 

+ O(t3/r2). 

In the limit r → ∞ this approximation becomes ex- 
act. Well-known method exist for implement each 
e−iHjt/2r arise in a second-quantized formulation us- 
ing a sequence of elementary gate and single-qubit ro- 
tations [11]. These rotation dominate the cost of the 
quantum simulation. 

Circuit synthesis and quantum error correction 

While exist estimate of the cost of quantum sim- 
ulation have take these rotation to be intrinsic quan- 
tum operations, do so belies the cost of perform 
the computation fault tolerantly. To achieve reliable re- 
sults, fault tolerant implementation of the algorithm be 
crucial. Fault tolerance be achieve by encode a sin- 
gle logical qubit in a number of physical qubits with a 
quantum error-correcting code, such a the surface code 
[48]. This redundancy protects the logical qubit against 
decoherence and other experimental imperfections. 

Quantum error correction cannot directly protect any 
arbitrary quantum operation, such a arbitrary rotations. 
Fortunately, however, it can protect a discrete set of 
gates, from which any continuous quantum operation can 
be approximate to within arbitrarily small error [49]. 

Approximation take two steps. First the exponen- 
tials in the Trotter formula be decompose into single- 
qubit rotation and so-called Clifford gates. In the sur- 
face code, which we consider here, Clifford gate can be 
implement fault tolerantly. The single-qubit rotations, 
however, require approximation by a discrete set of gate 
consist of Clifford operation and at least one non- 
Clifford operation, usually take to be the T gate, a ro- 
tation by π/8 about the z-axis. Each T gate require a 
procedure call magic state distillation, which consumes 
a host of noisy quantum state to output a single accu- 
rate magic state. The magic state be then use to tele- 
port a T gate into the computation [50]. The space and 
time overhead of state distillation render it by far the 
most costly aspect of quantum error correction, lead 
to a large multiplicative overhead for each single-qubit 
rotation. The number of T gate therefore typically dom- 
inates the cost when implement a fault tolerant algo- 
rithm. 

III. RESOURCE ESTIMATES 

We now show that the resource require to elucidate 
reaction mechanism on quantum computer not only 
scale polynomially, but also that the calculation be fea- 
sible on a relatively small quantum computer in reason- 
able time. These resource estimate be base on extrap- 
olations from the cost found from simulation of small 
molecule (for loose upper bound see Appendix C) and 
focus on two protoypical structure of FeMoco that be

electron in 57 spatial orbitals (see Supporting Material for 
further details). These runtimes and gate count be likely to 
exceed the actual requirements. 

typical of the complexity of those that naturally would 
arise when probe the potential energy landscape of the 
complex to find the reaction rates. Our work differs from 
previous study in that we not only look at an important 
target for simulation but we also examine it within a ba- 
si set that be reasonable match for the target accuracy 
require (see Appendix J). 

We first estimate the runtime of the computation as- 
sum a quantum computer can perform a logical T gate 
every 10 ns, Clifford circuit require negligible time and 
that a good trial state for the ground state be available. 
We then determine the cost of perform this simula- 
tion fault tolerantly use the surface code, such that 
each physical gate take 10 ns. 

For chemical significance, we aim to compute the en- 
ergies with a total error of at most 0.1 mHartree, add 
up all source of systematic and statistical error (see Ap- 
pendix E). These error include the error in phase esti- 
mation, the error in the Trotter–Suzuki deocomposition 
and error from decompose the Trotter–Suzuki approx- 
imation into H and T gates. We then optimize over these 
three cost to find the most efficient way to divide the 
error budget up over these three sources. We also con- 
sider a large error of 1 mHartree that would still put 

our approach into the accuracy range of standard state- 
of-the-art quantum chemical method for simple (mono- 
nuclear) transition metal complexes. 

Three concrete implementation of the quantum algo- 
rithm be consider here. In the first approach, call 
Serial, the single-qubit rotation be constrain to occur 
serially. In a second approach, call Nesting, Hamilto- 
nian term that affect disjoint set of spin orbitals be exe- 
cut in parallel, which substantially reduces the runtime 
of the calculations. In the third approach, programmable 
ancilla rotation (PAR), rotation be cached in qubits, 
which be then teleport into the circuit a need [12]. 
For each approach, the overall cost be found by decom- 
pose the rotation into Clifford and T gate use [51] 
for the serial case and [52] in the other two cases. 

The cost at a logical level, show in Table I for sim- 
ulation of two different structure of FeMoco in different 
charge and spin state (see Appendix J for details) be 
within reach of a small scale quantum computer. If all 
gate be execute in series then we estimate that the 
simulation will complete in under a year and use a small 
number of logical qubits. PAR can reduce the time re- 
quired to several day at the price of require nearly 
20 time a many logical qubits. Nesting give a reason- 
able tradeoff between the two and may be the prefer 
approach. Finally, if we focus on learn qualitatively 
accurate reaction rate then the cost drop by roughly a 
factor of 10 in all examples. Further detail can be found 
in the appendix. 

Resource requirement with quantum error 
correction 

We next add the overhead require to perform the 
simulation fault tolerantly and summarize the cost in- 
curred by perform the simulation of structure 1 use 
the surface code in Table VI. The underlie resource 
calculation follow [48]. These cost naturally depend on 
the physical error rate assume in the hardware, and we 
consider three case that correspond to (a) a near-term 
error rate of 10−3, (b) an error rate of 10−6 that might 
one day be feasible in superconducting qubits, but be ex- 
pected early on for topological quantum bit [53] and (c) 
an error rate of 10−9 that may be achievable for topolog- 
ical quantum computers. 

Rather than focus solely on the number of physical 
qubits we consider a fine-grained modular architecture 
for a quantum computer, sketch in Fig. 3, consist 
of a classical supercomputer interfacing with a quantum 
computer that consists of a main quantum processor and 
dedicate separate T factory and rotation factory to 
produce T gate and to synthesize rotations, respectively. 
Only the main quantum processor be a general purpose 
device, while the other factory be special purpose hard- 
ware that be expect to be easy to construct. 

We first observe in Table VI that the number of logical 
qubits in the main quantum processor be only of the order

FIG. 3. We show the architecture of a hybrid classi-

tions. The quantum computer act a an accelerator to the

of a hundred, which translates into ten of thousand 

to million of physical qubits – which be challenge but 
not out of reach for early devices. Most of the qubits 
be use in the T factories, which each need even few 
physical qubits than the main quantum processor. Even 
the number of T factory need to perform the serial 
calculation be reasonable, with only 202 such factory 
require in this case for an error rate of 10−3, and few 
for good qubits. After factor in the number of qubits 
need per T factory, we arrive at the conclusion that only 
105 to 106 physical qubits be need for the 10−6 and 
10−9 error rates. 

If we consider the parallelize with the PAR approach 
then these cost become much more daunting. The num- 
ber of T factory require increase by a factor of roughly 
1000 although the number of qubits require in each 
factory remains comparable. This explosion be due to 
the fact that PAR perform about one thousand time a 
many rotation a the serial code. The cost require by 
the nest approach, on the other hand, be much more 
modest and lead to only an order of magnitude increase 
in the number of qubits with a comparable reduction in 
runtimes. 

At low error rates, the total number of qubits require 
in both the serial and nest case be of the order of a 
million, which could even be envision a a single quan- 
tum processor. The case of 10−3 error or the PAR ap- 
proach require hundred of million to nearly a trillion 
physical qubits, which seem more daunting. However, 
consider a modular design where each factory require 
about one million physical qubits this be nevertheless cer- 
tainly within the realm of possibility for future gener- 
ations of quantum device and the potential economic 
benefit of solve chemical catalysis problem of indus- 
trial importance may offset the cost. 

IV. DISCUSSION 

While at present a quantitative understand of chem- 
ical process involve complex open-shell specie such 
a FeMoco in biological nitrogen fixation remains beyond 
the capability of classical-computer simulations, our work 
show that quantum computer use a accelerator to 
classical computer could be use to elucidate this mech- 
anism use a manageable amount of memory and time. 
In this context a quantum computer would be use to 
obtain, validate, or correct the energy of intermediate 
and transition state and thus give accurate activation 
energy for various transitions. 

We note that the require quantum compute re- 
source be comparable to that need for Shor’s fac- 
toring algorithm for interest 4096 bit numbers; both 
in term of number of gate and also physical qubits [48]. 
The complexity of these simulation be thus typical of 
that require for other target for quantum computing. 

We also observe that the resource require depend 

sensitively on gate error rates. Therefore robust qubits,

valuable for use a quantum computer to elucidate re- 
action mechanism for important chemical process such 
a the mode of action of nitrogenase. 

Chemical reaction that involve strongly correlate 
specie that be hard to describe by traditional multi- 
configuration approach be not just limited to nitro- 
gen fixation: they be ubiquitous. They range from 
small molecule activate catalyst for C-H bond break- 
ing, to those for hydrogen and oxygen production, carbon 
dioxide fixation and transformation to industrially useful 
compounds, and to photochemical processes. Given the 
economic and societal impact of chemical process rang- 
ing from fertilizer production to polymerization catalysis 
and clean energy processes, the importance of a versatile, 
reliable, and fast quantum chemical approach power by 
quantum compute can hardly be overemphasized. Par- 
allelising the quantum computation of the energy land- 
scape will be crucial to provide answer within a time-

Appendix A: Introduction to Quantum Computing 

Here we provide a brief review of quantum compute 
for those that be not expert in quantum computing. 
The aim of this review be to introduce the basic con- 
cepts and notation that be use in quantum compute 
a well a introduce quantum algorithm for simulate 
chemistry and also quantum error correction. For a more 
detailed exposition see [49]. These concept will be use 
in section B 1 where we discus quantum process such 
a phase estimation. 

1. Qubits and Quantum Gates 

In quantum computation, quantum information be 
store in a quantum bit, or qubit. Whereas a classical 
bit have a state value s ∈ {0, 1}, a qubit state |ψ〉 be a 
linear superposition of states: 

|ψ〉 = α|0〉+ β|1〉 = [ αβ ] , (A1) 

where the {0, 1} basis state vector be represent in 

Dirac notation (called ket vectors) a |0〉 = 
[ 
1 0 

]T 
, and 

|1〉 = 
[ 
0 1 

]T 
, respectively. The amplitude α and β be 

complex number that satisfy the normalization condi- 
tion: |α|2 + |β|2 = 1. Upon measurement of the quantum 
state |ψ〉, either state |0〉 or |1〉 be observe with proba- 
bility |α|2 or |β|2, respectively. 

Dirac notation be use largely because it contains an 
implicit tensor product structure that make express 
qubit state much easier. For example, that the four- 
qubit state |0000〉 be equivalent to write the tensor 
product of the four states: |0〉 ⊗ |0〉 ⊗ |0〉 ⊗ |0〉 = |0〉⊗4 = 
[ 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ] 

T 
. 

A general n-qubit quantum state life in a 2n- 
dimensional Hilbert space and be represent by a 2n×1- 
dimensional state vector whose entry represent the am- 
plitudes of the basis states. A superposition over 2n 

state be give by: 

|ψ〉 = 
2n−1∑ 
i=0 

αi|i〉, such that 
∑ 
i 

|αi|2 = 1, (A2) 



8 

where αi be complex amplitude and i be the binary rep- 
resentation of integer i. The ability to represent a su- 
perposition over exponentially many state with only a 
linear number of qubits be one of the essential ingredient 
of a quantum algorithm — an innate massive parallelism. 

In a quantum computation, unitary transformation 
be use to transform quantum state into other quan- 
tum states. In particular, the quantum state |ψ1〉 of the 
system at time t1 be related to the quantum state |ψ2〉 at 
time t2 by a unitary |ψ2〉 = U |ψ1〉. 

In general we cannot expect that a quantum computer 
can implement every unitary transformation on n qubits 
exactly because there be an infinite number of such 
transformations. Instead, gate model quantum comput- 
er use a discrete set of quantum gate (which can be 
represent a 2n × 2n unitary matrices) to approximate 
these continuous transformations. Any such set of gate 
be know a universal if any unitary transformation can 
be expressed, within arbitrarily small error, a a sequence 
of such gates. 

The gate set that we consider in this work include the 
follow gates: 

• the X gate which be the classical NOT gate that 
map |0〉 → |1〉 and |1〉 → |0〉. 

• the Hadamard gate H map |0〉 → 1√ 
2 

(|0〉+ |1〉) and 
|1〉 → 1√ 

2 
(|0〉 − |1〉). 

• the Z gate map |1〉 → −|1〉 and T be the fourth– 
root of Z, and can be use interconvert Z and X 
gate via HZH = X. 

• the Y gate map |1〉 → −i|0〉 and |0〉 → i|1〉. 

• the identity gate be represent by 11. 

• the two-qubit controlled-NOT gate, CNOT, map 
|x, y〉 → |x, x⊕ y〉. The correspond unitary ma- 
trice are: 

H = [ 1 11 -1 ] , X = [ 
0 1 
1 0 ] , Y = 

[ 
0 i 
−i 0 

] 
, Z = [ 1 00 -1 ] , 

T = 
[ 

1 0 
0 eiπ/4 

] 
, 11 = [ 1 00 1 ] , CNOT = 

[ 
1 0 0 0 
0 1 0 0 
0 0 0 1 
0 0 1 0 

] 
. 

Measurement be an exception to this rule; it collapse 
the quantum state to the observe value, thereby eras- 
ing any information about the amplitude α and β. This 
mean that extract information from a quantum sys- 
tem irreversibly damage a state. Consequently, although 
the exponential parallelism that quantum computer nat- 
urally posse be mitigate by the fact that most quantum 
computation will have to be repeat many time to ex- 
tract the necessary information about the output of the 
quantum algorithm. 

2. Quantum Circuit Synthesis 

In order to understand how the cost estimate of our 
algorithm be found it be important to understand how 
arbitrary unitaries can be convert into discrete gate 
sequences. For our purposes, we consider the Clifford + 
T gate library discuss above, but compilation into other 
gate set be also possible [54, 55]. The simplest case to 
consider be that of single qubit unitary synthesis where 
U ∈ C2×2. In such cases, an Euler angle decomposition 
exists such that, up to an irrelevant overall phase, 

U = eiαZHeiβZHeiγZ . (A3) 

Thus the problem of implement a single qubit trans- 
formation reduces to the problem of perform the ro- 
tation eiθZ = cos(θ)11 + i sin(θ)Z. The general case of 
U ∈ C2n×2n similarly reduces to instance of single qubit 
synthesis intersperse with entangle gate such a CNOT. 
Thus implement single qubit rotation can be see a 
an atomic operation on which compilation process for U 
be based. 

There be a host of method know for decompose 
rotation into Clifford and T gates. Perhaps the earli- 
est such algorithm be the Solovay–Kitaev algorithm [56], 
which provide an efficient method for perform this 
decomposition base on Lie–algebraic techniques. In re- 
cent years, much more efficient method for decomposi- 
tion have be discover that be base on number the- 
ory. These method require near–quartically few opera- 
tions than the Solovay–Kitaev algorithm would need [56] 
and be useful, if not necessary, for reduce the gate 
count of the simulation algorithm to a palatable level. 

In the absence of ancillae, the cost require to approx- 
imate an axial rotation within error � for the bad pos- 
sible input angle, C(�), be know to lie within the inter- 
val [52] 

4 log2(1/�)− 9 ≤ C(�) ≤ 4 log2(1/�) + 11. (A4) 

Subsequent work [57] have provide a method that have an 
average case complexity roughly 3/4 of this bad case 
bound and also have make the compilation process effi- 
cient [58]. 

More recent method have introduce the use of ancil- 
lae to reduce the cost of synthesis [51]. These method 
can substantially reduce the number of T gate require 
to perform the synthesis. This approach can reduce the 
scale of the average number of T gate need to im- 
plement an axial rotation 

C(�) ≈ 1.15 log2(1/�) + 9.2. (A5) 

This approach require one additional ancilla qubit. 
Asymptotically good method exist, such a repeat- 

until-success (RUS) synthesis with fallback [51], but these 
method do not outperform this method give the range 
of � that we require for the simulation to reach chemical 
accuracy. Further method such a PAR rotation [12] or 



9 

gearbox circuit [59] can be use to substantially reduce 
the T–depth of the simulation circuit at the price of re- 
quiring great parallel width. While we do not consider 
the impact of gearbox synthesis here, we will examine the 
cost and benefit of PAR rotations. 

An important issue arises when use such method for 
parallel execution. If several rotation be implement 
simultaneously on different qubits and RUS synthesis be 
use then the dominant contribution to the cost be give 
by the long sequence of gate use in each block of 
parallelize rotations. In particular, while RUS synthe- 
si reduces the expectation value by a factor of roughly 
4 from the bad case bounds, it be clear that when per- 
form many of them in parallel it be very likely that 
at least one of them will saturate the bound. For this 
reason we use upper bound on deterministic synthesis 
give by (A4), which have a good bad case scaling. 

3. Simulating Quantum Chemistry 

Our approach to quantum chemistry simulation 
closely follow the strategy propose in Ref. [9]. We be- 
gin by represent the quantum chemistry Hamiltonian 
in a second quantize form, keep track of the location 
of the electron by use the occupation of a discrete ba- 
si of spin-orbitals. Since a spin orbital can only contain 
one electron, such state be very natural to express in a 
quantum computer. Each spin orbital be assign a qubit 
where the state |1〉 corresponds to an occupy orbital 
and |0〉 an unoccupied orbital. 

These state be often described use creation and an- 
nihilation operator which obey a†|0〉 = |1〉, a†|1〉 = 0, 
a|1〉 = |0〉 and a|0〉 = 0. Since these operator correspond 
to create electrons, they must respect the symmetry 
appropriate for Fermions. The most important prop- 

erty be the anti–commutation property {a†i , aj} = δi,j . 
This mean that while it may be tempt to identify 
a† = (X − iY)/2, such a representation do not satisfy 
the anti–commutation relation for Fermionic operators. 
Instead, these creation and annihilation operator can be 
convert into Pauli operator use the Jordan–Wigner 
or Bravyi–Kitaev [60] transformations. 

In order to simulate the dynamic of the system we 
need to emulate the unitary dynamic that the system 
undergoes use a sequence of gate operations. This dy- 
namics be of the form e−iHt where 

H = 
∑ 
pq 

hpqa 
† 
paq + 

1 

2 

∑ 
pqrs 

hpqrsa 
† 
pa 
† 
qaras, (A6) 

Once these fermionic creation and annihilation operator 
be translate into Pauli operator using, for example, 
the Jordan–Wigner transformation then the Hamiltonian 
can be translate into a sequence of operation that in- 
dividually could be perform on a quantum computer. 
Well know circuit exist for perform the exponential 
yield by the Trotter–Suzuki formula [11, 14, 49]. 

The most direct method for estimate the ground- 
state energy be phase estimation (see Section B 1 for more 
detail). Phase estimation us quantum interference be- 
tween control execution of 11, e−iHt1 , e−iHt2 , . . ., to 
infer the eigenvalue of e−iHt. If t be small than π/‖H‖ 
this also directly yield the eigenvalue of H. Apart from 
the ability to directly sample from the eigenvalues, a fur- 
ther advantage to phase estimation be that it require 
O(1/�) application of e−iHdt to learn it eigenphase 
within error � with high probability. This be quadrati- 
cally good than bound on the variance that would be 
see from optimal classical sample method use an 
unbiased estimator. 

It be necessary to apply phase estimation on an ini- 
tial state that have large overlap with the ground state 
in order to find the ground-state energy with high prob- 
ability,. Specifically, if apply to an initial state |ψ〉 = 
ag|EG〉+ 

√ 
1− |ag|2 

∣∣E⊥G〉 then PE return an estimate of 
ground-state energy EG with probability |ag|2. The sim- 
plest state to use be the Hartree–Fock state, which only 
require apply a sequence of NOT gate to the state 
|0〉n, however configuration interaction with sufficiently 
high excitation may be require to achieve high overlap 
for system that have strong correlation in their ground 
states. We do not consider the cost of prepare such a 
state here, since such a cost of prepare a sufficiently 
accurate approximation to the ground state of FeMoco 
be difficult to determine in absentia of large scale quan- 
tum computers. We discus this issue in more detail in 
Section F. 

4. Quantum error correction 

Quantum hardware be far less robust to error a clas- 
sical hardware. Quantum error correction provide a way 
to reduce the error in the device without sacrifice the 
quantum nature of the system. Quantum error correct 
code require that the physical error rates, say of qubits, 
quantum gates, and measurements, be less than a give 
threshold value. This threshold value depends on the er- 
ror correct code be use and the type of noise of 
the system. If error rate be below the threshold, then 
error in the computation, refer to a the logical gate 
and logical qubits, can be make arbitrarily small at only 
a polylogarithmic overhead. 

The surface code be currently the most popular code 
due in part to it relatively high threshold of 1% [61]. 
Much of this enthusiasm have arisen because of evidence 
that exist superconducting quantum computer may 
already have error rate near this threshold [62]. This 
raise the hope that a fault-tolerant, scalable quantum 
computer may be just over the horizon. 

While quantum error correction promise the ability 
to perform arbitrarily long quantum computation on a 
noisy device, the resource require to execute such a 
fault-tolerant computation can be large if the system op- 
erates close to the threshold. The majority of the cost 



10 

of quantum error correction arises from the need to per- 
form a universal set of quantum gates. While protect 
so-called Clifford gate require very little overhead in 
the surface code, in comparison protect a non-Clifford 
gate, such a a T or Toffoli gate, require substantial 
resources. While several technique for produce fault- 
tolerant non-Clifford gate exist [63–66], here we focus on 
the use of magic state distillation in conjunction with the 
surface code [61]. Magic state distillation [50] take a in- 
put a set of noisy resource state and output a cleaner 
resource state. For the surface code, we must distll the 
T state a it cannot be implement directly in the code. 
Here we consider the 15− 1 distillation scheme of Bravyi 
and Kitaev [50], where 15 noisy input state with error 
rate p produce a single magic resource state with error 
rate roughly 35p3. 

Magic state distillation consists only of Clifford opera- 
tions, which can be implement easily within the surface 
code. 

Appendix B: Implementing Phase Estimation 

In this section, we discus how to implement the phase 
estimation protocol in quantum computers. This be im- 
portant to our subsequent estimate of the complexity 
of simulate nitrogenase’s FeMoco because phase esti- 
mation constitutes the outer most loop of the quantum 
simulation and hence be a major driver of the cost of the 
simulation. 

1. Phase Estimation 

Phase estimation be one of the most critical component 
of the quantum simulation algorithm. Without phase es- 
timation, the amount of simulation time need to esti- 
mate the ground-state energy would grow quadratically 
a �−2 with the precision � required. Since � be on the 
order of 0.1mHartree, the phase must be estimate for 
one time step of the evolution operator within an error 
0.1/r mHartree where r be the number of Trotter step 
required. If statistical sampling, rather than phase es- 
timation, be use to estimate the phase then on the 
order of 1012 experiment would be need to make the 
variance in the estimate sufficiently small. This would be 
impractical and so phase estimation be crucial for most 
large scale application in quantum chemistry. 

The standard quantum phase estimation algorithm [49] 
allows eigenvalue to be learn within error � with prob- 
ability at least 1/2 us a number of application of the 
unitary circuit, M(�), that be bound above by 

M(�) ≤ 16π 
� 
. (B1) 

This value be far from optimal time scale of π/�, but 
have the advantage of require neither measurement of 
the quantum system nor a classical computer to infer the 

|0〉 H Rz(Mθ) H 

|ψ〉 UM 

FIG. 4. This circuit be use in iterative phase estimation al- 
gorithms wherein the eigenvalue be infer from measure- 
ment statistics. 

most likely eigenvalue. We will also use this result below 
because it provide an upper bound on the cost of the 
optimal phase estimation algorithm. 

An alternative approach be to use iterative phase es- 
timation. Iterative phase estimation forgoes store the 
phase in a quantum register and instead us a classical 
inference algorithm to learn the eigenphase from mea- 
surements of an auxillary probe qubit that be iteratively 
measure and re-entangled with the system. Kitaev pro- 
pose the first variant of iterative phase estimation. The 
circuit use in this process be give in Fig 4. 

The ultimate limit that can be achieved, in term of 
the number of time the unitary be apply a a function 
of desire error tolerance, be give by [67–69] 

M(�) ≈ π 
� 
. (B2) 

Furthermore, Gaussian strategy such a RFPE [70] 
yield Bayesian Cramer–Rao bound that come close to 
saturate this: 3.3/�. As these bound be often satu- 
rat for likelihood function of this form [71] and be- 
cause the Gaussian assumption cause the user to throw 
away substantial information from high moment in the 
posterior distribution, we expect that (B2) represent the 
ultimate limit for phase estimation and that base on 
previous study the use of optimize policy [72–74] will 
enable performance that come close to saturate this 
limit. As a result we use M(�) ≈ π/(2�) a a surrogate for 
the expect performance of these optimize approaches, 
where the factor of 2 difference follow from an important 
optimization that hold for the case of quantum simula- 
tion algorithm that we discus in detail in the follow 
section. 

2. Controlled rotation 

While the previous discussion only show how to per- 
form a Z–rotation, we need to perform control Z– 
rotation to perform the phase estimation algorithm. 
Fortunately, there be well know method that can be 
use to perform such control rotation use a pair of 
rotation and two CNOT gates. A good approach, pre- 
viously show in unpublished work by Tsuyoshi Ito in 
2012, be give in Figure 5 and the validity of the circuit 
be proven in the follow lemma.

|c〉 −θ/2 

|ψ〉 θ/2 

FIG. 5. Low depth circuit for control Z–rotations where 
the θ gate represent eiθZ . 

Lemma 1. The circuit of Fig. 5 implement the con- 
troll operation Λ(RZ(2θ)) where the top most qubit be 
the control. 

Proof. Assume that |c〉 = |0〉 or |1〉 then the CNOT gate 
performs 

|c〉|ψ〉 7→ (Xc ⊗ 11)(a|00〉+ b|11〉). (B3) 

The rotation gate then prepare the state 

(aei(1−(−1) 
c)θ/2|c〉|0〉+ be−i(1−(−1) 

c)θ/2|c⊕ 1〉|1〉). (B4) 

Finally the CNOT gate yield the state 

|c〉(aei(1−(−1) 
c)θ/2|0〉+ be−i(1−(−1) 

c)θ/2|1〉) 
= (Λ(Rz(2θ))|c〉|ψ〉) . (B5) 

Therefore the circuit function properly for either |c〉 = 
|0〉 or |c〉 = |1〉. By linearity it be also valid for any 
input. 

This form of a control rotation be well suit for 
many quantum simulation application because it allows 
the control evolution to be replace with evolution 
that control only on the single qubit rotation in the cir- 
cuits for implement the individual term in the Hamil- 
tonian. However, it be not optimal here because we can 
implement a variant of a control rotation gate to in 
effect double the impact that the eigenphase have on the 
measurement probabilities. 

Lemma 2. Let U = 
∏Nexp 
j=1 Bj(11⊗Rz(φj))B

be unitary transformation and assume that it be chosen 

such that U† = 
∏Nexp

j then if U |φ〉 = 

eiφ then there exists a quantum protocol that us an M 
rotation and sample from a Bernoulli distribution such 
that the probability of the protocol output 0 be 

P (0|φ; θ,M) = 1 + cos(2M [φ+ θ]) 
2 

. 

Proof. Our proof be constructive and follow directly from 
the argument present informally in [75]. The idea 
behind the protocol be to replace every control ro- 
tation use in the circuit in Fig. 4 with the circuit in 
Fig. 6. Formally we denote this by replace the con- 
troll operation Λ(UM ) with WM , which be define such 
that W |0〉|ψ〉 = |0〉U |ψ〉 and W |1〉|ψ〉 = |1〉U†|ψ〉. Since 

XRz(θj)X = Rz(−θj), the operation W can be write 
a 

W = 

Nexp∏ 
j=1 

BjΛ(X)(11⊗Rz(−φj))Λ(X)B†j , (B6) 

where the controlled–not operation Λ(X) us the control 
qubit a it control and the qubit that Rz act on a it 
target. This circuit be show in Fig. 6. 

Applying (H⊗11)W (H⊗11) to the eigenstate |0〉|φ〉, such 
that U |φ〉 = eiφ|φ〉, yield

|0〉|φ〉(1 + e2i(θ−φ)M ) + |1〉|φ〉(1− e2i(θ−φ)M ) 

) 
, 

(B7) 
up to a global phase. The probability of measure the 
ancilla qubit to be zero be (1 + cos(2M(φ − θ)))/2 a 
claimed. 

Lemma 2 show that the number of rotation need 
to perform phase estimation be 1/4 the value that would 
be expect if circuit such a that of Fig. 5 be use 
(or 1/2 the cost in parallel settings). As an example, for 
the case of RFPE numerical experiment show that we 
can learn the eigenphase within error � with probability 
1/2 use 

M(�) ≈ 2.3 
� 
. (B8) 

In comparison, the ultimate low limit give by previous 
study becomes π/(2�) and the Bayesian Cramer–Rao 
bound give a low limit of approximately 1.6/� under 
the assumption of Gaussian prior make in RFPE [70]. 
Similarly the upper bound on the cost of traditional 
QPE in [49] become 8π/� rather than 16π/� if these cir- 
cuits be used. 

While the assumption that the underlie Trotter– 
Suzuki formula can be invert by simply invert the 
sign of the evolution time. Specifically, this assumption 
applies for the (2k + 1)th order Trotter-Suzuki formula 
for all k ≥ 1 but it do not apply to the second order 
formula unless further assumption be made. We can 
see this from the fact that N∏ 

j=1 

e−iHjt 

 N∏ 
j=1 

eiHjt 

 = 1 +O(t2). 
If we assume that we be interested only in the ground- 
state energy and the Hamiltonian be real value (like in 
the quantum chemistry application that we consider) 
then the error in assume that U† can be form by 
simply flip the sign be O(t3) [16], which be by no 
mean fatal but it could potentially contribute to the er- 
ror in Trotter–Suzuki decompositions. Whereas if the 
third (or higher) order Trotter–Suzuki formula be use 
then no such danger exists. This, along with the supe- 
rior bound proven for the error in the third order for- 
mula, provide the justification for use this formula in 
preference to the asymptotically equivalent second–order 
formula.

Appendix C: Trotter error 

Here we discus the issue of how error from the use 
Trotter Suzuki formula lead to systematic error in the 
ground-state energy estimate output by phase estima- 
tion. We further discus the methodology that we use 
to upper bound these error and also give empirical esti- 
mate of the scale of such errors.

A major source of error in most quantum simulation 
algorithm arises from the use of Trotter formula expan- 
sions. Such error can be make arbitrarily small but the 
need to make such error small then chemical accuracy 
mean that the cost of do so can substantially impact 
the time require to perform the simulation. In this ap- 
pendix we will provide a detailed discussion about how 
to bound the error in low–order Trotter formulas. 

Trotter error arise from the fact that the term in 
the Hamiltonian use in the expansion do not commute. 
In principle, the Zassenhaus formula provide everything 
that be need in order to understand the scale of these 
errors: 

e(A+B)t = eAteBte 
1 
2 [A,B]t 

2 

+O(t3), (C1) 

and thus 

‖e(A+B)t − eAteBt‖ ∈ O(‖[A,B]‖t2). (C2) 

Although this expression be useful in estimate the 
scale of simulation errors, the question that we’re in- 
terested in be somewhat orthogonal to this. Instead, we 
be interested in the error in estimate eigenvalues. The 
Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula, which be the dual to 
the Zassenhaus formula, can be use to estimate these 

errors. If H = 
∑L 
α=1Hα where the Hα correspond to 

term in (A6) then the second order Trotter–Suzuki for- 
mula (also know a the Straang splitting) give

(C4) 
This show that, to lead order, the error in the Strang 
splitting can be estimate by the ground–state expecta- 
tion value of a double commutator sum. Furthermore, 
since L ∈ O(N4) it be clear from this form that the error 
in the Trotter formula must scale at most a O(N10t2). 
It be not O(N12t2) because the commutator structure re- 
stricts two of the orbitals Hα and Hβ act on. Although 
this estimate can be compute in polynomial time, there 
be too many term for this to be reliably estimate for 
molecule on the scale of nitrogenase even use Monte 
Carlo method [19]. 

An upper bound on the asymptotic scale can be triv- 
ially found by apply the triangle inequality to (C4). 
This approach be not appropriate for our purpose be- 
cause we do not know apriori how large t must be for the 
lead order term to be dominant. As a result, we use 
the follow result, which be provably an upper bound 
on the error in the energy of the evolution: 

∆ETS/t 
2 ≤4 

∑ 
α,β,α′ 

‖Hα‖‖Hβ‖‖Hα′‖ 

× (δα>βδα′>β + δβ>αδα′,α)W (α, β, α′), 
(C5) 

where W (α, β, α′) be an indicator function that take the 
value 1 if and only if the correspond double commu- 
tator be non–zero. Note that this be slightly tighter than 
the bound use in (16) of [17]. 

There be several criterion that we know a priori lead to 
a double commutator vanishing: 

1. Hα′ and Hβ act on disjoint set of qubits. 

2. Hα act on a disjoint set of qubits from the set of 
qubits that Hα′ and Hβ act on. 

3. Hα′ and Hβ correspond to PP or PQQP terms. 

4. Hα′ and Hβ correspond to PR and PQQR term 
with the same P and R. 

5. Only one of [Hα, [Hβ , Hα′ ]], [Hβ , [Hα′ , Hα]] and 
[Hα′ , [Hα, Hβ ]] be non–zero accord to the prior 
rule (Jacobi identity). 

There be other symmetry to the term that can be 
use to argue that even more term be necessarily zero. 
Since we do not consider these properties, we overcount 
the contribution of any such term and so our estimate 
remains an upper bound. 

This bound be much more computable than the original 
expression, but be computationally challenge to com- 
pute exactly owe to the O(N10) term in the double 
commutator sum. The Cauchy–Schwarz inequality can 
be use to convert this expression into one that can be 



13 

compute in O(N4) operations, but do so can over- 
represent the influence of large term in the Hamilto- 
nian [17]. 

2. Empirical estimate of Trotter Error 

Given that computation of the matrix element of the 
error operator in (C4) be computationally challenging, 
we rely on Monte Carlo sample to estimate the up- 
per bound in (C5). Monte Carlo sample be much more 
effective here because the use of the triangle inequal- 
ity remove the alternate sign that we see when sum- 
ming the original series. We achieve this by draw M 
sample uniformly at random for {αj : j = 1 . . .M}, 
{βj : j = 1 . . .M} and {βj : j = 1 . . .M}. We then reject 
the sample if (δα>βδα′>β + δβ>αδα′,α)W (α, β, α 

′) = 0, 
and otherwise compute the product of the product of 
the norm of the three correspond Hamiltonian terms. 
If there be L term in the Hamiltonian and define 

Γ(α, β, α′) :=4‖Hα‖‖Hβ‖‖Hα′‖ 
× (δα>βδα′>β + δβ>αδα′,α)W (α, β, α′)

This implies that, for a fix h, if we wish to achieve error 
� in the eigenvalue of the Trotter–Suzuki expansion then 
it suffices to pick 

t =

. (C8) 

The variance in this estimator be 

L6Vα,β,α′(Γ(α, β, α′))t4

which implies use Chebyshev’s inequality that with 
probability great than 75% the sample error be less than

�2 
= 
L6Vα,β,α′(Γ(α, β, α′)) 

h2 
. 

(C10) 
In practice, uniform sample be not necessarily the 

best option because the importance of the different term 
can vary wildly within a class. For example, the one-body 
term tend to be much large than the two-body term 
but the two-body term be far more numerous. This 
mean that uniform sample can underestimate the con- 
tributions of such term because of their relative scarcity 
in the sample space. 

We combat this by sample from each type of dou- 
ble commutator. In particular, we sample over a class 

of double commutator such a [PQ, [PP,PQ]] and uni- 
formly draw PQ, PP and PQ term to estimate those 
term contribution to the overall error. The total error be 
then the sum of the estimate over all such classes. We 
use a minimum of 108 sample per class, which render 
the sample standard deviation in our estimate of the 
error less than 1%. 

The resultant bound can be see in Fig. 7 wherein we 
examine the predict Trotter number and the empiri- 
cally observe Trotter number for small molecules. The 
rough scale of the upper bound on the Trotter number 
that we see corresponds to N2.5 which be note in previ- 
ous numerical study [17], but owe to the scatter of the 
data due to the widely vary chemical property of the 
molecules, this scale should not be see a definitive. 
We observe that the upper bound seem to be roughly 
a factor of 10 000 time too loose for small molecules. 
For this reason we plot three reasonable extrapolation 
of the scale base on the numerical result for small 
molecules. The most pessimistic bound rescales the scal- 
ing extract from the upper bound such that all the data 
remains beneath the curve. The middle one rescales the 
upper bound data by the average discrepancy between 
the upper bound and the numerically compute exam- 
ples. The most optimistic curve be simply a polynomial 
fit to the numerical data that ignores the upper bound. 
We expect the middle curve to be the most realistic es- 
timates, but provide resource estimate for these three 
case below a well a result that follow from use the 
upper bound. 

Appendix D: Error propagation 

Here we provide proof of some basic result that we 
will use to propagate these error through the quantum 
simulation. These result be crucial for the cost esti- 
mate in the subsequent section because they show how 
large the bad case error can be in the eigenvalue es- 
timation give error of these magnitudes. It be worth 
note that we expect these result to yield substantial 
overestimate of the error because they do not consider 
the natural cancellation that be likely to occur in prac- 
tical eigenvalue estimation problems. 

Lemma 3. Let A and B be Hermitian operator act 
on finite dimensional Hilbert space such that ‖A−B‖2 ≤ 
� and A|ψA〉 = EA|ψA〉 and B|ψB〉 = EB |ψB〉 where EA 
and EB be the small eigenvalue of either operator 
then |EA − EB | ≤ �. 

Proof. Because A and B be Hermitian they satisfy the 
variational property meaning that 

EB ≤ 〈ψA|B|ψA〉. (D1) 

Since ‖A − B‖2 ≤ � it follow that there exists C such 
that ‖C‖2 ≤ 1 and A = B + �C. This implies that 

EB ≤ 〈ψA|A+ �C|ψA〉 = EA + �〈ψA|C|ψA〉. (D2)

FIG. 7. Trotter number (1/dt) need to reach 0.1 mHartree of accuracy assume no error from synthesis or phase estimation. 
Lines represent project upper bound base on current data. 

Thus 

EB − EA ≤ �〈ψA|C|ψA〉. (D3) 

If EA ≤ EB then we have from the definition of ‖ · ‖2 
that 

|EB − EA| ≤ �|〈ψA|C|ψA〉| ≤ �. (D4) 

Now assume that EB > EA. We then have 

EA ≤ 〈ψB |A|ψB〉. (D5) 

Then by repeat the same argument we conclude that 
|EB − EA| ≤ � regardless of the sign of EA − EB . 

Now we will go beyond this bound to show that the 
error scale in the eigenvalue of the unitary evolution 
generate by two similar Hamiltonians be no more patho- 
logical than the scale of error in the ground-state en- 
ergies. 

Lemma 4. Assume that for Hermitian bound opera- 
tor A and B act on a finite dimensional Hilbert space 
‖e−iAt − e−iBt‖2 ≤ tγ(t) for γ(t) a non–decreasing con- 
tinuous function of t on [0,∞) then ‖A−B‖2 ≤ γ(t). 

Proof. Using standard bound [49], we have that ‖e−iAt− 
e−iBt‖2 ≤ ‖A−B‖2t and furthermore from Taylor’s the- 
orem ‖e−iAt − e−iBt‖2 = ‖A− B‖2t + O([‖A− B‖2t]2). 

Therefore the former upper bound be tight in the limit 
a t → 0. By assumption ‖e−iAt − e−iBt‖2 ≤ tγ(t) for 
all t in a compact subinterval contain 0. Assume that 
limt→0 γ(t)/‖A − B‖2 < 1. This implies that there ex- 
ists a compact interval contain 0 such that for all t in 
this interval ‖e−iAt − e−iBt‖2 > ‖A− B‖2t, which lead 
to a contradiction because we have already demonstrate 
that ‖A−B‖2t be a tight bound on the error in this limit. 
Therefore γ(t) ≥ limt→0 γ(t) ≥ ‖A − B‖2 under the as- 
sumptions of the lemma.

Then use our assumption and standard inequality for 
the error in unitary operation [49] this error be at most 

[∆ETS(t) + (2M − 1)δ]t. (D7) 

Then apply Lemma 4 we have that ‖H − H̃(t)‖2 ≤ 
∆ETS(t) + (2M − 1)δ. The result then follow from ap- 
ply Lemma 3. 

These error bound apply for generic quantum simu- 
lation base on the second order Trotter formula (also 

know a the Strang splitting), however they apply in 
particular to the case of simulate quantum chemistry. 
We have already discuss the Trotter–Suzuki error for 
quantum chemistry in (C5). Even in the absence of de- 
coherence, a source of error inevitably come into our 
analysis from approximate the single qubit rotations. 
Now we need to show a result that bound the impact of 
such eigenvalue estimation. 

Lemma 5. For Hermitian H and t ≥ 0 let U(t) be a 
family of unitary operation such that ‖e−iHt−U(t)‖2 ≤ 
�t for all t ≥ 0, then for every t there exists a Hermitian 
operator H̃(t) such that U = e−iH̃t and ‖H−H̃(t)‖2 ≤ �. 

Proof. By take the principal matrix logarithm of U(t) 

it be clear that there exists H̃(t) such that U = e−iH̃(t)t. 
Furthermore, use standard inequality it be easy to see 

that ‖e−iHt − e−iH̃(t)t‖2 ≤ ‖H − H̃(t)‖2t. Because this 
bound be tight in the limit a t → 0, if � < ‖H − H̃(t)‖2 
then a contradiction be reach for t sufficiently small. 
Therefore since we require that the inequality hold for 
all t ≥ 0, ‖H − H̃(t)‖2 ≤ �. 

It be easy to see from the fact that there be a one to one 
mapping between the Hamiltonian term and the rota- 
tions perform in the circuit. Thus if the error in each 
such rotation be δt then the error in each term of the 
effective Hamiltonian be at most δ. This mean that the 
total shift in energy from circuit synthesis be at most Mδ.

let each e−iHjt/2 be implement use a unitary Uj(t) 

such that ‖Uj(t) − e−iHjt/2‖2 ≤ ∆synth for all t. The 
error in the ground-state energy that result from such a 
simulation be at most ∆ETS + (2M − 1)∆synth/t. 

Proof. The result then follow directly from Theorem 1 
and Lemma 5. 

This show that it suffices to choose synthesis error 
that shrink linearly with the timestep use in the Trot- 
ter decomposition. Since the cost of circuit synthesis of 
rotation in the the Clifford + T gate library scale log- 
arithmically with ∆synth/t [52]. 

Appendix E: Cost estimate for nitrogenase 

Fundamentally, two factor contribute to the cost of 
the quantum simulation (assuming that the user can pre- 
pare an exact copy of the ground state at negligible cost). 
The first be the cost of implement the Trotter decom- 
position of the Hamiltonian and the second be the number 
of time that the Trotter circuit must be repeat in the 
phase estimation algorithm. 

One might object that the number of time step re- 
quired in the Trotter–Suzuki decomposition also be a driv- 
ing factor in the cost. Of course the Trotter decomposi- 
tion be a major driver of the cost, but it come in only in- 
directly through the cost of phase estimation. This be be- 
cause, in principle, the phase estimation algorithm learns 
the eigenphases of a single Trotter step. The Trotter er- 
ror can be make arbitrarily small by choose shorter 
evolution times, but this in turn require the phase es- 
timation algorithm to take more steps. As the cost of 
phase estimation scale inversely with the desire uncer- 
tainty, this cause the cost to scale inversely with the time 
step use in the Trotter–Suzuki decomposition. Thus the 
cost of the simulation can be thought of a arise from 
only two sources, the cost of each depend on the error 
tolerance allow for all three contribution to the error. 

If we then define �1 to be the error in phase estimation, 
�2 := ∆ETS to be the error in the Trotter–Suzuki expan- 
sion and �3 := (2M−1)∆synth/t to be the error in circuit 
synthesis then it follow from the triangle inequality and 
Corollary 1 that the error in the ground-state energy be 
at most 0.1 mHartree if 

�1 + �2 + �3 ≤ � := 10−4Ha. (E1) 

In this section we will focus on the target of 0.1 mHa 
level of accuracy, which be appropriate for quantitative 
calculation of the reaction rates. 

We estimate the cost of the circuit use the number 
of T gate require in the algorithm, which be a function 

of the form

(E2) 
and then optimize over �1, �2 and �3 to minimize C sub- 
ject to the constraint in (E1). Here α be the scale con- 
stant for the phase estimation algorithm used, β be the 
Trotter number (or multiplicative factor by which t be 
decrease from 1 Ha−1) need to achieve an error of 
0.1 mHartree in the ground-state energy estimate and γ 
and δ be the constant use in the quantum circuit syn- 
thesis algorithm. Here M = 6.1× 106 for nitrogenase in 
the 54 orbital basis and M = 8.2× 106 for nitrogenase in 
the 57 orbital basis use the circuit of [9]. 

The true optimum of (E2) be difficult to find because 

of the factor of 
√

plify our optimization we instead choose �1, �2 and �3 to 
minimize

subject to the same constraint. The global optimum 
of (E3) can be found directly from calculus, which al- 
low near optimal parameter for (E2) to be found easily. 
The value of (E2) at these parameter be then an upper 
bound on the minimum of (E2) and so the estimate pro- 
vided remain upper bound (modulo assumption about 
the Trotter error). 

The “worst” case assumption in Table IV correspond 
to only use rigorously proven upper bound on the cost. 
These lead to estimate that be clearly extremely pes- 
simistic. Even give our optimistic assumption about 
the target computer, the bad case bound suggest be- 
tween million and ten of thousand of year depend 
on whether parallelism be used. 

The “pessimistic” assumption use empirical scaling 
for circuit synthesis and phase estimation and use the 
bad scale support from our bound on the Trotter 
error, but rescale by the ratio observe between the ac- 
tual Trotter number require and the theoretically pre- 
dicted ones. 

The “rescaled” case take the rigorous upper bound 
for nitrogenase and divide it by the average ratio ob- 
serve between the exact Trotter number and their up- 
per bound for the tractable molecule molecules. Rescal- 
ing the upper bound by a constant and apply least 
square fitting to find the most consistent constant yield 
similar results. We suspect these rescale estimate may 
provide the most realistic estimate of the Trotter number 
require to simulate nitrogenase. 

The “optimistic” assumption again use the same em- 
pirical scaling for PE and synthesis, but instead extrap- 
olate the average scale observe for the ensemble of 
molecule whose Trotter number we can compute and 
scale up the result so that all of the data lie beneath 
the curve. This scale be optimistic, a there be little 
evidence for a clear trend in the empirical data and the

out to 108 spin orbitals (54 spatial orbitals) or more. We 
provide this estimate because it provide the best scale 
that could reasonably be claimed to be support by the 
data. 

1. Variance-based estimate 

Such error arise from three sources: the systematic 
error in the TS decomposition �TS, the statistical er- 
ror tolerance for phase estimation �QPE, and the sta- 
tistical error in synthesize rotation from Clifford and 
T gate �Rot. We then require the total error to be

tie be then chosen such that the number of T gate

can be use within this expression for the error under 
the assumption that the error in QPE and synthesis 
be not adversarial. This approach be take with the 
estimate in the main body, wherein the three dominant 
cost be optimize against each other to minimize the 
resource need to achieve the 0.1 mHartree target. The

optimization process be exactly the same a that use 
to minimize the cost give in (E2), however a different 
constraint link the three error be used. This lead to 
modest reduction in the cost relative to the bad case 
bounds, which we provide in Tables IV and V. 

2. PAR circuit 

There be several approach that can be take to par- 
allelize rotations. The first, often coin nesting, be dis- 
cuss in [16, 76]. It involves take term that commute 
with each other in the Hamiltonian and group them 
together so that they can be execute simultaneously. In 
principle, this can lead to substantial reduction in the 
depth but in practice it be difficult to ass the perfor- 
mance of these scheme here because of the size of the 
molecule and the fact that we have chosen to restrict our- 
self to lexicographic ordering. This mean that if we 
be to estimate the impact that parallelization can bring 
to these calculation we need to introduce a method that 
can reduce the T–depth without change the order 
of term in the Trotter–Suzuki decomposition. 

The PAR method give a way to achieve this goal [12]. 
It work by teleport a rotation into a state with prob- 
ability 1/2 use only Clifford operation and a pre– 



18 

rotate ancilla. In the event that this method fails then 
instead of perform Rz(θ) it performs Rz(−θ). This 
can be correct by teleport a rotation Rz(2θ) into 
the qubit in question. Should this fail (and it will half the 
time) the rotation can be correct by teleport a rota- 
tion of Rz(4θ) and so on. This creates a geometric distri- 
bution of the number of pre–cached qubits need to per- 
form a give rotation. These rotation angle be know 
before hand and so can be prepared offline in parallel. 
Hence a logarithmic multiplicative overhead in space be 
need to guarantee that enough ancilla qubits be pre- 
par to perform the rotation with such high probability 
that it be unlikely that the cache of ancillae will ever be 
depleted. 

In order to bound the number of ancillae need in 
order to parallelize a factor of M rotation with high 
probability consider the follow protocol. 

• Divide the term in the Trotter expansion of the 
Hamiltonian into block consist of M sequential 
terms. 

• For each rotation angle θj in a give bloeck 
and each j = 0, . . . , n − 1, prepare the state 
Rz(2 

jθj)|+〉 in parallel for a predetermine value 
of n. 

• Implement each of the M (possibly sequential oper- 
ations) use programmable ancilla rotation use 
at most n attempts, if the PAR circuit fails in each 
attempt then a failure be say to have occurred. 

• If a failure occurs then implement the correct rota- 
tion and proceed to the next precached rotation. 

This protocol can be use to perform the desire rotation 
and it performance be summarize below. 

Theorem 2. There exists a protocol for implement- 
ing PAR rotation that cache M rotation of the form 
Rz(θj), Rz(2θj), . . . , Rz(2 

n−1θj) for j = 1, . . . ,M such 
that the expect number of rotation perform before a 
failure occurs be 

2n(1− (1− 2−n)M ). 

Proof. The proof be constructive. To see this consider the 
protocol discuss above. Such a protocol fails when all n 
PAR circuit fail for any of the M rotation cached, and 
a failure occurs when all n attempt at the rotation that 
have be precomputed be expended. The probability 
of such a failure be clearly 2−n because the PAR circuit’s 
success probability be independent and each attempt 
have success probability 1/2 [12]. 

From the geometric distribution, the probability that 
no failure occurs in M trial be then simply (1− 2−n)M . 
Similarly, the probability that a failure occurs after pre- 
cisely k attempt be 2−n(1−2−n)k−1. Since there be only 
M rotation in the cache any branch that have more than 

M success can only yield M rotations. This implies 
that the mean be 

M∑ 
k=1 

k2−n(1−2−n)k+M(1−2−n)M = 2n(1−(1−2−n)M ). 

(E4) 

A consequence of Theorem 2 be that a PAR cache of M 
rotation that further cache the correction operation for 
n failure can reduce the T–depth by a factor of 2n(1 − 
(1 − 2−n)M ). We can therefore adjust these parameter 
to substantially reduce the T–depth without add a 
prohibitive number of rotations. 

Note that a n→∞ (E4) approach M a expected. 
This suggests that take large n allows the PAR rota- 
tions to be paralellized more efficiently, but this come at 
the price of require more T gate and hence increase 
the overhead of quantum error correction. 

a. Factory approach 

A major challenge with PAR face cost it in a fault 
tolerant set be that all the non–Clifford operation 
can be prepared simultaneously and offline. This mean 
that if we take the cost model where only T gate be 
consider then we come to the absurd conclusion that 
the cost of all quantum simulation algorithm can be 
reduce to that of synthesize a single rotation. In order 
to prevent such absurd tradeoff we assume here that a 
delay of time equal to 1 T gate be include to model the 
measurement and feed-forward step that be need for the 
programmable ancilla rotation. This fix cost mean 
that even if all of the T–gates be precached before hand 
then the time require for the remainder of the simulation 
will never be zero. 

The above assumption lead to an alternative approach 
to implement PAR rotations, which we follow in the 
PAR cost in the follow a well a the main body. 
Rather than construct a large cache of rotation of- 
fline, it make sense to produce the rotation just in time. 
Specifically if the cost of synthesize a rotation be C T 
gate then it make sense to have nC factory constantly 
produce rotation state of the form Rz(2 

jθj)|+〉 for 
j = 1, . . . , n. Each of these nC factory be stagger 
such that one set of factory finish with their n state 
at least 1 cycle before the next rotation be needed. As 
soon a a set of factory finish it then proceeds on to 
the next set of rotation need (excluding those that be 
currently be generated). If a failure occurs, then the 
factory approach halt just like the traditional approach 
and wait for a rotation to be synthesize that applies 
the correct rotation online. 

Imagine for the moment that the PAR circuit succeed 
in C consecutive attempts. Since each attempt require 
time equivalent to a single invocation of a T gate and the 
cost of synthesis be C T gates, the first set of factory 



19 

will have finish produce their state before the last 
set applies theirs. This mean that with C such factory 
rotation state can be continuously generate even in the 
“worst case scenario” where each PAR circuit succeed on 
the first attempt. This be why in this set it do not 
make sense to use more than nC rotation factory give 
the assumption that the cost of each PAR attempt be 1 T 
gate and that the rotation for at most n failure be to 
be pre-cached. 

Theorem 3. The average time require per rotation 
to apply the factory–based PAR strategy, assume each 
PAR application require time at most equal to 1 T gate 
and all remain Clifford operation be free is( 

2− n+ 2 
2n 

) 
+ 
C + n 

2n 
. 

Proof. The probability of success in any PAR attempt be 
1/2 therefore the expect number of T gate that need 
to be apply before a solution be found be 

n∑ 
j=1 

j 

2n 
+ 
C + n

. (E5) 

The latter term give the expect impact of a failure, 
which occurs with probability 1/2n, make n PAR at- 
tempts and incurs a cost of C T gate in apply the 
fallback rotation. The result then follow from sum 
the geometric series. 

We use the above theorem to compute the expect 
time require by PAR under our assumption of the cost 
of feed forwarding. If such cost be neglect then the 
online cost of perform a PAR rotation be simply C/2n 

T gates. 

b. Nesting estimate 

Finally, we would like to reiterate that in both the se- 
rial and PAR cases, the cost be found by building the 
circuit correspond to the TS formula and counting the 
gate that compose it. The estimate for nest give 
in the main body be upper bound base on empirical 
estimate of the number of term that can be simultane- 
ously executed. We estimate this by take FeMoco and 
greedily group term that act on distinct set of spin 
orbitals. We specifically find that there exists a group 
that can simultaneously execute 26.43 term simultane- 
ously for strucure 1 and 27.83 for structure 2. These 
value roughly correspond to the optimal scale of N/4 
that can be achieve through this nest strategy. We 
then assume the quantum computer can simultaneously 
execute each of these commute group and find the cor- 
respond time by divide the T count by these factors. 

Rather than execute the group in LIQUi|〉 we use 
a simple upper bound on the number of Clifford gate 
that could arise from the grouping. We do this because 

the group strategy break the lexicographic order 
that lead to dramatic cancelation of the CNOT string 
that arise from the Jordan–Wigner decomposition. 

For the nest data, the number of timesteps need 
be assume to be the same a for the other cases, which be 
reasonable give that operator order tends to not have 
a dramatic impact on the error. Subsequent work will 
investigate the precise interplay that operator order 
have in nesting. 

Appendix F: State Preparation 

We discus in this section the issue of state prepara- 
tion, which be a major unanswered question that impact 
the cost of quantum simulations. While we do not dis- 
cuss these cost in detail in the rest of the paper, we 
discus below the issue that arise when use elemen- 
tary state preparation method base on couple cluster, 
configuration interaction or Hartree–Fock state a well 
a adiabatic state preparation. We also provide numer- 
ical result show that the ground state overlap with 
Hartree–Fock state scale for small molecule and dis- 
cuss the cost involve in adiabatic state preparation. 

1. Elementary state preparation method 

Although we cannot rigorously prove that elementary 
state preparation method such a Hartree–Fock states, 
unitary couple cluster or truncate configuration inter- 
action state (such a CISD or difference dedicate CI 
(DDCI) [77] states) will suffice for prepare a state with 
large overlap with the ground state, it be still important 
to ask how good simple ansatzes perform for numerically 
tractable cases. We provide some numerical evidence for 
small molecule show that the overlap of the true 
ground state with the Hartree–Fock ground state be not 
necessarily small. We leave similar study of the overlap 
for unitary couple cluster and truncate configuration 
interaction ansatzes for subsequent work. 

We see in Figure 8 that there be substantial overlap be- 
tween the Hartree–Fock state and the true ground state 
of the molecule calculate use LIQUi|〉 . In particu- 
lar, the small overlap that we see be 89%. Other stud- 
y that have look at chain of hydrogen atom that 
be near disassociation show very small overlap with the 
Hartree–Fock states. Thus there be small molecule that 
can be construct that be not well described by such 
ansatzes. 

We find weak evidence for a downward trend in the 
overlap with the Hartree–Fock state a the size of the sys- 
tem grows. Specifically, we see that roughly 50% of the 
data point be well approximate by 107.75%×e−0.0076n 
where n be the number of spin orbitals. This scale would 
suggest that the overlap with the Hartree–Fock state for 
a molecule typical of this ensemble of the scale of FeMoco 
may be roughly 43%, we cannot say whether nitrogenase

be indeed typical of this ensemble. Indeed, one may ex- 
pect strong correlation to be present for molecule that 
contain atom with d–electrons than those examine in 
Figure 8. Such molecule be frequently outside of our 
ability to simulate classically so find an appropriate 
ensemble of molecule to use for such benchmark re- 
main an open research problem; however, the success of 
method such a CI dynamically extend active space 
(CI-DEAS) [78, 79] in DMRG suggests that elementary 
truncate configuration interaction state may also suf- 
fice for quantum simulation [80]. 

We further see no compelling evidence for scale with 
the maximum nuclear charge of the constituent atom 
for the molecule in this set. This can clearly be see 
from BeH2 which have substantially good fidelity with 
the ground state than Be does. Similarly, HF and HCl 
have nearly identical overlap despite the fact that Cl 
have nearly twice the nuclear charge of F. More study 
be need in order to understand how these overlap 
scale for large molecules, however it be strongly suspect 
that multi–reference state will be require to accurately 
model highly correlate ground states. 

2. Adiabatic State Preparation 

Adiabatic state preparation [81] provide an alterna- 
tive approach state preparation wherein the Hamiltonian 
to be simulated be replace with a time–dependent Hamil- 
tonian whose final ground state coincides with the target 
ground state and whose initial ground state be an easily 

preparable state. An example of such a Hamiltonian be 

H(s) =

) 
, 

(F1) 

where s ∈ [0, 1] be a dimensionless time that be 0 at the be- 
gin of the evolution and 1 at the end. It be then easy 
to see that the ground state of H(0) be the Hartree–Fock 
state and the ground state of H(1) be the full configura- 
tion interaction (FCI) ground state. 

For such Hamiltonians (or more generally for those 
that be differentiable at least three time and whose re- 
sulting derivative be O(1) [82]) a sufficiently slow evolu- 
tion under the Hamiltonian will cause the Hartree–Fock 
state to be transform into the FCI ground state of H. 
In other word if T be the time–ordering operator which 
be define such that 

∂sT (e−i 
∫ s 
0 
H(s′)ds′T ) := −iH(s)T (e−i 

∫ s 
0 
H(s′)ds′T ) (F2) 

and if we define P to be a projector onto the FCI ground 
state and ∆(s) to be the small eigenvalue gap between 
the ground state and the rest of the spectrum of H(s) 
then 

|(11− P)T (e−i 
∫ 1 
0 
H(s′)ds′T )|ψHF〉| ∈ O 

( 
max ‖Ḣ(s)‖ 
min ∆2(s)T 

) 
. 

(F3) 
Here we take T � 1 and treat the other parameter 
to bound above by a constant in this asymptotic ex- 
pansion. For such Hamiltonians the triangle inequality 
clearly show that ‖Ḣ(s)‖ ∈ O(N4) (although on phys- 
ical ground we expect ‖ ˙H(s)‖ to be in O(η2) ∈ O(N2) 
because the potential energy scale quadratically with 
the number of constituent particles). Thus if we want to 
have O(1) probability of prepare the FCI ground state 
it suffices to simulate the time–dependent Hamiltonian 
H(s) for time 

T ∈ O 
( 

N4 

min ∆2(s) 

) 
. (F4) 

Prima facie, the best know bound on the cost of 
Trotter–Suzuki base simulation give the circuit size for 
such a simulation to be [83, 84] 

Noperations ∈

, (F5) 

where h ≥ max{|hpq|, |hpqrs|}. If we take h ∈ O(1), this 
rigorous bound suggests that the cost of adiabatic state 
preparation may be prohibitively expensive even if the 
eigenvalue gap be constant, it be important to note that 
this upper bound on the norm of the derivative of H be 



21 

expect to be extremely loose and the scale of the 
error in the Trotter–Suzuki formula be expect to be 
much good than the scale quote above. 

If we take the depth of second-order Trotter–Suzuki 
formula simulation of real molecule to scale a O(N5.5), 
a observe in previous study [17], and take the norm of 
the Hamiltonian to scale a O(N2) a anticipate asymp- 
totically for a local basis [85] then the scale that arises 
from use the second–order Trotter formula for time– 
dependent Hamiltonians [83] would be 

O 

( 
h3/2N8.5 

min ∆3(s) 

) 
. (F6) 

If h ∈ O(N−2) then this scale reduces to 
N5.5/mins ∆ 

3(s), which be expect if the two body 
term dominate the cost of the Trotter–Suzuki decom- 
position. This mean that even after make empirical 
assumptions, highly gapped adiabatic path be likely to 
be necessary for adiabatic state preparation to be useful. 

It be worth mention that adiabatic state preparation 
have be investigate for other system and in these set- 
ting it have be found to be a highly practical method of 
state preparation [20, 75]. Although it should be note 
that the path use from the initial Hamiltonian to the 
final Hamiltonian be often non-trivial. These observa- 
tions suggest that the above complexity analysis may be 
quite loose. Further work be need to good estimate the 
cost of adiabatic state preparation for realistic molecule 
and also the cost of learn optimal adiabatic path from 
easily preparable Hamiltonians to the FCI Hamiltonian. 

Appendix G: Cost estimate for topological qubits 

In this section we will examine the impact topolog- 
ical quantum compute may have on these numbers. 
This be important because the fault tolerant overhead 
quote in the main body depend sensitively on the error 
rate. Topological quantum compute promise to pro- 
vide physical error rate that be order of magnitude be- 
yond what be achievable in alternative platforms; however 
there be a catch. Much of the current research underway 
focus on topological quantum compute use Ising 
anyons, which provide topological protection for Clifford 
operation but do not provide protection for T gates. This 
mean that even if we achieve very low error rate use 
this technology then the cost of magic state distillation 
may not be reduce dramatically despite the quality of 
the Clifford gate that topological quantum compute 
affords. We examine this by model the error in gen- 
erating the T state to be 10−4 and then consider the 
cost of use the surface code to distill the necessary 
gates. We provide the data for this scenario in Table VI. 

The data in Table VI show that even in this set 
assume low quality magic state do not remove the 
benefit of topological protection for the Clifford opera- 
tions. In particular, if we look at the saving in physical 
qubits that occur from go from error rate 10−6 to 10−9 

we see in the data in the main body that roughly an or- 
der of magnitude separate the two number of physical 
qubits. In contrast, if we assume the low quality magic 
state give above then the reduction be more modest: 
they be roughly a factor of 5. This show that while 
have high fidelity magic state be ideal, even if such 
state be low quality then a topological quantum com- 
puter with protect Clifford operation can nonetheless 
see advantage from have topologically protect gate 
at the level of accuracy require to simulate nitrogenase. 

Appendix H: FeMoco — the active site of 
nitrogenase 

In this section we provide more background on the im- 
portance of biological dinitrogen fixation and on the ac- 
tive site model of nitrogenase prepared in different charge 
and spin state apply in the feasibility analysis of this 
work. 

For decades, a Holy Grail in chemistry have be 
the catalytic fixation of molecular nitrogen under am- 
bient conditions. Less than half a dozen synthetic cata- 
lysts have be developed for this purpose [25–27] (after 
decade of fruitless efforts). All of them suffer from low 
turnover number and the synthetic dinitrogen-fixation 
problem under ambient condition can thus be consider 
largely unsolved. The process be of tremendous impor- 
tance for society a fertilizer be produce from ammo- 
nia, the final product of dinitrogen fixation. Industrially, 

ammonia be produce in the very efficient Haber–Bosch 
process, which, however, require high temperature and 
pressure (and consumes up to 2% of the annual energy 
production) [86]. 

While it currently appear unrealistic that this sim- 
ple heterogeneous process will be replace by a sophisti- 
cat synthetic homogeneous catalyst, which be likely to 
be less stable and expensive to produce, a mono- or poly- 
nuclear iron-based catalyst work under ambient condi- 
tions and feed on an easily accessible source for ’hydro- 
gen’ (and dinitrogen from air) could become important 
for local small-scale fertilizer-production concepts. 

In any case, nitrogen fixation represent a tremendous 
chemical challenge to activate and break the strong triple 
bond in dinitrogen at room temperature and pressure. 
Nature found an efficient way to achieve this goal. It 
be accomplish by the enzyme nitrogenase whose active 
site, the iron–molybdenum cofactor FeMoco, consists of

seven iron atom and one molybdenum atom, which be 
clamped together by bridging sulfur atom [87]. The 
complete structure of the FeMoco be solve only very 
recently when a central main-group atom be discov- 
ered [88] that, surprisingly, turn out to be a carbon 
atom [23, 24, 89]. The complex electronic structure of 
this cluster of open-shell iron atoms, the possible charge, 
spin, and protonation state a well a the different lig- 
and binding site to be consider make this active site 
a nightmare for electronic structure calculations, which 
be the basis of all theoretical approach toward the elu- 
cidation of the mode of action of metalloenzymes such a 
nitrogenase. 

It be thus no surprise that the specific mechanism of 
dinitrogen reduction at this active site have be elusive, 
especially give the fact that the mechanism of nitro- 
genase be difficult to study experimentally. Computa- 
tional approach suffer from the static electron corre- 
lation problem. For two ammonia molecule to be pro- 
duced, the transfer of six proton and six electron be re- 
quired per dinitrogen molecule (in fact, eight proton and 
eight electron be need a one dihydrogen molecule 
be produce stoichiometrically). The transfer of these 
highly reactive agent lead to many stable intermediate 
and side product (see, for example, the analogous dis- 
cussion of these step in Ref. [28] for the first synthetic 
dinitrogen-fixating complex by Yandulov and Schrock). 
To elucidate the mechanism of nitrogenase, which be im- 
portant for a good understand of the activation of 
inert bond by synthetic catalysts, therefore require the 
consideration of a very large number of molecular struc- 

tures. 
While molecular structure of stable intermediate and 

transition state may be optimize within unrestricted 
Kohn–Sham DFT, the calculation of their energy de- 
mands an accurate wave-function-based approach. We 
therefore optimize molecular structure of a FeMoco 
model in the rest structure (Fig. 1 (right) in the 
main article) for vary charge and spin state in or- 
der to create different electronic situation that challenge 
the feasibility analysis present in this work. For these 
structures, integral in a molecular orbital basis have 
be obtain that parametrize the electronic structure 
of the cluster in the second-quantized quantum-chemical 
Hamiltonian of Eq. (A6). 

Appendix I: Exact diagonalization technique in 
chemistry 

The electronic structure of a molecular structure de- 
termines it reactivity. Predicting chemical reaction re- 
quire the solution of the electronic Schrödinger equa- 
tion to obtain the electronic energy and wave function. 
Whereas the expansion of the many-electron wave func- 
tion into a (quasi-) complete many-electron basis will 
produce the exact solution, call full configuration inter- 
action in chemistry or exact diagonalization in physics, 
this approach be unfeasible for molecule of more than a 
few atoms. As all standard quantum-chemical solution 
approach construct many-electron basis function from 
orbitals, the number of the former be determine by the 



23 

number of the latter. Exact diagonalization be therefore 
limited to about 18 electron distribute among 18 spa- 
tial orbitals due to the exponential scale of the many- 
electron basis state with the number of orbitals [39]. 
Unfortunately, the size of an orbital basis be already very 
large for moderately size molecules. As a consequence, 
a restrict orbital space must be chosen. 

Of all approximation developed in quantum chem- 
istry to overcome this problem [36] the complete-active- 
space self-consistent-field (CASSCF) approach (and re- 
lated models) utilizes exact diagonalization, but, because 
of the exponential scaling, in a reduce orbital space, the 
so-called CAS, that selects orbitals around the Fermi en- 
ergy. To compensate for this approximation, the orbitals 
be relaxed self consistently, hence the name. Still, the 
CAS be limited by the 18-orbital wall and by the neglect 
of most of the (virtual) orbitals for the construction of 
the wave function. Considering the fact that molecule of 
a hundred atom or more quickly require much more than 
a thousand one-electron basis function for an accurate 
description of their electronic structure, most of the or- 
bitals construct from these basis function be omit 
in the construction of a CASSCF wave function. Even 
iterative technique such a the density matrix renormal- 
ization group (DMRG), which can be understood a a 
polynomially scale CASSCF approach, can push this 
wall only to about a hundred spatial orbitals. 

As a result, a CASSCF-type wave function solves only 
the so-called static electron correlation problem. It be 
therefore particularly well suit for molecular structure 
with near-degenerate orbitals. The result electronic 
structure be only qualitatively well described. However, 
this feature be maintain throughout a reaction coordi- 
nate, which make a CASSCF-type approach an appeal- 
ing universal approach. For a quantitative description, 

the many virtual orbitals not consider for the CAS 
make a nonnegligible contribution to electronic-energy 
differences. To account for this so-called dynamic cor- 
relation be mandatory and typically achieve by a sub- 
sequent multi-reference perturbation theory calculation. 
Such perturbation theory to second order require el- 
ements of the three- and four-electron reduce density 
matrices, which be difficult to calculate and to store. 

Instead of this ’diagonalize, then perturb’ approach, 
also ’perturb, then diagonalize’ idea have be study 
in chemistry. These latter approach produce a ’dressed’ 
many-electron Hamiltonian which be then good condi- 
tioned for a CASSCF-type approach. A new develop- 
ment in this area be the combination of density functional 
theory (DFT), know to describe dynamic electron cor- 
relation well with a CASSCF-type approach by spatial 
range separation introduce by Savin (see Refs. [42, 43] 
and reference cite therein). Range separation be ac- 
complished for the electron–electron interaction matrix 
element and allows one to apply DFT at short range, 
whereas at long range the full flexibility of a CASSCF- 
type wave function can be exploited. This approach be 
very efficient and do not compromise the efficiency of 
a CASSCF-type approach (by contrast to perturbation 
theory). In combination with the polynomially scale 
DMRG, this approach have deliver very promising re- 
sults [43] for benchmark reaction involve transition 
metal [4]. 

As a consequence, a chemically sensible exact diag- 
onalization technique be a CASSCF-type approach that 
capture dynamic correlation effect in the one-electron 
states. Such an approach could be directly implement 
on a quantum computer with the specific exact diagonal- 
ization technology developed for such a machine. 

What chemical problem will benefit from such an im- 
plementation? Clearly, these will be problem that be 
dominate by strong static electron correlation (rather 
than by weak dispersion interaction originate from dy- 
namic electron correlation). The electronic Schrödinger 
equation assigns an energy to a give molecular struc- 
ture in the Born–Oppenheimer approximation, and this 
electronic energy (evaluated at zero Kelvin without vi- 
brational, temperature, and entropy corrections) should 
dominate the energy change of a chemical process. 
Transition-metal catalysis be a field that present such 
situations. 

Many important chemical transformation be medi- 
ated by complicate electronic structure feature by 
transition-metal complexes. Especially late 3d transition 
metal be of this kind, most importantly iron, which be 
cheap and ubiquitous, often yield nontoxic compounds, 
and therefore represent an ideal catalytic center. More- 
over, stable intermediate and, in particular, transition 

state of a reaction mechanism often represent typical 
static electron correlation problem a bond be form 
and broken on the way to stable products. To reliably 
predict a chemical transformation of this kind usually 
require to study many more than one elementary reac- 
tion step — especially when reactive intermediate be 
involved. The number of stable intermediate also in- 
crease due to unwanted side reaction that need to be in- 
spected. Therefore, the total number of molecular struc- 
tures whose electronic energy be require for an under- 
stand of a reaction mechanism is, in general, very 
large. 

Clearly, all these structure must be optimize with 
an efficient quantum chemical method. While the ac- 
curacy of electronic energy obtain with present-day 
DFT approach be often not satisfactory for predictive 
purpose (see, e.g., Refs. [4, 90]), molecular structure 
can be reproduce with remarkable accuracy (obviously, 
a geometry gradient would replace DFT structures, too).

Hence, CASSCF-type method will mostly be require 
for the validation of electronic energy of DFT-optimized 
molecular structures, which be the essential piece of infor- 
mation for establish a reaction mechanism. 

Appendix J: Computational Methodology 

We optimize the structure of a FeMoco resting-state 
model that take those residue of the protein backbone 
into account which anchor the metal cluster in the en- 
zyme (see Fig. 1 (right) in the main article). Note that 
different spin and charge state be consider for the 
structure optimization in order to obtain a variety of elec- 
tronic structure for the assessment of a solution algo- 
rithm on a quantum computer. These spin and charge 
state do not necessarily match the one of the rest 
state of nitrogenase. 

Structure 1 for three positive excess charge and an 
equal number of α- and β-spins, and structure 2 for an 
uncharged FeMoco model with one unpaired α-spin. 

The Cartesian coordinate of these structure be col- 
lected in Tables VIII and IX. In these unrestricted DFT 
calculations, the spin symmetry be broken [91] and only 
Sz remains a a good quantum number. For these struc- 
ture optimization we chose the Turbomole program 
package (V6.4) [92] and employ the B3LYP density 

functional [93–96] with the def2-TZVP Ahlrichs triple- 
zeta basis set plus polarization function on all atom 
[97]. An effective core potential be chosen only for 
the molybdenum atom [98], which also take care of all 
scalar-relativistic effect on this heavy atom. 

Then, integral in the molecular orbital (MO) basis 
be produce MO integral for structure 1 be gen- 
erated for a CAS of 54 electron in 54 spatial CASSCF 
orbitals (108 spin orbitals), which be obtain from a 
singlet CASSCF calculation with 24 electron in 16 or- 
bitals. Accordingly, for structure 2 we generate MO 
integral for a CAS of 65 electron in 57 spatial CASSCF 
orbitals (114 spin orbitals) from a quartet CASSCF cal- 
culation with 21 electron in 12 orbitals. 

The choice of the large active space be base on 
Pulay’s UNO-CAS criterion [37, 99], in which the oc- 
cupation number of the natural orbitals serf a a 
selection criterion. However, rather than unrestricted 
Hartree–Fock natural orbitals, we select those small- 
CAS CASSCF natural orbitals in the occupation inter- 
vals [1.98,0.02] and [1.99,0.01], respectively. The molec- 
ular orbital integral for the second-quantized electronic 
Hamiltonian in these small-CAS orbital base be cal- 
culated with the Molcas program [39]. 

All setting for the calculation be summarize in Ta- 
ble VII.
