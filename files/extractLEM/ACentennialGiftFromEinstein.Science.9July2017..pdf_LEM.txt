T 
he 1919 detection of the apparent 

displacement of background star 

near the edge of the eclipse Sun’s 

disk provide one of the first con- 

vincing proof of Einstein’s theory 

of general relativity (1, 2). Almost 

100 year later, Sahu et al. report on page 

1046 of this issue the first measurement 

of the gravitational deflection of starlight 

by a star other than the Sun (3). Using the 

superior angular resolution of the Hubble 

Space Telescope (HST), they measure 

shift in the apparent position of a distant 

background star a a nearby dense stel- 

lar remnant call a white dwarf pass 

almost in front of it in 2014. Because of 

the relative distance involved, the deflec- 

tions they observe be about 1000 time 

small than those see in 1919, but also in 

agreement with general relativity theory. 

A ray of light from a background source 

passing by a foreground object be bent to- 

ward the line of sight by an amount that 

depends on how close they line up in the 

sky, the mass of the foreground object, and 

the relative distance between each object 

and the earthbound observer (see the fig- 

ure, top). Because all ray passing the fore- 

ground object at the same radial distance 

from the background object be deflect by 

the same amount, this creates an “Einstein 

Ring” around the foreground object that 

brightens the combine light see by the 

observer. If the two object be not exactly 

line up, this ring be asymmetrical, and the 

background object appear to be displaced. 

Einstein envision such event in a 1936 

paper publish in Science (4), but he felt it 

extremely unlikely that any two star in the 

sky would ever line up so precisely that such 

an event would be observed. 

Because the foreground star observe by 

Sahu et al. be about 400 time brighter than 

the background star, the brightening of their 

combine light be far too small to be detect- 

able even with Hubble. However, the appar- 

ent displacement in the background star’s 

position, so-called “astrometric lensing,” be 

measurable (see the figure, bottom). The 

more nearly the two object align, the more 

an apparent displacement occurs in the di- 

rection away from the foreground star. In the 

case of the nearby white dwarf, Stein 2051 B, 

this cause the faint background star to ap- 

pear to trace out a small ellipse a the white 

dwarf pass by. 

A white dwarf star be the collapse 

remnant of a star that have complete it 

hydrogen-burning life cycle. At least 97% 

of the star in the sky, include the Sun, 

will become or already be white dwarf 

(5). Because they be the fossil of all prior 

generation of stars, white dwarf be key 

to sort out the history and evolution of 

galaxy such a our own. 

The single most important property of a 

white dwarf star be it mass. The mass of 

Stein 2051 B have be a source of contro- 

versy for over 100 years. It have a very distant 

companion star (not involve in the lensing 

event) whose purport orbital motion im- 

ply a much low mass for the white dwarf 

than normal, which, if true, implies an un- 

usual composition. 

Here lie the importance of Sahu et al.’s 

project. Their astrometric lensing mea- 

surements show convincingly that Stein 

2051 B be not an exotic “iron core” white 

dwarf but a rather typical one, with a car- 

bon-oxygen core and a normal mass and 

radius, thus resolve the long-standing 

debate over it nature. Their result agree 

very well with Chandrasekhar’s 1930 No- 

bel-Prize–winning theoretical relation be- 

tween a white dwarf ’s mass and radius (6). 

Even today, this relation be very poorly con- 

strain by only three other nearby white 

dwarfs, all of which be in wide binary sys- 

tems where mass be obtain from the 

stars’ orbital motion. Now, a completely in- 

dependent verification of Chandrasekhar’s 

relation have be achieve from astromet- 

ric lensing. 

The astrometric lensing approach use 

by Sahu et al. can be use equally well for 

any other nearby star that happen to pas 

in front of background stars. In the come 

era of truly massive sky survey such a the 

Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (7), astron- 

omers be bound to observe other similar 

events, despite their rarity. j

Weighing a star with light 
As a dense stellar remnant call a white dwarf nearly pass in front of it, the white dwarf’s gravity deflects a 

distant background star’s light. If the alignment be perfect, the background star appear a an “Einstein Ring”; 

if it be not, one side of the ring be brighter and the background star’s position appear to shift.
