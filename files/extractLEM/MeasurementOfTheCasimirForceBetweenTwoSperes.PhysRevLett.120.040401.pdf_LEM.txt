Complex interaction geometry offer a unique opportunity to modify the strength and sign of the 
Casimir force. However, measurement have traditionally be limited to sphere-plate or plate-plate 
configurations. Prior attempt to extend measurement to different geometry rely on either nano- 
fabrication technique that be limited to only a few material or slight modification of the sphere-plate 
geometry due to alignment difficulty of more intricate configurations. Here, we overcome this obstacle to 
present measurement of the Casimir force between two gold sphere use an atomic force microscope. 
Force measurement be alternate with topographical scan in the x-y plane to maintain alignment of the 
two sphere to within approximately 400 nm (∼1% of the sphere radii). Our experimental result be 
consistent with Lifshitz’s theory use the proximity force approximation (PFA), and correction to the PFA 
be bound use nine sphere-sphere and three sphere-plate measurement with sphere of vary radii.

In 1948, Hendrik Casimir derive an expression for 
the force between two uncharged, parallel plate result 
from a modification of the quantum electromagnetic 
vacuum energy [1]. Yet, only a few measurement have 
be perform in the original plate-plate configuration due 
to difficulty in maintain parallelism [2,3]. Instead, a 
sphere-plate geometry be typically employ [4–8], and 
comparison between experiment and theory be perform 
use the proximity force approximation (PFA) [9] to 
model curve surface a a series of parallel plates. 
However, this approximation fails for sharp edge 
[10,11] and be predict to have perturbative correction 
for smooth surface [12–14]. In some situations, exact 
calculation predict repulsion even when the PFA do 
not [15,16]. 
Two experimental technique have emerge to extend 

Casimir force measurement beyond the sphere-plate and 
plate-plate geometries. The first begin with a sphere-plate 
geometry and texture one or both surface so that the 
alignment advantage of the sphere-plate configuration 
be maintain while effect beyond the PFA be probed 
[17–19]. The second involves fabricate two interact 
surface out of a single crystal to ensure the alignment of 
the surface [20,21]; however, measurement be limited to 
material for which sufficient fabrication technique exist. 
Geometries such a the needle-and-hole [15] and sphere- 
sphere [22–25] [Fig. 1(a)] require in situ alignment, make 
detection difficult. Recent experiment have probed the van 
der Waals force between latex sphere in liquid by align 
the sphere use their optical interference pattern [26,27], 
but the metallic coat necessary for Casimir force

measurement prevents optical alignment use that 
technique. 
Here, we present measurement of the Casimir force 

between two gold-coated hollow glass sphere use an 
in situ scan technique to maintain alignment of the 
spheres’ center to within ∼1% of their radius over 24 hour 
of continuous measurement. Because the experiment be 
perform in air, we determine (and mitigate) both the 
electrostatic and hydrodynamic force through a lock-in 
detection scheme, while track the in-phase and quad- 
rature component of the signal. Horizontal alignment 
between the two sphere be preserve by alternate force 
measurement with topographical scans. Finally, we put 
bound on correction to the PFA base on a combination 
of sphere-sphere and sphere-plate measurement corre- 
sponding to different radii. 
To align the two spheres, we attach one to an AFM 

cantilever (Mikromasch USA), and it be raster scanned, 
while oscillating, over a second sphere. A piezoelectric 
transducer control the bottom sphere so that the oscillation 
amplitude of the cantilever, and thus, the separation, be 
maintain while an image be record [Fig. 1(b)]. We 
perform a fit to the result image, which allows for lateral 
alignment of the two sphere to within 400 nm, or about 
0.01 to 0.02 R0, where R0 ¼ ðR−11 þ R−12 Þ−1 be the effective 
radius of the two-sphere system. Misalignment between 
the two sphere result in three primary effect (see 
Supplemental Material [28]): (1) the absolute separation 
of the two sphere can change by up to 1 nm, result in a 
total separation uncertainty of �3 nm, (2) the effective 
sensitivity can change by up to �0.3%, increase the 
calibration uncertainty to �5.3%, and (3) a discrepancy on 
the order of 0.05 nm may exist for misalign sphere 
due to motion of the piezo, which be small enough to be 
ignored. We use a commercial AFM (Cypher, Asylum 
Research) for the measurements, and the environment be 
maintain at 303.15� 0.05 K and 15� 9% relative 
humidity. 
We measure the spatial derivative of the Casimir force 

(FC0 ¼ ½ð∂FCÞ=∂d�) in an ambient environment utilize 
the procedure developed by de Man et al. [7,29]. This 
process allows u to determine the surface separation 
and spring constant, while also eliminate hydrodynamic 
and electrostatic force from the data channel contain 
Casimir force. For each sphere-sphere configuration, we 
collect data at ∼400 individual separation (from 4 μm to 
30 nm) for each approach and retraction. The measurement 
be split into several steps, a described below. 
We minimize the electrostatic contribution to the total 

force signal at each sphere-sphere separation through the 
application of two apply biases. First, an ac voltage, Vac, 
be apply to the top sphere at a frequency of ωA=2π ¼ 
77 Hz (while the bottom sphere be grounded), which cause 
the cantilever to oscillate at an angular frequency of ωA and 
at high harmonic (e.g., 2ωA and 4ωA). The signal at 2ωA 

be use by a feedback loop to control the amplitude of Vac to 
maintain a constant amplitude set point for the cantilever 
oscillation. A second voltage, V0, be apply by an addi- 
tional feedback loop to the top sphere in order to minimize 
the cantilever oscillation signal at ωA, which, in turn, 
minimizes the electrostatic force, akin to a Kelvin probe 
feedback loop [29]. Data be acquire for each sphere- 
sphere separation. 
While the electrostatic interaction be minimized, we 

determine the spatial derivative of the remain force 
(Casimir and hydrodynamic) by oscillate the bottom 
sphere with an amplitude Δd at frequency ωpz=2π ¼ 
211 Hz and observe the response of the cantilever with 
a lock-in amplifier. The phase of the cantilever’s response be 
use to separate the hydrodynamic force from FC0 [29]. 
The shake amplitude be reduce from 48 to 1 nm on 
approach, to maximize the sensitivity at large separations, 
while also minimize any artifact from the nonlinearity of 
the Casimir force. 
Once the approach and retract run be completed, we 

determine the absolute separation use the separation- 
dependent tip-sample capacitance, CðdÞ [30]. The capaci- 
tance derivative C0 ¼ ½∂C=∂d�, calculate from Vac and 
oscillation of the cantilever at 2ωA, be fit to the expect 
sphere-sphere C0 for an entire approach or retract sequence 
of measurements. While fitting C0 to determine the sepa- 
ration, the bending of the cantilever (< 3 nm) be take into 
account, and the modification of the capacitance due to an 
expect water layer of 1.5� 0.75 nm on each surface be 
include [31]. After the force measurements, the top sphere 
again approach and retracts from the bottom sphere, 
while electrostatic measurement be make with Vac ¼ 8 V 
to calibrate the optical lever sensitivity and the spring 
constant from the electrostatic signal at 4ωA. 

FIG. 2. Representative measurement of the spatial derivative 
of Casimir force for both sphere-plate (blue) and sphere-sphere 
(red) measurement geometries. Results be in agreement with 
calculate value of the Casimir force derivative for two gold 
sphere with a 4.9 nm rms perturbative roughness correction 
(black line). Gray shade region show the uncertainty in the 
roughness correction due to the uncertainty in the orientation of 
the sphere [32]. The sphere-plate force be measure with the 
sphere in Fig. 3(a), and the sphere-sphere data be collect 
between it and the one in Fig. 3(d).

We repeat the topography, force measurement, and cali- 
bration cycle for 24 hour for each sphere pair result in 
about 50 force-distance measurement per sphere-sphere 
experiment. A total of nine sphere-sphere and three sphere- 
plate measurement be recorded, with three different 
top sphere and three different bottom sphere (hollow 
glass, Trelleborg SI-100). The sphere radius range from 
29 to 47� 0.3 μm and be epoxied to either a cantilever or 
a silicon substrate and coat (Denton e beam) with 
Crð3Þ=SiO2ð50Þ=Crð3Þ=Auð100 nmÞ. The SiO2 layer be 
use to block ion from the glass sphere from diffuse into 
the Au. The silicon plate be coat with Crð5Þ=Auð100 nmÞ. 
We perform measurement for both the sphere-sphere 

and sphere-plate configuration and compare their result 
when use the same top sphere. The force derivative be 
divide by the effective radius, R0, to compare the different 
measurement (Fig. 2). The Casimir force between the gold 
surface be compute by combine ellipsometry data over 
the range 0.74–6.3 eV with reference optical data [33] at 

high frequency and the Drude model with ωp ¼ 
8.84 eV and γ ¼ 42 meV at the low frequency [34]. 
The AFM image of the surface be then use to estimate 
uncertainty in the roughness correction to FC0 [32]. A thin 
water layer (described above) be expect to increase FC0, 
primarily at small separation [35], which be also take into 
account (e.g., at a separation of 50 nm, the water layer 
increase the force calculation by 5%, but by only 1.6% 
at 100 nm). 
All sphere-sphere measurement (nine different combi- 

nations) be present in Fig. 3, show the consistency of 
the measurements. At the shortest separations, roughness 
cause the force to increase, and at separation beyond 
200 nm, stray light interference affect some of the data. 
Stray light appear a an artifact that be partially periodic 
with separation and be proportional to Δd. Even though a 
superluminescent diode be use to minimize the stray light 
effect, it be present in some of the sphere-sphere data up to 
about 0.5 Nm−2 (although it differs between measure- 
ments) and be about half the level of the artifact in the 
sphere-plate data due to increase reflection off the plate in 
that configuration. Possible reason that measurement 
with the top sphere in Fig. 3(b) show a small force at 
separation <100 nm be that the sphere have a deformity 
not capture by the roughness measurement [32], or that it 
slightly small spring constant have lead to an increase in the 
separation uncertainty. 
The PFA allows FC0 to be compute from the force per 

unit area between parallel plates. However, a more com- 
plete theory predicts the presence of deviation from the 
PFA [13,14]. The large predict correction be propor- 
tional to 1=R0. The combination of sphere-sphere and 
sphere-plate measurement give effective radius (R0) that 
vary from 13–46 μm. The wide range of R0 value allows 
the procedure of Krause et al. [6] to be use to put bound 
on deviation from the PFA of the form

We combine all twelve measurement to put bound on

with bin width that be 2% of the separation; e.g., one bin 
be 100� 1 nm. All twelve FC0 measurement at one 
separation be then plot versus 1=R0 (Fig. 4). We fit a

line in the form of Eq. (2) to the record data at each 
separation. Then, β0 be calculate from the fit a 

β0 ¼ m 
bd 

; ð3Þ 

where m and b be determine from the line fit. 
The estimate of β0 be more robust to several type of error 

than FC0, which make it good suit for explore 
deviation from the PFA. First, systematic uncertainty in 
the separation (due to, for example, a water layer) lead to a 
small error in β0, because β0 varies less with separation 
than FC0 [14]. Second, the stray light effect, which lead to 
a systematic artifact in any single experimental configura- 
tion, be effectively random between configurations, and so, 
the total error it imparts be reduced. Finally, any overall 
systematic offset in the calibration that be common to all 12 
set of data do not affect the estimate of β0. The error in β0 
for each separation be propagate from the error on each 
individual force measurement, which is, in turn, calculate 
from: uncertainty in the separation, uncertainty from 
roughness, uncertainty from calibration, uncertainty in 
the amount of the hydrodynamic force couple into the 
Casimir signal channel, and uncertainty from stray light. 
Figure 4(b) show our experimentally determine esti- 

mate of β0 for each separation, d. Early theoretical work 

predict that β0 would be independent of separation [13], 
and the early experimental investigation of β0 in the 
sphere-plate geometry found that β0 ¼ 0� 0.4. However, 
recent theoretical work have show that, for real material at 
finite temperature, β0 depends on separation and be pre- 
dicted to vary between -0.4 and -0.6 in the range explore 
in this Letter [14]. To put our bound on β0 in a form similar 
to Krause et al., we find that β0 ¼ −6� 27 be within the 2σ 
confidence interval of the calculate β0 at all of the 
measure separations. 
Stronger bound on β0 will be possible by extend the 

range of radius use in the measurement. The large possible 
radius that can be use be limited by the ability to separate 
the hydrodynamic force from the Casimir force (the former 
scale a R2, the latter a R). The small possible radius 
must still be large enough so that the sphere contributes 
much more to FC0 than the cantilever use to support it. If a 
large enough range of radius be used, it would also be 
possible to look for higher-order correction to Eq. (1). 
Because the measurement of β0 be less strongly affected by 
systematic error than direct measurement of FC0, it should 
facilitate comparison between experiment and theory. 
In conclusion, we have measure the Casimir interaction 

between two sphere for separation of 30–400 nm, by 
combine topographical alignment with FC0 measure- 
ments. The alignment method can be use to position 
any object that may present interest geometry for FC0 
measurement in air. Further, the technique can be adapt 
to liquid or vacuum conditions, though care will be 
necessary to keep the sphere from contact one another 
when drag be minimal. Once the object be aligned, any 
type of force can be measured: critical Casimir, hydro- 
dynamic, magnetic, etc. Finally, by combine measure- 
ments from several experimental configurations, we place 
limit on correction to the PFA. Because the experiment 
be conduct in ambient conditions, we anticipate that 
the result and technique will be important for incorpo- 
rating geometrically control Casimir force into MEMS 
devices.
