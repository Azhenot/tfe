Supplementary Information for Clinically 
applicable deep learn for diagnosis and 
referral in retinal disease 

Supplementary Figures 








Supplementary Figure 1 | Generating prediction with an ensemble of segmentation and classification networks. 
Illustration show how the ensemble of 5 segmentation network instance and 5 classification network instance be jointly 
use to generate 25 prediction for one scan. Each segmentation network instance first provide a segmentation map 
hypothesis base on the input OCT. For each of these 5 segmentation map hypothesis every classification network instance 
provide a probability for each label, here show in detail for the geographic atrophy label. 












Supplementary Figure 2 | Example information available to the expert to make the referral decision. (a) Full OCT scan 
with a slider to scroll through the slices. (b) Fundus image. (c) Patient summary notes. Scale bars: 1mm 






Supplementary Figure 3 | Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) diagram for referral decisions. (a) Urgent and semi- 
urgent referral versus routine referral and observation only (n=997 patients). The blue ROC curve be create by sweep a 
threshold over the predict probability (or the measure segmentation volume in case of Drusen and epiretinal membrane 
(ERM)). Points outside the light blue area correspond to a significantly different performance (95% confidence level, use a 
two-sided exact binomial test). Filled marker denote expert's performance use OCT only; outline marker denote their 
performance use OCT, fundus image and summary notes. Dashed line connect the two performance point of each expert. 
(b) Urgent, semi-urgent and routine referral versus observation only (n=997 patients) 











Supplementary Figure 4 | Confusion matrix for the referral decision for all 8 experts. n=997 patients. 












Supplementary Figure 5 | Error rate of the referral decision on device type 1. The error rate be show for the device type 1 
test set (dataset #5 in Supplementary Table 3) for different number of model instance in the ensemble. The error rate be 
compute a the average over all possible combination of N x M segmentation and classification model instance out of the 5 
x 5 instance that be use in the rest of this study. The performance difference between 4 x 4 instance and 5 x 5 instance 
be only marginal (n=997 patients) 















Supplementary Figure 6 | Adverse consequence of wrong referral decisions. (a) Our propose penalty point for a wrong 
referral decision. In the first row the penalty point correspond approximately to the number of week that a CNV patient might 
lose in referral time before treatment (with 100 a a maximum for a patient triaged a ‘observation’ and would not be call 
back for assessment). The penalty point in the other row be select relative to this, with the additional constraint that an 
overdiagnosis (lower left triangle) be consider less harmful to an individual than an underdiagnosis. (b) Average penalty point 
per patient accord to our propose penalty metrics. Framework (1) be optimize for balance performance; framework (2) be 
optimize for a good penalty score (n=997 patients, error bar indicate 95% confidence interval, compute from the standard 
error of the sample mean) (c) Distribution of the collect penalty point for our model and the expert (n=997 patients) in the 
same layout a above. The color part of each bar indicate the amount of penalty point collect in each category. 







Supplementary Figure 7 | Confusion matrix of an end-to-end classification network apply to the test set (dataset #5 in 
Supplementary Table 3). The result be obtain by an ensemble of 5 model instance (n=997 patients). 









Supplementary Figure 8 | Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) diagram for the additional pathologies. The blue 
ROC curve be create by sweep a threshold over the predict probability (or the measure segmentation volume in case of 
Drusen and ERM). n=997 patients. Points outside the light blue area correspond to a significantly different performance (95% 
confidence level, use a two-sided exact binomial test). Filled marker denote expert's performance use OCT only; outline 
marker denote their performance use OCT, fundus image and summary notes. Dashed line connect the two performance 
point of each expert. 










Supplementary Figure 9 | Differences between the two device types. The scan take by device type 2 (Heidelberg 
Spectralis) have obvious difference in appearance compare to those take by device type 1 (Topcon 3D OCT). The high 
contrast in device type 2 result in good feature definition which could mislead segmentation model train only on device 
type 1. Arrowheads in each image show the difference between device type 1 & 2 respectively. (a) Posterior hyaloid. (b) 
Intraretinal fluid. (c) Geographic atrophy. (d) Fibrovascular PED. (e) Drusen. In addition, in all image the choroid - the area 
below the retina at the bottom of the image - be good define with device type 2. While this have benefit for diagnosis the 
difference can confuse model which may mistake the difference for additional retinal layers. Scale bars: 0.5mm 







Supplementary Figure 10 | Excluded and include case in the test set. (a) The three case exclude from the test set due 
to insufficient signal in the OCT. Every 10th slice of the OCT scan be displayed. Note that in all case the retina be either absent 
(empty scan) or barely visible, prevent the interpretation of the scan. (b) Four example of case that be include in the 
test set despite be of poor quality, or represent complex pathology. Scale bars: 1mm

adaptation branches” to segment scan of device type 2. In the top left we show an enlarge version of the difference 
compare to the original architecture for device type 1 (shown in Supplementary Fig. 14). Blue box illustrate the 4D 
activation map with the number of channel show below. Green arrow denote convolutional operations. We train on scan 
from both device type 1 and device type 2 but subsample those from device type 1 in the z-dimension to match the low z- 
resolution of device type 2. Depending on which device the scan be from, the scan first go through either the top branch, for 
device type 1, or the bottom branch, for device type 2. The output of the chosen branch be then use a input to a modify 
version of the first level of the analysis path of the original architecture. The rest of the architecture be identical.

Supplementary Videos 

Supplementary Video 1 - OCT viewer | This video demonstrates the interaction with the OCT viewer. The OCT scan belongs 
to a 72 year old female present with increase visual distortion over a 4 month period; the OCT show loss of RPE 
consistent with geographic atrophy. The view first go through the whole volume (128 slices) for a fix tissue map 
hypothesis, follow by show the different tissue map hypothesis for a give slice. Finally, we let the collage cycle through 
the different hypothesis continually while scroll through the volume, pause on several slice briefly to show the variations. 
The color legend for all segmentation map be available in Supplementary Table 2. 

Supplementary Video 2 - wet AMD | Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) be the pathognomonic feature of the neovascular 
(“wet”) form of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and require urgent treatment to prevent irreversible visual loss. A 72- 
year old man present with a history of reduce vision in his left eye. Best correct visual acuity in the affected eye be 38 
Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) letters. The model correctly selects the Most Urgent Diagnosis a “CNV”, 
suggest referral to an ophthalmologist on an urgent basis. The model segmentation highlight growth of the neovascular 
tissue in the sub-retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) space – a so-called fibrovascular pigment epithelium detachment (PED). 
Subretinal fluid can be see surround the inferior margin of the fibrovascular PED indicate the presence of ongoing CNV 
leakage. 

Supplementary Video 3 - Normal | Scans be quick and safe to perform and be thus commonly use in the screen of 
patient without visual symptom or other ophthalmic findings. A 46-year old man who be refer for retinal specialist review. 
Best correct visual acuity be 6/6. The model correctly selects the referral decision a “Observation Only”, suggest that 
the OCT finding in isolation do not require referral to an ophthalmologist. The model accurately delineates the neurosensory 
retina without the presence of any pathologic compartments. It also highlight partial separation of the posterior hyaloid of the 
vitreous – this be a normal find a the vitreous gel increasingly liquefies with age. 

Supplementary Video 4 - Diabetic Macular Edema | Accumulation of this fluid in the macula – diabetic macular edema 
(DME) – be the commonest cause of visual impairment in diabetes. A 54-year old man with diabetes be refer to Moorfields 
for ophthalmologist review with best correct visual acuity in the affected eye of 45 ETDRS letters. The model correctly 
detects the presence of macular retinal edema (MRE) and suggests semi-urgent ophthalmology referral. The model highlight 
intraretinal fluid accumulation, with cystoid space in both the inner nuclear and outer plexiform layers, and a mixed 
petaloid/honeycomb appearance on the en face images. There be also an accompany significant increase in total retinal 
thickness. 

Supplementary Video 5 - Ambiguous Case (chronic CSR) | In chronic CSR, diagnosis of secondary CNV formation be often 
challenge due to the frequent presence of shallow irregular pigment epithelium detachment (PEDs). A 60-64 year old woman 
present with a history of CSR in her left eye. The model correctly detects the presence of CSR but be far less certain about 
the presence of CNV. It highlight a gravitational tract of subretinal fluid with a discrete area of fibrovascular PED superior to 
the fovea. 

Supplementary Video 6 - Ambiguous Case (advanced geographic atrophy) | In advanced form of AMD, geographic 
atrophy (GA) may sometimes coexist with CNV formation. In such cases, the CNV component may be clinically silent, and the 
fundus appearance may be limited to that of GA, make the diagnosis difficult. A 84-year old man be refer to Moorfields. 
Best correct visual acuity in the affected eye be 1/60. The ground truth diagnosis be GA and routine referral be 
recommended. While the model correctly diagnosis the presence of GA and drusen, it suggests urgent referral due to the 
possible presence of CNV. The presence of subretinal hyperreflective on model segmentation be suggestive of previous CNV 
formation. 

Supplementary Video 7 - Difficult Case of CNV | A 30 year old male patient, with a know history of CSR, present with 
acute visual loss in his left eye and be diagnose with secondary CNV formation. At this visit, the OCT scan lack many of the 
prototypical feature of CSR, such a subretinal fluid accumulation. The model correctly diagnosis the presence of CNV and 
suggests the presence of CSR, but with far less certainty. 

Supplementary Video 8 - Failure case (partial thickness macular hole) | Ocular medium opacity may sometimes cause 
artefactual reduction in OCT signal strength and this can make accurate image segmentation challenging. Due to localize 
reduction in OCT signal strength in this case, some of the model erroneously detect the presence of a partial thickness 
macular hole. As a result, the model be uncertain a to whether the eye be normal or whether routine referral be required. 

Supplementary Video 9 - Integration with other clinical information | Retinal angiomatous proliferation (RAP) be a variant of 
choroidal neovascularization (CNV) due to age-related macular degeneration (AMD). A 75-79 year old woman present with 
reduce vision in her left eye. The model segmentation highlight the presence of a fibrovascular pigment epithelium 
detachment (PED) with subretinal hyperreflective material, overlie intraretinal fluid, and surround drusen. These finding 
be highly suggestive of RAP - in it early stages, this can be misdiagnosed a macular retinal edema (MRE), particularly in 
elderly patient with diabetes. The interpretable representation reduces the risk of misdiagnosis and allows the clinician to 
easily correlate these finding with other clinical information, e.g., fundus fluorescein angiography.
