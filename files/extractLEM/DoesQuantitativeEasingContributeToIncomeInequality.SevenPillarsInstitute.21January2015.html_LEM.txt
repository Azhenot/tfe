Does Quantitative Easing Contribute to Income Inequality? 

August 26th, 2013 by Kara in Case Studies, Economics 



Background to Quantitative Easing 

As Quantitative Easing (QE) lack an extensive history, the monetary 
technique, despite recent use by numerous central banks, be fraught with 
controversy[1]. QE occurs when a central 
bank increase the money supply, often by buying government bond 
through open market operation from company and institutions.[2] The goal be to increase liquidity, borrowing, investments, and economic activity.[3] 
However, QE be associate with some negative side effects, make it a 
last resort strategy use after traditional method – such a when 
official interest rate be near zero – have be exhausted. One of the 
apparent downside be QE increase income inequality. Is this claim 
legitimate? 

Income Inequality 

Income Inequality (II) be define a the unequal distribution of income within a population.[4] 
There be multiple common method of measure income inequality, 
include the GINI index, the generalize entropy index, and the decile 
ratio.[5] Various factor can affect the 
degree of income inequality, such a monopolistic control by lead 
families, cultural structures, legal constructs, favorable tax treatment 
for the rich, regulatory favoritism, decrease labor union strength, 
or technological change.[6] Based on 
historical data, country not in the Organization for Economic 
Cooperation and Development (OECD), such a China, have a large income 
disparity than those in the OECD. Past research also indicates that 
among OECD countries, the USA and Latin America have high level of 
income inequality. Overall, the recent trend have be increase income 
inequality.[7] 

Using Government Yields to Measure Quantitative Easing 

Government yield refer to the interest, or the amount of money make at maturity, on government bonds.[8] 
Specifically, we use US Treasury Bill yields. Due to the United States 
federal government’s credibility and low default rate, yield on 
Treasury Bills have low systematic and unsystematic risk. As a result, 
they be a good measure of QE’s impact than stock or bonds. 

QE have an inverse relationship with government yields. The more 
easing, the low the yield because QE increase money supply, 
decrease the supply of Treasuries through purchase by the central 
bank, which in turn, decrease yields.[9] 

It should be noted, a QE affect many aspect of the economy, other 
measure – such a the inflation rate – can potentially be used. 
However, we use Treasury yield because they have a more direct 
connection to QE than other measurements. 

The Association Between the PE Ratio, Shiller PE Ratio, and Income Inequality 

The typical Price to Earnings (PE) Ratio compare price per share to 
earnings per share. The Shiller PE Ratio, an adaptation of the typical 
PE ratio, divide the current price per share by the average 
inflation-adjusted earnings from the past 10 years.[10] 
The share price in PE Ratios be often an indication of corporate 
profits, a the ratio will be high if earnings expectation remain 
positive.[11] 

A high ratio be directly associate with high income inequality. 
Higher share price often increase income inequality a the gain mainly 
go to the wealthy, who own stock at high rate than the poor.[12] In fact, the wealthy 10% own 91.4% of stock and mutual funds. 

Methodology 

First, we examine the correlation between quantitative ease and 
income inequality in the USA. Second, we examine the United States’ 
historical GINI index data. Third, we compare, contrast, and analyze the 
observation from the QE/II correlation and GINI index. 

Establishing a Mathematical Correlation between Quantitative Easing and Income Inequality Within the USA: 

To determine this result, we utilize the begin of the year data 
for the yield of the three-month Treasury bill rate a provide by the 
Federal Reserve of St. Louis[13], and Shiller PE Ratio a provide by Robert Shiller in his book Irrational Exuberance.[14] 
Yields and PE ratio be useful measure of ease and income 
inequality, respectively. We examine data from two time periods: 
1990-2008 and 2009-2013. The result be sometimes label a QE/II 
correlations. 

1) 1990-2008: 



The first time period, from 1990-2008, be significant. During that 
time the United States do not use QE. In this period, the yield 
decrease from 7.64% to 2.75% and the PE Ratio increase from 17.05 to 
24.21. The correlation between these two variable be -0.03658. This 
inverse relationship indicates that income inequality increase during 
this period. However, base on Dancey and Reidy’s 2004 categorizations, 
this be essentially a nonexistent correlation, a it be less than -0.1.[15] 

A) 1990-1999: 



It be worth examine two subsection of this first time period: 
1990-1999 and 2000-2008. Between 1990-1999, the PE ratio increase while 
the yield fell. The inverse -0.23704 correlation suggests income 
inequality increased. However, the QE/II correlation remains weak during 
this period. 

B) 2000-2008: 





The 2000-2008 period witness a positive correlation of 0.617692 
where both the PE Ratio and Treasury yield fell. Unlike the 1990 to 
1999 time frame, this correlation be generally consider to be 
relatively strong, indicate that income inequality decrease in the 
absence of QE. We investigate the reason for the difference between 
these two subsection in a late section. 

2) 2009-2013: 



Next, we examine the 2009 to 2013 period, during which time the 
United States enact quantitative ease policies. Quite unlike the 
2000-2008 period, there be a weak inverse correlation at -0.22582. We 
examine why this increase in income inequality may have occur due to 
quantitative ease and determine why this be a strong inverse 
correlation than the simple correlation between PE Ratios and 
quantitative ease suggests. 

Facts About the USA’s GINI Index: 

We can measure the actual income inequality that occur within the 
USA at different time period use the GINI index. The GINI Index 
measure income inequality through the Lorenz Curve, which show the 
cumulative income earn within the population start from the low 
earner to the highest. A GINI coefficient of 0 represent no 
inequality, while 1 mean one person have all the income.[16] 
Thus, the high the GINI coefficient, the great the inequality. At 
the time of writing, the United States GINI coefficient be available up 
to 2011. We therefore compare the coefficient from the 1990-2008 
period to the coefficient from the 2009-2011 period.[17] 

1) 1990-2008: 

Between 1990 and 2008, the coefficient increase from 0.428 to 0.466, 
for a total increase of 0.038, or approximately 9%. When we divide this 
by the total number of years, we witness an average increase of 0.002 
per year, suggest that there be an increase in income inequality 
during this period. 

Although the trend from 1990-2008 overall show worsen income 
inequality, there be multiple year where we witness a decline in 
income inequality: 1994-1995, 1997-1998, 2001-2002, and 2006-2007. 

A) Before 2000 vs. After 2000: 

A closer examination of the 1990-2008 period show the increase 
occur primarily before 2000. 1990-2000 account for 0.034 of the 
total increase of 0.038. Thus, from 2000-2008, the index increase only 
0.004, accounting for only 10.5% of the total increase during 1990-2008. 
As discuss earlier, there be a much more significant increase in 
income inequality in the former period. It be also clear despite the 
small change from 2000-2008, inequality increase nevertheless. 

2) 2009-2011: 

From 2009 to 2011, the coefficient grow by more than it have from 2000 
to 2008. It increase by 2%, from 0.468 to 0.477, a difference of 0.009 
in total, or 0.003 per year. There be no decrease during any of 
these years. Thus, income inequality worsen the most during this time, 
with a large increase than that of the 1990-2008 era. 

Analysis of QE/II Correlations and GINI indexes: 

When compare the result from the QE/II correlation and GINI 
coefficient data, the 1990-2008 and post 2009 period suggest increase 
inequality overall. 

2000-2008 Divergence of GINI and QE/II 

However, when take into account subsection of the first period, 
the QE/II correlation and GINI index do not reach the same conclusion 
for the 2000-2008 period. The GINI coefficient suggests that income 
inequality still increase from 2000 to 2008, but the QE/II correlation 
indicates otherwise. 

There be several reason for this difference. First, PE ratio be 
not necessarily indicative of corporate financial health because the 
share price also be a product of investor confidence – which be 
unusually high during the 2000-2008 period even though the underlie 
data suggest the market would eventually falter – rather than an 
objective indicator of a company’s financial health or profits.[18] 
This lead to a false positive QE/II correlation. Second, a the 
Shiller PE Ratio be base on the previous 10 years’ earnings and the 
2000-20008 period be not a 10 year block, therefore, other event and 
factor played a role.[19] For example, 
the 1998 crash most likely lead to small earnings for that year, which 
be include when calculate the 2000-2008 Shiller PE Ratio. Such 
event can make the denominator smaller, meaning a large PE ratio and 
an alter QE/II correlation. 

Furthermore, the PE ratio do not take into account which group be 
the key recipient of corporate profits, only the sum total of the 
profits. Thus, it fails to take into account the offshoring and job 
loss that particularly harm certain group of the US population. 
This be problematic a company be increasingly operating 
internationally with success.[20] If that 
reason be take into account, income inequality would be high than 
the QE/II correlation suggests because international competition lower 
household incomes. Therefore, it appear that the QE/II correlation for 
2000-2008 suggests less inequality than there be actually. Due to these 
circumstances, the GINI index may be a more holistic data point than the 
QE/II correlation for that period. 

This rationale can also be apply to the 2009-2011 period to 
illustrate that the QE/II correlation suggests a weaker correlation than 
it should. With unusually low investor confidence, the price per share 
be also unusually low. Likewise, the denominator (earnings) be large 
than it should be due to the fact that the Shiller PE ratio considers 
ten year of corporate earnings, which include earnings for the year 
when the economy grew; this mask the sharpness of the increase in 
income inequality.[21] The offshoring of 
job continued during this time period, another contribute factor to 
great actual income inequality in practice than the QE/II correlation 
suggests. 

Furthermore, the decline in income inequality suggest by the GINI 
index be likely cause by other factors. During 1994-1995, 1997-1998, 
and 2001-2002, the technological boom, rather than the lack of easing, 
may explain why income inequality decreased. While one may expect to see 
a decrease each year, other economic variable may have played a role 
in the year 1995-1997 and 1999-2000. Nevertheless, the boom most likely 
contribute to these reversals. Furthermore, 2006-2007 be the peak 
year of the housing bubble. The great number of home sell during 
this period may have result in a temporary, one-time increase in 
household income that skewed the income data to make income appear 
high than they otherwise would be. 

Similar Trends of GINI and QE/II 

Despite the fact there be some difference between the two, a 
general trend exists base on the comparison of the GINI coefficient and 
the QE/II correlation. Income inequality worsen more sharply after 
2009 than during other periods. In contrast, it worsen the least 
during the 2000 to 2008 period. There be logical reason why QE 
increase income inequality, provide support for possible causation. 

Reasons behind Quantitative Easing’s Association with Income Inequality 

The list below be not exhaustive, and describes the most significant connection between ease and income inequality. 

1) Inflation 

By try to stimulate the economy, quantitative ease attempt to 
increase spending and thus achieve a desire price level and desire 
inflation rate. However, it may lead to a high inflation rate than 
intended.[22] This affect the value of 
wages, annuities, and pensions. People already suffer from financial 
hardship due to the weak economy will have to tighten their budget 
further to accommodate an additional loss in their purchasing power and 
incomes. 

2) Annuities 

Many retirement program contain yields, a percentage that indicates 
the annuity, or income, a person will receive during a specify time 
period. Under a QE regime, these yield be lowered.[23] Lower yield translate into low income for retirees, many of whom rely on annuity for their day-to-day needs. 

3) Pension Funds 

Like annuities, pension fund be affected by QE in more than one 
way. Lower interest rate due to quantitative ease harm pension fund 
by increase their liabilities, a low interest rate result in a 
high net present valuation for liabilities. In other words, low 
rate result in a high present value of future liability obligations. 
This mean that corporation need to divert money from investment or 
hire to fund their pension plans.[24] 
However, corporation may be unable to do so, leave those who depend 
on such plans, often lower-income individuals, with reduce payment or 
nonpayment.[25] 

4) Investment and Borrowing Opportunities 

Decreasing interest rates, a result of QE, often lead to increase 
borrowing. However, the opportunity to borrow and invest money be 
typically limited to those who be already wealthy and have good credit 
scores.[26] When these investment bear 
fruit, the money return to investor in the form of income. Those who 
do not have good credit score – who be most likely to be comparatively 
poorer – miss out on these opportunities, lead to increase income 
inequality. 

5) Corporate Profits Versus Worker Wages 

As mention earlier, QE lead to low interest rates, result in 
more borrowing and investment opportunities, include for corporations. 
Successful investment ultimately result in high corporate profits. 
However, these typically go to executive and shareholders, who be 
wealthier; poorer worker do not experience similar benefits.[27] 

6) Stocks and Profits Versus Worker Wages 

As suggest by the correlation show earlier, quantitative ease 
lead to increase share prices. Demand for the central bank’s bond 
decrease due to their low rate of return. Equities offer high return 
and investor flock towards stocks, which raise their prices.[28] 
Second, a highlight in (5) above, corporation be invest more 
and consequently have great potential to make extra profits, which be 
attractive to shareholders.[29] The 
wealthy benefit more from increase share price and corporate 
profits. Income inequality be further exacerbate when wage for 
workers, who do not tend to own stocks, do not increase by a similar 
amount.[30] 

Consequences of Quantitative Easing on Developing Countries 

As nation in global economy be interconnected, change in United 
States QE policy affect other countries, include develop nations. 
There be two primary manifestation of US quantitative ease in other 
countries: increase inflation and liquidity.[31] 

The United States’ QE affect the currency exchange rate of 
develop countries. When a country like the United States utilizes 
ease to devalue it currency, other emerge economy may be 
compel to depreciate their currency to maintain a competitive trade 
advantage. However, further devaluation by emerge economies, 
especially a permanent one, lead to more unwanted inflationary pressure 
on emerge economies.[32] As indicate earlier, inflation can aggravate income inequality by negatively affect purchasing power. 

Additionally, QE lead to increase capital outflow to develop countries[33] through an increase in private investments. These outflow often end up in emerge economies’ portfolio investments.[34] Like the effect of increase share prices, such investment in security and stock often benefit the wealthy. 

Ethical Implications: Distributive Justice 

Distributive justice theory focus on society’s framework for distribute benefit and burdens.[35] 
First, in some way QE may not provide equal opportunity. Access to 
money create by QE occurs primarily through stocks. As note earlier, 
the wealthy own the most stock due to their ability to invest while 
still meeting their basic needs. The poor, who struggle to survive, 
cannot afford to invest in stocks. Such access be also available to 
executive who reap the benefit of corporate profits. However, the 
poor, typically retiree or low skilled workers, be not executive and 
tend not to enjoy trickle down benefit from corporate profits. They 
therefore, do not receive any financial benefit from quantitative 
ease policies. 

Although the correlation within the USA be weak, it indicates that QE 
negatively affect income inequality and thus do not achieve 
distributive justice in the US. The USA’s QE also fails to help other 
country achieve distributive justice since their income inequality be 
affected a a result. Furthermore, other indicators, such a the 
disparity between the poor and rich’s consumer sentiment, support the 
argument that QE aggravates income inequality. After QE policy be 
implemented, the rich, who gain more and lose less, have significantly 
more positive sentiment about the health of the economy and their 
personal financial prospect than the poor. 

Practical Implications of Failing to Achieve Distributive Justice 

Overall, in the short run, income inequality may encourage social 
unrest when the poor articulate their dissatisfaction and desire for a 
high standard of living.[36] Examples include the 2011 London riots[37] or the Occupy Wall Street and Greek protests.[38] 
Unfortunately, these implication be not only applicable to the 
present. Income inequality also hamper countries’ economic prospect in 
the long term. It creates a permanent underclass and limit 
intergenerational economic mobility.[39] 
This occurs because poorer child grow up in an environment where they 
receive a bad education, harm their future livelihoods. 
Furthermore, the poor be prompt to borrow more than they should in 
order to meet their needs[40], increase 
the risk of a financial crisis. As the poor have low incomes, they 
cannot help drive economic activity, rely on welfare, consequently 
further harm a country’s long term economic potential. 

We analyze the short and long term implication of income inequality 
in more depth by organize country into two categories: developed and 
develop nations. These country have different social, political, 
and economic characteristic and thus face different specific risk from 
income inequality.[41] 

As developed country have more stable political, legal, social, and 
economic systems, their economy be likely to experience some 
positive benefit of quantitative ease without be destabilize from 
social unrest. Even so, they might experience unrest to some degree. 
The complication associate with small-scale protest and unrest may 
still harm the prospect of other, potentially better, solution and 
require a short-term response. Additionally, a these country be not 
grow or reorganize their economies, income inequality becomes 
ingrained, create a long-term problem.[42] 

In contrast, develop country be less establish and stable, 
heighten the short-term risk of income inequality. Adding extra 
instability may in fact plunge such country into violence or internal 
strife, which can last for a significant amount of time and cancel out 
any short-term growth that result from QE. Furthermore, a develop 
country be likely to have unstable institutions, often riddle with 
corruption, and lack institutional power. This factor put the 
country’s future at risk if the institution make unwise decisions, 
create the condition for financial bubbles. The run up to the 1997 
Asian financial crisis be one example.[43] However, unlike a developed country, a develop country’s growth allows it a chance to reduce income inequality.[44] 

The failure of QE in provide distributive justice potentially risk the wellbeing of both developed and develop countries. 

An Alternative Proposition 

As QE be not effective in reduce income inequality, an alternative 
tool may help the economy and be more effective at combat income 
inequality. 

Implementing a direct job program may resolve the problem pose by 
QE, especially if the program strengthens infrastructure, enhance a 
country’s growth prospects.[45] This 
would naturally help business grow a well a bolster the income of 
workers, so long a they earn more than unemployment benefit give 
them. Furthermore, such a program train workers, help their long 
term earn potential, and decrease income inequality. 

Some may argue this be attempt in the 1930’s and be not 
successful. The attempt by Roosevelt before the war be unprecedented 
for it time, but not large enough to reverse the Depression. However, 
the economy revive with World War II, which be essentially a job 
program. This do not necessarily mean we should enter more wars; this 
simply suggests a job program can work. The mathematical correlation 
from 1934 to 1941, before the US enter the war, and from 1941-1955, 
which include the war and some time after the war, support this 
proposition. The correlation between the Shiller PE Ratio and Treasury 
Yields from 1934 to 1941 be -0.23445, whereas it be 0.222655 in the 
late period. While the correlation be weak, it seem to indicate that 
the war reverse the trend from increase inequality to decrease 
inequality and do a good job than QE. 









Furthermore, some may claim that such a program be difficult to 
implement a it must pas the legislature. If the government need to 
act quickly, then it should consider do both a quantitative ease 
program and a direct job program simultaneously. QE can be enact 
easily by the Federal Reserve and bring positive benefit in the short 
term. The direct job program, which can be execute in a decent time 
frame, give pressure from a public that understands the benefit of a 
job program, can limit or reverse the income inequality cause by 
quantitative ease policies. However, it should be emphasize that a 
purely jobs-centric approach be probably the best way to tackle 
long-term economic problem of economic disparity.

The real inequality of the QE’s have be the reduction in 
interest rate which directly impact all non-borrowers. It exemplifies 
the Robin Hood approach, take from those who have, and give to those who 
don’t. I have see first hand retiree’s who labor for year to save 
enough money to retire, yet over the past 5 year their income on such 
saving have be reduce to zero and they have be force to eat up 
their principal rather than live off the interest income. The various 
QE’s have have little effect on job creation, it have allow the banking 
industry to recapitalixe itself at the expense of the non-borrower. The 
rate on home loan have little impact on the housing recovery until 
recently. Corporations be sit on record amount of cash never 
before see in this magnitude. Banks be awash with deposit and be 
competiting heavily on the quality loan with very thin margins. Banks 
be also extend their security portfolio to longer and longer 
durations, which when interest rate do rise, will force bank to take 
loss on massive amount of securities, which will wipe out much of the 
gain in capital earn by those same bank over the past 5 years. The 
FED have create the large hedge fund in the world currently at $3.7 
Trillion. It appear when interest rate rise they will be force to 
also take loss or hold those security until maturity, create 
massive loss for tax payers. The 300+ billion in profit which have 
be earn to date by the Fed on the QE’s have go down the drain, 
rather than keep those profit to offset potential losses, the money be 
give to the Treasury to reduce the debt/spend more. Anytime the 
finaicial market be tinker with, bad thing will eventually result. 
The QE’s be no exception. I fear the outcome of this debacle will be 
much bad and more broad than the housing crisis ever was. When will 
they ever learn?
