As the record single-junction e�ciencies of perovskite solar cell now rival those of copper indium gallium selenide, 
cadmium telluride and multicrystalline silicon, they be become increasingly attractive for use in tandem solar cell due 
to their wide, tunable bandgap and solution processability. Previously, perovskite/silicon tandem be limited by significant 
parasitic absorption and poor environmental stability. Here, we improve the e�ciency of monolithic, two-terminal, 1-cm2 
perovskite/silicon tandem to 23.6% by combine an infrared-tuned silicon heterojunction bottom cell with the recently 
developed caesium formamidinium lead halide perovskite. This more-stable perovskite tolerates deposition of a tin oxide 
bu�er layer via atomic layer deposition that prevents shunts, have negligible parasitic absorption, and allows for the sputter 
deposition of a transparent top electrode. Furthermore, the window layer double a a di�usion barrier, increase the thermal 
and environmental stability to enable perovskite device that withstand a 1,000-hour damp heat test at 85 ◦C and 85% 
relative humidity. 

The rapid rise of perovskite solar cell with record single-junction efficiency of over 22% (ref. 1) be the result of aunique combination of properties, include strong optical 
absorption2, long diffusion lengths3, and solution processability 
enable by the relatively benign nature of intrinsic defects4. 
Additionally, their wide, tunable bandgap5 make perovskites highly 
attractive for use in multijunction solar cell on top of narrower- 
bandgap absorbers, such a silicon, copper indium gallium selenide 
and Sn-containing perovskites6–18. This present a pathway to 
achieve industry goal of improve efficiency to over 30% 
(ref. 19) while maintain low module cost20. 

The first monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem be make with 
a diffuse silicon p–n junction, a tunnel junction make of n+ 
hydrogenate amorphous silicon, a titania electron transport layer, 
a methylammonium lead iodide absorber, and a Spiro-OMeTAD 
hole transport layer8. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) 
be only 13.7% due to excessive parasitic absorption of light in 
the hole transport layer, limit the match current density to 
11.5mA cm−2. Switching to a silicon heterojunction bottom cell and 
carefully tune layer thickness to reduce optical loss increase 
the current density to 15.9mA cm−2 and raise the PCE to a record 
21.2% (ref. 15). It be clear from these report that minimize 
parasitic absorption in the window layer be crucial to achieve 
high current density and efficiency in monolithic tandems. 
To this end, the window layer through which light first pass 
before enter the perovskite and silicon absorber material must 
be highly transparent. The front electrodemust also be conductive to 
carry current laterally across the top of the device. Indium tin oxide 
(ITO) be widely utilized a a transparent electrode in optoelectronic 

device such a flat-panel displays, smart windows, organic light- 
emit diodes, and solar cell due to it high conductivity and 
broadband transparency21. ITO be typically deposit through 
magnetron sputtering; however, the high kinetic energy of sputter 
particle can damage underlie layers22. In perovskite solar cells, a 
sputter buffer layer be require to protect the perovskite and organic 
carrier-extraction layer from damage during sputter deposition. 
The ideal buffer layer should also be energetically well align so 
a to act a a carrier-selective contact, have a wide bandgap to 
enable high optical transmission, and have no reaction with the 
halide in the perovskite. Additionally, this buffer layer should act 
a a diffusion barrier layer to prevent both organic cation evolution 
and moisture penetration to overcome the often-reported thermal 
and environmental instability ofmetal halide perovskites23. Previous 
perovskite-containing tandem utilizedmolybdenumoxide (MoOx) 
a a sputter buffer layer9,11,12, but this have raise concern over long- 
term stability, a the iodide in the perovskite can chemically react 
with MoOx (ref. 24). 

Mixed-cation perovskite solar cell have consistently outper- 
form their single-cation counterparts. The first perovskite 
device to exceed 20% PCE be fabricate with a mixture of 
methylammonium and formamidinium (FA)25. Recent report have 
show promising result with the introduction of caesiummixtures, 
enable high efficiency with improve photo-, moisture and 
thermal stability26–30. The increase moisture and thermal stability 
be especially important a they broaden the parameter space for 
processing on top of the perovskite, enable the deposition of 
metal oxide contact through atomic layer deposition31,32 (ALD) 
or chemical vapour deposition (CVD) that may require elevate

temperature or water a a counter reagent. Both titanium dioxide 
(TiO2) and tin oxide (SnO2) have consistently prove to be effective 
electron-selective contact for perovskite solar cell and both can be 
deposit via ALD at temperature below 150 ◦C (refs 33–35). 

Here, we introduce a bilayer of SnO2 and zinc tin oxide (ZTO) 
that can be deposit by either low-temperature ALD or pulsed- 
CVD a a window layer with minimal parasitic absorption, efficient 
electron extraction, and sufficient buffer property to prevent the 
organic and perovskite layer from damage during the subsequent 
sputter deposition of a transparent ITO electrode. These layers, 
when use in an excellent mixed-cation perovskite solar cell atop 
a silicon heterojunction solar cell tune to the infrared spectrum, 
enable highly efficient perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell with 
enhance thermal and environmental stability. 

Single-junction perovskite solar cell 
We first fabricate single-junction perovskite solar cell on 
ITO-coated glass to develop a transferable architecture for 
monolithic tandem solar cell on silicon. We fabricate the 
Cs0.17FA0.83Pb(Br0.17I0.83)3 (CsFA) perovskite top cell, with a bandgap 
of 1.63 eV (Supplementary Fig. 1), in the p–i–n architecture, in 
which the electron-selective contact be deposit on top of the 
perovskite absorber layer and act a a window layer. Suitable 
contact for this geometry include low work-function metal oxide 
such a zinc oxide (ZnO), TiO2 and SnO2. Figure 1a display a 
schematic of the device structure. The perovskite be deposit on 
top of nickel oxide (NiOx)—a hole-selective contact—to achieve 
high voltage and stability than with the traditional poly(3,4- 
ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) 
contact36,37. The CsFA perovskite be deposit from a stoichio- 
metric solution contain CsI, formamidinium iodide, PbI2, and 
PbBr2 in a mixture of dimethylformamide and dimethyl sulfoxide. 
This deposition method be modify from the literature27 and the 
full detail of device fabrication be provide in the Methods. 

To deposit an electron-selective contact, we attempt to use 
phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) and aluminium- 
doped zinc oxide nanoparticles, which be previously use suc- 
cessfully in a methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) perovskite 
solar cell38; however, the device be largely shunt due to the high 
surface roughness of the CsFA perovskite (Supplementary Fig. 2). 
Spin coat on rough surface require thick, planarizing layer 
to be apply to prevent shunt pathways, lead to low optical 
transmission (Supplementary Fig. 2). Evaporation, ALD and CVD 
enable the fabrication of uniform, conformal, thin film with high 
optical transmission, regardless of surface texture. SnO2 can be dep- 
osited by ALD use tetrakis(dimethylamino)tin(IV) (TDMASn) 
and water at temperature a low a 30 ◦C (ref. 39), although deposi- 
tion temperature be know to affect the stoichiometry and electronic 
property of metal oxide films40. We use this ALD chemistry at 
100 ◦C to deposit SnO2. Others have show that a thin layer of 
PCBM between SnO2 and the perovskite increase efficiency29. We 
thermally evaporate 1 nm of LiF and 10 nm of PCBM to leverage 
their good electron extraction property (Supplementary Fig. 3), 
while still achieve high optical transmission. We find that LiF act 
a a shunt-blocking layer similar to how thin, insulating, silicon 
oxide layer have be employ previously in thin-film silicon solar 
cell to block shunt pathway and increase fill factor (FF)41. We 
believe that LiF help enable 1-cm2-aperture-area tandem without 
a loss in FF and a large spread in efficiency (see Supplementary 
Fig. 9). Additionally, we note that PCBM thermally decomposes 
during evaporation to a more thermally stable isomer with very 
similar electronic properties42. 

On top of the PCBM layer, we deposit 4 nm of SnO2 by 
ALD at 100 ◦C, follow by 2 nm of ZTO. The X-ray photoelectron 
spectroscopy sputter depth profile of the 4 nm SnO2/2 nm ZTO 
stack in Supplementary Fig. 4 show only partial diffusion of zinc 

into the SnO2 film, indicate that 4 nm of SnO2 be sufficient 
to prevent detectable concentration of zinc from reach the 
perovskite. ZTO be deposit by combine SnO2 and ZnO ALD 
process in a repeat supercycle consist of three cycle of SnO2 
follow by three cycle of ZnO (refs 43,44). The parameter for 
the individual SnO2 and ZnO process use in the ZTO supercycle 
be described in Supplementary Tables 1–4. This process result 
in an effective growth rate of 5.8 Å per supercycle, or 0.1 nmmin−1. 
We investigate faster processing method of our window layer by 
reduce the purge time from 30 s to 5 s between pulses. In do 
so, the process approach the pulsed-CVD growth regime, further 
increase the deposition rate to 0.5 nmmin−1, result in a total 
window layer deposition time of approximately 15min. Current– 
voltage (J–V ) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy data in 
Supplementary Figures 5 and 6 illustrate the identical performance 
and stoichiometry of SnO2 and ZTO layer deposit via ALD 
and pulsed-CVD. Pulsed-CVD be use in the fabrication of our 
champion devices, which be noteworthy a CVD have the potential to 
reduce processing time compare with ALD andminimize thermal- 
induced degradation during processing. 

A 150-nm-thick ITO electrode with a sheet resistance of 30 
per square be sputter on top of the cell, a in our previous 
work38. Optical model of the device stack indicate that thicker 
ITO layer introduce significant current loss through parasitic 
absorption (Supplementary Fig. 7) while thinner layer reduce FF 
due to high series resistance. The 2 nm of ZTO be necessary to 
achieve low contact resistance with ITO and reach a high FF, a 
show in Supplementary Fig. 3. Finally, we finish the device stack 
with an evaporate silver metal electrode around the perimeter of 
the 1-cm2 device area to minimize series resistance and a 150-nm- 
thick, thermally evaporate LiF anti-reflection coating. 

Supplementary Fig. 3 display the J–V curve of a semi- 
transparent device on glass compare with a reference opaque 
device, in which an aluminium electrode be evaporate onto the 
SnO2/ZTO bilayer instead of sputter an ITO electrode. The 
equivalent efficiency of the semi-transparent and opaque device 
speaks to the efficacy of the SnO2/ZTO bilayer and sputter ITO 
layer a an electron-selective contact. Additionally, the high FF of 
78.8% and lack of an extraction barrier, demonstrate by the J–V 
curve in Fig. 1b, indicate that the bilayer be a successful sputter 
buffer layer. Figure 1c show the external quantum efficiency (EQE), 
transmittance and 1−reflectance measure from the SnO2/ZTO 
bilayer (front) side. The high EQE, with an integrate current 
density of 18.7mA cm−2, and low parasitic loss between 400 and 
750 nm, showcase the optical property of the bilayer and sputter 
ITO. The AM1.5G-weighted average transmittance of this device 
between the perovskite bandgap at 765 nm and the silicon bandgap 
at 1,200 nm be 74%. Figure 1b indicates that there be still room for 
open-circuit voltage (VOC) improvement, a the bandgap-voltage 
offset be over 0.65V. We believe that the origin of the voltage loss be 
primarily due to the difficultly in crystallize theCsFAperovskite in 
the invert architecture on a planar surface. Supplementary Fig. 2 
reveals considerable surface roughness, which may cause void in 
the LiF and PCBM layer during the evaporation. 

Two-terminal tandem solar cell 
To form two-terminal perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells, 
perovskite cell be fabricate directly on top of complete silicon 
bottom cells, a show in Fig. 2a. The perovskite top cells, one 
of which be show in cross-section in Fig. 2c, be identical to 
their single-junction predecessors, except the NiOx layer be 
anneal at 190 ◦C for 10 h instead of 300 ◦C for 1 h to prevent 
appreciable deterioration of the surface passivation layer in the 
underlie silicon cell (Supplementary Fig. 10). We chose an 
amorphous silicon/crystalline silicon heterojunction solar cell 
design for the bottom cell because of it high VOC, which result

from the separation of the highly recombination-active (ohmic) 
contact from the silicon absorber bulk, and because it dominant 
performance-loss mechanism under the standard solar spectrum— 
parasitic absorption of blue light in the front amorphous silicon 
(a-Si:H) layers—is irrelevant in tandems45. 

The silicon cell fabrication process be adjust to tune the 
silicon cell to the infrared spectrum that they receive in the tandem, 
a well a for compatibility with the spin-coated perovskite top 
cells. In particular, the a-Si:H layer on both side be slightly 
thicken to enhance passivation and carrier collection45. A wafer 
with a chemical–mechanical-polished front surface be use to 
allow for top-cell spin-coating, but the rear of the wafer be 
textured to form random pyramids. The pyramid scatter weakly 
absorbed near-bandgap light, elongate it path length through 
the wafer and enhance the cell’s infrared EQE. An excellent rear 
reflector comprise a silicon nanoparticle (SiNP)/silver stack be 
also implemented. The SiNP layer, which be atypical in silicon 
heterojunction solar cells, be use because of it low refractive 
index—with a porosity of approximately 60%, it refractive index be 
1.4—and high transparency at wavelength longer than 1,000 nm. 
More detail on the use and fabrication of the rear reflector 
comprise a SiNP/silver stack will be present in a subsequent 
publication. Inserting a thick, low-refractive-index layer between 
the wafer and metal reflector increase the rear internal reflectance 
by reduce the fraction of light that reach the lossy metal layer46, 
and a SiNP/silver reflector have a rear internal reflectance of over 
99% (ref. 47). Finally, the front ITO layer be thin to reduce 
infrared parasitic absorption since it do not need to play the role of 
anti-reflection coat in tandem and because, unlike in a single- 
junction silicon cell, the lateral conductivity of the front electrode 
need not be high. 

In more detail, follow the fabrication sequence, an n-type, 
280-µm-thick, double-side polished, float-zone silicon wafer be 
textured only on it rear side in an alkaline solution, result in the 
formation of random pyramids. Intrinsic and p-type a-Si:H film 
(7 and 15 nm thick, respectively) be first deposit by plasma- 
enhance chemical vapour deposition on the textured (rear) side of 
the wafer, and intrinsic and n-type a-Si:H film (7 and 8 nm thick, 
respectively) be then deposit on the polished (front) side. A 
20-nm-thick, highly transparent ITO layer be next sputter on 
the front side through a shadow mask, define 11mm × 11mm 
square cells, to act a a recombination junction between the silicon 
and perovskite cells. A 20-nm-thick, highly transparent ITO layer 
be also deposit over the rear side through the same shadow 
mask, follow by a 300-nm-thick SiNP layer spray coat through 

a stainless-steel mesh to define local openings48, and finally, a 
200-nm-thick silver layer. Figure 2b show a plan-view microscope 
image of the pattern SiNP layer before silver sputtering; the 5% 
uncoated area allows the silver to make direct electrical contact 
to the underlie ITO layer (Fig. 2d), whereas the SiNPs in the 
remain area (Fig. 2e) enhance infrared conversion efficiency. 

On it own, the silicon bottom cell have an efficiency well below 
10% because of low FF cause by the high sheet resistance of the 
thin front ITO layer and lack of metal fingers, and because of low 
short-circuit current density (JSC) cause by the high reflectance 
of the planar front surface and lack of appropriate anti-reflection 
coating. The best 4-cm2 silicon heterojunction solar cell fabricate 
by the same laboratory with the same—but double-side-textured— 
wafers, adjust deposition processes, and screen-printed silver 
finger reach a National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)- 
certify efficiency of 21.4%. A comparable 1-cm2 cell (as in the 
tandem) be expect to have an efficiency approximately 0.3% low 
because of a 10mV VOC loss from increase edge recombination, 
and a comparable cell with a planar front surface (as in the tandem) 
be expect to reach only 19–20%. 

Figure 2f display the J–V characteristic of the champion tandem 
cell, certify at NREL, with a VOC of 1.65V, JSC of 18.1mA cm−2 
and FF of 79.0%, result in an efficiency of 23.6% with a 1-cm2 
aperture area and no hysteresis, a show in Supplementary Fig. 9. 
The tandem be held at it maximum power point for over 
half an hour, under constant illumination, and maintain 23.6% 
efficiency. Supplementary Fig. 11 show performance metric for 
our final batch of device without IR reflector (Voc = 1.64± 0.02V , 
Jsc = 17.5 ± 0.2mA cm−2, FF = 79.9 ± 1.0%, and η = 22.8 ± 0.4%) 
andwith IR reflector (Voc =1.64± 0.01V , Jsc =18.2± 0.2mA cm−2, 
FF = 78.1 ± 1.0%, and η = 23.3 ± 0.4%). The high performance 
and narrow statistical distribution for these 1-cm2 cells—which be 
large-area amongst present perovskite devices—attests to the ability 
of the pulsed-CVD process to deposit a window layer that prevents 
pinhole and shunt pathways. 

Figure 2g show the measure total absorbance (1−reflectance) 
andEQEof both sub-cells in the perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell. 
The figure have be divide into several (coloured) region to help 
visualize the tandem response and loss mechanisms. Integrating 
the EQE spectrum over the AM 1.5G spectrum reveals that the 
perovskite top cell and silicon bottom cell generate 18.9mA cm−2 
and 18.5mA cm−2, respectively. We note that the silicon cell EQE 
exceeds 90% between 800 and 875 nm, which be much high than 
the measure transmittance of the single-junction perovskite cell in 
Fig. 1c. This high EQE result from a thinner ITO electrode (20 nm

between the silicon and perovskite in the tandem instead of 170 nm 
between the perovskite and glass in the single-junction cell) and 
reduce reflection due to the lack of an air interface in the tandem. 
Supplementary Figs 9 and 11 illustrate the efficacy of the SiNP 
rear reflector in increase infrared absorption within the silicon 
wafer, correspond to an increase in JSC of about 1.5mA cm−2. 
Two main current loss be front-surface reflection (area above the 
total absorbance curve) and parasitic absorption (area between the 
total absorbance and EQE curves), which account for 4.8mA cm−2 
and 4.5mA cm−2, respectively. To further improve the JSC of the 
tandem device, the easy step would be to reduce front-surface 
reflection. Were it eliminated, the sum JSC would increase by 
4.2mA cm−2. (As parasitic absorption still exists, not all transmit 
photon would be convert into electron–hole pairs.) The short- 
wavelength parasitic absorption loss associate with the first pas 
through the layer at the front of the solar cell be 1.2mA cm−2 
(0.7mA cm−2 from the ITO and 0.5mA cm−2 from the PCBM and 
SnO2/ZTO bilayer, accord to our optical simulations) would be 
gain a current in the top cell if the parasitic absorption be 
eliminated. The infrared parasitic absorption, which may occur in 
any layer in the tandem, appear to be large at 3.3mA cm−2, but this 
‘loss’ be mislead because not all of this current be available to be 
gained. Eliminating infrared parasitic absorption will result in a JSC 
gain (in the bottom cell) of less than half that value because—even 

assume Lambertian light trapping—much of the light will escape 
out the front of the cell and contribute to the measure reflectance. 

Improved stability of perovskite solar cell 
In addition to act a a highly transparent and conductive 
electrode, ITO—by virtue of it behaviour a a diffusion barrier— 
can significantly increase the thermal and environmental stability 
of a perovskite solar cell by trap the volatile methylammonium 
cation38,49. The increase thermal stability of the thermodynamically 
favourable27 mixed CsFA perovskite compare with the pure 
methylammonium perovskite26, along with the dense, pinhole-free 
ALD SnO2/ZTO bilayer, should result in perovskite solar cell 
with even great stability than previously reported. We test 
the stability of single-junction CsFA mixed perovskite solar cell 
by operating 0.48-cm2-aperture-area device at the maximum 
power point without additional encapsulation under continuous, 
one-sun-equivalent, visible illumination with a sulfur plasma lamp. 
The test be perform in ambient condition with an average room 
humidity of around 40% and the lamp heating the sample to 35 ◦C. 
Remarkably, the device operate with minimal degradation in 
performance for over 1,000 h of testing, a show in Fig. 3a. In our 
previous study, small dust particle in the perovskite result in pin- 
hole in the ITO encapsulation, create a pathway for methylam- 
monium evolution and cause eventual efficiency degradation38.

Figure 3 | Stability of perovskite top cell. a, E�ciency (black), JMPP (red), and VMPP (blue) of a single-junction perovskite device with no additional 
encapsulation during 1,000 h of continuous maximum-power-point tracking. b, E�ciency (black), JMPP (red), and VMPP (blue) of a single-junction 
perovskite device package with EVA, glass, and a butyl rubber edge seal during damp heat testing. 

In the present CsFA devices, however, no such pinhole-based 
degradation be apparent after 1,000 h of operation, speak to the 
efficacy of the conformal ALD process to prevent pinhole formation 
and to the overall increase stability of the CsFA perovskite. 

Although the cell in Fig. 3a have the same efficiency after 
1,000 h a at the start of the test, this efficiency be not constant 
over the test period. As can be see in Fig. 3a, the rise in 
efficiency during the first 400 h corresponds to an increase in 
voltage (VMPP), suggest an improvement of the NiO/perovskite 
interface or increase perovskite crystallinity. VMPP start at only 
a modest value but the lack of VMPP decay during the test be 
noteworthy. Falling current density (JMPP) be the culprit for the 
decrease in efficiency over the last 600 h of the test. The exact 
cause of this decrease in JMPP be currently be studied, but 
potential cause be the lack of an edge seal or pinhole in the 
ITO layer cause by dust particles; either case would lead to 
evolution of the organic cation. However, both of these potential 
issue can be solve through proper device encapsulation. The 
vast majority of commercial silicon solar module be encapsulate 
with the elastomeric polymer ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) and a 
glass cover sheet to prevent oxidation and moisture ingress, and 
thus to enable>25-year lifetimes. Lamination of EVA be typically 
perform at 110–150 ◦C for 30min under mild vacuum. The 
increase thermal stability38 of our perovskite device with the 
sputter ITO electrode enables u to compare the stability of our 
device directly with conventional silicon module by packaging 
our device use this industry-standard encapsulation process. We 
laminate single-junction perovskite device between two sheet of 
glass with EVA at a cure temperature of 140 ◦C for 20min. A butyl 
rubber edge seal be use to prevent moisture ingress. 

To test the efficacy of this packaging, we perform the 
damp heat test described in the International Electrotechnical 
Commission (IEC) design qualification test protocol 61215 for 
‘Crystalline Silicon Terrestrial Photovoltaic (PV) Modules’. These 
be accelerate lifetime test with the goal of rigorously test 
module for the same failure mechanism observe in the field in 
a much shorter time. The damp heat test require that the module 
withstand 85 ◦C and 85% relative humidity for 1,000 h with nomore 
than 10% degradation in performance. We perform this damp 
heat test on two package perovskite device over the course of 
6 week (1,008 h). The device be take out of the dark damp 
heat chamber once a week and measure with a maximum-power- 
track program until the efficiency stabilized. Figure 3b show 
the voltage, current and efficiency at maximum power each week. 
Not only do the device pas the damp heat test, they improve over 
the course of the test. While the efficiency of the device be initially 

limited by poor FF, VMPP increase throughout the test, similar to 
under continuous illumination (Fig. 3a). However, unlike in the 
continuous-illumination study, JMPP remains constant throughout 
the course of the damp heat test, indicate that the packaging 
successfully address potential problem such a pinhole in the 
ITO and an improper edge seal. 

Conclusions 
An ALD- or pulsed-CVD-processed SnO2/ZTO window layer have 
enable the successful fabrication of perovskite solar cell with high 
efficiency and improve stability. These vapour process produce 
a compact, conformal, uniform and highly transparent SnO2/ZTO 
bilayer with efficient hole-blocking ability and sputter buffer layer 
properties, allow for 1-cm2 device with no pinholes. These 
device have the thermal and ambient stability to be further seal 
with industry-standard encapsulation such a EVA and glass. In 
addition to be make a single-junction device on glass, the 
same device be fabricate on silicon solar cell with planar 
front surface to form two-terminal tandems. When the perovskite 
cell be couple with silicon heterojunction bottom cell with 
an excellent rear reflector and a-Si:H and ITO layer adjust for 
the exclusively infrared spectrum, the result tandem reach 
an efficiency of 23.6% with no hysteresis and stable maximum 
power over more than 30min under illumination. This efficiency 
be well beyond that of both sub-cells, beyond that of the record 
single-junction perovskite cell, and approach that of the record 
single-junction silicon cell. Performance-loss simulation suggest 
that the efficiency can be increase further by widen the 
bandgap of the perovskite and reduce front-surface reflection, 
which will enable both high match current density and high 
voltage. Perovskite/silicon tandemswith anALD SnO2/ZTO-bilayer 
layer present a promising method to achieve industry-standard 
operational lifetime with pathway to raise efficiency over 
30% (ref. 19). 

Methods 
Perovskite device fabrication. Semi-transparent perovskite device be 
fabricate on patterned, 10 per square glass from Xin Yan Technology. After 
cleaning with Extran, acetone and isopropanol, the ITO glass be UV ozone 
clean for 15min. A 1M solution of nickel nitrate hexahydrate (Sigma-Aldrich, 
puriss) and ethylenediamine (Sigma-Aldrich) in anhydrous ethylene glycol 
(Sigma-Aldrich) be spun on ITO-coated glass at 5,000 r.p.m. for 50 s and 
anneal at 300 ◦C for 1 h. The NiOx film be quickly take into a dry air box 
where the CsFA perovskite be deposit from a stoichiometric solution 
contain CsI (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.99% trace metals), formamidinium iodide 
(Dyesol), PbI2 (TCI) and PbBr2 (Sigma-Aldrich, 96%) in a mixture of 
N ,N -dimethylformamide (Sigma-Aldrich) and dimethyl sulfoxide

(Sigma-Aldrich). The solution be deposit through a 0.2 µm PTFE filter and 
spun at 1,000 r.p.m. for 11 s, follow by 6,000 r.p.m. for 30 s. During 
spin-coating, chlorobenzene be quickly dispense 5 s prior to the end of the spin 
process a an antisolvent to assist perovskite crystallization. The film be 
anneal on a hot plate at 50 ◦C for 1min and then anneal at 100 ◦C for 
30min. This deposition method be adapt from the literature27. Next, we 
thermally evaporate 1 nm of LiF and a thin 10 nm layer of PCBM. Then, we 
deposit 4 nm of stoichiometric SnO2 with pulsed-CVD at 100 ◦C on top of the 
PCBM, follow by 2 nm of zinc tin oxide. Tin oxide and zinc oxide pulsed-CVD 
process be developed on an Arradiance GEMStar-6 ALD system at 100 ◦C. 
The SnO2 pulsed-CVD cycle consist of the processing sequence: 5 s purge 
(30 sccm N2), 1.5 s TDMASn pulse (30 sccm N2), 5 s purge (90 sccm N2), 1 s 
deionize water pulse (90 sccm N2) and 5 s of purge (90 sccm N2) 
(5 s/1.5 s/5 s/1 s/5 s). The door and body temperature be maintain at 100 ◦C 
for the hot-wall reactor while the manifold temperature be 115 ◦C with a 
precursor temperature of 60 ◦C. Pulsed-CVD of zinc oxide be grown at 100 ◦C 
use diethyl zinc and water with the processing sequence: 100ms/5 s/1 s/5 s with 
a constant 90 sccm N2 flow. The reactor temperature be the same a the tin 
oxide process, but the diethyl zinc precursor be unheated. Note that ALD can be 
perform instead of pulsed-CVD above. See Supplementary Tables 1–4 for 
detail of the ALD and pulsed-CVD process parameters. For the semi-transparent 
and monolithic tandem devices, 150 nm of ITO be deposit through d.c. 
sputtering. The sputter deposition of ITO film in the work be perform a 
previously described38. An ITO witness sample on glass have a mobility of 
43 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a carrier concentration of 3.5 × 1020 cm−3. We finish the 
device stack with an evaporate or sputter silver metal electrode around the 
perimeter of the 1 cm2 device area to minimize series resistance and subsequently 
evaporate 150 nm of LiF a a second anti-reflection coating. For the damp heat 
stability testing, the single-junction solar cell be package between top and 
bottom EVA encapsulants and two sheet of 3-mm-thick glass. The butyl rubber 
edge seal be place a a frame on the outer edge of the glass during assembly. 
The package get press with 1,000mbar pressure at 140 ◦C for 20min for the 
edge seal to soften and the encapsulant to cure. 

Silicon device fabrication. An n-type, 280-µm-thick, double-side polished, 
float-zone wafer be use a the start substrate. A 250-nm-thick silicon 
nitride layer be deposit by plasma-enhanced CVD in an AMAT P5000 tool on 
one side of the wafer a a protective coating, and the wafer be then textured on 
the uncoated side in potassium hydroxide to reveal random pyramids. After 
remove the nitride coat in dilute hydrofluoric acid, the wafer be clean 
in piranha and RCA-B solutions, and the oxide be remove in buffer oxide 
etchant prior to deposition of amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) layers. Intrinsic and 
p-type a-Si:H film (7 and 15 nm thick, respectively) be first deposit by 
plasma-enhanced CVD on the textured (rear) side of the wafer, and intrinsic and 
n-type a-Si:H film (7 and 8 nm thick, respectively) be then deposit on the 
polished (front) side. A 20-nm-thick indium tin oxide (ITO) layer be sputter 
from a 90/10 In2O3/SnO2 in an MRC 944 tool on the polished side of the wafer 
through a shadow mask to define square cell 11mm on a side. A 20-nm-thick 
ITO layer be also sputter over the textured surface through the same shadow 
mask. The front ITO layer be deposit use a 2.3:100 oxygen/argon mixture, 
which result in film with electron density and mobility of approximately 
5 × 1020 cm−3 and 25 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively after anneal at 200 ◦C; in 
contrast, the rear ITO layer be deposit use a 4.1:100 oxygen/argon mixture, 
which result in film with electron density and mobility of approximately 
2 × 1020 cm−3 and 25 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, after anneal at 200 ◦C. The 
textured surface be subsequently coat with a 300-nm-thick silicon 
nanoparticle layer that be spray-coated through a stainless-steel mesh (in 
contact with the wafer) to define local opening occupy approximately 5% of 
the total area. The nanoparticles be synthesize and deposit in a custom tool 
that us a flow-through plasma process to nucleate nanoparticles from silane gas 
and deposit them via acceleration through a nozzle toward a substrate. The wafer 
be next anneal at 200 ◦C for 20min to partially oxidize the nanoparticles, and 
a 200-nm-thick silver layer be sputter through the shadow mask to cover the 
textured surface, finish the cell. 

Device characterization. Current–voltage measurement be perform use a 
Keithley model 2400 digital source meter. A 300W xenon lamp (Oriel) solar 
simulator be use to irradiate semi-transparent device from the bottom glass 
side. To irradiate tandem and semi-transparent device from the top, an Oriel 
Sol3A solar simulator be used. To negate spectral mismatch between our 
reference KG5 diode and the response of the perovskite and silicon solar cells, the 
lamp be calibrate to match the integrate photocurrent calculate by EQE. For 
the semi-transparent devices, the J–V curve be measure from forward to 
reverse bias with a 0.1V s−1 scan rate. The semi-transparent device be initially 
test use a maximum-power-tracking program that be a perturb-and-measure 
program with voltage step of 5mV. Once the device efficiency have stabilize for 
at least 10min, a J–V scan be taken. For the monolithic tandem devices, both 

forward-to-reverse and reverse-to-forward scan be measure at a rate of 
0.12V s−1. Reported value for efficiency be all evaluate on the basis of steady 
maximum-power-point operation for a minimum of a minute. The opaque cell 
and semi-transparent cell be illuminate through 0.12 and 0.39 cm2 aperture 
areas, respectively. The perovskite/silicon tandem all have an aperture area of 
1 cm2. The EQE be record a a function of the wavelength use a Keithley 
model 236. A 100W tungsten lamp (Newport) be use a the excitation source 
and focus through a Princeton Instruments SpectraPro 150 monochromator. 
The monochromatic light be chopped at around 73Hz and Stanford Research 
Systems SR830 model lock-ins be use to monitor the perovskite signal at the 
chop frequency. Data be average for 5 s at each wavelength. Each 
individual sub-cell in the tandem must be electrically isolated to obtain an EQE 
spectrum. We light-biased the silicon sub-cell with a 980 nm laser diode from 
ThorLabs and the perovskite sub-cell with a white-light LED array to measure the 
EQE of the perovskite and silicon sub-cells, respectively. No white-light bias be 
use during the EQE measurement of the single-junction perovskite devices. To 
measure the unpackaged stability under continuous illumination, device be 
test under a sulfur plasma lamp from LG (6,000K blackbody). The device be 
monitor at maximum power point use electronics from Science Wares Inc. 
The surface temperature of the device during the test be 35 ◦C, a measure with 
a temperature probe. The damp heat device be place in an 85 ◦C and 85% 
relative humidity chamber and be take out every week for performance 
measurement take at room temperature. These device be test under one 
sun on an Oriel Sol3A solar simulator. A maximum power point track 
program be write in LABVIEW to measure stable device performance.
