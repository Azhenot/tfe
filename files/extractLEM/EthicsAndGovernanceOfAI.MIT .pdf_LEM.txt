Professor Joi Ito, Director of the MIT Media Lab, co-taught with Professor Jonathan Zittrain 

MIT 
Spring 2018 



Syllabus 

I. Course Description 

This course will pursue a cross-disciplinary investigation of the implication of emerge 
technologies, with an emphasis on the development and deployment of Artificial Intelligence. 
We will cover a variety of issues, include the complex interaction between governance 
organization and sovereign states, the proliferation of algorithmic decision making, 
autonomous systems, machine learn and explanation, the search for balance between 
regulation and innovation, and the effect of AI on the dissemination of information, along with 
question related to individual rights, discrimination, and architecture of control. The course will 
entail an intense array of learn and teach methods. Students will be expect to 
participate in a variety of activities. The class may include Media Lab and Berkman Klein Center 
fellow and affiliates.
