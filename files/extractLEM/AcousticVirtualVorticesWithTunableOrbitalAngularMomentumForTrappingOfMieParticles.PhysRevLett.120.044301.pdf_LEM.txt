Acoustic vortex can transfer angular momentum and trap particles. Here, we show that particle 
trap in airborne acoustic vortex orbit at high speeds, lead to dynamic instability and ejection. We 
demonstrate stable trap inside acoustic vortex by generate sequence of short-pulsed vortex of 
equal helicity but opposite chirality. This produce a “virtual vortex” with an orbital angular momentum 
that can be tune independently of the trap force. We use this method to adjust the rotational speed of 
particle inside a vortex beam and, for the first time, create three-dimensional acoustic trap for particle of 
wavelength order (i.e., Mie particles).

Acoustic vortex have be extensively study for their 
ability to trap particle [1–3] and transfer orbital angular 
momentum (OAM) [4–13]. Acoustic vortex have be 
theorize to generate negative radiation force along the 
propagation direction [1,14,15], and recently, the stable 
three-dimensional trap of Rayleigh particle (i.e., 
radius small than the wavelength a ≪ λ) be demon- 
strated use focus acoustic vortex [16,17]. We note 
that, in this context, a stable trap be one in which the force 
be convergent on the particle and that the system be 
relatively insensitive to small perturbations. 
Acoustic vortex be wave field with a screw dislocation 

in the phasewave front [18] and an amplitude null on the axis 

pin ¼ Pðr; θÞeilφe−iωt; ð1Þ 
where (r,θ) arepolarcoordinates,ω be angular frequency, and 
Pðr; θÞ be an axisymmetric field, typically a first or high 
order Bessel function, that satisfies the scalar wave equation. 
The phase factor expðilφÞ describes the helicoidal motion 
around the propagation axis (φ refers to the azimuth angle), 
and l defines the helicity (or topological charge); it sign 
defines the handedness, or chirality, of the wave front 
propagation. 
In an acoustic vortex, both the trap force and theOAM 

be proportional to the total power of the beam [10–12], 
meaning that the rotational speed cannot be control 
independently of the trap force. This couple result 
in dynamic instability; e.g., when high power be need to 
create stiff traps, the by-product be high OAM, result in 
instability and possible ejection of the levitate particle [16]. 

Acoustic method have distinct advantage over other 
levitation methods, for example, optical, magnetic, or 
electrostatic levitation, particularly in their ability to levitate 
a wider range of material in different host fluids. 
Consequently, acoustic trap be a fundamental tool in 
chemistry [19], blood analysis [20], the study of organism in 
microgravity [21,22], control of nanomaterial self-assembly 
[23], and x-ray crystallography [24]. At the same time, 
contactless rotation have proven invaluable for understand 
planetary formation [25] and acoustic stream have be 
use to rotate microorganism for microscopy [26]. 
If the link betweenOAMand trap force could be broken, 
acoustic levitation could become an affordable and adaptable 
method for contactless rotation of sample due to the variety 
of support material and high efficiency. 
It have be show that an acoustic twin trap can be use 

to rotate a levitate particle [16,27] by alter the 
orientation of the high pressure “fingers.” However, this 
approach require the use of asymmetric particle and the 
speed of rotation be limited to the phase refresh rate of the 
drive electronics and emit devices. Acoustic vortex of 
fractional order [28] and short-pulsed vortex [29] have 
noninteger topological charges, but the OAM be still 
couple to the beam power and trap force. In optics, 
the polarization of the two beam that make a vortex can be 
adjust to change the amount of OAM independently from 
the trap strength [30]; however, a sound be a scalar 
field, this approach cannot be use directly in acoustics. 
Here, we show that rapidly time-multiplexed acoustic 

vortex of opposite direction create a time-averaged vortex, 
or virtual vortex, which can have trap force and 
OAM that be independently tunable. Acoustic virtual 
vortex be show to be able to stably trap and effectively 
control the rotational speed of levitate samples. 
Additionally, a virtual vortex of large aperture (i.e., high 
helicity) be show to steadily trap particle with diameter

large than the wavelength—a result which surpasses the 
classical Rayleigh scatter limit that have previously 
restrict stable acoustic particle trapping. 
To explore these concept experimentally, two multiele- 

ment array have be construct use air-coupled 
ultrasound transducer operating at 40 kHz (wavelength 
λ ¼ 8.66 mm in air at 25 °C). These array be name the 
spherical cap (SC) and open spherical sector (OSS). The SC 
array have a diameter of 110 mm, geometrical focus of 
70 mm, and be make of 52 air-coupled transducer (See 
Supplemental Material Fig. S1 in Ref. [31]); we use 
this array to trap expand polystyrene particle (EPS), 
with diameter range from 0.5 to 5 mm. The OSS array 
have an f number (focal length to aperture) equal to 0.1, 
with an outer diameter of 195 mm and an inner diameter of 
120 mm. It be make of 192 transducer (Fig. S2 in 
Ref. [31]); this array be use to trap EPS particle of up 
to 16 mm in diameter, correspond to ∼1.85λ. 
Through a series of experiment and accompany 

numerical simulations, we now demonstrate (a) the inherent 
instability of airborne acoustic vortices, (b) stabilization of 
a vortex beam use the virtual vortex concept, (c) control 
of rotational speed of levitate samples, and finally, 
(c) levitation of particle with diameter of wavelength 
order (i.e., Mie particles). 
Here, we term an acoustic vortex define by Eq. (1) a 

regular vortex (RV). Such vortex have be previously 
show to be suitable for trap and manipulate 
Rayleigh particles. However, a the particle get larger, 
they start to orbit around the vortex core until be eject 

out of the trap. This dynamic behavior be observe both 
in simulation and experiments, a show in Figs. 1 and 2 
a well a in the Supplemental Material (Movie S1 in 
Ref. [31]). The inability of acoustic vortex to trap particle 
large than the first high-intensity ring have be hint at 
before [44], but the actual limit in air be much lower. In 
principle, one might expect that a particle small than the 
first high-intensity ring may be stably trap (i.e., ∼6 mm 
in our setup for a regular vortex with helicity l ¼ 1). 
However, in experiments, even particle of 1.6 mm diam- 
eter be ejected. As the particle size increases, the tangential 
component of the exert force field increases, which 
cause the particle to orbit around the beam axis during 
the trap process. When the tangential force component 
cannot be sufficiently damped by the air drag, the orbit 
diameter increase until the particle be ejected. This lead to 
a threshold in the particle size that can be trap (Fig. 2). 
This phenomenon have be theoretically predict for 
particle trap in optical vortex [45–47]. 
To make vortex stable for a wider range of particle 

sizes, we switch the emit vortex chirality between þl 
and −l at high frequencies. Experimentally, this be 
achieve by switch the driver phase to make the array 
emit two different pressure fields. These pressure field will 
each exert a time-averaged radiation force on the particle. 
The total effect on the particle be a combination of these 
different force fields. This idea build on the concept of 
mode switch for control the height of particle 
passing through a stand wave in a microfluidic channel 
[48] and, in general, emerges from the acoustic radiation

vortex of opposite chirality have be generate before 
[49] and have be use for communication [50]. The idea 
of use them to control the rotational speed of particle have 
be hint at before [51], but never model or realize 
experimentally.

square wave be define by TNþ, where T be the period of the 
sinusoidal acoustic wave (40 kHz) and Nþ be the number of 
cycle of the first component. As can be seen, in general, the 
result force be a function of time and a timing diagram can 
be see in the Supplemental Material (Fig. S3 in Ref. [31]). 
However, if the switch period TR be much longer than the 
period T of the acoustic wave and much shorter than the 
period associate with the system’s time constant τ (see 
Methods in Ref. [31]), then the particle can be thought of a 
be act on by the overall time-averaged force. 
In this study, we found that the fast switch rate for 

generate a virtual vortex beam with our experimental 
parameters, without alter the stiffness of the trap, be 
Nþ ¼ N− ¼ 40 (Fig. S4 in Ref. [31]). This corresponds to 
a constant modulation time t�M ¼ TR=2 ¼ 1 m at 40 kHz 
in air. 
Figure 2 show that VVs can trap a wider range of particle 

size compare to RVs. Our experiment indicate that 

particle with diameter of up to 4 mm can be stably trap 
in aVV1ðl ¼ �1Þ, compare to 1.6mm in aRV1.However, 
this 4 mm size limit be cause by the maximum axial force 
(z direction) achievable in our devices, rather than by the 
underlie dynamics. If we neglect the z component, our 
time domain dynamic simulation (Methods in Ref. [31]) 
suggest that the size stability limit for a VV1 will be≈6 mm 
(Fig. S5 in Ref. [31]). 
Trajectory plot for particle trap inside a VV1 be 

show in the Supplemental Material (Fig. S6 in Ref. [31]); 
it be observe that VVs reduce the particle orbit behavior 
relative to RVs and hence lead to particle dynamic a if 
the azimuthal force component have be canceled. 
By regulate the amount of time that each direction of 

the vortex be emitted, the angular velocity of the particle can 
be adjust (Movie S2 in Ref. [31]). Figure 3(a) show the 
angular velocity of a 1.2 mm diameter particle trap in 
a VV1, a a function of the number of period N� of 
the emit component vortices. Figure 3(b) show that the 
particle remains in a constant z position despite rotational 
speed changes, thus demonstrate the OAM have be 
decouple from the trap force. Figure 3(c) show that 
the particle angular velocity can also be adjust by change 
the amplitude of the emit vortices. However, in this case, 
the trap force be couple to the OAM, a can be observe 
from change in the z position [Fig. 3(d)]. 
Particles with diameter significantly large than the 

wavelength have be ultrasonically manipulate in two 
dimension underwater use high f number focus 
beam (so call microbeams) [52,53]. However, this 
phenomenon only occurs if the particle be partially acous- 
tically transparent. In practice, this principle do not work 
in air, a even low-density material (i.e., EPS) have 
significantly high acoustic impedance than the

surround air. Alternatively, we note that large object 
have be levitate use near field acoustic effect 
[54–56]; i.e., the source must be place around the object 
and in close proximity (on the order of a wavelength) to the 
surface of the object. However, despite the above progress, 
three-dimensional stable acoustic trap of particle 
inside a stand wave or single beam have be funda- 
mentally limited to particle small than half wave- 
length [57]. 
Controlling the aperture of the central vortex null by 

increase the helicity of the vortex (l > 1) have be 
suggest a a method for trap of Mie particle 
[58]. A RVof high helicity would not be able to trap such 
particle due to the previously show instability, especially 
in this case, because the OAM be proportional to the 
helicity. The acoustic power of the beam can be reduce 
to reduce the OAM, but this also weakens the trap 
force. However, use VVs of high helicity, wavelength- 
scale particle can be trap a show below and in the 
Supplemental Material (Movie S3 in Ref. [31]). 
Here, we use the large OSS array to generate VV3 and 

VV5. A 10 mm (1.18λ) diameter EPS particle (weight 
10 μg) be stably trap use an excitation signal of 
12.5� 0.1 V in a VV3 (Fig. S7 in Ref. [31]). We note that 
the prediction of the axial force be 4.3% small than 
observe in the experiments. Furthermore, a particle of 
16 mm (1.88λ) diameter (weight 35 μg) be stably trap 
use an excitation signal of 15.4� 0.6 V in a VV5 
(Fig. 4), and the prediction of the axial force be 56% 
small than the experiments. The poorer experiment-to- 
simulation agreement see in the VV5 be thought to be due 
to surface irregularity in the hand-carved 16 mm diameter 
particle and the inaccuracy associate with drop test 
[59]. In Supplemental Material Movie S5 [31], the device be 
tilt beyond 90°, while a 10 mm (1.18λ) diameter particle 
be trap inside a VV3. 
We have show that regular airborne acoustic vortex 

be inherently unstable for trap particles, even when 
they be small than half-wavelength diameter. This 
instability originates from the OAM that be partially trans- 
ferred a a tangential force component that cannot be 
sufficiently damped and thus accumulates, increase the 
orbit diameter. We have create virtual vortex by rapidly 
switch between component vortex of equal helicity 
and opposite chirality. By vary the proportion of these 
component vortices, the OAM can be tune independently 
from the total beam power and trap force, lead to 
stable trap of wavelength order (i.e., Mie) particles. 
Fine rotational velocity control be achieved, a can be 
see from the small error bar in Fig. 3(a) (1% standard 
deviation over mean value). 
To ensure stability of the virtual vortices, the switch 

rate must be tune consider the dynamic of the system, 
which depends critically on particle size. To avoid ejection 
of EPS particle of 1.6 mm diameter, the switch speed 

need to be faster than 1200 period (30 ms), for particle of 
2 mm 5000 period (13 ms) and for particle of 3 mm 1000 
period (2ms) (Fig. S8 in Ref. [31]). Through analysis of the 
particle dynamic simulations, the effect that dominate here 
be that, a particle size increases, the tangential component of 
the force field also increase (see force vector in Fig. 1). 
For the first time, we have achieve stable acoustic 3D 

trap of wavelength-scale particle (16 mm or 1.88λ). 
Using a more powerful device, our simulation suggest 
that, use virtual vortices, we could have reach particle

size of up to 20 mm (2.32λ) use a VV5 (Fig. S5 in 
Ref. [31]). In Supplemental Material Movie S4 [31], 
we show two-dimesional trap of a particle of 5 cm 
diameter (5.88λ), support on a table, and control it 
rotation with a VV12. 
All the present result be for airborne acoustic 

vortices, but simulation (Fig. S9 in Ref. [31]) suggest 
that the instability due to accumulation of orbital momen- 
tum also affect vortex in other media, such a water or 
blood. Instabilities be report when trap particle in 
water in two dimension use high-aperture vortex [58], 
although their cause be not certain. 
We anticipate that virtual vortex will allow novel 

application in particle centrifugation and manipulation 
of arbitrarily size particles. With the standard acoustic 
levitation methods, numerous application have be 
developed: i.e., crystallography [24], microscopy [60], 
and spectroscopy [61]. Therefore, the introduction of 
virtual vortex will extend the current us of acoustic 
levitation to allow large object to be manipulate and 
their rotation controlled. Virtual vortex can also benefit 
other field in which vortex be employed, such a 
microfluidics [62,63], optic [45], and electron beam [64].
