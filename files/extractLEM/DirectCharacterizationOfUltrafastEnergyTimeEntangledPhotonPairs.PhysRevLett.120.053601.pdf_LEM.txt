Energy-time entangle photon be critical in many quantum optical phenomenon and have emerge a 
important element in quantum information protocols. Entanglement in this degree of freedom often 
manifest itself on ultrafast time scales, make it very difficult to detect, whether one employ direct or 
interferometric techniques, a photon-counting detector have insufficient time resolution. Here, we 
implement ultrafast photon counter base on nonlinear interaction and strong femtosecond laser pulse to 
probe energy-time entanglement in this important regime. Using this technique and single-photon 
spectrometers, we characterize all the spectral and temporal correlation of two entangle photon with 
femtosecond resolution. This enables the witness of energy-time entanglement use uncertainty 
relation and the direct observation of nonlocal dispersion cancellation on ultrafast time scales. These 
technique be essential to understand and control the energy-time degree of freedom of light for ultrafast 
quantum optics.

The energy-time degree of freedom of nonclassical light 
be of great interest for quantum information, a it support 
various encodings, include frequency bin [1], time bin 
[2], and broadband temporal mode [3], and be intrinsically 
robust for propagation through long-distance fiber link [4]. 
Applications which harness quantum correlation in this 
degree of freedom, refer to a energy-time entanglement 
[5], include dispersion cancellation [6,7], high-dimensional 
quantum key distribution [8,9], and quantum-enhanced 
clock synchronization [10]. In ultrafast optic and atto- 
second physics, the ability to measure both frequency and 
temporal feature have lead to important innovation in 
electric field reconstruction technique [11,12] and pulse 
characterization on very short time scales, enable 
advance in spectroscopy [13], laser physic [14], nonlinear 
optic [15], and image [16]. In order to characterize and 
control energy-time entangle photon and advance bipho- 
ton pulse shaping, similar measurement capability be 
essential in the quantum regime. 
Experimental signature of entanglement can arise in 

correlation measurement of complementary variable [17], 
or through nonlocal quantum effect [5,6]. With the energy- 
time degree of freedom, one complementary set consists of 
measure the intensity correlation a a function of the 
photon frequency and a a function of their time of arrival. 
These have be individually realize for different photonic 
system with measurement in frequency [18,19] or in time 
[20–22]. Certifying the presence of entanglement with 
direct measurement require both spectral and temporal 
correlations, since acquire only one remains insufficient 
to uniquely specify the other due to the ambiguity of the 

spectral phase. Depending on the platform, this can be 
challenging. Narrow-band photon from atomic system 
can be readily measure in time but be difficult to 
spectrally resolve [22]. THz-bandwidth photon produce 
in spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) be 
often characterize spectrally, but they can have feature 
on femtosecond time scale below current detector reso- 
lution [23]. 
Other technique can be employ to infer the presence 

of energy-time entanglement. High-order interference 
effect with Franson interferometer have be use to 
illustrate entanglement between two [24] and three photon 
[25]. Nonlocal dispersion cancellation [6], whereby the 
temporal spread in coincidence remains unchanged when 
equal and opposite dispersion be apply to each photon, can 
also be use to witness entanglement [26,27]. For either 
method to be effective, the detector resolution must be 
shorter than the time scale of the correlations. Strong 
energy-time entanglement can nonetheless exist when the 
time scale of the correlation be shorter. Certain obser- 
vations have point to nonlocal dispersion cancellation in 
this regime, but they either require introduce a very 
large amount of dispersion such that temporal resolution 
could be achieve with standard detector [28], or use 
sum-frequency generation (SFG) between the photon pair 
[29], which, unlike measurement with fast and indepen- 
dent detectors, have a close classical analogue [30]. Directly 
measure ultrafast quantum effect require new method 
to control and analyze single photon in the time domain. 
In nonlinear optic and laser physics, optical gate be 

widely use to overcome limitation with detector which

be too slow to observe feature on subpicosecond time 
scales. The gate be achieve by combine the signal with 
a short gate pulse in a nonlinear medium and measure the 
up-conversion signal on the detector. With fast gate and 
slow detectors, an effective fast detector can be engineer 
to temporally resolve single photon [31,32] and photon 
pair [20]. In this Letter, we develop fast optical gate to 
achieve subpicosecond timing resolution for spatially 
separate pair of single photons. We use this technique 
in conjunction with single-photon spectrometer to explic- 
itly measure both the spectral and temporal correlation of 
broadband photons, a well a the cross-correlations 
between the frequency of one photon and the time of 
arrival of the other. Furthermore, by control the 
dispersion of each photon, our high-resolution joint tem- 
poral measurement make it possible to directly observe 
nonlocal dispersion cancellation on femtosecond time 
scales. 
Through spectral and temporal measurements, energy- 

time entanglement can be witness by violate uncer- 
tainty relation [33,34]. Two separable photon or classical 
pulse must satisfy the follow inequality [17,21]: 

Δðωs þ ωiÞΔðts − tiÞ ≥ 1; ð1Þ 

where each photon, label signal, and idler be described by 
it frequencyω and it time of arrival t, andΔ represent the 
standard deviation in the joint spectrum or joint temporal 
intensity. In other words, there be a nontrivial limit to the 
strength of the product of correlation between the sum of 
the frequency and the difference in time of arrival if the 
photon be separable. However, this be not the case for 
energy-time entangle photons, where the right side of 

Eq. (1) can approach zero. Thus, the uncertainty relation be 
an entanglement witness. 
Two-photon state produce via SPDC be usually 

energy-time entangled. In down-conversion, energy con- 
servation tends to lead to entangle state with frequency 
anticorrelations, although dispersion engineer SPDC 
source have be explore to produce photon pair with 
uncorrelated [35,36] or even positively correlate frequen- 
cies [37–41]. For a pure state with no spectral phase, strong 
frequency correlation imply strong correlation in the time 
of arrival of the photons. Under these conditions, Eq. (1) 
can be violated, provide one have sufficient resolution in 
the measurements. 
Our experimental setup be show in Fig. 1. The laser 

output at 775 nm be frequency-doubled to 387.5 nm in 
2 mm of bismuth-borate (BiBO). The result pump light 
be spectrally narrow use a 0.085 nm ð1= ffiffiffiep Þ bandpass 
filter. Signal and idler photon pair be create through 
type-I SPDC of the pump in 5 mm of BiBO with central 
wavelength of 729 nm and 827 nm, respectively. The 
bandwidth be control use tunable spectral edge 
filters, after which the photon be couple to single-mode 
fibers. The fiber allow for easy switch between spectral 
measurement, temporal measurement, and direct detection. 
The dispersion of the fiber link be then compensate with 
grating-based pulse compressors. Spectral measurement 
be perform with grating-based scan monochroma- 
tor with a resolution of about 0.1 nm. Temporal measure- 
ments be perform through sum-frequency generation in 
1 mm of type-I BiBO with a strong gate laser pulse with an

spectral bandpass filter which remove the second har- 
monic background of the gate pulse. Detection event for 
the signal and idler be measure in coincidence after they 
have pass through either both spectrometers, both tem- 
poral gates, or one of each. The correspond measure 
joint spectrum, joint temporal intensity, and time-frequency 
plots, which measure the frequency of one photon in 
coincidence with the arrival time of the other, be show 
in Fig. 2. Background subtraction have not be employ in 
the data [42]. 
The SFG employ in the temporal measurement can 

approach unit efficiency when the temporal duration of the 
photon be approximately the same length in time or shorter 
than the gate pulse [45]. However, in the present experi- 
ment, the photon be much longer than the gate, and 
consequently, we estimate a maximum up-conversion 
efficiency of approximately 30% [46]. The absolute effi- 
ciency of the temporal measurement apparatus at the 

cross-correlation peak, include fiber coupling, chirp 
compensation, and up-conversion, be found to be approx- 
imately 2% of this maximum. 
For each joint measurement of Fig. 2, the marginal width 

be obtain by fitting the marginals to a one-dimensional 
Gaussian, while the herald width be obtain by take 
the average of several slice of the data when the frequency 
or time of one photon be fixed. The statistical correlation, ρ, 
be obtain by find the value that best fit a two- 
dimensional Gaussian with the measure marginals. 
Since the finite resolution of both spectral and temporal 
measurement be of the same order of magnitude a the 
spectral and temporal distributions, the measure feature 
will be broadened. To account for this, the fit parameter be 
deconvolved assume a Gaussian response function [41], 
and these value for the joint spectrum and joint temporal 
distribution of Figs. 2(a) and 2(d) be present in Table I. 
The measure joint spectrum show in Fig. 2(a) 

exhibit strong anticorrelation (−0.9951� 0.0001) in 
the signal and idler frequencies, while the joint temporal 
intensity of Fig. 2(d) show strong positive correlation 
(0.987� 0.004) in the arrival time of the photons. We 
can witness the effect of the spectral phase in Figs. 2(b) 
and 2(c), which show weak correlation between the 
frequency of one photon and the time of arrival of the 
other. Low correlation in the time-frequency plot may 
indicate little uncompensated dispersion in the experiment 
(see Supplemental Material [42]). 
The spectral and timing correlation be further analyze 

by binning the data present in Figs. 2(a) and 2(d) into 
histogram base on ω1 þ ω2 and t − ti, a well a ωs − ωi 
and t þ ti for comparison, a show in Fig. 3. The bin 
size be select to match the step size of the measu- 
rement apparatus. Gaussian fit to the histogram 
give a joint uncertainty product Δðωs þωiÞΔðts − tiÞ ¼ 
ð1.429� 0.006 ps−1Þð0.203� 0.005 psÞ ¼ 0.290� 0.007, 
which violates the inequality of Eq. (1) by about 100

standard deviations. Error bar be obtain via 
Monte Carlo simulation assume Poissonian noise. 
When deconvolved, we find ΔðωsþωiÞΔðts− tiÞ¼ 
ð1.329�0.007 ps−1Þð0.110�0.010 psÞ¼0.15�0.01. The 
measure uncertainty product thus provide a clear witness 
of energy-time entanglement on ultrafast time scales. 
We now turn to the problem of measure the impact of 

dispersion on our energy-time entangle state. We directly 
observe the effect of apply dispersion on the temporal 
correlations, a present in the joint temporal intensity of 
Fig. 4. We control the spectral phase of the photons, 
ϕðωs;ωiÞ ≈ Asðωs − ωs0Þ2 þ Aiðωi − ωi0Þ2, with two gra- 
ting compressors, where the chirp parameter As and Ai be 
for the signal and idler fields, respectively. We estimate the 
magnitude of the apply dispersion from the geometry of 
the compressor and the relative position of the grating 
[47], and measure the standard deviation Δðts − tiÞ of a 
Gaussian fit from histogram of t − ti. 
Starting from the case with no dispersion [Fig. 4(a)], we 

apply positive dispersion As ¼ ð0.0373� 0.0015Þ ps2 to 
only the signal [Fig. 4(b)] and negative dispersion Ai ¼ 
−ð0.0359� 0.0014Þ ps2 to only the idler [Fig. 4(c)]. In 
these two cases, we observe a large increase in the timing 
uncertainty Δðts − tiÞ and a vertical or horizontal shear of 
the joint-temporal intensity along the correspond axis. 
We then apply the same amount of positive and negative 
dispersion to the signal and idler a before [Fig. 4(d)], 
where the dispersion apply to the idler be set to minimize 
the timing uncertainty between the two photons. Here, the 
timing uncertainty in arrival time Δðts − tiÞ be almost 

unchanged. This be the signature of nonlocal dispersion 
cancellation, limited by the finite correlation of the initial 
two-photon state (see Supplemental Material [42]). The 
temporal marginals in Fig. 4(d) still increase, since each 
side remains expose to a significant amount of dispersion. 
For classical pulses, the effect of dispersion on 

the correlation in arrival time can be express a an in- 
equality [26], Δðts − tiÞ2F ≥ Δðts − tiÞ20 þ 4A2=Δðts − tiÞ20, 
whereΔðts − tiÞ0 be the initial difference in detection times, 
and Δðts − tiÞF be the final difference with equal and 
opposite dispersion A apply on each side. Under the 
assumption that the initial state be unchirped, take the 
measure initial value from Fig. 4(a), Δðts − tiÞ0 ¼ 
0.235 p (0.162 p when correct for the gate resolution), 
and use the average magnitude of the apply dispersion 
A ¼ 0.0366 ps2, we calculate that the standard deviation in

arrival time for classical pulse have to be at least Δðts − 
tiÞF ≥ 0.390 p (0.480 ps). However, the measure uncer- 
tainty observe in Fig. 4(d),Δðts− tiÞ¼ð0.245�0.004Þ ps, 
remains significantly smaller. The experimental apparatus 
thus provide a direct way to detect this inherently quantum 
effect in a regime inaccessible to current detectors. 
We have directly measure both the temporal and 

frequency correlation of an ultrafast biphoton pulse. 
Optical gate employ here be critical for realize 
ultrafast coincidence detection and correspondingly high- 
resolution temporal measurements. We observe energy- 
time entanglement via a joint time-bandwidth inequality 
and demonstrate ultrafast nonlocal dispersion cancellation 
of the biphotons with direct and independent detection. 
This work can be extend to quantum interference 
measurement on ultrafast time scales, and can be com- 
bin with temporal image to greatly increase the 
versatility of energy-time entangle photon for quantum 
information applications.
