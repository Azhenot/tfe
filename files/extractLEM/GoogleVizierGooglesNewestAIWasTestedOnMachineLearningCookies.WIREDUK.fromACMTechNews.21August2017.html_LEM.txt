Google's new AI learns by baking tasty machine learn cooky 


The system "designs excellent cookies", accord to it creator

Google's computer scientist have create an AI to tweak the company’s other AIs. The advanced machine learn 
system, which go by the faintly sinister name of Google Vizier, 
automatically tune algorithm right across Google’s parent company 
Alphabet. But to test it, the researcher use an old-fashioned metric: 
cookie quality in the canteen.

Modern machine learn system be the 
algorithmic equivalent of Formula 1 race cars. The system have 
tremendous power, but they be extremely sensitive: to function 
effectively they need to be finely tuned, usually by hand.

In particular, the system need 
carefully set 'hyperparameters': parameter set in advance that be 
adapt to the problem at hand. This isn’t easy, because machine 
learn system be “black boxes”: even when you’ve make them, you can 
never be entirely sure how they get their results. One common method for 
tune be know in the field a “grad student descent”: basically, you get a graduate student to twiddle the parameter until the algorithm works. 
Google 
Vizier cut short this tedious manual task by automatically optimise 
hyperparameters of machine learn models. According to Google’s 
researchers, the system be already in use across the company. 
"Our 
implementation scale to service the entire hyperparameter tune 
workload across Alphabet, which be extensive," they write in a paper release this week, 
cite an example where Google researcher “used Vizier to perform 
hyperparameter tune study that collectively contain million of 
trial for a research project… That research project would not be 
possible without effective black–box optimisation.”

One process employ in Google 
Vizier be call 'transfer learning,' essentially, learn from 
experience. Using data from previous study a a guide, the Vizier 
algorithm can suggest optimal hyperparameters for new algorithms. The 
method be most effective when there have be lot of study in the 
area, but it also work when there be relatively little crossover: for 
instance "when the observe metric and the sample of the datasets be 
different".

well a help research, Google Vizier be be put to use at 
Alphabet, where, it creator write, it "has make notable improvement 
to production model underlie many Google products, result in 
measurably good user experience for over a billion people".

These improvement include

the system be be use to optimise the trade-off between the 
relevance of a particular search and the distance of that result from 
the user (with the inevitable aim of get high engagement for 
Google).

Google Vizier can also be use to solve black box 
optimisation problem in the messy physical world. And this be where the 
cooky come in. 
To test their system, the researcher give 
cookie recipe to the contractor who make the pudding in Google’s 
canteen. They taste-tested the result and tracked any alteration the 
chef make to improve the taste. Recipes be a kind of algorithm in 
their own right, with similar black box property (because you never 
exactly know why your bake go wrong). And this test allow the 
researcher to try out their transfer learn approach: 
ADVERTISEMENT 




“Before start to bake at large scale, we bake 
some recipe in a small scale run-through,” they write. “This 
provide useful data that we could transfer learn from when baking at 
scale.” 
Even when thing go slightly wrong – as, for instance, 
when the dough be allow to sit longer, which "unexpectedly, and 
somewhat dramatically, increase the subjective spiciness of the cooky 
for trial that involve cayenne" – the schema be able to respond. 
After a number of rounds, the cooky improve significantly, the 
researcher say: 
“Later round be extremely well-rated and, in the authors’ opinions, delicious."
