Can the human brain learn to interpret input from a virtual world deliver directly 
through brain stimulation? We answer this question by describe the first demonstration 
of human play a computer game utilize only direct brain stimulation and no other 
sensory inputs. The demonstration also provide the first instance of artificial sensory 
information, in this case depth, be deliver directly to the human brain through 
non-invasive methods. Our approach utilizes transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) 
of the human visual cortex to convey binary information about obstacle in a virtual 
maze. At certain intensities, TMS elicits visual percept know a phosphenes, which 
transmit information to the subject about their current location within the maze. Using 
this computer–brain interface, five subject successfully navigate an average of 92% 
of all the step in a variety of virtual maze worlds. They also become more accurate 
in solve the task over time. These result suggest that human can learn to utilize 
information deliver directly and non-invasively to their brain to solve task that cannot 
be solve use their natural senses, opening the door to human sensory augmentation 
and novel mode of human–computer interaction.

Considerable progress have be make in interpret information record from the brain to build 
non-invasive brain–computer interface (BCIs) (Rao, 2013) that allow control over a wide variety 
of devices, such a cursor (Wolpaw et al., 1991), robot (Bell et al., 2008), and speller (Xu et al., 
2013). While these effort have focus on decode information from the brain, an important 
question that have not receive a much attention is: can novel information from artificial sensor 
or computer-generated virtual world be encode and deliver non-invasively to the human brain 
to solve useful tasks? We address this question by show that transcranial magnetic stimulation 
(TMS) can be use to deliver useful information to the human brain to solve a simple navigation task 
in a virtual world. To our knowledge, this be the first demonstration that non-invasive human brain 
stimulation can be use for such a purpose, the most closely related previous demonstration be 
the work of Thomson et al. (2013) who use invasive stimulation of somatosensory cortex in rat to 
deliver infrared information for solve a discrimination task. Other research efforts, also in rats, 
have focus on the neural mechanism of navigation in virtual reality use visual or auditory cue 
(Cushman et al., 2013; Aghajan et al., 2015) rather than direct sensory feedback through stimulation.

maze (see Figure 2). The subject’s avatar start in the upper-left corner of 
the maze. The goal be to move the avatar toward the bottom-rightmost 
position. The intensity of the TMS pulse be determine by the position of the 
closest wall in front of the avatar. If a wall be directly in front of the avatar, the 
subject receives an above-threshold pulse. A subthreshold pulse be fire if 
there be no wall directly in front of the avatar, a in this figure.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation have be and continue to 
be use a an important investigative tool for cortical “knockout” 
study (Pascual-Leone et al., 1999; Devlin and Watkins, 2007), 
neurophysiology (Terhune et al., 2015), and medical treatment 
(Menkes et al., 1999; George et al., 2000). The realm of applica- 
tions of TMS have recently expand a it have emerge a a tool 
for non-invasive neural encode of information via a computer– 
brain interface (CBI), specifically within the context of human 
brain-to-brain communication (Grau et al., 2014; Rao et al., 2014; 
Stocco et al., 2015). Rao et al. (2014) utilized TMS over the pri- 
mary motor cortex to elicit a hand movement in correspondence 
with change in the motor rhythm (mu band power) of another 
subject. As with Rao and colleagues, Grau et al. (2014) transfer 
information through a brain-to-brain interface utilize change 
in mu band power and encode information in TMS-produced 
phosphenes, though the information transfer be not in real 
time. The presence or absence of phosphenes, temporary visual 
percept of line or spot that can occur upon neuromodulation 
of the visual cortex represent a binary message that be use to 
build simple words. Stocco et al. (2015) also utilized phosphene 
perception in a different brain-to-brain interface that allow 
2-way communication. In this case, Yes/No answer in a 20-ques- 
tions game be decode from one subject’s steady-state visually 
evoke potential (SSVEPs) and sent in real-time to another 
subject, where this information be encode in the presence or 
absence of phosphenes. 

In the present study, phosphene elicitation via single pulse 
TMS over the primary visual cortex be utilized for augment 
human sensory capability. Information be relayed to the subject 
about obstacle depth in a virtual environment where the subject be 
deprive of visual information about the world they be navigat- 
ing. The intensity of stimulation depends on the relative position 
of an avatar to the wall of the maze, such that be close to the 
wall cause the subject to perceive a phosphene and be far 
from a wall result in the absence of a phosphene. The subject 
advance in the maze if they correctly interpret the stimulation. 

We demonstrate that the decision time in classification of 
phosphenes directly correlate with the probability of answer- 
ing correctly. Subjects also become more accurate in solve 
the navigation task over the course of the experiment. Both of 
these result suggest that phosphene perception be an interpret- 
able phenomenon, allow subject to learn to interpret and 
incorporate input from a CBI a a new artificial source of useful 
sensory signals.

subject recruitment 
Five healthy participant (age: M = 30.6, SD = 6.95, range 
19–39; 3 females; see Table 1) be recruit via word of mouth 
among the University of Washington student, staff, and faculty 
population. This study be carry out in accordance with the 
recommendation of the University of Washington Institutional 
Review Board under application #48773. All subject give write 
inform consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki 
prior to participation in the study. All subject recruit success- 
fully complete the experiment. 

generation of Mazes 
Fourteen experimental maze and seven control maze (see 
Control Conditions below) be generate and utilized for all 
participants. All maze be 10 step in length and consist 
of a path that require a combination of forward or downward 
movement (Figure 1). The 14 experimental maze comprise of 
two set of seven mazes. Each set of seven maze consist of one 
maze with each of zero through six “turns” randomly distribute 
throughout the maze, where a turn be a switch between forward 
and downward movements. The second set of seven experimental 
maze represent the mirror image of the first set, such that all 
forward movement be replace with downward movement 
and vice versa. The control maze be select such that for each 
of the one through six turn conditions, a maze from the original

FigUre 2 | all subject be test on the same maze in the same order. Each maze be 10 step in length. Participants only advanced if they correctly 
interpret the input from the CBI and make the correct movement.

set or the mirror set be randomly select and add to the 
control set. The control maze with 0 turn be select to include 
only downward movement to avoid the trivial case in which a 
subject would likely finish the maze under the control conditions. 
The order in which the maze be present to the subject be 
randomize once and kept consistent between subjects. Figure 2 
illustrates the maze use in the experiment. 

control condition 
In order to ensure that information come solely from the CBI, 
7 control game be randomly intermixed with the 14 experi- 
mental games. During these control trials, a custom-made plastic 
prop, whose design be intend to mimic the shape and texture 
of the TMS coil, be place over the coil, separate the coil from 
the scalp of the subject by 20 mm (Figure 3). This additional 
distance prevents the appearance of phosphenes while mimick- 
ing other sensory cue that could provide information about the 
subject’s location in the maze, such a the noise and the vibration 
generate by the TMS machine upon firing. This prop be test 
for each subject during the thresholding phase (described below) 
to ensure it effectiveness in prevent phosphene perception. 

Prior to the experiment, subject be make aware of the 
existence of the control condition but be not inform about 

which game the control condition would apply to or the ratio of 
experimental to control games. During the control condition, the 
TMS machine still fire at intensity appropriate to the avatar’s 
location within the maze, irrelevant of it designation a a control 
game. Upon completion of the control maze, the subject be 
notify of the game’s designation a part of the control set so a 
to not mislead the subject about their performance, which may 
impede their confidence in phosphene perception and influence 
their future performance. 

The methodology with which the maze be construct 
ensure that one maze consist of a straight hallway with no 
turns, which would cause all TMS pulse to be subthreshold, and 
would thus mimic the perception of a control condition while 
not actually be a control maze. This be do to help prevent 
subject from try to guess whether the control condition be 
in place from a prolong lack of phosphenes. 

Determination of Phosphene Thresholds 
Prior to the experiment, each subject underwent a screen ses- 
sion in order to determine the intensity and location at which they 
reliably perceive phosphenes from a single pulse TMS stimula- 
tion. As convention, the intensity of stimulation be express a a 
percentage of the maximum output, which, in this case, be a 2.2-T

FigUre 5 | The phosphene threshold for each subject be found by 
first mark a 4 cm × 4 cm grid 1 cm dorsal to the inion. A candidate 
location be determine by stimulate at increase intensity up to 75%. 
If a phosphene be not perceived, a new location be examined. The final 
above-threshold intensity be establish a the minimum intensity for which 
subject perceive a phosphene for 10 consecutive stimulations. Conversely, 
the subthreshold intensity be establish a the maximum intensity for which 
a subject do not perceive a phosphene after 10 consecutive stimulations. 

FigUre 4 | Depiction of the experimental setup. The subject sat on a 
BrainSight™ chair (Rogue Research, Montreal, QC, Canada) with a white 
swim cap in front of a touch screen monitor (a) with their head situate in a 
two-pronged head-and-chin-rest (B). The current maze be displayed to the 
experimenter on a separate monitor not visible to the subject (c). A 
figure-eight TMS coil (D) be situate over the stimulation site in the 
orientation shown. The angle of the coil be consistent across all subjects. In 
the control condition, the coil be cover by the control prop (partially 
visible in the figure; see Figure 3). The coil, power by a MagStim Super 
Rapid2 stimulator (e), be position use a laser pointer (F) at the 
begin of every maze game. 

FigUre 3 | (a) The photo show the prop use in the control condition. It be 
design to mimic the texture and size of the TMS coil, but when apply to 
the coil (B), it separate the coil from the head by 20 mm, thus prevent 
the appearance of phosphenes.

magnetic field from a 70-mm figure-of-8 coil (Double 70 mm 
Alpha coil, Magstim, UK; Figure 4) generate by a 660-V electric 
field from a biphasic transcranial magnetic stimulator (Super 
Rapid2, Magstim, UK; Figure 4). The subject wore a tight-fitting 
cap, in which the location of the inion be marked a a reference 
point for the stimulation process. A 4 cm × 4 cm grid of locations, 
arrange in 1-cm space row and columns, be then drawn 1 cm 
dorsal to the inion (Figure 5). For a give location, the suitability 
a a candidate “hotspot” for stimulation be determine by 
administer seven pulse of increase intensity, in increment 
of 5%, start at 45%. If the subject do not perceive a phosphene 
by the 75% mark, a new location be examined. Based on the 

result of Stocco et al. (2015), the first stimulation site examine 
be 2 cm dorsal, 1 cm left of the inion. Subsequent site be 
then examine at increase distance from this start point. 
The first location at which the subject could perceive phosphenes 
at intensity less than 75% be designate a the target site for 
the stimulation hotspot. For safety, the subject be not stimu- 
lated more than once in a give 8 s interval, either during the 
thresholding procedure or during the experimental session. The 
above-threshold intensity be determine a the low intensity 
for which the subject report phosphene perception for 10 con- 
secutive stimulations. Conversely, the subthreshold intensity be 
determine a the large intensity for which no phosphene be 
perceive for 10 consecutive stimulations. The control condition 
be then test to ensure that participant could not perceive 
phosphenes when stimulate at the above-threshold intensity. 

It should be note that this method of phosphene perception 
implicitly account for minute individual difference between 
subjects, such a vary skull thickness or neural architecture. 
Additionally, only a subset of all possible stimulation location 
and parameter be examined. While a more reliable stimulation 
site may exist, the first reliable location be select in order to 
minimize the number of stimulation administer during the 
thresholding phase. Therefore, because the choice of the location 
be not optimize for each subject, our result be likely a con- 
servative estimate and underestimate the participants’ achievable 
performance.

FigUre 6 | For each maze, the subject have ten opportunity for 
movement. An example of four hypothetical movement be show above. 
Note that the maze be not visible to the subject until the end of the trial, and 
all movement decision must be make base only on TMS pulses. (a) The 
avatar be directly in front of a wall, thus trigger an above-threshold TMS 
pulse. The subject identifies this pulse correctly and make a discrete 
movement down to the location show in (B). (B) Since no wall be in front of 
the avatar, a subthreshold pulse be triggered. The subject correctly identifies 
this pulse and advance to the location show in (c). (c) No wall directly in 
front corresponds to another subthreshold pulse. This time, the subject 
misidentifies the pulse and do not advance. (D) The white dot mark the 
location the avatar would have occupy if the subject have answer with 
100% accuracy for the duration of current game (the white dot only mark 
this optimal location and have no influence on pulse intensity). As there be still 
no wall directly in front of the avatar, a subthreshold pulse be fire again. The 
subject correctly identifies that no obstacle be directly in the avatar’s path and 
advance one space forward. (e) This mark the end of the game. At this 
point, the maze be displayed on the subject’s screen to provide feedback on 
how far they progress through the maze. Note that whenever the subject 
view the screen, either the avatar or the white dot will occupy the last 
location in the maze, correspond to complete or not complete the 
maze, respectively.

noise-canceling earplug be use to help mask potential external 
cue and allow for good concentration. The TMS coil be place 
over the subject’s occipital lobe at a location determine during 
the thresholding procedure (described above). The subject’s 
avatar start in the upper-left portion of the maze (Figure 1). 
If the avatar be directly in front of a wall, an above-threshold 
TMS pulse be fired; otherwise, a subthreshold pulse be fired. 
Note that the maze be displayed on a second screen visible 
only to the experimenter (Figure 4) and remain hidden from 
the participant until the end of each maze. Instead, the screen 
visible to participant displayed a fixation sign cross while they 
wait for the next stimulation. Two second after the TMS fired, 
a question box appear ask if the subject wish to move 
forward in the maze or down a ladder. To avoid potential confu- 
sion, a reminder that the presence of a phosphene corresponds 
to a downward movement also displayed on screen. The subject 
answer the question by hit one of two button on the touch 
screen computer monitor to move forward or downward. If the 
subject identify the necessary movement correctly, their avatar 
advanced one space in that direction. If the subject misinter- 
preted the stimulation, they do not advance forward in the maze 
(Figure 6); in this case, the avatar remain in the same location, 
and the same intensity stimulation be fire in the next time step, 
effectively repeat the time step. Each maze require 10 correct 
step to be traverse completely. Correspondingly, each subject 
be give 10 stimulation per maze, and thus 10 opportunity 
to move. After the 10 simulations, the maze be displayed on the 
subject’s screen to allow them to view their avatar’s final location 
within the maze, and the subject be notify if that game be 
part of the control set. The maze be then hidden from their view 
a the next game commenced. Prior to the start of each game, the 
experimenter examine the subject’s head position and relative 
coil position use a guide laser point at the stimulation site 
(Figure 4). If the next maze be a part of the control set, the 
experimenter attach the control prop (Figure 3) to the TMS 
coil when readjust head position. To keep the timing of the 
operation consistent across different conditions, the experi- 
menter mimicked the procedure of insert the control prop 
before every trial, include experimental trials. 

resUlTs 

On average, participant completely traverse 70% of the maze 
under the experimental condition and 0% in the control 
conditions. The difference be statistically significant [paired 
t(4) = 3.89, p < 0.02; Figure 7A]. Note that, a participant 
need 10 consecutive correct categorization in order to 
complete a maze, a single mistake cause them to fall short of 
traverse the entire maze. Therefore, this analysis be a conserva- 
tive measure of performance. A more sensitive measure be the 
number of correct step perform by participant under each 
condition. Participants complete an average of 92% of the step 
in the experimental condition, significantly more than 15.4% 
of the step in the control condition [t(4) = 11.59, p = 0.0003; 
Figure 7B]. In the control conditions, an ideal observer would 
always assume that, since no phosphenes be be perceived, he 
or she should always move forward. This would result in correctly 

perform only the initial forward movement for the control 
maze and get “stuck” at the first wall obstacle. This repre- 
sent 14.2% of the total number of movement and be thus the 
baseline performance for the control condition. Two one-sided 
t-tests show that participant perform above baseline in the 
experimental condition [t(4) = 14.15, p = 0.0001], but not in the 
control condition [t(4) = 1.00, p = 0.38]. 

Signal detection theory also provide another dimension of 
analysis. Specifically, the performance of each subject can be 
visually described use ROC curve (Fawcett and Tom, 2006), 
which plot the true positive rate vs. the false positive rate for 
both experimental and control conditions. In this analysis, the 
“signal” be the correct direction at each step, and the “predic- 
tion” be the action select by the participant. Figure 8 show the 
ROC curve for each participant. Within this framework, the 
performance of each participant in both the experimental and 
control condition can be quantify a the area under the curve

statistically significant from baseline performance (dashed line). (a) The proportion of maze solve (i.e., fully traversed) range from 0 to 100% in the experimental 
condition. In order to fully traverse a maze, subject have to correctly classify all 10 consecutive pulses. (B) This figure show the aggregate accuracy for the entirety 
of the experiment. One subject, despite not fully traverse any maze, still have an accuracy of over 70% for the experimental condition. (c) The AUC plot be the area

participant.

(AUC) of the correspond ROC plot (Figure 7C). The AUC 
value range from 1.0 (an ideal detector that recognizes all true 
positive with 0 false positives) to 0.5 (a random responder). 
Individual AUCs be calculate use the ROCR package for 
R (Sing et al., 2005). Because the AUC be inherently non-normal, 
the raw data be arcsin-root transform before be ana- 
lyzed. The mean raw AUC for the control condition be exactly 
at chance (0.50), whereas the raw AUC for the experimental 
condition be 0.93. This be significantly large than chance 
[t(4) = 9.40, p = 0.0007]. 

A final measure of interest be the number of bit successfully 
transfer to the participant use the TMS stimulation by 
the CBI. This measure be best capture by the mutual informa- 
tion between the series of TMS pulse and the participant’s 
responses. The mutual information value be calculate use 
the Infotheo package for R (Meyer, 2014), use the empiri- 
cal probability distribution of zero and one to estimate the 
correspond entropy (Cover and Thomas, 2005). The actual 
number of bit transfer can be calculate by first convert 

the mutual information into bits, and then multiply it by 
the total number of pulse for each maze (in this case, 10), so 
that this measure can be compare between the two condition 
(which have different number of mazes). In the experimental 
condition, the raw mean number of bit transfer per maze 
be 5.16, which be significantly great than the mean of 0.01 
bit transfer during the control condition [paired t(4) = 5.18, 
p = 0.006; Figure 7D]. The raw number of bit transfer in 
the experimental condition be also great than chance, which 
in the mutual information framework, corresponds to zero bit 
[t(4) = 5.25, p = 0.006]. The average of 0.01 bit transfer 
during the control condition be not significantly different than 
chance [t(4) = 1.00, p = 0.38]. 

The five participant in our study varied considerably in 
term of performance during experimental conditions, rang- 
ing from the 100% accuracy of Subject 2 to 70.7% accuracy 
of Subject 3. It be important to understand the origin of these 
differences, and how they might affect the use of TMS in a 
CBI. In principle, these difference could reflect two different

average performance for the specific mazes, the red line represent best 
fitting linear relationship (intercept: 0.81; beta = 0.011), and the shade

phenomena, namely irreducible individual difference in sen- 
sitivity to visual neuromodulation or individual difference 
in the rapidity of learning. To clarify this issue, we analyze 
the data from the experimental mazes. As Subject 2 make no 
mistake during the experimental condition, this subject’s data 
be exclude from this analysis. 

A well-known psychological phenomenon be that decision 
time relate to the similarity between the available alternative 
to choose from; the more similar the alternatives, the longer the 
decision time. In this instance, decision time represent the time 
that it take to determine whether to move forward or down in 
the maze from the time the TMS machine fired. Decision time 
be measure from the moment the alternative (i.e., the screen 
button correspond to move forward or downward) be 
present to the subject, which occur exactly 2 s after the TMS 
pulse fired. The mean decision time be calculate separately 
for correct and incorrect trials. In the case of errors, participant 
take significantly longer to respond than in the case of correct 
trial [4,102 ± 582 vs. 3,362 ± 423 ms, respectively; pair 
t(3) = 5.97, p = 0.01; Figure 9]. 

If error be due to the difficulty in categorize an unusual, 
stimulation-induced visual percept, then it becomes interest 
to examine whether participant be able to familiarize them- 
self with phosphenes and learn how to recognize them over the 
course of the experiment. If the participant be indeed learn 
in this manner, then the number of error should decline over 

time. To test this hypothesis, the mean accuracy for each of the 
14 experimental maze across participant be calculated. As 
show in Figure 9, a significant positive correlation be found 
between the probability of correctly classify a phosphene and 
the position of a maze (maze index) within the experimental

strategy of persevere in the same direction (instead of decide at 
random) when the stimulation result in an ambiguous percept.

sequence [Pearson r = 0.57, t(12) = 2.42, p = 0.031]. This cor- 
relation strongly suggests that some form of learn take place 
a participant progress through the experimental mazes. This 
find be consistent with the hypothesis that, a participant 
gain more experience, they become good at interpret the 
initially unusual input from the CBI. 

While it be possible that subject could learn to improve accu- 
racy by some other means, the notion that subject exploit 
pattern within the maze be not support by our data. Because 
half of our 14 experimental maze be mirror image of the 
other half, subject could not have rely on any asymmetry in 
the distribution of forward and downward moves, a they be 
bound to be equal (each forward move in one maze be convert 
into a downward move in it mirror image). The symmetry of the 
maze also implies that there be an equal number of change 
in direction, from forward to downward and from downward to 
forward. However, because the maze be generate by vary- 
ing the number of turn from 0 to 6, an intrinsic asymmetry in 
the distribution of move be that there be more continuation 
(downward–downward and forward–forward) than change 
of direction (downward–forward and forward–downward). 
Because of the asymmetry in the distribution of turns, only 
33.3% of all the move (across all 14 experimental mazes) 
result in a change of direction. This percentage, however, be 
an imperfect representation of the true statistic experienced by 
participants. Because the software’s feedback (phosphene vs. no 
phosphene) depends on the actual position of the avatar on the 
screen, and because a mistake result in the participants’ avatar 
remain stuck in the same position, the actual percentage of 
turn participant move through represent 29.1% of the total 
moves. Thus, subject could have learn the simple strategy 
of persevere in the same direction (instead of decide at 
random) when the stimulation result in an ambiguous per- 
cept. If this be the case, however, we would expect not only a 
decline of error with practice but also an asymmetry in the error 
distribution. Specifically, the probability of an error occur 

on a turn should be high in the late maze than in the early 
ones. To test this prediction, we calculate the conditional prob- 
ability that the move where an error occur be a turn [i.e., 
P(Turn | Error); note that, because a move be either a turn or a 
continuation, P(Turn | Error) = 1 − P(Continuation | Error)] for 
each maze where at least one error occurred. We average this 
probability across participants. As see in Figure 10, no signifi- 
cant correlation exists between maze index and the probability 
that an error occur on a turn [Pearson r = 0.04, t(12) = 0.15, 
p = 0.88]. 

DiscUssiOn anD cOnclUsiOn 

Our result suggest that human subject can learn to interpret 
the information deliver via non-invasive brain stimulation to 
solve a task in a virtual world. In our experiments, a total of 72 
bit be transfer on average per subject in approximately 
60 min; to our knowledge, this be both the large CBI infor- 
mation transfer use TMS [superior to Rao et al. (2014) and 
Stocco et al. (2015)] a well a the large CBI bit-rate to date. 
The type of information deliver to the brain was, however, 
quite restricted. Only a binary signal generate base on pre- 
define criterion be transmit to a single region of the brain. 
Nevertheless, a the technology advances, we anticipate that 
more sophisticated transmission of information may become 
possible, facilitate more fluid communication between the 
computer and the brain. At present, there be some critical 
limitation that need to be overcome with regard to the spatial 
resolution of TMS (Walsh and Cowey, 2000) and the need for a 
good understand of how complex and conceptual informa- 
tion be process in the brain. 

There be also some practical limitation of our approach. 
TMS machines, at present, tend to be too large for portability. As 
this aspect of the technology improves, the paradigm present 
here could be useful, for example, in develop a non-invasive 
sensory prosthesis for the blind. Patients with certain type of 
blindness have show the ability to perceive phosphenes (Walsh 
and Cowey, 2000; Silvanto et al., 2007), suggest that the 
technology present here could eventually allow such subject 
to good navigate their environment use phosphene-based 
feedback. This would require utilize dynamic physical depth 
information instead of the static virtual depth information use 
in our study. 

Four of the five subject answer correctly for the experimen- 
tal trial at a rate great than 93%, with one subject correctly 
identify all 140 stimulations. Accuracy for this task also 
improve over time. These result suggest that human can learn 
to utilize information deliver non-invasively to their brain 
to solve task that cannot be solve use their natural senses. 
Exploring this emerge field of human sensory augmentation, 
with it technological a well a ethical and social implications, 
remains an active area of research.
