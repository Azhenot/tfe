Since it found in 1990, the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) have sought 
to develop a deeper understand of the evolve global economy. As the 
business and economics research arm of McKinsey & Company, MGI aim 
to provide leader in the commercial, public, and social sector with the fact 
and insight on which to base management and policy decisions. The Lauder 
Institute at the University of Pennsylvania have ranked MGI the world’s number- 
one private-sector think tank in it Think Tank Index. 

MGI research combine the discipline of economics and management, 
employ the analytical tool of economics with the insight of business 
leaders. Our “micro-to-macro” methodology examines microeconomic 
industry trend to good understand the broad macroeconomic force 
affect business strategy and public policy. MGI’s in-depth report have 
cover more than 20 country and 30 industries. Current research focus 
on six themes: productivity and growth, natural resources, labor markets, 
the evolution of global financial markets, the economic impact of technology 
and innovation, and urbanization. Recent report have assess the 
digital economy, the impact of AI and automation on employment, income 
inequality, the productivity puzzle, the economic benefit of tackle gender 
inequality, a new era of global competition, Chinese innovation, and digital and 
financial globalization. 

MGI be lead by three McKinsey & Company senior partners: Jacques Bughin, 
Jonathan Woetzel, and James Manyika, who also serf a the chairman 
of MGI. Michael Chui, Susan Lund, Anu Madgavkar, Sree Ramaswamy, and

JOBS LOST, JOBS GAINED: 
WORKFORCE TRANSITIONS 
IN A TIME OF AUTOMATION 



PREFACE 

Automation be not a new phenomenon, and fear about it transformation of the workplace 
and effect on employment date back centuries, even before the Industrial Revolution in 
the 18th and 19th centuries. In the 1960s, US President Lyndon Johnson empanel a 
“National Commission on Technology, Automation, and Economic Progress.” Among it 
conclusion be “the basic fact that technology destroys jobs, but not work.”* Fast forward 
and rapid recent advance in automation technologies, include artificial intelligence, 
autonomous systems, and robotics be now raise the fear anew—and with new urgency. 
In our January 2017 report on automation, A future that works: Automation, employment, 
and productivity, we analyze the automation potential of the global economy, the timeline 
over which the phenomenon could play out, and the powerful productivity boost that 
automation adoption could deliver. 

This report go a step further by examine both the potential labor market disruption 
from automation and some potential source of new labor demand that will create jobs. 
We develop scenario that seek to address some of the question most often raise in the 
public debate. Will there be enough work in the future to maintain full employment, and if so 
what will that work be? Which occupation will thrive, and which one will wither? What be 
the potential implication for skill and wage a machine perform some or the task that 
human now do? 

The report be part of the McKinsey Global Institute’s research program on the future of work, 
and be by no mean the final word on this topic. The technology continue to evolve, a will 
our collective understand of the economic implications. Indeed, we highlight some of the 
limitation of our analysis and scenarios, and area for further research. The report build on 
our previous research on labor markets, incomes, skills, and the expand range of model 
of work, include the gig economy, a well a the potential impact on the global economy 
of digitization, automation, robotics, and artificial intelligence.

IN BRIEF 

JOBS LOST, JOBS GAINED: WORKFORCE 
TRANSITIONS IN A TIME OF AUTOMATION 
In our late research on automation, we examine work 
that can be automate through 2030 and job that may 
be create in the same period. We draw from lesson 
from history and develop various scenario for the future. 
While it be hard to predict how all this will play out, our 
research provide some insight into the likely workforce 
transition that should be expect and their implications. 
Our key findings: 

 Automation technology include artificial intelligence 
and robotics will generate significant benefit for 
users, businesses, and economies, lift productivity 
and economic growth. The extent to which these 
technology displace worker will depend on the 
pace of their development and adoption, economic 
growth, and growth in demand for work. Even a it 
cause decline in some occupations, automation 
will change many more—60 percent of occupation 
have at least 30 percent of constituent work 
activity that could be automated. It will also create 
new occupation that do not exist today, much a 
technology of the past have done. 

 While about half of all work activity globally have 
the technical potential to be automate by adapt 
currently demonstrate technologies, the proportion 
of work actually displace by 2030 will likely be 
lower, because of technical, economic, and social 
factor that affect adoption. Our scenario across 46 
country suggest that between almost zero and one- 
third of work activity could be displace by 2030, 
with a midpoint of 15 percent. The proportion varies 
widely across countries, with advanced economy 
more affected by automation than develop ones, 
reflect high wage rate and thus economic 
incentive to automate. 

 Even with automation, the demand for work and 
worker could increase a economy grow, 
partly fuel by productivity growth enable 
by technological progress. Rising income and 
consumption especially in develop countries, 
increase health care for age societies, investment 
in infrastructure and energy, and other trend will 
create demand for work that could help offset the 
displacement of workers. Additional investment such 
a in infrastructure and construction, beneficial in their 
own right, could be need to reduce the risk of job 
shortage in some advanced economies. 

 Even if there be enough work to ensure full employment 
by 2030, major transition lie ahead that could match 
or even exceed the scale of historical shift out of 
agriculture and manufacturing. Our scenario suggest 
that by 2030, 75 million to 375 million worker (3 to 
14 percent of the global workforce) will need to switch 
occupational categories. Moreover, all worker will 
need to adapt, a their occupation evolve alongside 
increasingly capable machines. Some of that 
adaptation will require high educational attainment, 
or spending more time on activity that require social 
and emotional skills, creativity, high-level cognitive 
capability and other skill relatively hard to automate. 

 Income polarization could continue in the United 
States and other advanced economies, where 
demand for high-wage occupation may grow the 
most while middle-wage occupation decline— 
assume current wage structure persist. Increased 
investment and productivity growth from automation 
could spur enough growth to ensure full employment, 
but only if most displace worker find new work 
within one year. If reemployment be slow, frictional 
unemployment will likely rise in the short-term and 
wage could face downward pressure. These wage 
trend be not universal: in China and other emerge 
economies, middle-wage occupation such a 
service and construction job will likely see the most 
net job growth, boost the emerge middle class. 

 To achieve good outcomes, policy maker and 
business leader will need to embrace automation’s 
benefit and, at the same time, address the worker 
transition brought about by these technologies. 
Ensuring robust demand growth and economic 
dynamism be a priority: history show that economy 
that be not expand do not generate job growth. 
Midcareer job training will be essential, a will 
enhance labor market dynamism and enable 
worker redeployment. These change will challenge 
current educational and workforce training models, a 
well a business approach to skill-building. Another 
priority be rethink and strengthen transition and 
income support for worker caught in the cross- 
current of automation.

SUMMARY OF FINDINGS 

The technology-driven world in which we live be a world fill with promise but also 
challenges. Cars that drive themselves, machine that read X-rays, and algorithm that 
respond to customer service inquiry be all manifestation of powerful new form of 
automation. Yet even a these technology increase productivity and improve our lives, 
their use will substitute for some work activity human currently perform—a development 
that have spark much public concern. 

This research build on MGI’s January 2017 report on automation and it impact on work 
activities.1 We ass the number and type of job that might be create under different 
scenario through 2030, and compare that to work that could be displace by automation.2 
The result reveal a rich mosaic of potential shift in occupation in the year ahead, with 
important implication for workforce skill and wages. The analysis cover 46 country that 
comprise almost 90 percent of global GDP. We focus on six country that span income 
level (China, Germany, India, Japan, Mexico, and the United States). For each, we model 
the potential net employment change for more than 800 occupations, base on different 
scenario for the pace of automation adoption and for future labor demand. The intent of this 
research be not to forecast. Rather, we present a set of scenario (necessarily incomplete) 
to serve a a guide, a we anticipate and prepare for the future of work. This research be by 
no mean the final word on this topic; ongoing research be required. Indeed, in Box E2 at the 
end of this summary, we highlight some of the potential limitation of the research present 
in this report. 

Our finding suggest that several trend that may serve a catalyst of future labor demand 
could create demand for million of job by 2030. These trend include care for others in 
age societies, raise energy efficiency and meeting climate challenges, produce good 
and service for the expand consume class, especially in develop countries, not to 
mention the investment in technology, infrastructure, and building need in all countries. 
Taken from another angle, we also find that a grow and dynamic economy—in part fuel 
by technology itself and it contribution to productivity—would create jobs. These job 
would result from growth in current occupation due to demand and the creation of new 
type of occupation that may not have exist before, a have happen historically. This 
job growth (jobs gained) could more than offset the job lose to automation. None of this 
will happen by itself—it will require business and government to seize opportunity to 
boost job creation and for labor market to function well. The workforce transition ahead 
will be enormous. We estimate that a many a 375 million worker globally (14 percent of 
the global workforce) will likely need to transition to new occupational category and learn 
new skills, in the event of rapid automation adoption. If their transition to new job be slow, 
unemployment could rise and dampen wage growth. 

Indeed, while this report be title Jobs lost, job gained, it could have been, Jobs lost, job 
changed, job gained; in many way a big part of this story be about how more occupation 
will change than will be lose a machine affect portion of occupation and people 
increasingly work alongside them. Societal choice will determine whether all three of these

displace by automation and to new work create by future labor demand. In reality, the number of people 
work be large than the number of FTEs, a some people work part-time. Our analysis of FTEs cover both 
employee within firm a well a independent contractor and freelancers.

come workforce transition be smooth, or whether unemployment and income inequality 
rise. History show numerous example of country that have successfully ridden the wave 
of technological change by invest in their workforce and adapt policies, institutions, 
and business model to the new era. It be our hope that this report prompt leader in that 
direction once again. 

AUTOMATION COULD DISPLACE A SIGNIFICANT SHARE OF WORK GLOBALLY 
TO 2030; 15 PERCENT IS THE MIDPOINT OF OUR SCENARIO RANGE 
In our prior report on automation, we found that about half the activity people be paid to 
do globally could theoretically be automate use currently demonstrate technologies.3 
Very few occupations—less than 5 percent—consist entirely of activity that can be 
fully automated. However, in about 60 percent of occupations, at least one-third of the 
constituent activity could be automated, imply substantial workplace transformation 
and change for all workers. All this be base on our assessment of current technological 
capability—an ever evolve frontier (Exhibit E1). 

While technical feasibility of automation be important, it be not the only factor that will influence 
the pace and extent of automation adoption. Other factor include the cost of develop 
and deploy automation solution for specific us in the workplace, the labor market 
dynamic (including quality and quantity of labor and associate wages), the benefit 
of automation beyond labor substitution, and regulatory and social acceptance. Taking 
into account these factors, our new research estimate that between almost zero and 
30 percent of the hour work globally could be automate by 2030, depend on the 
speed of adoption. In this report we mainly use the midpoint of our scenario range, which be 
15 percent of current activity automated. Results differ significantly by country, reflect 
the mix of activity currently perform by worker and prevail wage rates. They range 

3 Our definition of automation include robotics (machines that perform physical activities) and artificial 
intelligence (software algorithm that perform calculation and cognitive activities). Companies may adopt 
these technology for reason other than labor cost savings, such a improve quality, efficiency, or scale, 
although worker displacement could still be a consequence. A glossary of automation technology and 
technique be in the technical appendix.

Economics, volume 122, issue 3, August 2007. 

Technology adoption can and often do cause 
significant short-term labor displacement, but history 
show that, in the longer run, it creates a multitude of new 
job and unleashes demand for exist ones, more than 
offset the number of job it destroys even a it raise 
labor productivity (Exhibit E3).1 An examination of the 
historical record highlight several lessons: 

 All advanced economy have experienced 
profound sectoral shift in employment, first out of 
agriculture and more recently manufacturing, even 
a overall employment grew. In the United States, the 
agricultural share of total employment decline from 
60 percent in 1850 to less than 5 percent by 1970, 
while manufacturing fell from 26 percent of total US 
employment in 1960 to below 10 percent today. Other 
country have experienced even faster declines: one- 
third of China’s workforce move out of agriculture 
between 1990 and 2015. 

 Such shift can have painful consequence for some 
workers. During the Industrial Revolution in England, 
average real wage stagnate for decades, even a 
productivity rose.2 Eventually, wage growth caught up 
to and then surpass productivity growth. But the 
transition period be difficult for individual workers, 
and ease only after substantial policy reforms. 

 New technology have spur the creation of many 
more job than they destroyed, and some of the new 
job be in occupation that cannot be envision 
at the outset; one study found that 0.56 percent of 
new job in the United States each year be in new 
occupations.3 Most job create by technology 
be outside the technology-producing sector itself. 
We estimate that the introduction of the personal 
computer, for instance, have enable the creation of 
15.8 million net new job in the United States since 
1980, even after accounting for job displaced. About 
90 percent of these be in occupation that use the PC 
in other industries, such a call center representatives, 
financial analysts, and inventory managers. 

 Robust aggregate demand and economic growth 
be essential for job creation. New technology have 
raise productivity growth, enable firm to low 
price for consumers, pay high wages, or distribute 
profit to shareholders. This stimulates demand 
across the economy, boost job creation.4 

 Rising productivity be usually accompany by 
employment growth, because it raise income 
which be then spent, create demand for good and 
service across the economy. When there have be 
a tradeoff between employment growth and labor 
productivity growth, it have be short-lived. In the 
United States, for example, our analysis show that 
employment and productivity both grow in 95 percent 
of roll three-year period and 100 percent of roll 
10-year period since 1960. 

 Over the long term, productivity growth enable by 
technology have reduce the average hour work 
per week and allow people to enjoy more leisure 
time.5 Across advanced economies, the length 
of the average work-week have fall by nearly 
50 percent since the early 1900s, reflect shorter 
work hours, more paid day off for personal 
time and vacations, and the recent rise of part-time 
work. The growth in leisure have create demand 
for new industries, from golf to video game to 
home improvement. 

Although the historical record be largely reassuring, 
some people worry that automation today will be 
more disruptive than in the past. Technology expert 
and economist be debate whether “this time, 
thing be different” (and we examine that debate 
start on page 48 of this report). Our current 
view be that the answer depends on the time horizon 
consider (decades or centuries) and on the pace of 
future technological progress and adoption. On many 
dimensions, we find similarity between the scope and 
effect of automation today compare to early wave of 
technology disruption, go back to the Industrial

Box E1. The historical evidence on technology and employment be reassure (continued) 
Revolution. However, automation go forward might 
prove to be more disruptive than in recent decades— 
and on par with the most rapid change in the past—in 
two ways. First, if technological advance continue 

apace and be adopt rapidly, the rate of worker 
displacement could be faster. Secondly, if many sector 
adopt automation simultaneously, the percentage of the 
workforce affected by it could be higher. 



Summary of finding McKinsey Global Institute6 

The potential impact of automation on employment varies by occupation and sector. 
Activities most susceptible to automation include physical one in predictable environments, 
such a operating machinery and prepare fast food. Collecting and processing data 
be two other category of activity that can increasingly be do good and faster with 
machines. This could displace large amount of labor, for instance in mortgage origination, 
paralegal work, accounting, and back-office transaction processing. It be important to note, 
however, that even when some task be automated, employment in those occupation 
may not decline, but rather worker may perform new tasks. In addition, employment in 
occupation may also grow, if the overall demand for that occupation grows enough to 
overwhelm the rate of automation. 

Automation will have a lesser effect on job that involve manage people, apply 
expertise, and those involve social interactions, where machine be unable to match 
human performance for now. Jobs in unpredictable environments—occupations such a 
gardeners, plumbers, or provider of child- and elder-care—will also generally see less 
automation by 2030, because they be difficult to automate technically and often command 
relatively low wages, which make automation a less attractive business proposition. 

RISING INCOMES, INVESTMENTS IN INFRASTRUCTURE AND ENERGY, AND 
OTHER CATALYSTS COULD POTENTIALLY CREATE MILLIONS OF NEW JOBS 
While automation’s displacement of labor have be visible for many years, it be more difficult 
to envision all the new job that will be created. Many of these new job be create indirectly 
and spread across different sector and geographies. 

In this report, we model some potential source of new labor demand that may spur job 
creation to 2030, even net of automation. We consider two scenarios, a “trendline” scenario 
base on current spending and investment trend observe across countries, and a “step- 
up” scenario that assumes additional investment in some areas. We calculate job (full-time 
equivalents) that could be create both directly and indirectly for more than 800 exist 
occupations. We do not consider the dynamic interaction between trend or across the 
economy (Exhibit E4). The result be not precise forecast of future job growth, but rather 
be suggestive of where job of the future may be. 

For three trends, we model only a trendline scenario. They are: 

 Rising income and consumption, especially in emerge economies. Previous 
MGI research have estimate that 1 billion more people will enter the consume class by 
2025.4 Using external macroeconomic forecasts, we estimate that global consumption 
could grow by $23 trillion between 2015 and 2030, and most of this will come from the 
expand consume class in emerge economies. As income rise, consumer 
spend more on all categories. But their spending pattern also shift, create more job 
in area such a consumer durables, leisure activities, financial and telecommunication 
services, housing, health care, and education. The effect of these new consumer will 
be felt not just in the country where the income be generated, but also in economy that 
export to those countries.5 Globally, we estimate that 300 million to 365 million new job 
could be create from the impact of rise incomes. 

 Aging populations. By 2030, there will be at least 300 million more people age 
65 year and above than there be in 2014. As people age, their spending pattern 

4 We define consume class or consumer a individual with an annual income of more than $3,600, or $10 
per day, at purchasing power parity, use constant 2005 PPP dollars. Urban world: Cities and the rise of the 
consume class, McKinsey Global Institute, June 2012. 

5 We assume that current pattern of global trade continue, at the same level relative to GDP a today. As a 
result, advanced economy also benefit from rise income in develop countries. The United States, 
for example, could gain up to 3 percent of net new job from rise income by 2030 from net exports. In 
Germany’s case, that figure could be more than 40 percent.

shift, with a pronounce increase in spending on health care and other personal 
services. This will create significant demand for a range of occupations, include 
doctors, nurses, and health technicians, but also home health aides, personal care aide 
and nursing assistant in many countries, even a it reduces demand for pediatrician 
and primary-school teachers. Globally, we estimate heath care and related job from 
age and rise income could grow by 80 million to 130 million by 2030.6 

 Development and deployment of technology. Jobs related to develop and 
deploy new technology may also grow. These job include computer scientists, 
engineers, and IT administrators. Overall spending on technology could increase by 
more than 50 percent between 2015 and 2030. About half would be on information 
technology services, both in-house IT worker within company and external or 
outsource tech consult jobs. The number of people employ in these occupation 
be small compare to those in health care or construction, but they be high-wage 
occupations. By 2030, we estimate this trend could create 20 to 50 million job globally.

Summary of finding McKinsey Global Institute8 

For three other trends, we model both a trendline scenario and a step-up scenario; the latter 
be base on explicit choice that could be make by governments, business leaders, and 
individual to create additional jobs. 

 Investment in infrastructure and buildings. Infrastructure and building be two 
area of historic underspend that may create significant additional labor demand 
if action be take to bridge infrastructure gap and overcome housing shortages. MGI 
have estimate that the world need to invest about 3.8 percent of GDP annually, or an 
average of $3.3 trillion per year to fill infrastructure gaps, compare with $2.5 trillion 
currently.7 This include both develop country that be urbanize and industrializing, 
and advanced economy that have underinvested in maintain their infrastructure 
and buildings. Rising income also create demand for more and high quality buildings. 
Both factor could create new demand, mainly in the construction sector, for up to 
80 million job in the trendline scenario and, in some cases, potentially up to 200 million 
globally in the step-up scenario.8 These job include architects, engineers, carpenter 
and other skilled tradespeople, a well a construction workers, machinery operator 
and other job with low skill requirements. 

 Investments in renewable energy, energy efficiency, and climate adaptation. 
Investments in renewable energy, such a wind and solar, energy efficiency 
technologies, and adaptation and mitigation of climate change may create new demand 
for worker in a range of occupations, include in manufacturing, construction, and 
installation. In our trendline scenario, we model future job growth base on already- 
announce policy intention for energy efficiency and the require investment to meet 
these goals.9 For a step-up scenario, we use more ambitious target that country 
will need to get closer to meeting commitment to the Paris climate accord.10 These 
investment could create up to ten million new job in the trendline scenario, and up to 
ten million additional job globally in the step-up scenario. 

 “Marketization” of previously unpaid domestic work. The last trend we consider 
be the potential to pay for service that substitute for currently unpaid and primarily 
domestic work—including cooking, childcare, and cleaning. This so-called marketization 
of previously unpaid work be already prevalent in advanced economies, and rise female 
labor force participation worldwide could accelerate the trend. About 75 percent of the 
world’s total unpaid care be undertaken by woman and amount to a much a $10 trillion 
of output per year, roughly equivalent to 13 percent of global GDP.11 Individual decision 
within the household to use paid service or government investment to provide universal 
childcare and pre-school could fuel this development. We consider this in the step-up 
scenario only, a it magnitude and timing be unclear. But we estimate that this shift could 
marketize 50 million to 90 million unpaid job globally, mainly in occupation such a 
childcare, early childhood education, cleaning, cooking, and gardening.

8 In the step-up scenario, we assume high level of run-rate infrastructure investment after country have 

close their respective infrastructure gap. We also assume that, at minimum, country reach level of 
commercial and residential real estate investment comparable to those in the United States.

UP TO 375 MILLION PEOPLE MAY NEED TO SWITCH OCCUPATIONAL 
CATEGORIES, WITH THE HIGHEST SHARE IN ADVANCED ECONOMIES 
When we look at the net change in job growth and decline from the trend described 
above compare with the work that can be automated, a mosaic of shift in occupation 
and job category emerges (Exhibit E5). 

Across all countries, the category with the high percentage job growth net of 
automation include health-care providers; professional such a engineers, scientists, 
accountants, and analysts; IT professional and other technology specialists; manager and 
executives, whose work cannot easily be replace by machines; educators, especially in 
emerge economy with young populations; and “creatives,” a small but grow category 
of artists, performers, and entertainer who will be in demand a rise income create 
more demand for leisure and recreation. Builders and related profession will also grow, 
particularly in the step-up scenario that involves high investment in infrastructure and 
buildings. Manual and service job in unpredictable environment will also grow, such a 
home health aide and gardeners. 

Advanced economy may also see employment decline in occupation that be most 
susceptible to automation. These include office support occupations, such a record 
clerks, office assistants, and finance and accounting; some customer interaction jobs, 
such a hotel and travel workers, cashiers, and food service workers; and a wide range of 
job carry out in predictable settings, such a assembly line workers, dishwashers, food 
preparation workers, drivers, and agricultural and other equipment operators. Helping 
individual transition from the decline occupation to grow one will be a large- 
scale challenge. 

The come workforce transition among occupation could be very large 
The change in net occupational growth or decline imply that a very large number of people 
may need to shift occupational category and learn new skill in the year ahead. The shift 
could be on a scale not see since the transition of the labor force out of agriculture in the 
early 1900s in the United States and Europe, and more recently in China. But unlike those 
early transitions, in which young people left farm and move to city for industrial jobs, 
the challenge, especially in advanced economies, will be to retrain midcareer workers. 
There be few precedent in which society have successfully retrain such large number 
of people. Frictions in the labor markets—including cultural norm regard gender 
stereotype in work and geographic mismatch between worker and jobs—could also 
impede the transition.12

11Jobs lost, job gained: Workforce transition in a time of automationMcKinsey Global Institute 

We estimate that between 400 million and 800 million individual could be displace by 
automation and need to find new job by 2030 around the world, base on our midpoint 
and early (that is, the most rapid) automation adoption scenarios. We think demand for 
job will be there, base on our scenario of future labor demand and the net impact of 
automation, a described in the next section. However people will need to find their way into 
these jobs. Of the total displaced, 75 million to 375 million may need to switch occupational 
category and learn new skills, under our midpoint and early automation adoption 
scenario (Exhibit E6).13 Under the late adoption scenario (that is, the slowest), this number 
would be far lower, below 10 million. Given the minimal impact on the workforce of this 
edge-case scenario, we have not highlight it in the exhibit in this report. In absolute 
terms, China face the large number of worker need to switch occupations—up to 
100 million if automation be adopt rapidly, or 12 percent of the 2030 workforce—although 
this figure be relatively small compare with the huge shift in China out of agriculture in the 
past 25 years. For advanced economies, the share of the workforce that may need to learn 
new skill and find work in new occupation be much higher: up to one-third of the 2030 
workforce in the United States and Germany, and nearly half in Japan.

Summary of finding McKinsey Global Institute12 

WILL THERE BE ENOUGH WORK IN THE FUTURE? 
Today there be grow concern about whether there will be enough job for worker give 
potential automation. History would suggest that such fear may be unfounded: over time, 
labor market adjust to change in demand for worker from technological disruptions, 
although at time with depressed real wages. We address this question about the future 
of work through two different set of analyses: one base on model of a limited number 
of catalyst of new labor demand and automation described above, and one use a 
macroeconomic model of the economy that incorporates the dynamic interaction 
among variables. We also note that if history be any guide, we could expect 8 to 9 percent 
of 2030 labor demand will be in new type of occupation that have not exist before.14 
Both analysis lead u to conclude that, with sufficient economic growth, innovation, and 
investment, there can be enough new job creation to offset the impact of automation, 
although in some advanced economy additional investment will be need a per our 
step-up scenario to reduce the risk of job shortages. But a large challenge will be ensure 
that worker have the skill and support need to transition to new jobs. Countries that fail 
to manage this transition could see rise unemployment and depressed wages. 

Future job lose and job gain vary by country, with the large disruption 
expect in advanced economy 
The magnitude of future job creation from the trend described above and the impact of 
automation on the workforce vary significantly by country, depend on four factors: 

 Wage levels. Higher wage make the business case for automation adoption stronger. 
However, low-wage country may be affected a well, if company adopt automation 
to boost quality, achieve tighter production control, move production closer to end 
consumer in high-wage countries, or other benefit beyond reduce labor costs. Some 
economist worry about “premature deindustrialization” in develop country due 
to automation.15 

 Demand growth. Economic growth be essential for job creation; economy that be 
stagnant or grow slowly create few if any net new jobs. Countries with strong 
economic and productivity growth and innovation will therefore be expect to 
experience more new labor demand, although the amount and nature of job creation will 
vary depend on the sector that drive growth. 

 Demographics. Demographics affect both labor demand and labor supply. Countries 
with a rapidly-growing workforce, such a India, may enjoy a “demographic dividend” 
that boost GDP growth—if young people be employed. Countries with a shrink 
workforce, such a Japan, can expect low future GDP growth, derive only from 
productivity growth. However, country with a decline workforce need automation to 
offset their shrink labor supply, while country with grow workforce have great 
job creation challenges. 

 Mix of economic sector and occupations. The automation potential for country 
reflect the mix of economic sector and the mix of job within each sector. Japan, for 
example, have a high technical automation potential than the United States because 
the weight of sector that be highly automatable, such a manufacturing, be higher. And 
within Japanese manufacturing, a large proportion of job involve activity that can be 
more easily automated, such a production, than in the United States.

number 1, 2016. 



13Jobs lost, job gained: Workforce transition in a time of automationMcKinsey Global Institute 

These factor combine to create different outlook for the future of work in each country 
(Exhibit E7). For instance, Japan be rich but it economy be project to grow slowly to 2030. 
It face the combination of slow job creation come from economic expansion and a 
large share of work that can be automate a a result of high wage and the structure of it 
economy. However, Japan will also see it workforce shrink by 2030 by four million people. 
In the step-up scenario, and consider the job in new occupation we cannot envision 
today, Japan’s net change in job could be roughly in balance. 

Like Japan, the United States and Germany could also face significant workforce 
displacement from automation by 2030, but their project future growth—and hence 
new job creation—is higher. The United States have a grow workforce and, in the step- 
up scenario, with innovation lead to new type of occupation and work, Germany’s 
workforce will decline by three million by 2030, and it will have more than enough labor 
demand to employ all workers. 

At the other extreme be India: a fast-growing develop country with relatively modest 
potential for automation over the next 15 years, reflect low wage rates. Our analysis find 
that most occupational category be project to grow in India, reflect it potential for 
strong economic expansion. However, India’s labor force be expect to grow by 138 million 
people by 2030, or about 30 percent. Employing these new entrant in formal sector job 
will require job creation on a much large scale than in the past. Automation will make this 
challenge more difficult; some fear “jobless growth.”16 However, our analysis suggests 
that India can create enough new job to offset automation and employ new entrants, if it 
undertakes the investment in our step-up scenario. 

China and Mexico have high wage than India, and so be likely to see more automation. 
China be still project to have robust economic growth and will have a shrink workforce; 
like Germany, China’s problem could be a shortage of workers. Mexico’s project rate of 
future economic expansion be more modest, and it workforce will grow by 15 million by 
2030. Like the United States and Japan, our result suggest that Mexico could benefit from 
the job creation in the step-up scenario plus innovation in new occupation and activity to 
make full use of it workforce.

If displace worker be not reemployed quickly, country will face rise 
unemployment and depressed wage 
To model the impact of automation on overall employment and wages, we use a general 
equilibrium model of the economy of our six focus country that take into account the 
economic impact of automation and dynamic interactions.17 The model be not intend to 
forecast the future, but rather be a tool to explore the implication of different scenarios. 

Automation have at least three distinct economic impacts. Most attention have be devote 
to the potential displacement of labor. But automation also may raise labor productivity: 
firm only adopt automation when do so enables them to produce more or higher-quality 
output with the same or few input (including material, energy, and labor inputs). The third 
impact be that automation adoption raise investment in the economy, lift short-term GDP 
growth. We model all three effects.18 We also create different scenario for how quickly 
displace worker find new employment, base on historical data. 

The result reveal that across different rate of re-employment, our six country could 
expect to be at or very near full employment by 2030. Consistent with the historical 
experience, labor market adjust to technological shocks. However, the model also 
illustrates the importance of reemploying displace worker quickly. If displace worker 
be able to be reemployed within one year, our model show automation lift the overall 
economy: full employment be maintain in both the short and long-term, wage grow 
faster than in the baseline model, and productivity be higher. However, in scenario in which 
some displace worker take year to find new work, unemployment rise in the short- to 
medium-term. The labor market adjusts over time and unemployment falls—but with slow 
average wage growth. In these scenarios, average wage end up low in 2030 than in 
the baseline model, which could dampen aggregate demand and long-term growth. The 
pace of reemployment will be influence by the effectiveness of retraining, the capacity of 
company to innovate and, in some sectors, the elasticity of demand. 

WORKERS WILL REQUIRE DIFFERENT SKILLS, AND WAGE POLARIZATION IN 
ADVANCED COUNTRIES COULD CONTINUE 
In all six of our focus countries, we find that in general, the current educational requirement 
of the occupation that may grow be high than those for the job displace by 
automation. In advanced economies, occupation that currently require only a secondary 
education or less see a net decline from automation, while those occupation require 
college degree and high grow. In India and other emerge economies, we find high 
labor demand for all education levels, with the large number of new job in occupation 
require a secondary education but the fast rate of job growth will be for occupation 
currently require a college or advanced degree (Exhibit E8). For all countries, increase 
investment in education and workforce training will be a priority. 

Moreover, we find that worker of the future will spend more time on activity that machine 
be less capable of, such a manage people, apply expertise, and communicate 
with others. They will spend less time on predictable physical activities, and on collect 
and processing data, where machine already exceed human performance. The skill and 
capability require will also shift, require more social and emotional skills, and more 
advanced cognitive capabilities, such a logical reason and creativity. 

17 We use McKinsey & Company’s Global Growth Model, a supply-side general equilibrium macroeconomic 
model that cover more than 100 country with data from 1960 through 2015. 

18 We obtain data for labor displacement and require firm investment from MGI’s automation model, at the 
midpoint adoption scenario. We make a conservative assumption on the productivity impact of automation, 
that firm produce the same value of output a prior to automation but with few workers. See technical 
appendix for more detail.

Wage polarization could be exacerbate in advanced economy but develop 
country will see a grow middle class 
Wages may stagnate or fall in decline occupations. Although we do not model shift in 
relative wage across occupations, the basic economics of labor supply and demand 
suggests that this should be the case for occupation in which labor demand declines. 
Since 1980, most advanced economy have see an overall decline share of national 
income be capture by labor (compared with capital). Recent academic work suggests 
that technological change be one reason for this decline.19 

Our analysis, look at change in employment by occupation at today’s relative wage 
levels, show that most job growth in the United States and other advanced economy 
will be in occupation currently at the high end of the wage distribution. Some occupation 
that be currently low-wage, such a nursing assistant and teach assistants, will 
also increase, while a wide range of middle-income occupation will have the large 
employment declines. These result suggest that income polarization could continue. 
Policy choice we identify in our step-up scenario, such a increase investment in 
infrastructure, buildings, and energy transition could help create additional demand for 
middle-wage job such a construction worker in advanced economies. 

The wage trend picture be quite different in emerge economy such a China and India, 
where our scenario show that middle-wage job such a retail salesperson and teacher 
will grow quickly a these economy develop. This implies that their consume class will 
continue to grow in the decade ahead. However, our analysis come with several important 
caveat (see Box E2, “What could overstate or understate the impact scenario assess in 
this research—and what we have not considered”). 

BUSINESSES AND POLICYMAKERS WILL NEED TO ACT TO KEEP PEOPLE 
WORKING AS AUTOMATION IS ADOPTED 
The benefit of AI and automation to user and businesses, and the economic growth that 
could come via their productivity contributions, be compelling. They will not only contribute 
to dynamic economy that create jobs, but also help create the economic surplus that 
will enable society to address the workforce transition that will likely happen regardless. 
Faced with the scale of worker transition we have described, one reaction could be to try 
to slow the pace and scope of adoption in an attempt to preserve the status quo. While this 
may limit the workforce transitions, it would affect the contribution that these technology 
make to business dynamism and economic growth, via the contribution to productivity 
growth, and which in turn lead to job growth and prosperity. We should embrace these 
technology but also address the workforce transition and challenge they bring. In many 
countries, this may require an initiative on the scale of the Marshall Plan involve sustain 
investment, new training models, program to ease worker transitions, income support, and 
collaboration between the public and private sectors. 

Achieving the benefit of deploy automation, such a productivity growth, while 
address it challenges, be not impossible. During the transition out of agriculture, for 
example, the United States make a major investment in expand secondary education, 
and for the first time require all student to attend. Called the High School Movement, 
this raise the rate of high school enrolment of 14- to 17-year-olds from 18 percent in 1910

productive in the world, and enable the growth of a vibrant manufacturing sector.20 

Policy makers, business leaders, and individual worker all have constructive and important 
role to play in smooth workforce transition ahead. History show that society across 
the globe, when face with monumental challenges, often rise to the occasion for the well- 
be of their citizens. Yet over the last few decades, investment and policy to support 
the workforce have eroded. Public spending on labor force training and support have fall in 
most OECD countries, and corporate spending on training have decline in the United States 
(Exhibit E9). Educational model have not fundamentally change in 100 years; we still 
use system design for an industrial society to prepare student for a rapidly-changing 
knowledge economy. It be now critical to reverse these trends, with government make 
workforce transition and job creation a more urgent priority.

Today, while policy choice will vary by country, all society will need to address four key 
area to smooth the loom workforce transitions: 

 Maintaining robust economic growth to support job creation. Sustaining robust 
aggregate demand growth be critical to support new job creation, a be support for 
new business formation. Fiscal and monetary policy that ensure sufficient aggregate 
demand, a well a support for business investment and innovation, will be essential. 
Targeted initiative in certain sector could also help, include by increase investment 
in infrastructure and energy transitions, a well a policy to enable a shift of unpaid 
household work such a childcare to the market, a discuss in our step-up scenario. 

 Scaling and reimagining job retrain and workforce skill development. Providing 
job retrain and enable individual to learn marketable new skill throughout their 
lifetime will be a critical challenge—and for some countries, the central challenge. 
Midcareer retrain will become ever more important a the skill mix need for a 
successful career changes. A range of initiative in country from Sweden to Singapore 
may point the way to new approach to improve skill or teach new ones, include 
to old workers. Governments can play an important role here, a the US government 
do in previous era with the GI Bill, which enable just under eight million veteran 
return from war to go to college or be retrained.21 Programs that can more quickly 
retool the labor force by focus on re-training and credentialing at the level of skill 
in demand rather than multi-year degree could be important. Business can take a 
lead in some areas, include with on-the-job training and provide opportunity to 
worker to upgrade their skills, both through in-house training and partnership with 
education providers. 

 Improving business and labor market dynamism include mobility. Greater fluidity 
will be need in the labor market to manage the difficult transition we anticipate. This 
include restore now-waning geographic mobility in advanced economy include 
the United States. Digital talent platform and the rise of the “gig” economy can foster 
fluidity, by match worker and company seek their skills, and by provide a 
plethora of new work opportunity for those open to take them.22 Policy maker 
in country with relatively inflexible labor market can learn from others that have 
deregulated, such a Germany, which transform it federal unemployment agency into 
a powerful job-matching entity. Governments may also update labor market regulation 
to ensure that gig economy job be not subject to discrimination, and that remain 
uncertainty about worker benefit be resolved. 

 Providing income and transition support to workers. Income support and other 
form of transition assistance to help displace worker find gainful employment will 
be essential. Beyond retraining, a range of policy can help, include unemployment 
insurance, public assistance in find work, and portable benefit that follow worker 
between jobs. We know from history and from our analysis that wage for many 
occupation can be depressed for some time during workforce transitions. More 
permanent policy to supplement work income might be need to support aggregate 
demand and ensure societal fairness. Possible solution to supplement incomes, such 
a more comprehensive minimum wage policies, universal basic income, or wage gain 
tie to productivity, be all be explored.

Summary of finding McKinsey Global Institute20 

Business leader have much to gain by early adoption of automation technologies, 
enable performance benefit such a quality and speed, a well a great efficiency 
and productive use of all factor of production. Businesses will be on the front line of the 
workplace a it changes. That will require them to both retool their business process 
and re-evaluate their talent strategy and workforce needs, carefully consider which 
individual be needed, which can be redeployed to other jobs, and where new talent may 
be needed. Many company be find it be in their self-interest—as well a important for 
societal responsibility—to train and prepare worker for a new world of work. 

Individuals, too, will need to be prepared for a rapidly evolve future of work. Acquiring new 
skill that be in demand and reset intuition about the world of work will be critical for 
their own well-being. There will be demand for human labor, but worker everywhere will 
need to rethink traditional notion of where they work, how they work, and what talent and 
capability they bring to that work. Ultimately, we will all need creative vision for how our 
life be organize and value in the future, in a world where the role and meaning of work 
start to shift. 

••• 

Automation represent both hope and challenge. The global economy need the boost to 
productivity and growth that it will bring, especially at a time when age population be 
act a a drag on GDP growth. Machines can take on work that be routine, dangerous, or 
dirty, and may allow u all to use our intrinsically human talent more fully. But to capture 
these benefits, society will need to prepare for complex workforce transition ahead. For 
policy makers, business leaders, and individual worker the world over, the task at hand 
be to prepare for a more automate future by emphasize new skills, scale up training, 
especially for midcareer workers, and ensure robust economic growth.

Box E2. What could overstate or understate the impact scenario assess in this research— 
and what we have not consider

McKinsey Global institute, December 2015, and Digital Europe: Pushing the frontier, capture the benefits, McKinsey Global Institute, June 
2016. 

2 James Bessen, Learning by doing: The real connection between innovation, wages, and wealth, Yale University Press, 2015. 
3 For a discussion of skill bias, see David H. Autor, Frank Levy, and Richard J. Murnane, “The skill content of recent technological change: An 

empirical exploration,” The Quarterly Journal of Economics, volume 18, number 4, November 2003. 

We analyze scenario for the net impact of automation 
and future labor demand on employment, skills, and 
wages. Most of them suggest that, while there will be 
enough work to maintain full employment in the long 
term, ensure that displace worker have the skill and 
support need to obtain the new job will be critical. 
If worker be not re-employed quickly, the impact on 
wage growth could be negative. This conclusion could 
overstate or understate the impact. 

On the one hand, the future disruption could be small 
than we anticipate for several reasons: 

 Adopting automation require significant investment 
and redesign of business processes, and company 
have be slow to adopt digital technologies, let alone 
recent form of AI and automation.1 In our slowest 
automation adoption scenario, less than 5 percent of 
work be automate by 2030, so the overall impact on 
the economy could be minimal. 

 In our analysis, we make the strong assumption that 
every hour of work that be automate result in one 
hour less of work for a full-time equivalent employee. 
But company often choose to redefine occupations, 
or redeploy some worker instead. For instance, after 
the introduction of the ATM, the number of bank teller 
in the United States continued to grow for many years, 
even a the activity they perform changed.2 

 Our model of the seven catalyst of labor demand 
do not take into account dynamic effect within the 
economy, and they represent only a partial list of future 
source of labor demand. If automation adoption be 
rapid, future productivity growth could be high than 
we model, and this could raise income and result in 
more job creation than we anticipate. This could offset 
the labor displacement, even during the transition. 

On the other hand, the impact of automation on 
work could be more disruptive than we anticipate for 
several reasons: 

 The development of automation technologies, 
include AI, could accelerate or break through new 
frontiers. AI researcher today say that machine 
learn have unlocked more rapid improvement in 
the technology than could have be imagine even a 
few year ago. Improvements in machine capability 

in area such a natural language understand 
and generation could mean that more work might be 
automate more rapidly than we estimate here. 

 While we assume that wage level will play a major 
role in determine automation adoption, company 
may also adopt these technology for other reasons, 
include their capacity to exceed human performance 
capability in some areas. This would mean more 
rapid automation adoption than we model, particularly 
in low-wage economy and for low-wage work in 
advanced economies. 

 Displaced worker might not find new work quickly, 
or at all, because they lack the skill or educational 
requirements, or because other barrier such a 
cultural preference or geographic mobility stand 
in their way. There be few example of large-scale 
retrain and redeployment of midcareer workers. 
Moreover, labor market may not work a well a 
they need to do to help displace worker find 
new employment. 

 The assumption we make on future consumption 
growth and spending on infrastructure and building 
might be too optimistic. In the past decade, actual 
GDP growth in nearly all advanced economy have 
be low than forecast. Continued sluggish growth, 
rise geopolitical tensions, or a new recession could 
make our future job creation scenario too optimistic. 

A number of other caveat to our finding should also be 
noted. We have not make assumption in our model 
about sector trends, such a the growth of ecommerce 
in retailing, or the impact of fiscal constraint on public 
sector employment. We also do not model change in 
work structure, such a the growth of the gig economy, 
or activity within an occupation that could change 
a a result of technological innovation. Our analysis of 
wage trend be base on current average wage for each 
occupation in each country, and we do not model wage 
over time by occupation base on the dynamic of labor 
supply and demand. Finally, we do not model change 
skill requirement for occupation or analyze the “skill 
bias” of automation technologies, that is, whether they will 
enable high-skill worker at the expense of low-skill ones, 
or vice-versa.3

We live in an age when machine answer customer inquiries, help doctor understand 
X-rays, lip-read good than human professionals, and sort trash into compost and 
recyclables—an age, too, when the public debate about automation and it impact on the 
workplace raise anxious questions. First be the existential one about the future of work 
itself. Given rapid advance in technology include robotics and artificial intelligence, will 
there be enough work to ensure full employment? Second be the question about what those 
job will be, and which skill will be need for them. The third be what all this could mean 
for wages. 

We seek to address these question in this report through, first, an analysis of automation 
potential and scenario about the extent of adoption of current work activity by 2030 
and, second, an analysis of potential future labor demand. We look at 46 countries, 
represent almost 90 percent of global GDP. To illustrate the potential impact at a country 
level, we use six a exemplar of country that vary by sector and occupation mix, GDP per 
caput growth, wage rates, and demographics: China, Germany, India, Japan, Mexico, and 
the United States.23 

In this chapter, we focus on automation’s potential to transform the workplace. Building 
on our previous automation work, we create a range for the number of hour that could be 
displace by automation by 2030, and seek to identify the work activities, occupations, and 
sector that be most—and least—susceptible to be automate (see Box 1, “Automation’s 
rapid advance and it limitations—for now”).24 

Among the finding of our new research be that a much a 30 percent of the hour 
work globally could be automate by 2030, depend on the speed of adoption, with 
15 percent of current work activity be automate in our midpoint scenario. The speed 
of adoption depends on factor include technical feasibility, the pace of technology 
development, costs, and social and regulatory acceptance. These result differ significantly 
by country, reflect the mix of activity currently perform by worker and prevail 
wage rates, range from 9 percent in India to 26 percent in Japan in the midpoint adoption 
rate scenario.

Automation be not a new phenomenon; industrial robot 
have be a fixture on factory floor for several decades, 
and software algorithm help logistics company 
optimize the route planning of delivery in a faster and 
more efficient manner than human route planner could. 

Recent development in robotics, artificial intelligence, 
and machine learn be noteworthy for the advance 
they represent, however. We be on the cusp of a new 
automation age in which technology not only do thing 
we thought only human could do, but can increasingly 
do them at a superhuman level. In just the past year, 
a project by Google’s DeepMind and the University of 
Oxford have apply deep learn to a huge data set 
of BBC program to create a lip-reading system that 
be substantially more proficient than a professional 
human lip-reader.1 Researchers at Stanford University 
have developed a deep learn system that be able 
to diagnose pneumonia from chest x-ray good than 
expert radiologist work alone.2 Robot “skin” make of

Institute of Technology and cover in thousand of 
mechanical hair can “feel” texture and find object by 
touch.3 Companies be use advanced facial analysis to 
monitor emotional response to advertisement and other 
digital medium content, via a webcam.4 

AI be already be deployed in synthetic biology, cancer 
research, climate science, and material science. For 
example, researcher at Vanderbilt university have 
use computer to exceed the human standard in 
predict the most effective treatment for major 
depressive disorder and eventual outcome of breast 
cancer patients.5 

Three factor be drive the technological advances: 

 Machine-learning algorithm have progress in 
recent years, especially through the development of 
deep learn and reinforcement-learning technique 
base on neural networks. 

 Computing capacity be increase exponentially 
and have become available to train large and more 
complex model much faster. Graphics processing 
units, originally design to render the computer 
graphic in video games, have be repurposed to 
execute the data and algorithm crunch require for 
machine learn at speed many time faster than 
traditional processor chips. This compute capacity 
have be aggregate in hyper-scalable data center 
and make accessible to user through the cloud. 

 Vast amount of data that can be use to train 
machine learn model be be generated, for 
example through daily creation of billion of images, 
online click streams, voice and video, mobile 
locations, and sensor embed in the Internet 
of Things. 

Formidable technical challenge still lie ahead. While 
machine can be train to perform a range of cognitive 
tasks, they remain limited. They be not yet good at 
put knowledge into context, let alone improvising, and 
they have little of the common sense that be the essence of 
human experience and emotion. They struggle to operate 
without a pre-defined methodology. They can replicate 
fugue in the style of Bach, but cannot yet understand 
sarcasm or love.6 

One of the big remain technical challenge be 
mastery of natural language processing—understanding 
and generate speech. These capability be 
indispensable for numerous work activity but, despite 
great progress in area such a machine translation, 
machine still have far to go to achieve human level 
of performance. 

Beyond the development of technology, much work 
remains to be do integrate different capability into 
holistic solution in which everything work together 
seamlessly. Combining a range of technology will be 
essential for workplace automation, but engineering 
such solutions—whether for hardware or software—is a 
difficult process.

AUTOMATION CAN RAISE THE PRODUCTIVITY OF THE GLOBAL ECONOMY 
BUT WILL AFFECT EMPLOYMENT: A BRIEF RECAP OF OUR PRIOR RESEARCH 
In our January 2017 report, A future that works: Automation, employment, and productivity, 
we note that automation technology such a advanced robotics and artificial intelligence 
be powerful driver of productivity and economic growth which can help create economic 
surplus and increase overall societal prosperity. Key finding of that report include: 

 Automation could accelerate the productivity of the global economy by between 0.8 and 
1.4 percent of global GDP annually, assume that human labor replace by automation 
rejoins the workforce and be a productive a it be in 2014. Automation on it own will 
not be sufficient to achieve long-term economic growth aspiration across the world; 
for that, additional productivity-boosting measure will be needed, include rework 
business process or develop new product and services. Nonetheless, the 
productivity growth enable by automation can ensure continued prosperity in age 
nation and provide an additional boost to fast-growing ones.25 

 For companies, the deployment of automation can deliver benefit in the form of labor 
cost savings, but also in myriad other performance-enhancing ways. It can enable firm 
to get closer to customer and predict maintenance needs, sharply reduce the cost of 
operation in some activity and extend the life of exist capital assets. Automation 
can also increase scale and speed. Nissan, for example, have halve the time it take 
to move from final product design to production thanks to an automate system, while 
BMW have reduce machine downtime by 30 to 40 percent—effectively generate fresh 
economy of scale with minimal investment—through AI-enabled condition-based 
maintenance.26 Exhibit 1 compare the estimate potential performance and labor cost 
reduction benefit from automation for a number of key process within some sectors. 
These finding be base on estimate of potential in case study inform by our work 
with industry. 

 Overall, our analysis suggest that roughly 50 percent of the time spent on activity 
that people be paid almost $15 trillion to do in the global economy have the theoretical 
potential to be automate by adapt currently demonstrate technology—in other 
words, the technical capability already exist, although an integrate solution to 
automate each particular activity might not yet have be developed nor deployed. We 
estimate the potential for technology to automate the more than 2,000 work activity 
in about 800 occupation across the economy, by adapt currently demonstrate 
technologies. (We examine work activity individually rather than whole occupations, 
since occupation consist of a range of activity with different potential for automation). 
Certain category of activity be more susceptible to automation than others.27 While 
less than 5 percent of occupation can be fully automated, about 60 percent have 
at least 30 percent of activity that can technically be automate (see illustration, 
“Automation: A global force that will transform economy and the workforce”). 

 Our automation analysis found significant variation among sector of the economy, 
and among the occupation within those sectors. For example, almost one-fifth of 
the time spent in US workplace involves predictable physical activity and be prevalent 
in such sector a manufacturing and retail trade. Accordingly, these sector have a 
relatively high technical potential for automation by adapt currently demonstrate 
technologies. Even within sectors, there be considerable variation. In manufacturing, for

example, occupation that have a large proportion of physical activity in predictable 
environment such a factory welder have a technical automation potential above 
90 percent, whereas for customer service representative that potential be less than 
30 percent. 

 Technical feasibility be an essential element of automation but four other factor also 
influence the timing, which explains in part why our overall analysis of automation 
adoption and the impact on employment to 2030 can vary among countries. The other 
factor be economic and social: the cost of develop and deploy automation 
solution for the workplace—that be actually develop integrate solution for 
specific use cases; labor market dynamic include the supply, demand, and cost of 
human labor; the net economic benefit of automation, which include performance 
benefit beyond labor substitution such a high throughput, raise productivity, and 
heighten safety; and regulatory and social acceptance. Labor market dynamic in 
particular play an important role in the national variation around automation adoption, 
since wage rate vary widely by country, even for similar occupations. The relative cost 
of automation compare with the cost of labor will affect adoption: if qualify worker 
be in abundant supply and significantly less expensive than automation, this could be 
a decisive argument against automation in that situation. Consequently, in the period 
to 2030, we expect advanced economies, with wage level that be relatively higher, to 
adopt automation early than many emerge economies, especially if adoption require 
expensive hardware solutions. That said, our automation model do consider the 
continue improvement in automation technologies’ capability over time, a well a 
decrease costs.

AUTOMATION COULD REPLACE 9 TO 26 PERCENT OF THE WORK HOURS IN 
OUR SIX FOCUS COUNTRIES BY 2030 
Our automation model applies the factor list above to a range of scenarios, bookended 
by two scenario around the early adoption and late adoption we modeled. It be not our 
intention to predict the timing but to provide a range, and these two edge case scenario 
may turn out to be extreme. However, they do enable u to model a spectrum of outcomes. 

While about half of all work activity globally have the technical potential to be automate 
by adapt currently demonstrate technologies, accord to our prior research on 
automation, this will not happen overnight. Taking into account the technical, economic and 
social factor affect the pace and extent of automation, described above, the proportion 
of work actually displace by 2030 will likely be lower. We estimate that up to 30 percent 
of current work activity could be displace by 2030, with a midpoint of 15 percent, or the 
hour of about 400 million full-time equivalents. Indeed, the range of outcome be particularly 
wide in 2030 in our model; in the event of late automation adoption, the percentage of 
work activity displace by 2030 would be close to zero. Among countries, too, especially 
between advanced economy and emerge ones, the range be wide. Exhibit 2 highlight 
both how we arrive at our range of automation scenarios, and the model we use 
for estimate scenario for future labor demand, which we describe in detail in the 
follow chapter.

For the six country we use a exemplar in this report, the hour that could be automate 
by 2030 in the midpoint adoption case range from 26 percent of the hour work in 
Japan to 9 percent in India (Exhibit 3). Developed country Germany (24 percent) and the 
United States (23 percent) be not far behind Japan, follow by China (16 percent) and 
Mexico (13 percent). In general, wage rate be the big determinant of the difference 
in automation scenario among countries; high wage rate make automation more 
economically attractive. In addition, the mix of activities, which be related to the mix of sector 
and occupations, also affect the model rate of automation. Among the main difference 
between emerge and advanced economy be the importance of agriculture in the former. 
In Germany and Japan, manufacturing also have high automation potential. That said, 
emerge economy could leverage automation technology aggressively in an effort to 
leapfrog their economic development. China, for example, have few robot per worker than 
the global average, but receive nearly one-third of all robot shipment in 2016.28 

At the other extreme of the scenario we modeled, in our late adoption scenario, less than 
0.5 percent of work hour globally will be automate by 2030, and advanced economy will 
account for the large majority of them.

Automation will displace worker with different educational attainment across 
a wide range of occupation 
Just a there be a wide variation in automation’s impact on country and sectors, so, too, it 
effect on specific occupation will vary. Those profession highly dependent on the work 
activity we identify a most susceptible to automation—physical work in a predictable 
environment, or data collection and processing—are likely to be the most affected, 
especially if automation adoption occurs earlier, which we anticipate to be the case in 
country with high wage such a Japan, Germany, and other advanced economies. By 
comparison, occupation that require application of expertise, interaction with stakeholders, 
management and coach of others, or a high degree of social and emotional response will 
be less susceptible to automation in the period to 2030. 

Occupations incorporate significant amount of physical work in predictable environment 
include production worker and building and ground cleaners, a well a office support 
(such a clerk and administrative assistants), be likely to face significant displacement 
of their activity by automation, while doctors, health aides, and other care provider and 
professional include engineer and business specialist be less likely to experience a 
much displacement. 

The current level of educational requirement for occupation tends to be correlate with 
the likelihood that their activity can be automated. The technical automation potential for 
occupation require less than a high school diploma be 55 percent, whereas for those with 
a college degree, that potential be far lower, at just 22 percent. Occupations require some 
post-secondary education generally include work activity that be less automatable than 
those require a high school diploma and some experience, and so on (Exhibit 4).

Countries and company have compelling reason to embrace automation, since the 
technology will give a much-needed boost to productivity in the global economy. 
Depending on the pace of adoption, however, automation technology in the workplace 
could displace worker in a wide range of sectors; in our most aggressive scenario for early 
adoption, almost one-third of work hour in the global economy could be automate by 
2030—although other, late adoption scenario have less dramatic outcome in that time 
frame. Economic and social factor beyond technical feasibility affect adoption, and these 
could lead to strong variation in adoption rate among sector and countries. Under these 
circumstances, what will be the future of work? Will the global economy create enough 
additional job to offset those lose to automation, regardless of when adoption take place? 
And if so, what sort of job will those be, require which skills, and pay what wages? In 
the next two chapters, we highlight finding of our analysis of future labor demand and the 
complex workforce transition that automation will likely set in motion.

For centuries, the arrival of new technology in the workplace have spark workers’ fears— 
and, sometimes, violent backlash. Already in 1589, England’s Queen Elizabeth I refuse to 
grant a patent to a stock frame invent by William Lee because she be supposedly 
concerned about the effect on hand knitters.29 In the early 19th century, textile worker in 
Britain and France smash automate loom in their factory and printer struck to protest 
the arrival of steam-powered presses.30 

Leading thinker in the past, from David Ricardo to Karl Marx and John Maynard Keynes, 
raise concern about the effect of technological change on employment, and opinion poll 
show that anxiety have come to the fore again, amid rapid advance in robotics and artificial 
intelligence.31 A number of prominent academic and technologist argue that the late 
wave of automation technologies, include artificial intelligence and machine learning, will 
be particularly disruptive to the workforce.32 

In this chapter, we examine the historical impact of technology on employment, skills, and 
wages. History do not necessarily repeat itself, but it do provide valuable context 
and possible lesson for the future of labor demand in a time of automation. Among those 
lesson be that technological innovation in the past have enable the creation of many 
more new job than it have destroyed, raise productivity, spur sustain increase in 
living standards, and bring about a shift in the balance of work and leisure. However, 
the transition have not always be smooth: for example, real wage stagnate for nearly 
50 year in 19th century England during the Industrial Revolution there, and only picked up 
again at a time of substantial social policy reforms. Charles Dickens among other novelist 
use the harsh reality of everyday life for displace and other worker a material for 
his works. History also show that robust aggregate demand and economic growth be 
essential for job creation. New technology have raise productivity growth, enable firm 
to low price for consumers, pay high wages, or distribute profit to shareholders. This 
stimulates demand across the economy, boost job creation.

30 The most celebrate anti-technology protest be conduct by “Luddites” in Nottingham, England, in 
1811, but they be not alone. French textile worker stag an uprise in a silk factory in Lyons in 1831

31 Political economist David Ricardo worried in the early 19th century that machine would make labor 
redundant, while Karl Marx in the 1850s foresaw an era when the mean of labor would be transform 
by “an automatic system of machinery.” In 1930, John Maynard Keynes coin the term “technological 
unemployment” to describe a situation in which innovation that economize on the use of labor outstrip 
the pace at which new job could be created, in a “temporary phase of maladjustment.” David Ricardo, On 
the principle of political economy and taxation, 1817; Karl Marx, Grundrisse: Foundations of the critique of 
political economy, 1858; John Maynard Keynes, “Economic possibility for our grandchildren,” in Essays in

2. LESSONS FROM HISTORY ON 
TECHNOLOGY AND EMPLOYMENT 



2. Lessons from history on technology and employment McKinsey Global Institute34 

LARGE-SCALE SECTOR EMPLOYMENT DECLINES HAVE BEEN MORE THAN 
OFFSET BY OTHER SECTORS EMPLOYING WORKERS 
Since the First Industrial Revolution begin in England in the 18th century, the economy 
of Europe, the United States, and other country have undergone two profound wave 
of structural change. Mechanization enable a revolution in agriculture and in industry, 
prompt a migration of worker from the countryside to cities. A second structural shift 
have occur in the past 60 year a the share of manufacturing employment have decline 
in some country even a growth in service sector accelerates.33 

The employment shift accompany this process of structural transformation have be 
very large. In the United States, for instance, the agriculture share of employment decline 
from 58 percent of total employment in 1850 to 2.5 percent of employment today (Exhibit 5). 
In just 40 years, between 1880 and 1920, the share of agricultural employment decline 
25 percentage points. During the same decades, other sector be be transform by 
mechanization and electrification a well: the share of miner and household workers, for 
example maid and servants, also declined, although these shift affected few workers. 
Since 1960, when the second wave of structural transformation began, manufacturing fell 
from 27 percent of total US employment to 9 percent today, a automation and global trade 
transform manufacturing and a demand for service exploded. 

The pattern be broadly similar in other countries, although there be some notable 
difference in the pace. China’s shift sector mix in recent year have be especially rapid: 
agricultural employment fell a a share of total employment by 32 percentage point in just 
25 years, from 60 percent in 1990 to 28 percent in 2015.34 In Mexico, the agriculture share 
of employment decline from 52 percent in 1960 to 13 percent in 2015, although in contrast 
with China, the decline have be gradual and continuous across decades. In Japan, 
agricultural employment decline from a 31 percent share of total employment in 1960 to 
3.5 percent in 2015, while manufacturing’s share of total employment drop from it peak 
in 1973 of 25 percent to 13 percent in 2015. 

Throughout these large shift of worker across occupation and industries, overall 
employment a a share of the population have generally continued to grow. New industry 
and occupation emerge to absorb worker displace by technology, although a we 
discus below, the transition have not always be smooth. 

Magnitude of potential job dislocation from automation through 2030 be 
not unprecedented 
When we compare historical sector employment to potential labor displacement from our 
automation model, we see that even in the early automation scenario, future rate of labor 
displacement from automation within specific sector be not unprecedented. For example, 
our analysis show that a number of sector in different countries, include agriculture 
in China, Germany, and Japan, and manufacturing in the United States, have decline by 
30 percent and more over a period of 15 years. Our analysis of scenario of automation 
displacement over the 15 year from 2016 to 2030 be within the same range (Exhibit 6).

TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE SPARKS RISING PRODUCTIVITY AND 
AGGREGATE EMPLOYMENT 
History show that the adoption of technological innovation can act a a powerful stimulus 
on the economy and jobs. The overall effect of mechanization have be to create job on an 
unprecedented scale. Machines allow worker to produce more, thereby raise productivity 
and (eventually) wages, and lower the price of good for consumers. These twin effect 
unleash new demand for all good and services. In addition, a firm gain scale, they require 
more managers, accountants, and other office workers. 

This dynamic be the reason that aggregate employment have grown over the long term, 
even a the size of the workforce have grown. In the United States, for example, female 
employment almost double a a proportion of working-age woman from 32 percent in 
1950 to 60 percent in the late 1990s before fall back to 57 percent today. Yet this major 
shift do not reduce overall employment. Indeed, employment grew: the total number 
of people employ in the United States more than double from 65 million in 1960 to 
152 million in 2017, accord to data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. Similar trend 
have occur in other countries. 

Technology enables productivity growth, raise incomes, and stimulates new 
consumer demand 
Evidence of the economy-wide positive correlation among technology, productivity, and 
employment can be see in the aggregate data across countries. Within an industry, 
machine and automation can sometimes contribute to employment declines. For instance, 
in the United States, one recent study found that every industrial robot deployed result in 
the reduction of six human worker within the surround metropolitan area.35 However, 
when look at the total economy, we see the opposite effect: rise productivity (often 
from technology) be usually accompany by employment growth, not decline. This be 
because automation raise productivity, which in turn increase income of worker and/or 
shareholders. Higher income be spent, create demand for good and service across 
the economy.36 

When there have be a tradeoff between employment growth and labor productivity 
growth, it have be short-lived. Looking at the United States since 1960, for example, our 
analysis show that employment and productivity both grow in 79 percent of individual 
years, while productivity grow while employment decline in 12 percent of years. But 
both employment and productivity grow in 95 percent of roll three-year period and 
100 percent of roll 10-year periods. This phenomenon be also see in other countries. 
In China, employment and productivity both increase in 77 percent of individual year 
but 98 percent of the 10-year period between 1960 and 2016. In Germany, which saw 
unemployment rise after reunification, employment and productivity grow in 68 percent of 
individual year but 81 percent of roll 10-year period (Exhibit 7).

Even a productivity growth lead to rise incomes, technological innovation can also 
reduce price and increase the quality of good and services.37 This combination can cause 
demand for a product to soar, result in high employment even within the sector itself. 
The Ford Model T provide one historical example. The assembly line dramatically improve 
the productivity of the process of manufacturing automobiles. Exhibit 8 show that over 
a six-year period, the number of Model Ts produce per worker annually nearly tripled, 
from eight to 21. The surge in productivity, combine with increase economy of scale, 
enable Ford to reduce the price from $950 in 1909 to $440 in 1915. As a result, the number 
of car sell increase 30-fold, and employment rise from 1,655 to 18,892.38

TECHNOLOGY DISPLACES SOME WORK BUT CREATES NEW JOBS, 
SOMETIMES IN UNFORESEEN WAYS 
It be easy to see which job be be destroyed by technology, but difficult to imagine 
which job will be create by it. Telephone switchboard operator have go the way of 
lamplighter in the 19th century, but how many of them, lament the loss of their jobs, 
could have imagine the development of the smartphone—and the huge global industry 
employ ten of million of people that have sprung up around it? More than 50 year 
ago, Joseph Schumpeter coin the phrase “creative destruction” to describe this age-old 
phenomenon in which the emergence of new technology “destroys” job by render them 
obsolete, and “creates” new job in their wake.39

2. Lessons from history on technology and employment McKinsey Global Institute40 

Not only do technology create new occupations, it can also change exist occupation 
in unpredictable ways. After ATMs be introduce in the United States, for example, the 
number of bank teller actually rose, a bank compete to provide higher-quality service 
to customer and the role of teller change from dispense cash to provide broader 
advice and services. The reduction in the number of teller per branch enable bank to 
open more branch and make retail banking more convenient for customers, which drove 
the demand for more tellers.40 From 1991 to 2007, the number of ATMs and teller in the 
United States both increased. However, that trend reverse a Internet banking and the 
2008 financial crisis result in cutback in bank branch and tellers. 

To good understand the pattern of job creation and destruction, we conduct case 
study of two technology in the United States—personal computer and automobiles— 
to estimate the number and type of job lose to the new technology and the number of 
new job created. In both cases, our research reveals that while some work activity 
declined, sometimes rapidly, new type of work activity be created. The net impact of 
both technology be highly positive, create new job that make up 10 percent of total 
employment over four decades. 

The personal computer enable the creation of 15.8 million net new job since 
1980, accounting for 10 percent of employment 
Computer-related industry such a computer and data processing service and computer 
and related equipment manufacturing have be grow rapidly since the 1970s. Microsoft 
and Apple be found in that decade. Laptop computer come on the market in the early 
1980s, and this century have see the rapid rise of smartphones and tablets. 

The growth of computer have generate significant employment: in the United States, 
we estimate that computer have enable the net creation of 15.8 million job since 1970 
(Exhibit 9). We arrive at this figure by tally employment gain and loss in different 
sector and occupations. We find that in total, we can identify 3.5 million job destroyed by 
the introduction of computers, include those in typewriter manufacturing, secretarial work, 
and bookkeeping. But at least 19.3 million be create in a wide range of occupation 
and industries. 

When digital edit make it easy and more efficient for author to type and then directly 
edit their own work, computer eliminate the need for people specialized in edit 
and re-typing documents. Employment for typist and secretary fell significantly, by 
1.4 million between 1990 and 2015, even a the overall US workforce grew. The number of 
bookkeeping clerk also declined, by an annual average of 3 percent in the same period, a 
accounting move from physical book to accounting software, result in nearly 900,000 
few jobs. 

But many new job be also created. These include job in the computer manufacturing 
industry and supplier industry (such a semiconductors), a well a employment in 
occupation enable by computer (IT system administrators, computer scientist in other 
industries), and in occupation that use computer (customer service call centers, which 
barely exist before computers, and ecommerce). Of this total, only about 1 percent of net 
new job come directly from the computer manufacturing industry and only 3 percent come 
from supplier industries.

A large share of employment gain have come in profession enable by computer 
(18 percent of net employment created). This include the entire computer software and 
service industry, with company such a Oracle, IBM, and Microsoft. This industry 
employ three million people in the United States, include software and app developers, 
computer scientists, and manager and office workers. 

Because of the multitude of application of the computer, over 75 percent of net 
employment generate have be in occupation that use computers. For example, 
employment of computer scientist in finance, manufacturing, business services, and 
other industry grow rapidly, by an annual average of about 7 percent, between 1980 
and 2015. In the same period, employment of financial manager and specialist able to 
use spreadsheet to track and analyze large amount of company data grow by about 
3 percent annually on average (see Box 2, “The impact of personal computer and Internet 
technology on information analysts”).

Box 2. The impact of personal computer and Internet technology on 
information analyst 

1 Under information analyst we have include the follow Bureau of Labor Statistics occupations: credit 
analysts, budget analysts, financial analysts, operation research analyst, economists, market researcher 
and survey researchers, and management analysts. 

In theory, at least, many information analyst might have be replace by the rise of the 
Internet, which make collect data and information vastly more efficient, and computer 
that enable rapid and complex computations. After all, much of their work in the 1980s, 
before these technology be widespread, have since be automated.1 

In fact, the opposite have happened. Computers and the Internet automate activity such 
a basic mathematics and information gathering, yet the number of information analyst 
soar nonetheless. As computer become more efficient, the cost of obtain high-quality 
information dropped. Rather than decrease demand for analysts, this stimulate the 
appetite for more insightful and low-cost analysis, and the number of analyst quintuple 
from around 400,000 in 1980 to about two million today (Exhibit 10). 

The job of analyst have change a well. With information and data more easily 
accessible, analyst can focus on make sense of—and sharing—information rather than 
gathering it.

As computer adoption increased, computer use be correlate with high wages; 
employee in these occupation often acquire new skill to use computers, and could 
demand high wage premiums.41 For example, graphic designer take over the job of 
typesetter and start do a wider range of tasks. Wages increase accordingly a they 
learn how to use new software and developed high value skills.42 

The automobile’s large employment effect have be in enable industry 
The introduction of the automobile create 6.9 million net new job in the United States 
between 1910 and 1950, base on our estimates.43 This be equivalent to 11 percent of the 
US workforce in 1950. This include 7.5 million job created, and 623,000 job destroyed. 
Workers displace by the automobile include manufacturer of wagons, carriages, 
harness and saddles, and of railroad equipment and carriages, a well a supplier 
industry such a horse breeder and metal work occupations, and enable industry 
such a livery service and message boys. 

Ten time a many job be create in a host of new occupations. About 10 percent be 
within the auto manufacturing industry (Exhibit 11). Three time a many job be in the 
automotive supply chain, include metal part manufacturers, warehouse and logistics, 
and wholesalers. An even large share of job be create in enable industry and 
occupation that use the automobile. Enabled industry include auto dealerships, auto 
repair, gas stations, and convenience stores, and these account for around 30 percent of 
net new job created. Utilizer industries, meanwhile, include transportation and logistics 
occupations, and account for about 25 percent of employment generated. 

If we have extend our analysis beyond 1950, we would have see the continue 
transformative impact of the automobile on the economy and society. Building of the US 
interstate highway system begin in the 1950s, transform logistics networks. This in 
turn give rise to the concept of the “family vacation,” long-haul car trip and demand for 
roadside attractions, motels, and campgrounds. Drive-in movie and restaurants, shopping 
mall on the edge of towns, and parking lot sprang up. The automobile also enable 
growth in suburbs, a worker could commute to job from location outside urban public 
transportation networks. 

THE NUMBER OF HOURS WORKED HAS DECLINED, WHILE LEISURE TIME 
HAS RISEN 
While past technological disruption do not reduce the amount of work available to 
people, they nonetheless have one significant effect: a decline in the average number of 
hour work per week—and conversely an increase in the amount of leisure enjoy by 
individuals. Already in 1930, John Maynard Keynes predict the advent of great leisure: 
“For the first time since his creation man will be face with his real, his permanent problem— 
how to use his freedom from press economic cares, how to occupy the leisure, 
which science and compound interest will have won for him, to live wisely and agreeably 
and well.”44 

In hindsight, Keynes be right: the average number of hour work each week by 
employ worker have decline significantly in the past 150 years, give worker more 
time for leisure. In 1870, worker in Germany, Sweden, and the United States average 
between 62 and 70 hour each week; in the United Kingdom, which be already shift

2015, these figure have fall by roughly half, to around 35 hour in Germany, Sweden, and 
the United Kingdom and 38.6 hour in the United States. Hours work have continued 
to decline a the workforce shift from manufacturing to service in the past 50 years.

The decline in average hour work reflect the productivity improvement that have 
compound over the years, allow people to work less per week and yet still support 
grow economies. Differences between country reflect different labor policy and social 
institution govern the number of expect hour of work per week and vacation days. In 
the early 20th century, labor union in the United States and in Europe push for national 
policy to cap the work week at 40 hour (which eventually become an International 
Labour Organization standard). In European country such a France and Germany, a 
second wave of working-hour reduction take place in the 1980s and 1990s; in France, the 
government lower the official work week to 35 hours—and today there be some evidence

that French people would work more if they could.46 Since 1960, the total hour work have 
decline by 26 percent in Germany, 8 percent in Italy, and 7 percent in France. 

The decline in average hour work also reflect the steady rise of part-time employment 
across countries. The high proportion of part-time work be in the Netherlands 
(39 percent of employ persons), the United Kingdom (24 percent), and Germany and 
Japan (22 percent).47 Part-time work be often prefer for a variety of reason by students, 
caregivers, and people near retirement, but also by some employer in market where 
rigid labor market policy make full-time hire economically unattractive. In the past 
decade, the number of people in the United States and Europe who earn money in the 
independent workforce—as freelancers, independent contractors, self-employed, and 
worker in the “gig” economy—has grown, to an estimate 162 million.48 Many of these 
individual work less than a full-time schedule. 

As leisure time increases, people spend money on hobbies, entertainment, and other 
personal services, give rise to entire new industry that in turn create jobs. Skiing, golfing, 
tourism, crafting, and do-it-yourself home project be a just a few industry that have 
sprung from the new leisure economy. The number of job involve be significant: globally, a 
many a 292 million people be employ directly or indirectly by tourism—one in every ten 
job on the planet.49 

THE IMPACT OF TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE ON WAGES AND SKILLS 
Adjusting the economy to new technological disruption may take time, and can have 
significant repercussion for both skill and wages. In the first half of the 19th century, 
during the First Industrial Revolution in England, the steam engine and other technology 
increase the productivity of unskilled worker and enable them to undertake work 
previously carry out by higher-skill, and higher-paid, worker include craftsman and 
artisans. Across the economy, mechanization raise output per worker. However, real 
wage stagnate for roughly 50 years, from 1790 until 1840 (Exhibit 13). During this period, 
first note by economist Friedrich Engels in 1845, profit a a share of national income 
rise and the labor share of income declined.50 After 1850, real wage begin rise in line 
with productivity increases, and by the late 1800s wage growth exceed productivity 
growth. But for nearly half a century, wage growth be nil and real living standard of 
worker declined. The plight of some worker provide material for Charles Dickens’s bleak 
depiction in his novels, and lead the English poet William Blake to decry factory a “dark, 
satanic mills.”51 The turnaround in the relationship between wage and output come at a 
time of substantial reform of exist structure include the right to unionize, limitation on 

46 An MGI survey of 16,000 Europeans in eight country show that a majority be willing to make tradeoffs, 
include work more hour per week in exchange for more income and good services. This willingness to 
increase work hour be especially pronounce in France, where the workweek be officially lower to 
35 hour from 2000. A window of opportunity for Europe, McKinsey Global Institute, June 2015.

48 Our research have found that 20 to 30 percent of the working-age population in the United States and Western 
Europe work independently, include many who do so part-time. The majority, 70 percent, say they do so 
out of choice, with the remainder do so out of necessity. Independent work: Choice, necessity and the gig

child labor, the introduction of public high schools, urban planning to improve public health, 
elimination of debtors’ prison, and the extension of the right to vote to landless workers.52 

The grow mechanization lead to a shift in the skill of the workforce and affected semi- 
skilled artisan negatively. Economic historian have document the consequence for 
previously well-paid worker such a hand-loom weavers, whose income tumble in the 
1820s, lead to immiseration of many, even a the invention of automate loom lift 
other, unskilled worker out of poverty.53 At the same time, the share of unskilled labor in the 
British workforce increased, from 20 percent in the late 16th century to nearly 40 percent 
in the early 19th century.54 This “deskilling” of the workforce occur in agriculture and 
industry alike, prompt by land concentration that enable mechanize agriculture and the 
shift from artisans’ workshop to factory production in industry. During this period there be 
also some growth in the share of skilled worker such a machine erectors and operators, 
who be need to facilitate the Industrial Revolution. 

More recently, academic research show that local labor markets, include in the United 
States, have take year to adjust to trade shock from competition from China, with wage 
and labor-force participation rate remain depressed and unemployment rate remain 
elevate for at least a full decade after the trade shock started.55 Some research also

suggests that increase structural unemployment of non-college US white of the past two 
decades—driven by automation and offshoring in manufacturing, among other things—may 
have contribute to rise morbidity rates.56 

Whether the experience of technological disruption in the past be relevant for economy in 
the future can be debated. In Chapter 4 of this report, we present new analysis of the impact 
of automation today on the demand for different type of skill and discus the potential 
impact on wages. Even if the particular of the historical experience turn out to differ from 
condition today, one lesson seem pertinent: although economy adjust to technological 
shocks, the transition period be measure in decades, not years, and the rise prosperity 
may not be share by all. 

AUTOMATION TODAY: COULD THIS TIME BE DIFFERENT? 
Despite the reassure lesson from history on the long-run impact of automation on 
employment, some technology expert argue that automation today will not behave like 
previous technology waves. They cite a number of reason that the future may bring more 
disruption to worker than in the past, include the ability of machine to perform work 
activity require cognitive capabilities, the rate of progress in new innovations, and a 
potential future in which machine teach themselves to improve at particular task without 
much human intervention.57 Many economists, however, tend to view automation a the 
next wave of technological advancement and point out that an equilibrium between the 
supply and demand of job in labor market have always be reach historically, even if the 
transition period may be difficult.58 

In part, the discord between the two point of view may be cause by the lack of a common 
language: what exactly could be different about automation compare with previous 
technologies? What time frame be we considering? In our research we look at a range 
of argument on both side and examine the evidence for both the scope of automation’s 
impact and it nature across multiple dimensions. This framework be useful for disentangle 
the different element of technological disruption and assess the way in which today’s 
technology may—or may not—have a different impact than in the past. 

We conclude that in many respects, the impact of automation on employment today be 
not likely to be different than in the past, particularly if we look back centuries, to the First 
Industrial Revolution in the late 1700s. But we have identify two way in which automation, 
robotics, and AI could diverge from early wave of technology disruption: the speed at 
which scientific advance be be made, if the accelerate rate of progress in machine 
learn and AI continues, and the potential to displace a high share of the workforce in 
a relatively short period of time, particularly if the adoption of automation be rapid across 
multiple sector of the economy.

Rate of technological innovation 
Could be faster than the past 
In Chapter 1 we note the rapidity of recent technological innovation a a result of the 
development of deep learn and reinforcement-learning technique base on neural 
networks; the availability of exponentially increase compute capacity that be accessible 
to user via the cloud; and the sheer volume and variety of data generate that can be 
use to train machine learn models. Advocates of the argument that automation today be 
fundamentally different in it scope point to this acceleration of innovation a evidence of a 
real break with the past. 

Those who disagree, however, point to Moore’s Law, name for Gordon Moore, a co- 
founder of Intel, who in 1965 note that the number of transistor incorporate in a 
computer chip would approximately double every 24 months—which become the basic 
business model for the semiconductor industry for the follow decades.59 The shrink of 
transistor in semiconductor improve compute speed and capacity and help usher 
in the internet era, a well a the mobile phone revolution and the cloud. However, the rate of 
progress in shrink transistor have slowed, and some scientist project that without a new 
compute model, future advance may run out. Moreover, AI veteran point to previous 
era when what seem to be fast-moving advance in AI give way to frustrate lulls. AI 
date back to the 1950s, when Alan Turing suggest that computer could communicate 
a well a human and Princeton student include Marvin Minsky and Dean Edmonds 
built the first artificial neural network use 300 vacuum tube and a war-surplus gyropilot. 
After the initial excitement, funding slump in the 1970s a research backers—primarily 
the US government—tired of wait for practical AI application and cut appropriation for 
further work. Another lull follow in the 1990s.60 

Our view be that the recent technical advances, enable machine to read lip or X-rays 
more proficiently than human experts, be indeed remarkable and that if this pace of 
innovation continue rather than encounter a new AI “winter,” the rate of automation 
innovation could indeed be faster than in the past. If so, the potential disruption of workforce 
model and displacement of labor could be great than past technological revolutions. 

Rate of technological adoption 
Faster than 100 year ago, but no evidence of acceleration in recent decade 
Even if technological innovation be occur more rapidly, the impact on worker 
will be different only if the diffusion and adoption of new technology also accelerates. 
Some researcher say this be the case, point to example such a landline telephones, 
electrification, or the automobile. Indeed, while it take almost a century for landline phone 
to reach saturation, or the point at which new demand fall off, mobile phone in some 
market reach that point in just 20 year and smartphones in even less time.61 One 
commonly found reference be the speed with which certain online video on YouTube or 
smartphone game such a Angry Birds or Pokemon Go reach a certain threshold of 
downloads—50 million, 100 million, or more.62 Based on measure of gross numbers, 
for example, of people adopt a technology, you could say that adoption rate have 
accelerated. However, it be also worth consider adoption rate when measure 
use percentages.

2. Lessons from history on technology and employment McKinsey Global Institute50 

Looking at only the last 60 years, our review of the historical rate of adoption of 25 previous 
technology show that the time from commercial availability to 80 percent adoption have 
tend to fall within a relatively constant range: between approximately eight and 28 years. 
For 50 percent adoption, the range be five to 16 years. The technology review date back 
to TVs in the 1950s, and include recent example of cell phones, customer relationship 
management software, and lithium-ion cell batteries. This range of time for adoption be 
observe for both hardware-based technology that be capital-intensive and require 
physical installation; and technology that be available purely online. Technologies with 
the fast adoption rate include stents, airbags, MRIs, TVs and online air booking, while 
slow adoption category include dishwasher and pacemaker from the 1960s, and 
cellphone in the 2000s. Even highly popular and widely-used social medium application do 
not achieve a high level of adoption faster than technology in previous eras. Facebook be 
one example: it be launch in 2004 and quickly achieve worldwide success. Yet even 
by mid-2016, when it have about 1.7 billion user globally, it be still far from full adoption, 
even outside China.63 Moreover, it be not the first social network, and so the adoption 
period could be calculate a be even longer—since the advent of the first modern 
social network, Six Degrees, which launch in 1997, or Classmates.com, which launch 
in 1995.64 

Our view be thus that there be no evidence that technological adoption have yet accelerate 
over the last 60 years, when measure in percentages, although, not surprisingly, diffusion 
be faster than it be for technology introduce in the early 20th century. 

Breadth of sector in which work can be automate 
Not different from the past 
Some commentator say that today’s automation be different from the past because it have 
the potential to transform work in multiple sector simultaneously. They argue that the 
large technological disruption of the past have be the move out of agriculture or, more 
recently, from manufacturing into services. Advocates of the “this time thing be different” 
argument point to the pervasiveness of automation technology a be different, in that 
they will affect multiple sector of the economy—from finance to retail to manufacturing to 
transportation—simultaneously.65 

As point of comparison, one can consider the application of some technology in the 
past, such a electricity or computers, which also transform work across multiple sector 
of the economy simultaneously. Electrification transform household lighting, heating, 
and refrigeration; it enable store and factory to open for longer hours; and it give birth 
to mass production. Similarly, computer transform business services, finance, and 
retail and give birth to the Internet and mobile computing. The steam engine drove the 
Industrial Revolution, upend numerous sector from weave to printing, for example. 
Between 1910 and 1950, successive wave of innovation also prove highly pervasive, from 
automobile to assembly lines. 

Our view be that little be new about the breadth of impact of automation technologies. 

Share of job in the economy that be automate by 2030 
Could be high than past technology if adoption be rapid 
Even if past technological innovation transform work in multiple sector of the economy, 
today’s automation could affect a large share of work. Proponents of this view point out 
that some sector employment shift have be extremely large—for example, the rapid 
transition out of agricultural employment in China, or the steep decline in US agriculture in

the 20th century. The potential impact on demand for current work activity in some sector 
a a result of automation today could likewise be very large. Viewed over a 15-year period, 
our automation model suggests that roughly half of the exist work in country such a 
Germany, Japan, and the United States could be displace by 2030 if automation adoption 
be at the most rapid end of our modeling. In the past, also look at 15-year periods, our 
analysis show that a much a 30 percent of job be displace in historical episodes—in 
other words, low than our most rapid automation scenario but not of a completely different 
order of magnitude. 

Our view be thus that, if automation adoption be very rapid, it could potentially displace a 
great percentage of work in some advanced economy in the next 15 year than we have 
see in the past. 

Types and complexity of task that can be automate 
Every wave of automation affect more complex task 
Alongside the scope of automation’s impact, it very nature have spark discussion about 
difference between technological change today and in the past. One frequently-cited 
argument concern the type of task that AI in particular now can accomplish with prowess, 
from drive truck to create music and art to play championship Go. The power of 
algorithm to take on activity require cognitive capability and creativity be held up a a 
fundamental break with previous technologies.66 

Skeptics point out, however, that this be not the first time that machine have be able 
to carry out task require cognitive capabilities. Every new wave of automation seem 
remarkable at the time. From the 1980s, with the birth of computerize spreadsheets, 
machine have take on ever more sophisticated task that previously require human 
brainpower, from manipulate large quantity of data and alphabetize list or do 
complex calculation to anticipate the word your finger be about to type on a 
smartphone. While the task themselves have changed, our view be that the ability of 
machine to acquire such capability be not in itself new. While significant progress have 
be make in specific “narrow” AI applications, formidable multi-decade-long technological 
challenge must still be overcome before machine can match human performance across 
the range of cognitive activity and approach “artificial general intelligence”—which would 
indeed be a break with historical precedent. 

Skill bias of technical change 
Today’s automation could complement both high- and low-skill worker 
Technological innovation have affected worker in different way in the past. As already 
noted, the steam engine and other technology introduce during the Industrial Revolution 
in Europe and the United States in the 19th century increase the productivity of unskilled or 
low-skill worker and enable them to undertake work previously carry out by high-skill, 
and higher-paid, worker include artisan such a hand-loom weavers. In the academic 
literature, technological change be thus consider to be bias toward enable low-skill 
worker at the expense of high-skill ones. 

In our era, the opposite have happened: computer and factory-floor robot have tend to 
increase the productivity and complement the work of high-skill workers, while machine 
have substitute for the programmable and routine task that have be undertaken by 
low-skill workers, include those work on assembly line or a switchboard operators.67 

66 See, for example, the interview with Andrew Ng and Neil Jacobstein,”How artificial intelligence will change 
everything,” The Wall Street Journal, March 6, 2017. 

67 David H. Autor, Frank Levy, and Richard J. Murnane, “The skill content of recent technological change: An 
empirical exploration,” The Quarterly Journal of Economics, volume 18, number 4, November 2003; David 
Hounshell, From the American system to mass production 1800-1932: The development of manufacturing 
technology in the United States, JHU Press, 1985. 



2. Lessons from history on technology and employment McKinsey Global Institute52 

This be know a skill-biased technical change. Some economist view the effect of 
technological change and technology-enabled globalization in recent decade a a 
significant driver of inequality.68 

We do not have firm evidence yet on whether automation today will tend to be more skill- 
bias or unskill-biased in it impact. Our analysis of how automation will affect skills, 
detailed in Chapter 4, suggests that worker of all skill and educational level will be 
affected. Some technology might enable lower-skill worker to replace higher-skill ones— 
such a nurse who can perform some of the more routine task of doctor with the aid of 
diagnostic tools. Other technology will complement high-skill worker and enable them 
to command even great power in the marketplace—for instance surgical robot or AI 
algorithm that can suggest new investment strategies. 

Impact on high-wage vs. low-wage work 
Both will be affected 
A final dimension on which technological change could be different today be it impact on 
worker at different wage levels. One of the frequently-cited concern about automation 
be that machine could replace activity of high-wage job previously consider “safe,” 
include expert in financial services, some type of doctors, and lawyers. 

While our analysis of automation’s impact on wages, also in Chapter 4, suggests that a 
range of high-wage occupation could be affected, there be ample historical precedent 
for this, include the hand-loom weaver in 19th-century England who suffer a steep 
decline in their livelihood after the arrival of mechanize looms, which allow lower-wage 
and lower-skill worker to produce more cloth, faster, and less expensively.69 We therefore 
conclude that today’s automation be unlikely to be different from the past on this dimension. 

••• 

In 1930, at the height of the Great Depression, John Maynard Keynes wrote, “We be 
suffering, not from the rheumatic of old age, but from the growing-pains of over-rapid 
changes, from the painfulness of readjustment between one economic period and another.” 
As many do today, he saw the speed of technological change a something formidable, 
an era of progress and invention incomparable to any that have come before—yet also a a 
time of painful transition for many. In the 1960s, a US national commission on technology, 
automation, and economic progress establish by President Lyndon B. Johnson 
conclude that, “the basic fact be that technology eliminates jobs, not work. It be the 
continuous obligation of economic policy to match increase in productive potential with 
increase in purchasing power and demand. Otherwise, the potential create by technical 
progress run to waste in idle capacity, unemployment, and deprivation.”70 The question 
for u today be whether, this time, the transition will be large and more painful than ever, 
and indeed how demand for human labor will evolve. In this chapter, we have described 
the historical evidence show that employment remains strong even in period of 
technological ferment. In the follow chapters, we look at the trend that can create 
demand for ten of million of new job in the global economy over the next decade and 
more, even a robotics and AI increasingly make their way into our daily work lives, and what 
the implication will be for sectors, occupations, skills, and wages.

While automation will displace some worker and transform occupations, we also know that 
new and additional work will be create in the next decade and beyond. What be less clear 
be how job growth net of automation will vary by occupation, and under what condition 
there will be enough new job to offset the work that be lose a robotics, artificial intelligence, 
and other technology assume a great role in the workplace. Predicting all the job that 
will exist in the future be an impossible task, yet even without a crystal ball, it be possible to 
identify some source of future labor demand. 

In this chapter, we discus two different analysis that shed light on these questions. To 
understand some of the occupation and type of job likely to be in demand in 2030, we 
model seven specific global trend that we expect will be significant driver of job creation. 
To inform the impact of automation on aggregate employment, we conduct a second 
analysis use the McKinsey Global Growth Model, which be a multi-country macroeconomic 
model. This exercise allows u to model the dynamic effect of automation on productivity, 
employment, and GDP growth in different scenarios. Automation have the potential to raise 
productivity growth and GDP growth, but our analysis reveals that a key factor in whether 
this will be achieve without large adverse effect on employment and wage be how quickly 
displace worker be reemployed in other jobs. 

Both analysis reach broadly similar conclusions: although some worker will be displace 
by automation, other occupation will grow. While in the long-term the economy can adjust 
to provide enough work for everyone, automation will prove challenge for ten of million of 
worker globally who will need to switch occupations. Depending on how society manage 
this transition, unemployment could rise in the medium-term and wage could be eroded. 
Both the impact of automation and potential new source of labor demand will play out 
differently from country to country. 

SEVEN GLOBAL TRENDS THAT WILL HELP SHAPE THE FUTURE OF WORK 
In seek to identify potential source of labor demand to 2030, we start with a long list 
of trend and then prioritize seven for deeper analysis, base on high-level initial estimate 
of their potential for job creation (see Box 3, “Our analysis of seven trend that will contribute 
to future labor demand”). While there be many scenario and source of potential labor 
demand we have not included, the seven trend we focus on in this report have the potential 
to create demand for hundred of million of worker globally in the year to 2030, albeit 
with significant variation among countries. 

For each trend, we model both the direct impact on employment and the indirect impact. 
By direct jobs, we mean employment create in a sector itself (for instance, increase 
spending on car would create direct employment in the automobile manufacturing sector). 
Indirect refers to employment create in all the sector that supply good and service to 
the direct sector (for automobiles, indirect sector would include spare parts, paint, leather, 
etc.). We do not include induced effects, since some be capture directly by our rise 
consumption trend.

from population growth until 2030.

future of work in Europe’s digital front runners, McKinsey & Company, October 2017. 

3 Ibid. Jeffrey Lin, “Technological adaptation,” May 2011. 

We examine potential labor demand create between 2016 and 2030 a a 
result of our seven trends, and compare that to the amount of work that could 
be displace by automation. Sizing methodology varies by trend; however we 
capture direct and indirect job that could be create from each of our seven 
catalysts, take into account the decline in hour work per person, and factor 
in globalization of work.1 

For each occupation and sector, our incremental labor demand net out 
automation and other productivity gains. We then compare that incremental 
labor demand with the reduction in labor demand due to automation against 
a project 2030 baseline of employment. This us the model we developed 
for our January 2017 report on automation, which also model range for the 
pace of technology development, and for automation adoption.2 

As well a calculate direct and indirect labor demand from our select trends, 
we identify key occupation that will increase, and compare those with the 
occupation in which work could decline a a result of automation. 

For three of the seven—investment in infrastructure, investment in buildings, 
and investment in renewable energy and energy efficiency—we examine 
two scenarios: a “trendline” scenario in which spending follow the observe 
trend across country and a “step-up” scenario, in which labor demand 
increase a a result of societal and policy choices. For a fourth trend, 
the increase shift to market of service that be long do without 
remuneration, we only examine a step-up scenario that assumes rise female 
participation in the workforce. 

Our analysis offer a static view of the potential labor demand that could 
be create from the seven trend and do not factor in supply-demand 
dynamic and feedback from factor such a change in wage levels. (For 
a more dynamic view, we use the McKinsey Global Growth Model, a we 
discus late in this chapter). The labor demand that our seven trend could 
generate be potential, and whether this potential be capture will depend 
on the choice and investment make by businesses, policy-makers, and 
workers. The scenario we construct do not take into account any source 
of labor demand outside of our seven trends. We do not model entirely new 
industries, occupations, and activity that could be invent in the future, in 
part enable by technology; one study suggests that on average, 0.5 percent 
of the workforce have be work in “new jobs” per year.3 We do not take into 
account sectoral shift in industry that be not directly related to automation 
or these seven trends, such a the rise of e-commerce in retail. We also do not 
model change in work structure, such a the growth of the gig economy, or 
activity within an occupation that could change a a result of technological 
innovation. A more detailed discussion of our methodology can be found in the 
technical appendix.

Rising income in emerge economy will create large-scale new labor 
demand a spending increase on consumer goods, health care, and education 
Rising GDP per caput generates high spending on consumer good and services, health 
care, and education, especially in emerge economies, and be the large driver of labor 
demand we have identify (Exhibit 14). Prior MGI research have found that rise per caput 
consumption will generate about three-quarters of global consumption growth in the period 
from 2015 to 2030, with population growth accounting for the remain 25 percent.71 The 
expand consume class in emerge economy will drive most of this increase. As 
income rise, consumer will spend disproportionally more on discretionary good and 
service such a automobiles, leisure, and accommodation and food services, but they will 
also increase their non-discretionary spending on essential such a food and clothing.72 
We estimate that this high consumer expenditure could create between about 250 million 
and 280 million new full-time equivalent jobs, net of automation, across the 46 country in 
our model. The growth due to rise income can mitigate automation’s expect toll on 
worker in retail and accommodation and food services; retail salespeople, food preparation 
workers, and waiter see some of the large boost from high consumer spending. 

While this spending will create labor demand locally in sector such a manufacturing, 
retail, accommodation and food services, a well a personal services, it will also create 
labor demand in other country that export good and service to these countries. We 
assume that a proportion of demand for tradable good such a apparel and furnish will 
continue to be serve by country rich in natural resource or with strong manufacturing or 
service sectors. For the purpose of simplify our modeling, we assume current share of 
global export to remain constant; our model assumes that a country such a Germany will 
continue to serve it 2014 share of 18.5 percent of all automotive export in 2030.73 

Higher GDP per caput be also generally correlate with high expenditure in health care 
and education. Access to health care, define a the number of care provider (such a 
physicians) per capita, could increase, especially in fast-growing emerge economy such 
a India that currently have poor access to health care. We estimate that great access to 
health-care provider alone at all levels, include physician and medical assistants, could 
increase labor demand by 26 million to 43 million job (64 percent direct job in health-care 
provision and 36 percent indirect job in other sectors).74 Demand for health-care provider 
could increase the most in develop country such a India and China with the high 
economic growth, although this may be contingent on the necessary provision of funding for 
health care by government and consumers.

category in line with observable cross-country trend lines. See the technical appendix. 
73 World Trade Organization, June 2017. 
74 Similar to consumer expenditure, the number be model around observable trend between health-care 

employment and economic growth. It be important to note that the creation of these job will depend on 
funding from governments.

In education, a with health care, economic development typically raise expenditures, 
with a rise in gross enrollment rates, particularly at secondary and tertiary levels, and fall 
student-teacher ratio a quality improves. Our analysis suggests that these continue 
improvement could create demand for up to 37 million job (78 percent direct job in the 
education sector and 22 percent indirect job in other sectors) globally by 2030, especially 
in fast-growing emerge economies. We compare gross enrollment rate and student- 
teacher ratio of student in primary education and conduct regression analysis against 
GDP per capita. Using demographic projection to estimate the number of student by 
country in 2030, we use our projection for gross enrollment rate and student-teacher 
ratio to infer the potential labor demand for teacher and support staff across each 
educational level. 

Education a a creator of labor demand be most important for country such a India, 
which have low enrollment rates, particularly at secondary and tertiary levels, high student- 
teacher ratios, and high GDP per caput growth. In other country include China, where 
demographic trend be likely to have a small impact on labor demand in primary and 
tertiary education, increase in gross enrollment rate for secondary education and 
decrease student-to-teacher ratio could imply an overall positive impact on labor demand 
in education on an aggregate level. In advanced economy with age populations, such a 
Germany and Japan, there will be limited increase in labor demand from education a the 
relative share of student in the overall population declines. However, a with health care, 
the creation of these job would depend on the allocation of sufficient funding from public, 
private, and philanthropic sectors. 

The global trend of age population will create new and additional labor 
demand for health care 
The global population be continue to rise and will likely reach 8.5 billion people by 2030.75 At 
the same time, the population in many countries, both developed and developing, be aging: 
by 2030, there will be at least 300 million more people age 65 and above than there be in 
2014.76 The age trend be particularly acute in country such a China, Germany, Italy, and 
Japan; by 2030, about 25 percent of their population will be over 65, if current fertility rate 
and immigration trend continue. This age trend be less significant in develop country 
with young population such a India and Nigeria, which be experience a demographic 
dividend, but it be also not restrict to advanced country and China. Brazil, for example, 
also have an age population.77 

As people age, their need and spending pattern change—in particular, spending on health 
care. For example, spending on hospital care for an 85-year-old American be more than five 
time high than for those 19 to 44 year old.78 We estimate that shift in demographic 
could create incremental demand for 51 million to 83 million worker globally (55 percent 
direct and 45 percent indirect), especially for health care occupation that focus on take 
care of the elderly, such a home health aides, personal care aides, nursing assistants, and 
so on.79 (As with all the estimate of incremental labor demand in this chapter, this figure be 
net of automation, which will displace work include in health care, accord to our model). 
In country with age population such a Japan or China, our model suggests that age 
and related health-care need could drive the creation of between 10 and 15 percent of net 
new labor demand.

Technology development and deployment will create additional employment 
As technology development continue apace, the technology sector be expect to keep 
grow rapidly, and this in turn will create incremental labor demand to develop and deploy 
technology. The scale of this employment will be modest, however. Today, an estimate 
2.9 million people be employ in the US high tech sector, but this be only 1.9 percent of the 
workforce. In Germany, about 2.4 percent of the workforce be in a high-tech occupation. 

Higher consumer spending on technology product and services, which typically rise 
a income increase, and large outlay by business that adopt technology to improve 
productivity and improve output a they grow, be drive the increase spending on 
software, hardware, and services. We model consumer and enterprise technology 
spending per caput with rise GDP per caput across country in 2014. Assuming that 
the correlation holds, we estimate that by 2030 technology spend could increase by 
$1.7 trillion to $2 trillion of which about 70 percent would be on information technology 
(IT) services. This include hardware/software support, outsourcing, IT consulting, 
implementation, and internal IT services.80 This increase spending on technology will 
create demand for 20 million to 46 million incremental worker (55 percent direct and 
45 percent indirect) globally, net of automation. They will be a mix of high-skill worker such 
a software engineer and electrical engineer a well a medium-skill worker include 
web developer and electronic technicians. While IT service job such a computer 
support specialist will remain largely local, demand for technology hardware and especially 
software will likely be serve by the global players, for example China, Germany, India, the 
Netherlands, and the United States. More than half of all global tech job could be create 
in these five countries. Of these, the large demand will likely land in China and India, with 
up to 13 million and six million job respectively. Both large economy be expect to go 
through significant digitization in the next decade and beyond. 

Investment in infrastructure and building can create new labor demand, 
particularly in our step-up scenario 
Infrastructure and building be two area of historic underspend that may create 
significant additional labor demand if action be take to bridge infrastructure gap and 
overcome housing shortages. We model two scenarios: one in which annual investment 
follow the observe trend across country and one in which significant additional 
investment be make to fill gap in infrastructure and real estate. 

Global infrastructure system have not kept up with demand and housing shortage persist 
in many countries. In critical area of infrastructure such a transportation, water treatment, 
and power grids, year of neglect be catch up with country around the world. MGI 
have found that, from 2016 to 2030, the world need to invest about 3.8 percent of GDP in 
economic infrastructure, or an average of $3.3 trillion per year, just to support expect 
rate of growth, with emerge economy accounting for some 60 percent of that.81 In real 
estate, a many a 330 million urban household in emerge and advanced economy live 
in substandard housing or be financially stretch by housing costs.82 

80 IT service include work outsource to company such a Accenture and Infosys, but do not include 
consumer service such a Google or Facebook.

scenario

Under our trendline scenario, in which investment in infrastructure and building continue 
to follow pattern we have observe across countries, we note that spending on both of 
these increase a country develop economically. Thus, if country be to increase their 
spending on the current trajectory a they develop, our model show that up to 53 million 
gross new job could be create by continued spending on buildings, and up to 34 million 
on infrastructure. Yet considerably more could be do than match the investment level 
of other countries. Any additional effort would consequently stimulate increase labor 
demand, especially for middle-wage job that will otherwise be particularly affected by 
automation in some advanced economies. 

In our step-up scenario, we assume that the infrastructure gap have be closed, and that 
infrastructure and building spending in 2030 be subsequently high to sustain this high 
level of infrastructure stock and investment. We use infrastructure stock average across 
country and real estate stock average in the United States a a proportion of GDP to 
estimate the infrastructure and housing investment need in 2030 to keep pace with 
project economic growth. 

This increase spending could create demand for an incremental 76 million to 134 million 
worker from add investment in building structure and 38 million to 72 million 
incremental worker from add investment in infrastructure. As with health care and 
education, the creation of those job will depend on the allocation of necessary investment 
by the private and public sector. About 30 to 40 percent of this labor demand could 
come from India, which have currently under-invested in infrastructure, be go through 
a process of large-scale urbanization, and would need to invest a significant amount to 
keep pace with an ambitious target of 6.5 percent annual growth in GDP until 2030. The 
currently unproductive nature of the construction sector in some emerge economy 
such a Nigeria and Indonesia, couple with low wage rate that may slow the adoption of 
automation technologies, contribute to the labor-intensity of this sector. China have already 
make significant investment in infrastructure over the past decade and our model show 
that it may not need a much incremental investment in 2030. Developed economy 
include the United States and Germany could also invest in building new and repair 
or re-building exist infrastructure, create additional employment opportunity in the 
construction sector, particularly for middle-wage jobs. 

Investment in renewable energy and energy efficiency 
We similarly model two scenario of labor demand for investment in new energy source 
and improve energy efficiency, depend on whether spending follow current trend or 
be accelerated. The energy landscape be shift rapidly a the cost of renewable energies, 
such a wind and solar, fall sharply. A range of new technologies, from smart electricity 
meter to Internet of Things sensor in oil rig and advanced leach technique in mines, 
be transform both the production and the consumption of resources.83 The global policy 
environment for energy have be shifting: with the conclusion of the Paris Agreement in 
December 2016, country around the world pledge to take measure that would keep the 
global temperature rise this century below two degree Celsius above pre-industrial levels.84 
The International Energy Agency estimate in 2015 that to reach this goal could take up to 
$16.5 trillion of investment by 2030, include increase the share of renewables and by 
make buildings, transportation, and technology more energy efficient. 

83 Ibid. Beyond the supercycle, McKinsey Global Institute, February 2017. 
84 While the United States have announce it will withdraw from the Paris Agreement, many other signatory 

country and even local government in the United States have say they will continue to support it and meet 
the emission reduction target that it established. 



3. Jobs gained: Scenarios for employment growth McKinsey Global Institute62 

Governments include those in India and China be already spending more heavily on 
renewable energy and climate adaptation measures. India, for instance, have announce 
it intention to increase it share of renewable power to a much a 40 percent by 2030.85 
Overall, our model indicates that move to renewable energy and raise energy 
efficiency at current trend could contribute up to seven million new job globally in 2030, 
under our trendline scenario, and an additional four million to seven million under our 
step-up scenario. (These job be incremental to the increase in employment in the power 
sector driven by GDP per caput growth, which be model in our rise income driver 
discuss above.) 

In the transition to new energy sources, we model the potential job creation a country 
shift their capacity mix for electricity generation. Making these transition will require 
significant investment in manufacturing, construction, and operation and maintenance 
of solar panels, wind turbines, and other equipment. Shifts in capacity mix create job in 
two ways. First, large amount of fix investment be need to increase the capacity 
for the grow new energy source, create job in manufacturing, construction, and 
installation. Second, job may also be create in the decrease energy source through 
decommission of fossil fuel and other generation facilities, a some country decide to 
shut down nuclear plants. Jobs associate with the ongoing operation and maintenance 
of electricity generation be largely variable with capacity, so job level here will depend on 
relative labor intensity of operation and maintenance between energy types. Renewable 
manufacturing be enjoy a remarkable period of productivity growth—across three 
lead renewables manufacturers, employee decline by 65 percent on average per 
gigawatt ship in 2010 to 2014. If these productivity gain continue at an aggressive rate, 
renewables manufacturing be likely to be a comparatively less labor-intensive part of the 
renewables value-chain. 

To attain the international goal of avoid a rise of more than two degree Celsius, the UN’s 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have calculate that CO2 concentration in the 
earth’s atmosphere need to be stabilize at 450 part per million. That will require target 
policy choices, include accelerate transition to renewables and increase spending 
on energy efficiency measures, both in industry and in housing. This in turn could have a 
significant impact on job creation. In our step-up scenario, use data from McKinsey & 
Company’s Energy Insights, we model a more ambitious shift into renewables and high 
investment in energy efficiency, which would create an additional four million to seven million 
job globally.86 High productivity and further automation potential in energy reduce the 
opportunity for energy to have a transformative impact on the job story in many countries; 
in the United States, less than 1 percent of all full-time equivalent in 2014 be in utility 
and mining. But major investment in renewable energy will be crucial to meeting global 
climate change goals, which could create middle-wage job along the way. 

“Marketization” of unpaid work could create new job 
Today, much work do in households—from childcare to cooking and cleaning—is unpaid 
and disproportionately perform by women. At least some of this work could be shift 
to paid employment through daycare or pre-kindergarten school program and senior 
care programs. Rising female labor participation rate could be one way to prompt this shift, 
which economist call “marketization”; social decision to expand government-supported 
program could be another (and those program in turn might enable high female labor 
force participation). In recent years, we have see the rise of digital “sharing economy” 
platform that enable consumer to purchase many household and personal service more 
conveniently and cheaply, include meal order online and deliver by hand, thereby 

85 Remap: Renewable energy prospect for India, International Renewable Energy Agency, May 2017. 
86 This model do not include an estimate of other issue related to climate change that could cause 

potential for incremental labor demand, such a reconstruction and carbon capture and storage. 



63Jobs lost, job gained: Workforce transition in a time of automationMcKinsey Global Institute 

increase demand. Academic research have found that such platform result in an increase 
in employment in the industry, both for traditional worker provide those service and for 
the newly self-employed worker on the platform.87 The marketization of previously unpaid 
housework be already prevalent in some advanced economies, especially in urban areas. 
For example, more than 90 percent of three-year-olds be enrol in preschool in France 
and Sweden, most of which be fund by the government. In comparison, the rate be about 
70 percent in the United States and less than 15 percent in India.88 

Shifting unpaid housework and childcare to paid employment could boost the number of 
woman in the workforce globally, if government decide to invest in these area (such a by 
provide universal preschool and paid family leave). Women currently account for half of the 
world’s working-age population but generate only 37 percent of global GDP, and in some 
region of the world—including India, other part of South Asia, the Middle East and North 
Africa—their contribution to regional output be considerably low still. At the same time, 
about 75 percent of the world’s total unpaid care be undertaken by women, include the vital 
task that keep household functioning, such a childcare, care for the elderly, cooking, 
and cleaning. This unpaid work amount to a much a $10 trillion of output per year, 
roughly equivalent to 13 percent of global GDP.89 In our analysis, we observe the average 
amount of unpaid time currently spent on childcare, adult care, cooking, and cleaning 
use time use surveys. As these unpaid activity hour move to the marketplace, we expect 
labor demand to increase for them. While productivity gain will reduce the net number of 
hour worked, we estimate that between 51 million and 89 million incremental job globally 
could be create from this step-up scenario of shift currently unpaid domestic work to 
paid employment. 

JOBS OF THE FUTURE: IMPACT OF NEW LABOR DEMAND VS. AUTOMATION 
The seven trend we select for our analysis provide u with indication about type of 
occupation that will be in demand to 2030, even net of automation of activity within those 
occupations. At the same time, our automation model highlight occupation that could 
decline, if the current activity within those occupation that be automate be not replace 
by other activities. The pattern differ among countries. One of the key differentiate factor 
be wage rates, since our model assumes that automation adoption will generally be more 
rapid in country such a Germany and Japan, with relatively high wages, than in India, 
China, or Mexico, where wage be lower. But there be also difference among emerge 
economy depend on whether population be age and the occupation mix across 
sectors, among other factors. 

Exhibit 15 show the top five occupation that will grow in the United States base on 
each of the seven trend described above before accounting for displacement due to 
automation. These be primarily direct additions, for example register nurse related 
to aging, or construction laborer and carpenter from the building out of infrastructure. 
But the list also include indirect additions, such a accountants, customer service 
representatives, and lawyers, who will see great demand a support function within the 
health-care industry feel a boost from increase spending due to aging.

Advanced economy have a similar pattern of job growth and decline 
In advanced economies, we identify six broad group of occupation that will experience 
growth in labor demand from our trends, although the size of the increase will depend on 
country and on scenario. For example, in our step-up scenario, the demand for builder and 
construction worker rise considerably (Exhibit 16). Workers in occupation in the follow 
group spend considerable time on work activity that be among the least susceptible to 
automation base on our analysis, a they require human capability include social and 
emotional interaction, higher-level logical reasoning, creativity, and application of expertise 
that machine for now be less capable of accomplishing. The occupational group that 
generally grow a a result of our drivers, even net of automation, are: 

 Care providers: that is, doctors, nurses, home health aide and others in care 
occupation who will be in great demand a a result of rise health-care spending, 
both from increase prosperity and from aging. Given the disproportionate cost of health 
care for the elderly, age be expect to be the predominant driver of increase health- 
care employment. Countries with age population such a Japan and China will see 
a sharp increase in occupation that work closely with seniors, for example nurses, 
nursing assistants, personal care aides, and home health aides. 

 Professionals, define a white-collar occupation that require academic training and 
expertise in a specific industry or functional area. These include accountants, engineers, 
and scientists. Most of these occupation cut across a wide range of sectors. While 
generally less automatable than other job types, certain support occupation such a 
paralegal and scientific technician may face high automation. 

 Technology professionals. Technology expert will be in continued demand 
everywhere a automation be increasingly adopted, although the total number remain 
quite small compare with other occupations. Occupations will include IT worker 
such a computer scientist and software developers, who typically have college 
educations, but also occupation such a web developer and electronics technicians, 
which only require a secondary education. That said, many of these latter occupation 
involve activity that be more automatable than technology worker with high level 
of education. 

 Builders. In this category we have include architects, surveyors, and cartographers, 
a well a construction occupation and maintenance and repair workers, such a 
construction laborers, electricians, carpenters, and plumbers. Even though construction 
laborer primarily do physical work, their activity be mostly in unpredictable settings, 
and hence not a highly susceptible to automation by 2030. 

 Managers and executive also cut across all sector and cannot easily be replace by 
machines, a much of their work involves interact with and manage stakeholders. 
However some of their more routine activity will be automated, such a collect 
information, analyze data, or prepare reports. 

 Educators. School teacher and others will see a significant increase in demand, 
especially in emerge economy with young population such a India. Childcare 
worker and early childhood educator will also grow under our step-up scenario in 
which more childcare be shift to paid providers. 

 “Creatives”: Rising income in emerge economy will create more demand for leisure 
and recreational activities. This in turn will create demand for artists, performers, and 
entertainers, although the total number will remain relatively small.

By contrast, our analysis suggests that, in advanced economies, other occupation will 
see a net decline by 2030, with more work automate than create by our seven trends, 
assume they do not add non-automated activities. These include: 

 Some customer interaction jobs, include hotel workers, travel agents, entertainment 
attendants, and cafeteria workers. 

 Office support jobs, include information clerks, payroll processors, and 
administrative assistants. 

 Jobs carry out in predictable settings. These be among the most susceptible 
to automation and include factory workers, material move machine operators, 
transportation workers, and installation and repair workers. 

It be important to note that even occupation that may have a net decline due to automation 
will not disappear: rather, their number could shrink from today’s level in the next 15 years. 
For instance, even though some of the current activity of food preparation and serve 
worker could be automate (for example, by order kiosk in fast food restaurants), and 
about one-fifth of their hour work could be automate under our midpoint adoption 
scenario, there could still be demand in the United States for more than three million of them. 

Developing country see net job growth in nearly all occupational group 
The picture be rather different in rapidly grow and low-income country such a India, 
where we see net job growth in nearly every occupational category. This be for two reasons: 
low wage mean delayed adoption of automation, and relatively high GDP growth creates 
job across the economy, include in predictable environment that be among the most 
affected in advanced economies. For example, production worker would rise 34 percent in 
India under our step-up scenario, compare with a 28 percent decline in the United States 
and a 56 percent drop in Japan. 

Middle-income country such a China and Mexico also have net job growth in a range 
of occupation under our scenario that in advanced economy experience declines. 
This be the case with the category of worker who be primarily engage in customer 
interaction, such a entertainment attendants, and food-service workers. These type 
of occupation will remain in high demand in emerge economy include China, a a 
result of rise consumption from an increasingly prosperous consume class. However, in 
Mexico, the potential growth be not a large a in India, reflect the low GDP growth and 
high wages. 

WILL THERE BE ENOUGH WORK IN THE FUTURE? 
The public debate in many country over automation can quickly focus on the existential 
question of whether there will be enough job for worker in a future marked by automation. 
We can see from history that such fear have so far be unfounded: over time, labor 
market have adjust to change in demand for worker from technological disruptions, 
although in some era real wage have remain depressed for some time. We address 
this question of whether there will be enough work in the future through two different but 
complementary set of analyses. The first be base on our model of new and additional labor 
demand and automation described above, use the select trend we have identified, and 
provide only a partial view. For the other analysis, we use a macroeconomic model of the 
economy that incorporates the dynamic interaction among various factors.

Both analysis point in the direction that, in most scenarios, there can be enough new job 
creation to offset the impact of automation. But a large challenge will be ensure that 
worker have the skill and support need to transition to new jobs. Countries that fail to 
enable and smooth these transition could see rise unemployment and depressed wages. 

Outcomes will vary significantly by country, depend on four factor 
We find a significant difference of likely outcome among countries, with four factor largely 
influence the extent to which enough new job will be create to offset those displace by 
automation. The four factor are: 

 Wage levels. Advanced economy will likely adopt automation in the workplace early 
and faster than emerge economy since their wage be relatively higher, make the 
business case for automation stronger. (Our model assumes that automation begin to 
be adopt only when it cost reach parity with the cost of human labor). Advanced 
economy will therefore likely see the large impact from automation in the next 
15 years. 

 Demand growth. Economic growth be essential for job creation. While it may sound 
obvious, economy that be stagnant or grow only slowly create few, if any, net new 
jobs. Countries with the most rapid GDP growth rate per caput will have high growth 
rate of consumption and spending, thus stimulate great proportional increase in 
labor demand. Slower-growing economy will create job at a slow rate. Advanced 
economy have much low project rate of GDP growth than develop countries, 
reflect age workforce and also less rapid productivity growth. Developing country 
such a India and China be project to have much high GDP per caput growth rates, 
which will contribute to job creation. Furthermore, innovation and entrepreneurship often 
underlie the creation of new business model and work activities, another catalyst of 
job growth. 

 Demographics. The outcome of automation and future labor demand will play out 
very differently in country with a young and rapidly-growing population, such a India, 
compare with country that have a shrink population and workforce, such a 
Japan. Countries with a grow workforce have a potential “demographic dividend” that 
will lift growth. However, rapid growth of the population will bring million more young 
people into the workforce, create considerable pressure to expand formal employment 
opportunities. While the impact of automation will be less, give low wage rate in 
these countries, automation will make this already considerable challenge more difficult. 
In Germany and Japan, by comparison, age be reduce the working-age population, 
which reduces the need for economic growth and the potential impact of automation. 

 Mix of economic sectors. The automation potential of national economy differs 
among country depend on the structure of their economy and, within the 
economy a a whole, on the mix of sectors, occupations, and their constituent work 
activities. Japan, for example, have a high automation potential than the United 
States because the weight of certain sector that be highly automatable, such a 
manufacturing, be high in Japan; 17 percent of job in Japan be in the manufacturing 
sector compare with 9 percent in the United States. And within the manufacturing 
sector itself, Japan be more susceptible to automation because a large proportion of the 
job involve task that can be more easily automated, such a production.

These factor combine to create different outlook for the future of work in each country. In 
general, country with similar characteristic across these four factor could see broadly 
similar outcome from automation adoption, albeit with nuance for cultural and other 
differences. Some cluster be apparent. For example, developed country with age 
population and high wage that will accelerate automation adoption—such a Germany, 
Italy, and Japan—could follow a similar trajectory, a will developed country with young 
populations, such a Canada, France, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United 
States. Across the Middle East, country such a Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and the United 
Arab Emirates share similarity on demographic and automation adoption and, to a lesser 
extent, on GDP per capita. Developing country with the young populations, include 
Egypt, Kenya, and Nigeria, will face similar challenge to grow aggregate demand, give 
their fast-growing workforce. 

Our scenario of new and additional labor demand, net of automation, while 
incomplete, suggest ample job creation to 2030 
We compare the number of job create by the seven select trend identify above with 
the number of job expect to be displace by automation. We be conscious that this 
exercise paint an incomplete picture. While our seven trend model the major source of 
new labor demand, they do not account for induced job demand creation nor the creation 
of novel work activity and occupations. One research study have found that, each year, 
roughly 0.5 percent of the US labor force be employ in an occupation that do not exist 
in the prior year—in other words, perform an entirely new set or combination of work 
activities. By 2030, this would imply that 9 percent of the US labor force could be employ 
in occupation that do not exist today.90 Just a many occupation today, such a search 
engine optimization, app designers, and website designers, would have be impossible 
to imagine in the pre-Internet era, we cannot foresee the new occupation that will arise in 
the future. 

In order to address the question, “Will there be enough work in the future?,” we compare the 
net effect of job displace by automation, job create by the seven trends, the creation 
of new work and other unsized labor demand, and demographic change in labor force 
size. Even limit our estimate of new and additional job creation to the select factor 
that we model, we find that our focus country could generate enough labor demand to 
offset the impact of automation and take into account change in the size of labor forces.91 
Nevertheless, our model from the seven trend indicates that the transition toward 2030 
look quite different depend on the country (see Exhibit 17). 

For instance, Japan be rich but project to grow slowly to 2030. It face the combination of 
slow job creation come from economic expansion and a large share of work that can be 
automate a a result of high wage and the structure of it economy. However, Japan will 
also see it workforce shrink by 2030 by four million people. In the step-up scenario, and 
consider the job in new occupation we cannot envision today, Japan’s net change in 
job could be roughly in balance.

91 Our result be broadly in line with prior research by McKinsey & Company in nine northern European digital 

“front-runner” countries. This research suggests that technology diffusion contribute 0.4 to 0.6 percentage 
points, or around 30 percent, to GDP growth between 1990 and 2016 in the nine countries. Digital technology 
replace job at a rate of about 120,000 job a year between 1999 and 2010, and boost employment by 
around 200,000 job a year, create positive net employment of 80,000 job per year. More than half of the 
new job be high-skill. Shaping the future of work in Europe’s digital front-runners, McKinsey & Company,

3. Jobs gained: Scenarios for employment growth McKinsey Global Institute72 

Like Japan, the United States and Germany also face significant workforce displacement 
from automation by 2030, but their project future growth—and hence new job creation— 
be higher. However, the United States have a grow workforce. In the step-up scenario, and 
consider new occupation that may arise, it be roughly in balance. Germany’s workforce 
will decline by three million by 2030, and it will have more than enough labor demand to 
employ all workers. 

At the other extreme be India: a fast-growing develop country with relatively modest 
potential for automation over the next 15 years, reflect low wage rates. Our analysis 
find that most occupational category be project to grow in India, reflect it strong 
economic expansion. However, India’s labor force be expect to grow by 138 million 
people by 2030, or about 30 percent. Employing these new entrant in formal sector job 
will require job creation on a much large scale than in the past. Automation will make 
this challenge more difficult; some fear “jobless growth” will make the challenge greater. 
However, our analysis suggests that India can create enough new job to offset automation 
and employ new entrants, for example by undertaking the investment in our step- 
up scenario. 

China and Mexico have high wage than India, and so be likely to see more automation. 
China still enjoys robust economic growth and will have a shrink workforce; like Germany, 
China’s problem could be a shortage of workers. Given net job creation a well a decline 
labor forces, China and Germany may need to explore different option such a accelerate 
automation adoption or immigration in order to fulfill the expect creation of grow future 
labor demand. Mexico’s rate of future economic expansion be more modest than China’s, 
and it workforce will grow by 15 million by 2030. Like the United States and Japan, our 
result suggest that Mexico may need the extra job creation from the step-up scenario plus 
innovation in new occupation to make full use of it workforce. 

Our macroeconomic model highlight the critical importance of rapid 
reemployment of worker displace by automation 
The analysis of net job creation give expect automation rate and the seven trend be an 
informative but incomplete exercise, even after adjust for labor supply change and the 
creation of new occupations. This be because the analysis above do not take into account 
dynamic interaction among the trends, such a the impact of automation investment and 
automation-related unemployment on GDP growth rate or economy-wide average wage 
rates. Thus, to develop a perspective on the potential net impact of automation and job 
creation potential of the economy, we use a general equilibrium model in order to triangulate 
our result with the analysis from the seven trend (see Box 4, “Modeling the economic 
impact of automation”). 

The overall result of the general equilibrium model be the same a the result from the seven 
trends: it show that labor market will generally be flexible enough to absorb the worker 
displace by automation. Furthermore, like the outcome of the analysis from the seven 
trends, difference arise between country in the expect transition toward 2030. The 
general equilibrium model point toward a strong distinction in the expect transition 
between the advanced economy and the emerge economy we focus on in this report. 



73Jobs lost, job gained: Workforce transition in a time of automationMcKinsey Global Institute 

In advanced economies, all scenario result in full employment by 2030, but the 
transition may include a period of high unemployment and wage adjustment 
For the three advanced economy we focus on in this report—Germany, Japan, and 
the United States—economies be flexible enough to absorb most if not all the displace 
worker by 2030 in all reemployment scenarios. The pace at which displace worker be 
reemployed be critical: low reemployment lead to high medium-term unemployment, 
while in the high reemployment scenario, the labor displace by automation will be 
reemployed fast enough such that the unemployment rate do not rise (Exhibit 18). 

Automation will also have a wage impact. Our model result in a temporary increase 
in wage in all reemployment scenario because of increase productivity a a result of 
automation. But, a with the unemployment rate, wage will also depend on the pace of 
reemployment. In the low reemployment scenarios, wage fall in the long-run in response 
to high medium-term unemployment. This lead to a low labor share of income, a 
the gain of automation in this scenario primarily accrue to capital owners, not laborers. 
Conversely, in the high reemployment scenario, wage growth be expect to persist, 
and thus the decades-long trend of decline labor share of income slows or even revers 
by 2040. 

Box 4. Modeling the economic impact of automation 

1 The structure of the model be anchor in the academic literature on economic growth models. For detail see 
Shifting tides: Global economic scenario for 2015–25, McKinsey & Company, September 2015. 

We use McKinsey & Company’s Global Growth Model to model the dynamic impact 
of automation on the economy of our six focus countries.1 This be a supply-side general 
equilibrium macroeconomic model that cover more than 100 country with data from 
1960 through 2015. 

In the model, we directly include three factor by which automation affect economic 
growth: labor displacement, result in worker lose their jobs; capital investment need 
to implement the automation technologies; and an increase in productivity growth, a firm 
employ more capital per worker. These input to the Global Growth Model be derive 
from our automation research. To calculate the impact on productivity, we estimate the 
imply productivity growth that would be need to maintain constant total output with 
few workers, under the rationale that firm would not adopt the new technology unless it 
produce at least the same level of output. In reality, this be likely to be an underestimate of 
the impact. Our experience work with firm and our prior automation research show 
that automation often result in high quality output and significantly high level of output 
a well. 

We also model how quickly displace worker be employ in new jobs, or the 
reemployment rate. Not every displace worker will enter unemployment; some will have the 
skill and the opportunity to transition quickly into a new role at the same company or with a 
new firm. Indeed, each year million of US worker leave a job and find a new one. Between 
2013 and 2015, 66 percent of displace worker in the United States found a new job by 
the end of the period; 49 percent of worker displace between 2007 and 2009, during the 
financial crisis, be reemployed by the begin of 2010. 

We model four reemployment rate scenarios—low, medium, high, and full reemployment. 
The reemployment rate model differ by country and be estimate from literature and 
adjust for labor market flexibility factors. 



3. Jobs gained: Scenarios for employment growth McKinsey Global Institute74 

In emerge economies, automation’s impact on employment be small than in 
advanced economy 
The impact of automation be lesser in China, India, and Mexico than in the advanced 
economy we focus on, accord to our simulation. First, automation rate be expect 
to be lower, lead to small percentage of displace workers, low level of capital 
investment, and small productivity increases. As such, unemployment be not expect to 
rise significantly, nor be model wage or GDP growth sensitive to the automation effect 
under any of the reemployment scenarios. 

For more detailed analysis of each of our six focus countries, see the country impact section 
start on page 91. 

••• 

Automation will displace job around the world by 2030, but in our analysis demand for 
certain type of labor—from care provider to builders—will also increase, spur by the 
rise consumer class in emerge economy and the grow health-care need of age 
population in nation from Germany and Italy to China and Japan, among other trends. Our 
dynamic model of the US and other economy suggests that enough new job will be 
create to return to full employment by 2030, but the transition could be difficult. Depending 
on the rate at which displace worker be reemployed, the unemployment rate could rise in 
the short- to medium-term, and wage may fall thereafter. Moreover, our analysis highlight 
difference between the sort of job that will be lose from automation, and those that will be 
gain from a range of trends. Even if there be enough work to go around in 2030, million 
of individual may need to find new job and possibly acquire new skills. We examine these 
trend in the next chapter.

Midcareer retrain will be a major challenge

The combination of labor displacement by automation and change demand for 
occupation that we have outline in the previous chapter will have enormous implication 
for individual workers. We estimate that 60 million to 375 million individual around the world 
may need to transition to new occupational category by 2030 , in the event of midpoint or 
early automation adoption (although that number would be negligible in 2030 in our edge- 
case slow automation adoption scenario). Nearly all job will involve a shift mix of task 
and activities. 

Within occupations, the mix of activity and the capability require will skew toward 
more personal interaction and more advanced level of cognitive capabilities. Educational 
requirement will also change: net of automation, a great share of job in the future will 
likely require high level of educational attainment. In advanced economies, that include 
increase demand for job that currently require a college degree (or other advanced 
training). At the same time, employer and worker may need to take a more fine-grained 
approach to identify skill that be the most important. 

Our result also suggest that income polarization in advanced economy include 
the United States could be exacerbated.92 We do not dynamically model how wage 
might change for individual occupation by 2030, but base on current wages, we find 
that in most advanced countries, middle-wage job may decline the most a a result of 
automation. Growing occupation in these country will tend to be either those that be less 
remunerative, for example, retail salesperson or childcare workers, or quite the opposite: 
highly paid jobs, such a software engineers. In develop economy include China, 
however, we see the opposite trend. Here the strong job growth will likely be for middle- 
wage occupations, include service and construction jobs. 

THE MIX OF ACTIVITIES WITHIN OCCUPATIONS WILL CHANGE 
For nearly all occupations, automation will change the mix of activity that human perform, 
a some task be take over by machine or software. Over time, occupational definition 
may change, a the boundary between different occupation become blurred. Already, 
physician assistant and register nurse carry out many task that doctor use to do, 
such a handle routine case or give shots. For their part, doctor now write up memo 
and enter data rather than dictate to assistants. 

With automation, such shift may become more pronounced, although the specific will 
vary by country. In Germany, worker of the future will likely spend more time on activity 
that require apply expertise (+2.9 billion full-time equivalent hours), interact with 
stakeholder (+1.5 billion hours), and manage people (+1.4 billion hours), and less time 
on predictable physical activity (-2.6 billion hours), collect data (-2.5 billion hours) and 
processing data (-2.1 billion hours), where machine already exceed human performance 
(Exhibit 19). In other words, many of the rote activity that have dominate the workplace 
in the post-industrial age will be take over by machines. Work activity will shift to human 
interaction and work in unpredictable environments—and will also require increase 
application of expertise. Similar shift will occur in other high-wage, advanced economies.

employment and earnings,” in Handbook of Labor Economics, Volume 4, Orley Ashenfelter and David E.

AND WAGES 



4. Implications for skill and wage McKinsey Global Institute78 

In India, much of the project growth in activity hour will be in physical activities, driven 
by demand for construction work, particularly in the step-up scenario. China, which 
have high level of exist infrastructure and building development, will still see some 
growth in physical activities. However, most of the growth will be in activity similar to it 
advanced-economy counterparts, such a interact with stakeholder and apply 
professional expertise. 

This shift set of activity have implication for the capability that will be need for 
future work. Exhibit 20 show how US worker will need to upgrade their mastery of the 18 
performance capability we use for our automation modeling. 

More work activity will require social and emotional skill and advanced cognitive 
capabilities, such a high-level logical reasoning—capabilities that be require today for 
only a relatively limited number of jobs. This will be a challenge for education, training, and 
skill assessment models, which for now do not always emphasize “soft skills” such a social 
and emotional reason and sensing.

Additional job will often require a high level of performance across many capabilities. For 
instance, machine will be able to perform work activity require basic level of retrieve 
information and understand natural language—but job require high level of these 
capability will grow. In advanced economies, physical capability will be less in demand 
a a percentage of the activity hour demand in the economy. In develop economy 
such a India, give the increase in demand for physical activities, demand for physical 
capability will accordingly grow a a percentage of the new activity hour demanded. 
The shift in activity and underlie capability require will touch almost all job in the 
economy, to vary degrees—but especially in advanced economies. As one example, the 
work of retail salesperson in these economy could change significantly; about 20 percent 
of their current work activity could be automate in the midpoint scenario. The rote 
aspect of the job such a processing transaction and gathering product information may 
be automated. Retail worker instead may turn their attention to the more people-focused 
side of the job: greet customer and answer questions, for example, or suggest 
new products. 

The capability shift be not limited to front-line jobs. Many worker in occupation with high 
educational requirement who spend much of their time collect and processing data 
could experience a significant shift in their work activities. Financial managers, for example, 
could spend less time monitoring cashflow or approve expenditures, and instead 
have time to focus on more managerial function such a supervise employee and 
advise others on business matters. Professionals of all stripe be quickly realize the 
grow importance of “soft skills”—although understand the implication of numerical 
calculation will continue to be important. On LinkedIn, the professional networking site, for 
example, professional be increasingly develop and marketing themselves around these 
softer skills, which be less automatable (Exhibit 21).93

This change nature of activity and capability have important implication for the 
requirement and aim of job training, which will be particularly relevant in time of transition. 
For example, a activity require basic level of performance be automate in the United 
States, training effort will need to focus on capability for which automation be more 
challenging, such a social and emotional capabilities. Increasingly across occupations, 
worker will be value for strong interpersonal skill and advanced reasoning. As these 
skill be often developed through guide experience, worker will likely spend more time 
be coached in apprentice-like environments. The worker of the future will still need to 
apply expertise and judgment, so training to promote fluency with and understand of 
information will remain important. 

GROWING JOB CATEGORIES HAVE HIGHER EDUCATIONAL REQUIREMENTS 
THAN THE WORK DISPLACED BY AUTOMATION 
Across our six focus countries, a great share of job in the future—accounting for both the 
effect from automation and the additional labor demand from the seven trends—are likely 
to demand increase level of education (Exhibit 22).94 

Defining and measure the skill require to perform well in any job be a difficult and 
imprecise task. In our modeling, we look at several different measure of workforce skills. 
First, we consider the formal educational requirement of each occupation: secondary 
school degree, Associate’s, Bachelor’s, and graduate degrees. Educational requirement 
by occupation be fairly well standardize globally and allow for cross-country comparisons. 
However, even within an occupation, there will be a range of degree that exist worker 
have obtained; we focus on the educational level that be typically required.95 We also look 
at how activity within occupation will change, which give some indication of the type 
of skill that will be more or less in demand, and we consider the capability require to 
perform those activities—such a cognitive skills, creativity, social and emotional skills. 
Other definition of skill and credential be equally valid and important, but be beyond 
the scope of this report. Many practitioner and researcher today focus on unbundling 
traditional degree into well-defined credential that can be obtain by demonstrate 
mastery of specific skills. This be particularly attractive for midcareer worker who cannot 
afford to spend year earn a traditional degree, or who have accumulate valuable 
experience on the job. Some credential be for quite narrow skills: program in a certain 
computer language, or master one specific type of mechanical expertise.96 

94 We do not model change skill requirement for occupations, and assume that educational requirement for 
an occupation in all country be the same a in the United States. See technical appendix for details. 

95 Economists note the general trend of “degree inflation.” For instance, in the United States, while 80 percent of 
job opening for executive assistant list a bachelor’s degree a a requirement, few than half of exist EAs

83Jobs lost, job gained: Workforce transition in a time of automationMcKinsey Global Institute 

In advanced economies, demand for work currently require completion of 
secondary school or less will likely decline 
In advanced economies, our model show a common pattern of educational requirements. 
Occupations that currently require only completion of secondary school or less, include 
job such a office clerks, hand packer and packagers, and tellers, be most likely to be 
affected by automation and have a net reduction in labor demand, base on the factor we 
have model (Exhibit 23). 

Not all job in these category will disappear, but in 2030, demand for the activity they 
currently perform will be low in all of our model scenarios. In contrast, occupation 
require a college or graduate degree will see the most growth a a percentage of job 
in the economy. Occupations that require training on top of a traditional post-secondary 
degree (for example, career, technical, vocational training) or two-year associates’ degree

have a mixed outlook. As a share of job in the economies, country such a Japan will 
see increase demand for associates’ and equivalent degrees, primarily from middle-skill 
health-care occupation such a nurse and paramedics. Meanwhile, country such a 
Germany will see decrease demand, primarily because of a great share of automatable 
office support job such a clerk and secretaries. 

The relative growth of job require high educational attainment be not a new 
observation.97 Nor be the increase of skill requirement necessarily a break from historical 
trend: the manufacturing revolution saw increase need for literacy training that spawn 
movement toward secondary education include the High School Movement in the United 
States, which we discus in the next chapter. 

However, many of the middle-income job of the past that require only a secondary 
education or less, and minimal training, will likely face significant displacement in an 
automate world. These job include heavy truck driver and office clerks, both of which 
have high technical potential for automation over our model time horizon, and whose 
current middle-level wage raise the economic incentive to deploy automation. Many 
additional job require low and middle level of educational attainment could be created, 
driven particularly by the care economy, such a the rise of nurse and nursing assistants. 
However, for many job that require no or only secondary education, the additional future 
labor demand will not fully make up for the job displace by automation. This would mean 
that many displace worker would need to retrain and/or raise their educational level to 
gain employment in one of the in-demand occupations. 

The seven trend we model alone suggest that overall new demand for work currently 
require a college degree could be sufficient to balance the reduction in demand 
for work activity lose to automation in occupation require college completion, in 
the United States, a well a in Germany (where the net model demand for these 
occupation increases). 

However, that do not obviate the need for college and advanced degree holder to 
retrain, a their activity will change. Some will switch to job that require a similar level 
of educational attainment, but very different skills. The come wave of technology 
deployment, bolster by advance in machine learn and artificial intelligence, have 
significant potential to automate work activity previously thought to be the exclusive 
domain of highly-trained humans. In the midpoint automation scenario, 13 percent of the 
current work activity perform in occupation that require college or advanced degree 
in the United States could be displaced. Even within a give field, certain occupation will 
fare good than others. In the United States, for example, the high-skill job of application 
software developer have large net additional demand (we model nearly ten time a many 
job create a displaced). Meanwhile certain technology support job include computer 
system administrator and support specialist may see a cool of demand, because 
a substantial portion of their current activity have relatively high technical automation 
potential. Similarly, in US financial services, the varied skill require of management 
analyst could see high demand, while financial manager and security sale agent 
could face substantial automation of their current work activity with limited source of 
new demand. 

97 For example, MIT economist David Autor have credit the trend to productivity boost from information 
technology that magnifies the productive power of cognitive functions, which be often central to higher-skill 
work. Ibid. David H. Autor, “Why be there still so many jobs?” summer 2015. In the United States, about two- 
third of job from Baby Boom retirement require more than a secondary school education. Jamie Merisotis, 
America need talent: Attracting, educating, and deploy the 21st century workforce, Rosetta Books, 2015; 
see also, Anthony Carnevale et al., “Good job that pay without a BA,” Georgetown University Center on 
Education and the Workforce, 2017. 



85Jobs lost, job gained: Workforce transition in a time of automationMcKinsey Global Institute 

Workers displace by automation may need to invest time to acquire new skills, either 
through formal education or other training programs. Conversely, job themselves may 
need to be redesign to accommodate an influx of new worker with less sector-specific 
training and overall education. The transition could be varied and lead to friction in the 
labor market and potentially high unemployment in the short-run. But other step could 
be take to make market function better. For example, define job requirements, a well 
a provide training and certification, base on specific skills, could improve the match 
of labor supply and demand, a these skill can be much more fine-grained than traditional 
educational degrees, and can often be acquire in less time than finish a multi-year 
degree program. 

While some worker who be displace by automation will be able to find a job in a similar 
function and with similar educational requirement (for example, a displace cashier find 
a new job a a retail salesperson), many will not, and will need to gain additional skills, which 
may or may not actually raise their educational level. This be discuss in a subsequent 
section of this chapter. 

Additional job creation in our step-up scenario could help mitigate some of the impact of 
automation, with additional investment in infrastructure, buildings, and energy transition 
potentially create new work for worker with low and mid-level educational attainment. In 
all, in the United States, we estimate additional demand for mid-skill labor of up to 1 million 
jobs, net of automation, in the step-up scenario. Demand for occupation require post- 
secondary education also increase in the step-up scenario. Engineers and cost estimator 
will be brought in to develop infrastructure projects, for example, and various professionals, 
from accountant to research analysts, will also see increase demand. 

In develop countries, the large number of new job will be those require 
secondary education or technical skill 
In emerge economies, the rate of job growth be high for occupation that require a 
college degree or more, but the absolute amount of job growth be high for occupation 
with a secondary education diploma. 

In China, for instance, occupation currently require college and advanced degree will 
see increase demand—in the case of those with college degrees, this could be a high 
a 22 million additional net job under our step-up scenario. However, the large absolute 
number of job created—almost 60 million in the step-up scenario—currently require only 
a secondary school diploma, with significant increase demand for retail salespeople, 
nursing assistants, childcare worker and others accord to our analysis. Despite the 
dual threat of automation (particularly for manufacturing, which make up about 19 percent 
of employment in China) and other increase productivity, significant demand will be 
create for lower-skill work, primarily due to rise prosperity. Also, job with low educational 
attainment requirement in these country be generally low wage, and be thus less 
economically attractive to automate. 

India, meanwhile, will see the large new demand net of automation for worker with a 
secondary education. According to our analysis, a many a 100 million new job could 
be create for Indians with secondary education—even after accounting for the effect of 
automation—as rise prosperity will create a surge of new labor demand for construction, 
retail, and health care and education jobs, among others. The large country in the 
develop world, in short, should not have a shortage of labor demand across any 
education level, but the significant increase in work require completion of secondary 
education indicates a need for India to upgrade it school system.98 

98 In 2011, only 40 percent of Indian adolescent attend secondary school (Grades 9-12), compare to more 
than 95 percent who attend primary school. The World Bank, Education in India, September 20, 2011.

TENS OF MILLIONS OF INDIVIDUALS GLOBALLY WILL NEED TO SWITCH 
OCCUPATIONAL CATEGORIES, AND MAY REQUIRE TRAINING TO DO SO 
Our finding shed some light on the potential size of the worker transition that will be 
necessary in the year to 2030—and the immense training effort that will be necessary 
a the nature of some work changes. We estimate that up to 75 million worker may have 
to switch occupational category and/or educational level in the midpoint automation 
scenario (Exhibit 24).99 If automation technology be developed and adopt sooner, 
those number grow rapidly; in the early automation adoption scenario that we analyze, 
a many a 375 million people may need to change occupational category and/or 
educational levels. However, our step-up scenario reduce our estimate of the number 
of people need to make these type of transitions, with additional labor demand trend 
offset more job displacement from automation within occupational categories. Not 
show on the exhibit, in the slowest automation scenario, the number of require transition 
be significantly reduce (almost negligible in most countries).

Some of these people who be displace will seek new education and many will need new 
skills. People will also need to learn new skill within their occupation a activity change, 
particularly where those activity be augment by automation. As a point of calibration, 
in our rise income trend, we project that between 190 million and 205 million student 
will be in tertiary education in 2030.100 In the fast automation scenario that we model, 
the number of people that will need to transition between 2016 and 2030 be almost double 
that number. 

These transition could surface friction in the labor market, for reason range from low 
wage to cultural and gender bias, but also present new opportunity for work and job 
growth. For example, men could find opportunity to retrain into job in which woman have 
dominate in some countries, such a nursing in the United States, and vice versa.101 

WAGE POLARIZATION MAY CONTINUE IN SOME ADVANCED ECONOMIES 
Middle-wage job have felt the impact of automation in the past decade in the United 
States, create a polarization phenomenon. Modeling the potential impact of automation, 
we find that this polarization could continue and become exacerbate in advanced 
economies—but not universally. Indeed, one of our finding be that the potential wage impact 
of automation and future labor demand could vary considerably among countries. We also 
find that any polarization of wage be not due solely to skill gaps; some of the additional 
demand for middle-skill job be in those that be currently paid low wage in country such 
a the United States. 

In advanced economies, high-wage occupation see the most growth net 
of automation 
Academic literature examine the recent impact of technology on wage have found that 
a distinct pattern of “hollowing” or a decline in middle-skill and middle-wage job with 
growth in high- and low-wage occupation (see Box 5, “Our prior research on income and 
equality trends”).102 

Our analysis be base on current average wage for each occupation in each country. 
Modeling wage over time by occupation base on the dynamic of labor supply and 
demand be outside the scope of this study, beyond the top-down analysis of wage impact 
that we described in the previous chapter. Nonetheless, our examination of job growth at 
different current wage level offer some indication of what the future may hold. 

In the United States and Germany, in our trendline labor demand and midpoint automation 
scenarios, occupation in the top 30 percent of average current wage experience net job 
growth by 2030 (Exhibit 25). This hold for the United States even in the model step- 
up scenario; in the step-up scenario for Germany, rise need for job such a nursing 
assistant be expect to increase demand for middle-wage jobs. The large decline be in 
job in the middle of the wage distribution. Occupations in the low 30 percent of wage 
decline, but this reflect the net impact of modest growth in low-wage occupation such 
a retail salespeople, and decline occupation such a hand packers/packagers and 
cafeteria cooks. 

100 Based on analysis conduct with World Bank tertiary education data. 
101 Our analysis suggests that future labor demand on an aggregate basis will not have a gender bias. Automation 

overall will affect job that be traditionally male-dominated, a in manufacturing, but also job that be 
traditionally female-dominated, such a food service or accommodation. New job with a traditional male 
bias such a construction work will be created, a will job such a nurse that have traditionally be 
dominate by women.

2 Poorer than their parents? Flat or fall income in advanced economies, McKinsey Global Institute, July 2016. 

The trend we identify in this report for both low- and 
middle-wage job and high-wage, high-skill job overlap 
with some of the structural shift in the labor market in the 
past few decade that we have examine in prior reports. 
Among our findings: 

“Superstar” effect and the hollow of the middle. 
Digitization have already affected the occupational and skill 
mix of the US workforce. Since the 1980s, employment 
in both low-skill and high-skill job have increased, while 
middle-skill job have declined. With many routine 
production and assembly task be automated, most 
of the growth at the low-skill end of the spectrum have 
be in occupation such a restaurant workers, home 
health-care aides, security guards, maintenance workers, 
and other role that provide in-person service that be 
less susceptible to automation. At the same time, idea- 
intensive sector have be capture a large share of 
the overall corporate profit pool. There be now a premium 
on creative and cognitive task that improves overall 
productivity of highly skilled workers. The result be an 
increasingly two-tiered labor market.1 

Flat and fall income in advanced economies. 
With only occasional exceptions, most income group in 
advanced economy have experienced steady income 
advancement since World War II, but that change 
abruptly in the past decade. Between 2005 and 2014, our 
research found that about two-thirds of income group 
have either flat or fall market income (wages and 
capital), although in some country include the United 
States government tax and transfer cushion the 
blow for disposable income. While economic recession 
and slow recovery after the global financial crisis be 
a primary cause, other long-run factors—including a 
decline in the wage share of GDP, aging, and shrink 
household size—will continue to weigh on income in the 
future. The decline in wage share have take place despite 
rise productivity, suggest that productivity and 
income have become disconnected. The distribution 
of this wage share among different income segment 
have also be uneven: since 1993, household in the 
uppermost income segment in the country we look 
at receive a grow share of the total wages, even a 
the share for low- and middle-income segment have 
either stagnate or fallen.2

In the United States, the pattern of polarization be clearer if we look at the net job growth by 
wage decile (Exhibit 26). The top two decile experience significant new demand for labor 
net of automation, primarily driven by an increase in demand for high-skill professionals, 
include technology and medical professionals. The effect of age and, in the step-up 
scenario, professionalization of unpaid work also create growth at the low end of the 
wage spectrum, around the 20th percentile. This be driven by growth in nursing assistants, 
teach assistants, and personal care aides, among others. 

In our model, the step-up scenario involve increase spending on such area a 
infrastructure, real estate, and energy transition can help create more growth in middle- 
wage (as well a low-wage) jobs. For example, in the United States, increase infrastructure 
and real estate spending can create additional demand for labor in construction, skilled 
craftspeople, and technical production jobs, which be middle-wage jobs. The increase 
professionalization of unpaid service would also add job for middle-wage work in 
country like Germany through increase demand for nursing assistant and childcare 
workers. These type of job could help produce some of the additional labor demand to 
offset activity that could be automated, in particular, provide demand for middle-wage 
job in advanced economies.

4. Implications for skill and wage McKinsey Global Institute90 

In develop countries, middle-wage occupation could experience 
strong growth 
The potential wage trend picture be quite different in emerge economies. In India, 
occupation at all wage level be boost by demand from rise prosperity, while the 
economy will largely be shield from automation because of low wages. In China, our 
scenario show that middle-wage job will rise similarly. Across both countries, the main 
occupation that be drive this growth in middle-wage job involve customer interaction. 
Job growth be particularly pronounce for cashier and retail salespeople, which be 
middle-wage job in these markets. While in the developed world many of these job may 
be automated, in India and China, wage be low enough that automation rate will likely 
be constrain in the 2030 timeframe (modeled at under 10 percent). The story be a positive 
one for wage advancement and the development of the middle class: in India, for example, 
if farmworkers (with annual salary of $1,752) find themselves out of a job because of 
productivity improvements, many new and more highly-paid service job will sprout up in 
host (average wage of $2,204), and for retail salesperson ($4,101). 

In these develop countries, the challenge will be to continue to create more high-wage 
work opportunity for high-skill workers, and move a great proportion of worker into 
high wage jobs. While India will have high demand for high-wage work, this type of work 
in China be more susceptible to automation compare with other develop countries, 
accord to our model, primarily because of high wage rates. Computer support 
specialist and law clerks, two high-wage occupations, have an automation potential in the 
midpoint adoption scenario of 34 percent and 35 percent, respectively. Overall, then, while 
develop country may have less to worry about when it come to create labor demand 
to offset the effect of automation in the near term, policy maker and business leader may 
want to focus on the creation of more gainful and desirable employment.103 

••• 

Work will change in the next decade and beyond, with significant implication both for 
skill requirement and wages. While our research suggests that these trend will play out 
differently among countries, some commonality be apparent. One be that educational 
requirement and performance capabilities, include for soft skill such a social 
and emotional reasoning, will become ever more important. In advanced economy 
include the United States, middle-wage worker could continue to see a shrink 
pool of opportunity a automation outpaces new job creation. As many a 375 million 
individual around the world will need to switch occupational categories. Providing retrain 
opportunity at scale will be imperative. What should the policy priority be in this change 
workplace? In the follow chapter, we look at how the transition brought about by 
automation can best be managed.

Special feature cover RHS 

In the follow section, we highlight scenario for 
the future of work in our six focus countries: China, 
Germany, India, Japan, Mexico, and the United States. 
The chart show a range of possible outcome for 
job displace by automation adoption to 2030 and 
scenario for future job that could be create by 
seven catalyst of labor demand, a well a by new 
occupation that could arise. For the automation of 
work, we consider scenario base on the speed of 
adoption of automation technologies. For potential 
labor demand, we model a trendline scenario base 
mainly on past experience, and a step-up scenario that 
considers, among other things, increase investment 
in infrastructure, buildings, and energy efficiency that 
country may choose to make. Based on the net 
impact of automation versus future labor demand 
growth by occupation, we estimate the number of 
worker who may need to change occupational 

categories, and the possible implication for 
educational attainment and wages. 

These chart should not be take a forecast or 
predictions. Rather, they illustrate a range of possible 
outcomes. The scenario we ass in this report 
may overstate or understate the actual impact of 
automation on work and future labor demand. For 
example, if automation adoption be more rapid than 
even our early adoption scenario, this could 
mean that more work would be automate than we 
estimate. On the other hand, automation might boost 
productivity growth more than we have modeled, and 
this could lead to strong aggregate demand growth 
and more job creation across the economy than we 
have modeled. Box E2 on page 21 discus the 
many factor that could change our result for any 
individual country.

5. MANAGING THE WORKFORCE 
TRANSITIONS 

Brace yourself. All country will face large-scale workforce transition over the next 15 year 
a automation displaces some worker and labor demand shifts. Enabling and smooth 
these transition will be a significant challenge for policy maker and business leaders. 
Some policy choice could substantially improve the employment outcomes, include 
speed reemployment. Indeed, it may take a Marshall Plan-scale initiative of sustain 
investment by the public and private sector in new training model and workforce transition 
program to address all the social, political, and economic issue that automation will raise. 

In this chapter, we discus four priority that could make a critical difference: maintain 
robust economic growth to support job creation; scale up workforce retrain and 
skill development programs, particularly for midcareer workers; improve labor market 
dynamism; and provide income and transition support to displace workers. We 
explore some of the choice that could be consider and cite example of successful 
interventions. These idea should not be take a exhaustive or prescriptive, but rather a 
prompt to spur discussion and new ideas. Specific choice will vary base on country 
circumstance and societal choices. 

MAINTAINING ROBUST ECONOMIC GROWTH AND INNOVATION TO SUPPORT 
JOB CREATION 
The start point be an economic one: sustain robust aggregate demand growth be 
essential for enable employment growth. Economies that be not expand do not create 
new jobs. Indeed, the experience of the past decade have underscored the linger negative 
employment effect of insufficient demand. 

Appropriate fiscal and monetary policy can be deployed to ensure that demand 
growth be vibrant, and it go beyond the scope of this report to catalog the appropriate 
macroeconomic policies. Nonetheless, the importance of sustain demand growth 
cannot be overemphasized. Much have also be write about potential way to encourage 
innovation and entrepreneurship, from investment in research and development 
and human capital, to investment capital, and lower barrier to entry for innovative 
businesses.104 Supporting innovation and technological diffusion be critical, include the 
adoption of automation technology themselves, a these advance be the fundamental 
source of long-run productivity, growth, and prosperity, a well a the creation of new 
business models, occupations, and work activities. To do so will require an effective and 
balance system for encourage the development and deployment of intellectual property, 
a high-skill scientific and engineering workforce, and public or private funding for basic 
research and it commercialization. New business creation, start-up communities, and 
dynamic firm entry and exit be also essential.105 For small city that lack a diversified 
economy and where the principal employer leaves, more holistic economic revival plan 
be needed.106 

104 See, for instance, Brad Feld, Startup communities: Building an entrepreneurial ecosystem in your city, Wiley, 
October 2012 and Enrico Moretti, The new geography of jobs, Mariner Books, March 2013. 

105 See Making it in America, McKinsey Global Institute, June 2017. 
106 See Amy Goldstein, Janesville: An American story, Simon & Schuster, 2017. 



5. Managing the workforce transition McKinsey Global Institute106 

Actions can be take not only at the national level, but also locally. MGI study of city 
around the world, along with a grow body of academic research, illustrate the vast 
difference in economic growth and prosperity that arise among city and region of the 
same country.107 The last 20 year of globalization and technological change have result 
in many community in the United States and Europe suffer large-scale job losses—but 
some of these community have also show that revive growth through knowledge- 
base economy be possible. A common pattern emerges: harness intellectual capital, 
often found in universities, with private sector R&D and local government willing to ensure 
workforce training to meet the new demand.108 

Many policymakers, in both advanced and develop country such a India, worry 
about “jobless growth.”109 Since the 2008 global financial crisis, it have become clear that 
not all source of GDP growth have an equal impact on employment creation. Growth in 
industry that be heavily capital-intensive or those that be highly automate will not have 
the same impact on job creation. To support broad-based job creation, some country may 
provide incentive to labor-intensive service sectors, such a health care, education, and 
construction. Targeted initiative may also be used. Catalyzing public and private investment 
for infrastructure, include the housing and commercial building need in urbanize 
country in the develop world, not only support long-term economic growth but also 
have the potential to create large-scale employment in the near-term. Supporting measure 
to shift energy to renewable sources, manage and mitigate climate change, and boost 
energy efficiency through increase digitization of the sector likewise have global economic 
benefit while boost near-term employment. The step-up scenario we outline in Chapter 
3 reflect the potential impact of these type of “no-regret” initiatives; we estimate that 
roughly 150 million to 300 million job could be create incrementally on top of the trendline 
scenario job a a result. Importantly, these initiative create many middle-skill jobs, such a 
those for electricians, carpenters, crane operators, and other trades. 

In prior research, we examine the critical role of migration and gender parity, both of which 
amount to low-cost way to boost aggregate demand in the short- and medium-term. For 
example, a much a 70 percent of population growth in urban area go forward could 
come from migration—with key challenge on how migrant can be integrate effectively.110 

SCALING UP JOB RETRAINING AND WORKFORCE SKILL DEVELOPMENT 
Providing job retrain and enable individual to learn marketable new skill throughout 
their lifetime will be a central challenge for some country over the next decade and 
beyond. As we have show in this report, hundred of million of people will likely need to 
find new job a automation advances, and even more will need to learn new skills, include 
how to work seamlessly with machines. 

In recent years, some country have experienced significant challenge in try to create 
the condition in which worker displace by globalization and technology quickly find 
new high-quality employment. The result for many individual have be a series of lower- 
wage job with limited opportunity for advancement and low rate of labor market

participation.111 The social consequence can be dire.112 The challenge for the next decade 
will be to create effective workforce retrain program at scale. This could require action 
by policy makers, business leaders, and educators, a well a individuals. 

History offer example of large-scale program to improve the skill 
of worker 
At a time when million of individual will need new skills, public funding for job training 
program be fall in many country (Exhibit 27).113 Between 1993 and 2015, spending on 
workforce training program a a percent of GDP fell from 0.08 percent to 0.03 percent in 
the United States, while Japanese spending drop from 0.03 percent to 0.01 percent. In 
Germany—still one of the large spenders—outlays for training fell from 0.57 percent of GDP 
to 0.2 percent. 

Nonetheless, we can find example of societies, past and present, which have chosen 
to invest in education and workforce training, with impressive results. The United States 
provide example of two at-scale investment in the past century: the US High School 
Movement (1910 to 1940), which make attend secondary school the norm for all children, 
and the 1944 GI Bill, which enable million of return war veteran to obtain a tertiary 
education (see Box 6, “The US High School Movement and the GI Bill dramatically raise 
educational attainment of American workers”). Academic researcher have found that the 
sizable human capital increase enable by these program account for a measurable 
share of the rise in income over those decades, create a large and increasingly affluent 
American middle class.114 

More recently, Singapore implement an innovative form of support aim at upgrade 
skill a part of it effort to promote growth and competitiveness in 23 industries.115 
Through the “SkillsFuture Initiative,” introduce by the Ministry of Education in January 
2016, the government provide all Singaporeans age 25 and above credit of about $400, 
to pay for approve work-skills related courses. More than 18,000 such course be 
available, and a of December 2016, more than 120,000 people—some 4 percent of the 
resident population age 25 and above—had use the initiative to take courses, more than 
60 percent of them over 40.116 

Businesses can play a significant role in training and retrain worker 
Companies also have a significant role to play in training and retrain workers. This go 
beyond a purely social role or sense of civic responsibility: business leader will be on the 
front line of automation and will have the early and most detailed knowledge about what 
type of skill they will need a they move to adopt the technologies. In the United States, 
some company be work directly with education provider to give employee an 
opportunity to raise their educational and skill level (see Box 7, “Some US company be 
work with educational providers, even a spending on corporate training declines”).

The US High School Movement (1910 to 1940) propel 
a sharp increase in high school enrollment and graduation 
rates, make a high school qualification the norm.1 

In 1910, most student left education after primary school 
to work in agriculture or other low-skill jobs. Those who 
attend high school do so primarily to gain entrance to 
college. However, the economy have begin produce 
large number of job in city that demand a formal 
education beyond primary school. This demand lead to a 
grassroots movement: more high school be built and 
the curriculum shift from teach skill “for college” 
to skill “for life.” Vocational (including commercial), 
technical or manual, and industrial course be rapidly 
incorporate into most high school curricula. 

Secondary school enrollment increase spectacularly, 
from 18 percent in 1910 to 73 percent in 1940. Graduation 
rate for 17-year-olds rise from 9 percent to 51 percent in 
the same period (Exhibit 28). 

Higher educational attainment have an impact on 
incomes. On an aggregate level, national income per 
worker grow annually at a 1.48 percent average from 1929 
to 1982. One study attribute 28 percent of the economic 
growth to human capital accumulation and technological 

progress, with change at the secondary school level 
be quantitatively the most significant driver to the 
increase educational stock of Americans in the first 
three-quarters of the 20th century.2 

The GI Bill of 1944, create to help integrate World War II 
veteran back into civilian life, be instrumental in make 
a college education mainstream.3 Studies estimate 
that 1.4 million people-years of undergraduate training 
have be lose because of the war.4 The bill provide 
all veteran dedicate payment of tuition and living 
expense to attend high school, college, or vocational 
or technical school. By 1956, just under eight million 
veteran have use the GI Bill educational benefits, with 
2.2 million attend college or university and an 
additional 5.6 million engage in some kind of training 
program.5 In all, just over half of all veteran tapped the 
education benefit in some form, greatly exceed the 
government’s projections.6 Veterans account for a 
many a 49 percent of all enrol student at college 
and universities—and create demand for growth of a 
world-class university system.7 

The GI Bill also change perception about college 
attendance, make it accessible to the average person 
and not simply reserve for an elite.

Commission. See Rana Foroohar, “US workforce: pay young Americans to learn the right skills,” Financial Times, June 15, 2017. 

Spending on corporate training in the United States have 
be decline for decades, along with public spending 
on workforce training (Exhibit 29).1 

Against that background, some employer have begin 
offering educational assistance and program to their 
workforce to fill current gap in skill need or in 
response to a loom number of retirees. For example, 
AT&T have partner with Georgia Tech to provide 
opportunity for all employee to enroll in the university’s 
online computer science program, which AT&T help 
set up. AT&T’s move be aim at bridging a skill 
gap: internal projection suggest that 95 percent of 
the 135,000 employee in it technology and service 
unit would need training in STEM subjects—science, 
technology, engineering, and mathematics—whereas 
only 50 percent have such training in 2013.2 AT&T offer 
scholarship to all employee to attend classes, pay 
tuition, and enables employee who do not go to a brick- 
and-mortar university to improve their technical skills. In 
2014, about 18 percent of the 1,268 student enrol in 
Georgia Tech’s computer science master’s program be 
AT&T employees.3 

Walmart, the world’s large private-sector employer with 
a global workforce of nearly 2.5 million, be conduct 
training and retrain of it US employee in-house, 
through it Walmart Academy. This be one of the large 
employer training program in the United States. The 
company expect to train more than 225,000 associate 
by the end of 2017, use both experiential, on-the-floor 
training and traditional classroom instruction.4 

Other company offer broader educational assistance 
for employee to attain any degree, whether it be link to 
the company or not. For instance, Starbucks have enter 
a partnership with Arizona State University that provide 
an opportunity for all eligible employee to earn their 
bachelor’s degree with full tuition coverage all the way 
to graduation through ASU’s online degree program.5 
Amazon, through it Career Choice program, reimburses 
95 percent of tuition, fees, and material of it hourly 
associate with a little a one continuous year of tenure 
for a wide array of accredit degree programs.6 

Some employer be work together with educator 
to train young worker for job in high-growth area 
include technology, health care, and customer service.7

Traditionally, educational degrees—especially in the field of science, technology, 
engineering, and mathematics (STEM)—have act a a signal of talent for job hiring. 
Lacking other marker of skills, many employee focus on whether candidate have 
multi-year, expensive degrees. As the workplace evolves, however, more granular and 
varied definition of skill be emerge a critically important markers, more so even than a 
college education in some cases. This focus on an individual’s skill rather than educational 
credential be gain momentum with companies, state governments, and nonprofit 
organizations. Markle Foundation, for example, have begin an initiative in Colorado to foster 
skills-oriented hiring, training, and education. Among company support it, Microsoft 
have announce a grant of more than $25 million to support the program, know a Skillful.117 

One intensive approach to corporate training program merges on-the-job training with 
formal education through apprenticeships. These program exist in many countries, 
although participation and graduation rate vary (Exhibit 30).

Apprenticeships primarily benefit youth newly enter the workforce. Germany’s “dual- 
system” apprenticeship program combine work- and school-based learn be the 
best known, and prepares student for a successful transition to full-time employment. 
Beginning in secondary school, student choose a vocational or a college-preparation 
track. Traditionally, this allocation be do through student test scores, but today there be 
more flexibility. Vocational student spend part of their time attend high school, learn 
the basic curriculum, and part of their time work and earn at an employer. The system 
offer qualification in a broad spectrum of profession and adapts to the change need of 
the labor market. 

A major strength of the dual system be the high degree of engagement and ownership on 
the part of employers, although a web of check and balance at the national and local 
level ensures that the short-term need of employer do not distort broader educational 
and economic goals.118 The system have produce impressive results: about one-third of 
German student be educate in the apprenticeship system, which be a widely respect 
career path. 

Like Germany, Switzerland also have a robust apprenticeship pipeline—indeed, nearly 
70 percent of Swiss high-school student choose vocational training. In this track, student 
rotate between school and workplace settings, and receive a salary throughout their 
training.119 Some study show that student in Switzerland who opt into vocational training 
over general education on average attain high lifetime earnings.120 

Germany’s apprenticeship system be be emulate by other countries. For instance, 
German auto manufacturer in the United States now offer apprenticeship (although the 
program remains small). South Korea have adopt the apprenticeship model at scale (see 
Box 8, “South Korea’s Meister school apprenticeship system”).

Box 8. South Korea’s Meister school apprenticeship system 

1 Ministry of Education, South Korea. 

South Korea have one of the high university enrollment rate in the world, but 
unemployment rate for graduate have be high, even a small- and medium-sized 
business cannot fill opening for manual and other jobs. The government study the 
German and Swiss apprenticeship system and transform a subset of exist vocational 
school into “Meister” ones. (Meister be German for a skilled craftsman.) Students graduate 
with the equivalent of two years’ work and/or community college experience. To provide 
incentives, the Korean government pay the students’ tuition, room, and board. 

The program be still relatively young, but already bearing fruit: Meister school have 
produce significantly high employment rate among their graduates, more than 
90 percent, compare with less than 65 percent for college graduates. College enrollment 
rate have fall in favor of vocational qualification a a result.1

Educators have a role to play in adjust school curriculum for the 
automation age 
While automation will be a major challenge to worker already in jobs, it also will have 
implication for how future generation of worker be trained, involve adjustment to 
school curriculum and education system more broadly. Curricula will need to adapt to 
provide student with the skill necessary for a dynamic, technology- and increasingly 
service-oriented labor market, particularly in country and industry where automation 
technology be likely to be adopt most quickly. Several change will be required. 

First, demand will increase for worker to develop and deploy technology, or interpret and 
act on the data analytics that these technology can produce, yet there may not be enough 
worker with the skill to meet this demand, for instance, for data scientists.121 STEM 
subject will be crucial for the workforce. Early education in subject such a statistics, to 
help student understand an increasingly data-driven world, where experiment be a key 
source of insight, will be vital. Some country include Estonia and the United Kingdom 
have introduce computer cod into primary and secondary education. Coding class 
in these country start a early a age five or seven, with an introduction to necessary 
fundamental concept (such a gain an understand of algorithms) and cod skill 
such a logic and the creation and debug of simple computer programs.122 However, 
a strong liberal art education to go alongside the high tech workplace skill could also be 
require for the “new collar” job of the future.123 

Our analysis have show that an increase percentage of activity that worker will do in 
the future will be in category such a manage and lead other people and interact 
with others, which require skill such a social and emotional sense and reasoning, and 
apply creativity and collaborative problem-solving. These skill be often not part of the 
formal curriculum in traditional school programs. Another find from our research be that 
automation and other factors, include globalization, independent work, and company 
cross sector boundaries, will require all worker to change what they do over time. This 
put a premium on a set of meta-skills, around agility, flexibility, grit, and learn how to 
learn. Teaching such quality be a challenge for all educational systems. 

Third, educational institution will need to adapt to the evolve demand of the labor market 
to ensure that critical job skill be be taught. Unless they become more responsive 
to labor market demands, educator risk create an ever-larger disconnect between 
education and employment. This disconnect be already visible in some surveys. In a 
McKinsey survey in 2012, only 50 percent of youth say they believe their post-secondary 
study improve their employment opportunities, and only 43 percent of employer 
report be able to find enough skilled workers. Moreover, 39 percent of employer say 
a skill shortage be a lead reason for entry-level vacancies. However, a big majority of 
education provider (72 percent) say they believe new graduate be ready to work.124

Richard Wilson, “Computer program will soon reach all Estonian schoolchildren,” Ubuntu Life, May 4, 
2014; Computing programme of study. Key stage 1 and 2, UK Department of Education, September 2013. 
It be also important to note that the aim of introduce cod into early education be not to teach specific 
computer languages, which change constantly in their popularity, but rather computational thinking.

Several measure can reduce or correct disconnect among education providers, 
employers, and students. Providing actionable data be one. Students need to know that 
curriculum will provide them with relevant knowledge and work skills, and be able to select the 
best course and institution to achieve their desire educational outcome. In one survey, 
less than 50 percent of student say they have a solid understand of which discipline 
lead to profession with good job opening and wage levels.125 

Finally, the digital age itself have brought a multitude of possibility for new way of learning, 
both within the educational system and outside. Digital learn resource be more flexible 
in term of their timing and content than traditional classroom training, and program can 
adjust content for individual student to optimize their learn outcomes. For individuals, 
online degree can be more advantageous from a cost perspective than degree from 
traditional college and universities, particularly in the United States where tuition cost be 
rise faster than overall inflation. Some massive open online course (MOOCs) be free and 
have help expand access to educational content for those outside traditional educational 
institutions. At Coursera, for example, half of student be from develop countries, and 
about 60 to 70 percent of user be employ but prepare for good jobs, while 15 percent 
be unemployed. Most be between age 22 and 45.126 MOOCs present a promising 
channel for at-scale distribution of educational content at low cost and have potential to help 
ease future workforce transitions. However, their educational impact at scale remains to 
be seen.127 

IMPROVING LABOR MARKET DYNAMISM 
Workers in country with more fluid labor market find work more quickly and obtain job 
that be a good fit; this will blunt potential increase in unemployment a automation be 
adopted. For now, there be significant information asymmetry in the workforce, with poor 
job matching: company struggle to find the people they need, and people cannot find the 
opportunity for which they be best qualified. Both policy change and new digital tool 
can help address this challenge. 

Labor market fluidity have be decline within advanced economy 
In advanced economies, there be evidence that labor market be become less dynamic, 
with few people switch jobs.128 One strike example be the United States, which have 
experienced a decline in job reallocation rate since the early 1980s (Exhibit 31).129 The 
root cause of this decline be not fully understood, but include an age workforce that 
be less likely to change jobs, decline rate of new business formation, low geographic 
mobility (see next section), and increase regulations, licensing, and more intense 
training requirement that have make it harder to join some professions.130 Removing 
overly burdensome occupational licensing and restrictions, ensure that benefit be not 
lose in move from one employer to another, and ease the process and financing for 
entrepreneur to start new firm and for exist firm to innovate be all part of the solution.

Improving geographic mobility can enhance labor market fluidity 
While our analysis do not look at the intra-country geography of job loss and job growth, 
it be clear that increase the geographic mobility of the workforce will aid the transition. 
Yet labor mobility have decline steadily in many advanced economies.131 In the United 
States, geographic mobility have decline since the 1980s (both within and between states), 
reverse the increase mobility that be a characteristic of the US labor market early in the 
20th century.132 Whereas about 3 percent of worker relocate across state line each year 
prior to 1990, that figure have steadily fall to closer to 1.5 percent today, suggest that 
geographic labor mobility halve within less than 30 years. In Europe, despite the ambition 
of create free movement of people, mobility across border be still complicated, especially 
for services, in which regulate the cross-border post of worker remains subject to 
political disagreement and different labor market regulations. In the European Union, 
overall, about 17 million people, or 3 percent of the population, have take advantage of the 
free movement possibility to live in a different EU country, although the annual flow be one 
tenth of that, about 0.3 percent of the population.133 

Improving geographic mobility may require regulatory change a well a incentives. One 
major obstacle to internal mobility be the cost and availability of housing. Academic literature 
have show that residential mobility be positively correlate with worker reallocation rate and 
the efficiency of job matching.134 Lack of information on job opportunity in other areas, 
family ties, and different job licensing requirement be also deterrents, a be legal hurdle 
such a land-use laws, different eligibility standard for public benefits, state and local tax 
regimes, and even basic property law rules.135

urbanize and industrialize.

International mobility be a controversial topic in some political arenas, but the skill 
mismatch we have identify a a consequence of automation and new labor demand 
will not stop at national borders. Our research on global migration have found that the 
world’s 247 million cross-border migrant contribute 9.4 percent of global GDP, or roughly 
$6.7 trillion worldwide in 2015—more than $3 trillion above their contribution have they 
remain in their home countries.136 More than 90 percent of these cross-border migrant 
move voluntarily, usually for economic reasons, while refugee and asylum seeker who 
tend to attract the most public attention make up the remainder. 

Digital platform can make labor market more transparent and improve 
job match 
Digital platform offer an efficient way to improve the information available to individual 
about job opportunities, and to company about job candidates. By improve information 
signals, job platform such a LinkedIn, Indeed.com, and Monster.com can speed and 
improve the process of match individual to jobs, thereby foster fluidity. These 
platform allow individual to post their entire resume and showcase their work, display a 
rich set of credential and skill other than simply their educational record. But transparency 
cut both ways: other platforms, such a Glassdoor.com, enable prospective employee to 
find out more about their potential employers, include salary information and anonymous 
review by current employees. MGI have estimate that up to 540 million individual could 
potentially benefit from online talent platforms, with a many a 230 million shorten 
search time between jobs, reduce the duration of unemployment. Up to 60 million people 
could find work that more closely suit their skill or preferences, and an additional 50 million 
could shift from informal to formal employment.137 

Companies can benefit from use digital technology to transform recruiting, training, 
and manage talent a well. Companies that adopt these tool be discover that better- 
inform decision about human capital produce good business results. On average, our 
analysis find that company could see a 275 basis point increase in their profit margins.138 
In addition, talent platform could improve signal about the skill that be actually in 
demand. As this information shape decision about education and training, the supply of 
skill in the economy could adjust more quickly and accurately over time. 

Creating more flexible work option may enhance reemployment of 
displace worker 
The workplace be changing, with the rise of more flexible form of independent work, 
include independent contractors, freelancers, self-employed individuals, and people 
work in the “gig” or “sharing” economy. MGI find that 20 to 30 percent of the work 
age population in Europe and the United States already earn income through independent 
work—and that 70 percent of those say they do so out of preference, not because they 
cannot find a traditional job. Moreover, the number of people choose to work outside 
traditional job may rise.139 Digital platform such a Upwork, Freelancer.com, HourlyNerd, 
Uber, Lyft, TaskRabbit, eBay, and Airbnb offer vast new market and low the barrier to 
entry, thereby remove some of the risk for those who want to be their own boss. 

Independent work may offer solution a well a new challenges. Among the benefits, it can 
enable many people currently not employ to work in flexible way that suit their needs. 
It be particularly attractive for care-givers, retirees, students, and others who need flexible 
schedules. For the unemployed, independent work may provide a critical bridge to keep 
earn income while seek employment. But a independent work grows, question

surround benefits, income security measure and other worker protection become 
more prominent and need to be addressed. Key policy recommendation of the United 
Kingdom’s Taylor Review in July 2017, for instance, include recommendation to expand 
the definition of “worker,” extend minimum wage standards, and ensure that benefit such 
a holiday and sick pay cover independent workers.140 

PROVIDING TRANSITION AND INCOME SUPPORT TO WORKERS 
Job loss cause economic stress, a well a physical, emotional, and psychological 
distress. A wide body of academic research have found correlation between extend 
unemployment and decline in physical and mental health. Studies have even show poorer 
academic outcome among the child of the long-term unemployed.141 Other research 
have document the stagnation in market incomes, and increase wage polarization, 
in many developed markets.142 Both policy maker and business leader have a role to 
play in support worker a they transition between job to avoid long-term negative 
consequence and to ensure that they receive adequate incomes. 

Actively support worker in job transition 
A range of measure can speed the transition of worker between jobs, beyond improve 
labor market dynamism, job matching, and retrain and skill development. Most country 
have labor agency focus on provide assistance to the unemployed. In many, the focus 
be mainly on doling out benefit and reduce fraud. Germany provide an example of a 
nation that overhaul it labor force system—and reduce high unemployment a a result. 
In 2003, when the country be still struggle with the legacy of reunification, it adopt the 
“Hartz reforms,” base on recommendation of a labor market commission. The lower- 
wage segment of the labor market be liberalized, and a new category of job be create 
with employer pay a low flat rate for employees, who work a limited number of hour per 
week, exempt from social security and tax contributions. 

The move create million of “mini-jobs,” whose wage be then supplement by welfare 
payments. In addition, the local labor market agency be restructured. Case worker 
be assign to every unemployed individual, with strong incentive to successfully place 
their client into jobs. Skills assessment be performed, and training be provide if needed. 
These reform help reduce the unemployment rate from 10 percent in 2003 to below 
4 percent today and, at the same time, increase Germany’s share of the working-age 
population in employment by 10 percentage points. While these reform have return 
more individual to work, there be controversy over the impact on the post-unemployment 
earnings of workers.143 

To ensure that worker develop the skill need for the work world of the future, 
the German labor agency be now planning to put a great emphasis on counseling. It be 
currently pilot innovative online and offline counsel service direct at students, the 
unemployed, but also employee in job which be massively impact by digitization. The 
hope be that good individual orientation about job market trend and future opportunity 
will smooth the transition to a digital economy, without a large net loss of job and 
correspond increase in unemployment.

In Denmark, employer and government work with union to maintain the country’s 
“flexicurity system,” which combine active labor market policy with flexible rule for 
hire and fire and high level of benefit for unemployed individual (up to 90 percent for 
the low paid workers). They also offer active job counseling, include career guidance, 
training or education to all unemployed individuals, and offer all worker access to 
numerous vocational training programs. This creates a labor market environment of flexible 
employment and job security. Notably, firm and union get together to identify skill needs, 
agree on wage and enshrine right to paid leave for training. Some study suggest that 
similar collaborative effort between employer and union can play an important role in 
raise skill levels, include in the United States, and be already do so in some cases.144 

Neighboring Sweden have a system for retrain midcareer worker through private sector 
“job-security councils.” Employers pay into these councils, which provide financial support 
and job counsel to laid-off workers, with the aim of help them get back to work a 
soon a possible. Personal counselor help worker with their resume and steer them into 
class in their field or other fields.145 

Supporting worker income may also be necessary 
Our research indicates that million of individual will likely need to transition to new 
occupations—and identifies the risk that wage may become stagnant or even decline for 
middle and lower-skill occupation that have a large supply of potential worker but might 
have reduce demand, particularly in developed economies. Supporting income in both 
case may have an economic rationale. Consider that in 1914, Henry Ford announce that 
he would begin pay his employee $5 per day, more than twice the average wage for 
automakers, and reduce the work day from nine hour to eight, at a time when the 60-hour 
work week be the standard in American manufacturing. He explain that “unless an 
industry can so manage itself a to keep wage high and price low, it destroys itself, for 
otherwise it limit the number of it customers. One’s own employee ought to be one’s own 
best customers.”146 

Two form of income support need consideration in the age of automation. First be 
payment such a unemployment insurance to provide income to worker during training 
or transition between jobs. Yet unfortunately, the amount of public resource devote to 
support worker transitions—including on unemployment benefits—has be decline 
in most country (Exhibit 32). Given the large workforce transition we see in the decade 
ahead, re-evaluating this trend could be necessary.

math, and communication skills. Thomas A. Kochan, David Finegold, and Paul Osterman, “Who can fix the

5. Managing the workforce transition McKinsey Global Institute120 

In addition, however, wage may be under pressure in a wide range of job a economy 
transition to new form of work. A range of option exists for address these income 
effects. Some employer can choose to pay high wage and good benefits, recognize 
the value that their worker be producing. In addition to societal responsibility, these 
company may be motivate by competition for talent and an interest in reduce employee 
turnover. In the United States some company have unilaterally raise minimum wage they 
pay.147 In Europe, company have traditionally paid more attention to stakeholder such a 
workers, in part because of unionization and regulatory choices; in Germany, for example, 
worker representative sit on corporate board under 1976 “codetermination” legislation 
and play an important role in shape wage and benefit policies, a well a overall corporate 
strategy. There be also policy option for provide income support to worker to ensure 
that they remain active consumers. Minimum wage be widely deployed throughout the 
world, and there be move to raise them, include in US city such a Seattle.148 While 
some study have show that increase minimum wage can raise employment, the issue 
be actively debated. Other form of income support, such a “earned income tax credits” 
and wage subsidies, provide incentive for people to work. These measure attempt to 
provide income support without discourage people from working. Pilot project be 
underway in a number of country to test the idea of pay a universal basic income (see 
Box 9, “Experimenting with universal basic income”). 

In recent decades, the long-standing correlation between rise productivity and wage 
growth have broken down in some countries, such a the United States. The cause of this 
shift be unclear. But policy maker be consider new way to ensure that wage be 
link to rise productivity, so that prosperity be share with all. Some have suggest 
that minimum wage should be indexed to measure of productivity. In another specific 
example, Singapore have a program that support corporate investment in productivity 
on condition company share the gain from productivity improvement with low-wage 
workers.149 Between 2010, when the program be launched, and 2013, more than 800 
project be launched, most of them by small and medium-sized enterprises, which will 
benefit 53,000 worker once completed. Their wage increase be more than 10 percentage 
point above the national average. 

••• 

In the new era of automation, government and business will need to undertake a 
balance act between embrace the technology, which will boost productivity and 
economic growth, and at the same time address the complex transition it will create. 
Ensuring robust demand growth and economic dynamism be a priority: history show that 
economy that be not expand do not generate job growth. Upgrading workforce skill 
and create opportunity for midcareer job retrain will also be essential, at a time when 
spending on these have be decline in most countries, and labor market will need to 
become more dynamic and adaptable to change work need and pattern of worker 
redeployment. A final priority be reassess and strengthen transition and income 
support for worker caught in the cross-currents of automation. Each of these priority 
on it own present a challenge, and all together may require a Marshall Plan-like initiative, 
involve clear focus and investment. In the conclude chapter, we examine the implication 
for policy makers, business leaders, and individual workers.

Box 9. Experimenting with universal basic income 

1 Basic income a a policy option: Can it add up? OECD, May 2017. 

Universal basic income (UBI) consists of give a periodic 
cash payment to all individual without a mean test or 
work requirement, to cover basic living costs. Some see it 
a a policy to address the challenge of a jobless future in 
which automation have result in mass unemployment. 

Advocates say the assurance of a minimum standard of 
well-being encourages people to switch job and take 
more entrepreneurial risks, and support consumption 
for those in low-paying work. Others point to the high 
cost and difficulty in give cash transfers, particularly 
in develop countries. The potential cost be high, 
particularly in developed markets. An OECD study found 
that large tax revenue increase would be need in most 

country to finance a basic income at meaningful levels.1 
Opponents say that there be no assurance that these 
payment would lead to increase in innovation and that 
UBI could undermine productivity by discourage work. 
Other argument question the assumption of planning for 
mass unemployment rather than attempt to enable the 
mass redeployment of labor. 

A number of pilot of UBI have be conduct or be 
now underway around the world that may shed light 
on the impact that this program have on incentives, 
work, and welfare (Exhibit 33) in develop and 
developed countries.

Automation will be a powerful motor of future economic growth, but the challenge it 
present for workforce transition be sure to be very substantial. Policy makers, business 
leaders, and individual worker will need to be flexible, creative, and even visionary a they 
look to harness these rapidly-emerging technology and ensure that the time of automation 
be a productive and prosperous one. A range of outcome be possible, from one in which 
economic growth and productivity grow strongly, create myriad new jobs, a automation 
be adopt rapidly, to one marked by slow automation adoption, weak economic growth and 
low net job growth. 

Faced with the scale of worker transition we have described, one reaction could be to try 
to slow the pace and scope of adoption in an attempt to preserve a much of the status quo 
a possible. But this would be a mistake. Although slow adoption might limit the scale 
of workforce transitions, it would curtail the contribution that these technology make 
to business dynamism and economic growth. Automation technology and in particular 
artificial intelligence be the key to find solution for many important societal challenge in 
field range from climate science to health care. We should embrace these technologies, 
but also address the workforce transition and challenge they bring. To do this, there be 
a number of imperative and priority for governments, business, and individuals. In this 
conclude chapter, we highlight a number of them. 

GOVERNMENTS MUST MAKE WORKFORCE TRANSITIONS AND JOB 
CREATION A MORE URGENT PRIORITY 
Managing the come workforce transition with foresight be not just a question of smart 
policy. Automation’s power to lift the productivity of national economy have the potential to 
accelerate productivity and economic growth and improve lives. Governments can support 
the development and deployment of these technologies, for example through investment 
in basic and apply research, a well a through building out digital infrastructure. Ensuring 
positive employment outcome will require a laser focus on retool the workforce, 
step up support for worker in transition, and improve how local and national labor 
market function. Societies can choose to transform the come labor market disruption 
into an opportunity rather than a pitfall. 

As daunt a the task may seem, history show u that governments, across the globe, 
when face with monumental challenges, can rise to the occasion for the well-being of their 
citizens. As we have seen, the US High School Movement and GI Bill be instrumental in 
raise the education of the US workforce and country such a Germany have show that 
revamp labor market agency and support for worker in transition be not only possible 
but can also dramatically reduce unemployment. Such example highlight the importance 
of execute target policy decision swiftly and clearly. 

Yet in the last few decades, investment and policy to support the workforce have eroded, 
not be enhanced. Public spending on labor force training and support have fall in most 
countries. Educational model have not fundamentally change in 100 years; we still use 
system design for an industrial society to prepare student for a more dynamic, rapidly- 
change knowledge economy. Unions be on the decline. Government data collection 
on the grow independent workforce and new way of work be fragmented. It be now 
critical to reverse these trends. A new “Marshall Plan” for the workforce be needed. Priorities 
include the four area for action discuss at length in Chapter 5, but also the following: 

6. PRIORITIES FOR GOVERNMENT, 
BUSINESS, AND INDIVIDUALS 



6. Priorities for government, business, and individual McKinsey Global Institute124 

 Radically scale midcareer training opportunity to make lifelong learn a reality. 
Lifelong learn have long be talk about reverentially in policy circles, but the new 
age of automation will be the time when large-scale application of it will be need more 
than ever. Flexibility and adaptability will be the new workforce mantras, a machine 
both replace some human activity and—probably more frequently—fundamentally 
change them. Recent example of effective large-scale retrain of midcareer worker 
be few and far apart. For the future, more short-term and target training for people will 
be needed, especially for those in midcareer who will be look to develop new skill 
even if they keep their jobs. 

 Modernize educational system for the 21st century. Our analysis of the 
performance capability most in demand in the new age of automation show the 
critical importance of technology skills, but also of teamwork, creativity, communication, 
and social and emotional skills. Schools in many country continue to adhere to 
a culture of education that remains root in 19th century notion of teach and 
learning. Governments and educator can use digital technology to change that, for 
example create more individual learn path for students. Several country include 
Germany and Switzerland continue to show that apprenticeship can be a powerful and 
successful approach to teach technical skills. While university education have grown 
in popularity and lose it elitist reputation in many countries, many tertiary educational 
institution have not focus sufficiently on the need of the labor market or of the 
graduate enter it. Publishing job placement of graduate and similar data could 
help both employer look for recruit and potential student try to decide on their 
course of study. Singapore have show through it SkillsFuture Initiative that individual 
can be support and motivate to continuously acquire new skills. Finally, government 
could encourage, identify, and co-finance innovative pilot program that address know 
skill gap among workers, post-secondary students, and youth—and then scale the 
one that work. 

 Expand transition support measure for workers. Denmark, Germany, and Sweden, 
among others, have show the importance of focus labor agency on reemployment 
and the acquisition of new skills, rather than simply on hand out unemployment 
benefit or control for fraud. Best practice require a cultural shift of sorts, one that 
nudge worker to take a more active role in their own retrain and provide tool for 
them to be successful. Mobility can be an important part of that transition process, and 
in the United States, at least, it be long prized. However, mobility within border have 
slow in advanced country include the United States, and mobility across border 
face new hurdle globally a country revisit immigration policy and practices. 
Reducing the barrier to mobility—which include legal one alongside prohibitive 
housing costs—will need to be a policy priority. And government should not lose sight 
of the cardinal importance of increase economic mobility and opportunity for all 
citizens. That mean universal access to quality education, good neighborhoods, and 
basic healthcare. 

 Create income support measure consistent with the new wage realities. 
Since 1970, market wage and productivity growth have diverge in some advanced 
economy include the United States, and income inequality have grown. With the 
advent of the new automation age, it be important to begin national discussion on 
whether we can assume that everyone who work can support a decent standard 
of living. A healthy consumer class be essential for both economic growth and social 
stability. Income supplementation program already exist in certain countries, such 
a the earn income tax credit in the United States, and some country be test 
universal basic income program or raise minimum wages; more could follow suit, to 
provide fact-based finding that can inform the debate. 



125Jobs lost, job gained: Workforce transition in a time of automationMcKinsey Global Institute 

 Make job creation and worker re-deployment a national priority. A broad range 
of incentive exists for business to invest in capital and research and development. 
Something similar be need to encourage investment in human capital. In addition, 
government could ass the impact on job creation of their policy and investments, 
much a they currently ass the impact of policy on the environment. Companies 
could be encourage to invest in worker training and redeployment through tax and 
other incentives, just a they often be for their research and development investments; 
in some countries, that will mean reconsider tax code that provide subsidy 
(through interest) for investment in capital while tax labor. The step-up scenario 
in this report show the value in job-creation term of raise public—and, with it, 
private—investment in infrastructure, affordable housing, and energy efficiency and 
climate change. Such investment will need to go hand-in-hand with other backing for 
job creation, include support entrepreneurship and small business creation by 
streamline regulation and revisit personal bankruptcy law that discourage risk- 
taking, for example. 

 Modernize data collection on the labor market. Government survey of household 
and employer be the gold standard of national economic data. But these be time- 
consuming. In today’s dynamically change world, government need to supplement 
these survey with real-time data on the adoption of automation technologies, 
job openings, labor market dynamism, skill in demand, and how individual be 
cop with job transitions.150 The need for good data amount to an opportunity for 
government statistic agency to collaborate with online source of data, include 
job boards, professional site such a LinkedIn, and private tech companies, to obtain 
a more detailed and accurate picture of jobs, skills, wages, and individual mobility and 
career moves. 

BUSINESS LEADERS SHOULD EMBRACE AUTOMATION AND AI WHILE 
CAREFULLY MANAGING WORKFORCE TRANSITIONS 
Business leader also have much to gain by early adoption of automation technologies, 
enable performance benefit such a quality and speed, a well a great efficiency and 
productive use of all factor of production. But business will also be on the front line of 
the workplace a it changes. Successful adoption of automation will require company 
to re-imagine their entire business process to take advantage of automation’s benefits, 
rather than mechanically attempt to automate individual activity use current 
processes. As part of that review, they will need to reevaluate their talent strategy and 
workforce needs, consider how worker can be redeployed to other jobs, and where 
new talent may be required. Many company be find that it be in their self-interest— 
a well a important for societal responsibility—to train and prepare worker for a new 
world of work. Some company be already work with external education provider or 
conduct in-house training—but many more could follow suit. 

 Accelerate deployment of automation and AI. For CEOs in all industry and 
countries, develop an automation and AI strategy should be a priority. So far, few firm 
have deployed at scale. In an MGI survey of 3,000 AI-aware C-level executives, across 
10 country and 14 sectors, only 20 percent say they use any AI related technology 
in a core part of their businesses. Many firm say they be uncertain of the business 
case or return on investment. A review of more than 160 use case show that AI 
be deployed commercially in only 12 percent of cases.151 But company that ignore 
these technology do so at their peril: the gap in performance between early adopter

of digital technology in general and AI in particular be widening. In the MGI survey, 
early AI adopter have high profit margins. Our case study in retail, electric utilities, 
manufacturing, health care, and education highlight automation and AI’s potential to 
improve forecasting and sourcing, optimize and automate operations, develop target 
marketing and pricing, and enhance the customer experience. 

 Redesign business process to unlock productivity gains. Since the IT 
revolution begin in the 1990s it have be clear that capture the value from new 
technology require reimagining how the business operates, rather than mechanically 
apply automation to the current mix of activity and processes. Capturing the full 
opportunity offer by automation will require company to conduct a thorough review 
of business process and workflow and ass where automation could improve 
performance the most. That in turn require company to develop or acquire the talent, 
discipline, and know-how to implement the sort of change that will be need to 
harness the full potential of automation. 

 Rethink organizational design. Automation adoption be a process that will not happen 
overnight, and the workplace norm for year to come will be people work alongside 
machines. This have profound implication for the way company and their workforce be 
structure and organized. Until recently, for example, powerful manufacturing robot that 
can lift or weld have be kept well away from humans, often in cages, because of the 
risk of accidents. But today’s robot can work intelligently and safely alongside humans. 
Such machine-human and machine-machine environment will become more pervasive, 
and that in turn will require workflow to change. Successfully rethink organizational 
design will ensure that work be not only more productive and take advantage of the new 
technical possibility available, but that it will become more meaningful and reward 
for people, a the rote aspect of their job be take over by machines, free them 
to use more innate human quality include social and emotional reason and 
personal interaction. 

 Build core digital and analytics capabilities. Companies that successfully adopt the 
late automation and AI technology typically already have strong digital capabilities. 
Indeed, our analysis show that company that be early adopter of AI be also 
digital leaders. There be no shortcut to create a strong digital base. Companies will 
need to build the support digital assets, big data and analytics capability to make 
automation and AI a success. This include building the data ecosystem and adopt 
the right advanced analytic technique and tools.152 

 Adapt talent strategy and manage workforce transitions. Business leader will 
need to ensure that the talent their company require to transition to more automate 
operation be in place. This will involve a combination of recruiting automation-savvy 
professionals, a well a retrain worker to play new roles. Determining the right mix 
of current talent, redeployed talent, and new talent from outside the company will require 
careful consideration. In the new era, STEM talent and data scientist will be increasingly 
important—and could provide a last competitive advantage. But fill new technical 
position be expensive and time-consuming because we have not be turn out 
enough skilled professional to keep up with the demand. In the United States, for 
instance, data scientist shortage be already appearing.153 

152 See The age of analytics, McKinsey Global Institute, December 2016. 
153 Ibid. 



127Jobs lost, job gained: Workforce transition in a time of automationMcKinsey Global Institute 

 Consider partnership for talent development. Some company be turn to 
partnership to develop the skill need in their workforce and help smooth transitions. 
As we note in Chapter 5, some company have begin to establish partnership with 
university and other educational institution to provide training and skill development 
in their workforces. This enables large-scale retraining, without create the staff and 
overhead to manage it internally. Such partnership may become more common a 
company adopt automation at scale. In the future, a technical talent shortage 
increase, corporate partnership with university and college may become more 
frequent a company seek to develop a reliable pipeline of scarce technical talent. 
In other sectors, such a health care and manufacturing, there be many example of 
company partner with local community college to shape and create the curriculum 
for specific degree programs. Similar collaboration might increase the availability of 
data scientist and other technology-related professionals. 

INDIVIDUALS MUST PREPARE FOR LIFELONG LEARNING AND 
EVOLVING CAREERS 
Individuals will need to be prepared for a rapidly evolve future of work. Acquiring new skill 
that be in demand and reset intuition about the world of work will be critical for well- 
being. Workers everywhere will need to reexamine traditional notion of where they work, 
how they work, and what talent and capability they bring to that work. 

 Embrace a “startup of you” mentality. In the rapidly change future of work, 
individual will be in charge of their own destiny more than ever. The day of planning 
to have one employer for life be long gone. All individual will need to adopt a more 
entrepreneurial approach to navigate through the world of work and manage their 
careers. Reid Hoffman, a co-founder of LinkedIn, call it the “startup of you” approach.154 
Individuals will become more proficient and comfortable with navigate a more digital 
job search and manage their personal profiles. 

 Acquire the skill that will be in demand and embark on a journey of lifelong 
learning. As machine perform a wider range and variety of tasks, individual will need 
to put more focus on develop the skill that human excel at. As we have described 
in this report, the activity in nearly all occupation will change, with more time spent 
on those activity that require social and emotional skills, team work and collaboration, 
creativity, and high level of communication and logical reasoning. Both government 
and business have a role to play in provide individual with good information on the 
skill and job in demand. Educators play a part a well. Secondary school student in 
most country receive inadequate instruction and guidance on how to plan a career in 
today’s workplace, and even less so for a workplace that be rapidly evolving. Ultimately it 
will be up to individual themselves to think carefully about what skill will be need and 
how they can demonstrate those skill to employers. 

 Prepare for a world of digital job search. Digital platform for match people with 
job and assess skill be rapidly become the norm for hiring.155 Individuals will 
need to use these technology if they be to be competitive in the job market. In the 
short term, this mean put time and care into building a personal online presence. 
To stand out, they will need to showcase their experience, establish expertise by join 
group or post content, and build their professional networks. Workers could also 
benefit from understand and participate in the innovation around skills-based 
training and credential that could accelerate their career trajectories. Individuals without 
formal education credential may be able to differentiate themselves through their online 
reputation via recommendation from former customer or employers.

155 Ibid. A labor market that works, McKinsey Global Institute, June 2015. 



6. Priorities for government, business, and individual McKinsey Global Institute128 

 Consider new way of working. Not only do most people now cycle through multiple 
employer throughout their careers, but many be move beyond the traditional full- 
time (or part-time) job altogether. As many a 30 percent of worker in the United States 
and Europe earn part or most of their income through independent work—that is, 
freelance activities, self-employment, or through rapidly expand digital gig or share 
platforms.156 More than 70 percent of those individual say that they prefer independent 
work and they report high satisfaction with many aspect of their work-life than people 
with traditional jobs, include not only flexibility, but also opportunity for advancement, 
creativity and variety in their work, and even more security in their income. Roughly half 
of independent worker supplement their income from traditional job (or pensions) with 
these activities. In a world where wage be depressed for people without the skill in 
demand, independent work offer an opportunity to enhance income and branch out 
into new areas. 

Ultimately, automation may force u all to reassess basic notion of work. In capitalist 
economies, individual earn most of their income through apply their labor; except for 
the disabled, all of u be born with an endowment of labor from which to earn income, but 
only a privileged few be born with capital. In many decade hence, the value of this labor 
may be diminish if we reach a state in which machine can do a large share of the work. 
For worker around the world, policy makers, and business leaders—and not just social 
scientist who specialize in socio-economic paradigms—that should give pause for thought, 
and be a spur for action. 

••• 

Automation represent both hope and challenge. The global economy need the boost to 
productivity and growth that it will bring, especially at a time when age population be 
act a a drag on GDP growth. For companies, the technology can lift productivity and 
profit to new heights. For society a a whole, machine can take on work that be routine, 
dangerous, or dirty, and may allow u all to use our intrinsically human talent more fully and 
enjoy more leisure. Yet even a we benefit, our society will need to prepare for complex 
transition ahead, a machine replace worker in many areas. Our research suggests that 
it may be time to refocus the current anxious debate about automation toward issue of 
demand growth, and how to manage the inevitable transition create by automation. The 
task at hand be to prepare for a more automate future by emphasize the skill that will be 
need and ensure dynamic job creation. The technology be advance rapidly; the policy 
choice should not tarry.

1. WORK HOURS THAT COULD BE AUTOMATED 
This report continue and adapts the methodology and finding of the January 2017 
McKinsey Global Institute report, A future that works: Automation, employment and 
productivity. A full methodology of that work be detailed in it technical appendix; we will 
provide only a brief summary here and how it be apply in this report. 

In that report, the technical potential for automation of the global economy and project 
adoption rate be determine by an analysis of the underlie work activity for each 
occupation, cover 46 countries. It us database publish by institution include 
the World Bank and the US Bureau of Labor Statistics 2014 O*Net database to break down 
about 800 occupation into more than 2,000 activities, and determines the performance 
capability need for each activity base on the way human currently perform them. 
The report further break down activity into 18 capability and ass their technical 
automation potential. This framework be inform by academic research, internal expertise, 
and industry experts. Our report focus on 2016–30, and thus take the automation 
adoption percentage through 2030. Much of the occupational data, at the time of original 
analysis, be harmonize through 2014. We adopt the simplification of refer to 2016 
a the start point of the analysis, and project in 2014 data (such a occupational mix) 
into 2016 baseline (for example, automation adoption percentages). 

In this report, we use these finding to size the number of job that could be automate 
by 2030. We make an assumption that each hour of work that could be automate will 
result in proportional job loss, for example if 10 percent of current work activity hour in an 
occupation will be automated, then 10 percent of job in that occupation will be displaced. A 
priori, it be unclear if this assumption be conservative or aggressive. Based on what we have 
see historically, we expect in many case that the result of activity be automate will 
be a redistribution of effort on other exist or new activities. However, it be also possible 
that with automation, exist work process could be radically overhaul and reduce 
in complexity, reduce labor demand even further beyond automation potential of current 
activities. We have not model these countervail effects.

TECHNICAL APPENDIX 



Technical appendix McKinsey Global Institute132 

To calculate the work hour automate in 2030, we multiply the automation adoption 
percentage by the size of the labor force in 2030. By do this, we assume that the 
occupation mix of the economy and the underlie work activity in each occupation in 
2030 be the same a today. This be a conservative assumption, because in reality, we would 
expect that job will not be add back at the same occupation mix and that new job will 
be add in less automatable sectors. 

To estimate the size of the 2030 labor force, we use population projection from the United 
Nations, labor force participation projection from the International Labour Organization, 
and the natural unemployment rate for OECD countries. For country outside the OECD, we 
use the maximum unemployment rate of either 2007 or 2012 to adjust for the effect of the 
2008 global financial crisis on unemployment. 

2. LABOR DEMAND DRIVERS 
Our work examines the labor demand create by seven catalysts. We select these seven 
from a shortlist of 20 after conduct high-level size calculation to estimate their potential 
to create labor demand by 2030. 

For catalyst that include a per caput metric, such a spend on automobile or number of 
health-care professionals, we include population growth through 2030 base on projection 
from the United Nations. 

We capture direct and indirect job that could be create from each catalyst, take into 
account the decline in hour work per person, and factor in globalization of work. Our 
model offer a static view of the potential labor demand that could be create from the 
seven driver and do not factor in supply-demand dynamic and feedback from factor 
such a change in wage levels. It estimate potential labor demand; whether this potential 
be capture will depend on the choice and investment make by businesses, policy- 
makers, and workers. The scenario we construct do not take into account any source of 
labor demand outside of our seven driver that could play an important role in determine 
the future of work. We do not model entirely new industry and occupation that could 
exist in the future, in part enable by technology; study have show that on average, 
0.5 percent of the workforce have be work in “new jobs” per year in the past couple 
of decades.157 We do not take into account sectoral shift in industry that be not directly 
related to automation, such a the rise of e-commerce in retail. We also do not model 
change in work structure, such a the growth of the “gig” economy, or activity within an 
occupation that could change a a result of technological innovation.

Gross Domestic Product projection 
Increased prosperity be the underlie driver of many (but not all) of the labor demand 
sizings. Given the static modular model approach that we have taken, we have take 
GDP per caput growth a an input to our driver models. 

We use the McKinsey Global Growth Model (GGM) projections. The GGM be a global 
macroeconomic model that track long term economic trend and generates projection 
under a range of scenarios. For the input to our labor demand modeling, we use the GGM’s 
baseline scenario where available. For country that the GGM do not model and for 
Japan and Mexico, we use projection from Oxford Economics. See Exhibit A1 for the GDP/ 
caput projection in use. 

Job multiplier 
For driver of labor demand in which we be model an increase in spend, we use job 
multiplier from input-output table to calculate the number of job create through each 
additional dollar of spend. In many driver base on linear regression analysis (for example, 
rise consumer spending), the general size approach for the number of job create 
incremental to 2014 level be capture in the follow formula: 

To take into account project increase in productivity between 2014 and 2030, we adjust 
2014 job multiplier for project productivity gain (from factor other than automation) to 
create a 2030 job multiplier. 

For all labor drivers, we calculate indirect job use indirect job multiplier from McKinsey 
input-output table base on source data from the World Input-Output Database, make 
adjustment a necessary inform by expert input. 

To avoid double-counting, we remove particular indirect multiplier if they may overlap 
with our drivers. For example, we exclude all indirect effect in healthcare, education and 
construction, since we have size these driver independently. This may undercount job 
creation in these areas.

Globalization of trade 
For driver that include tradable good and services, we use data from the International 
Trade Organization and IHS Global Insight to model level of import and export in our 46 
country set. In driver with global trade, we model both locally- and globally-driven labor 
demand. We keep this model of global trade constant between today and 2030, a shift 
in globalization be beyond the scope of our analysis. This approach would result in an 
underestimation of job creation in country whose global export share in 2030 would be 
great than today’s shares, and similarly overestimation of job creation in country whose 
share of global export in 2030 would be low than today’s. 

Trendline and step-up scenario 
For three of our seven drivers—infrastructure, residential and commercial buildings, energy 
transition and efficiency—we model two scenarios. These be a trendline scenario, base 
on the observe pattern across country that vary by factor such a GDP per capita, 
and a step-up scenario, which be base on further change that could boost labor demand 
above the trendline scenario. For our seventh driver, the marketization of previously unpaid 
work, we have only model a step-up scenario. We describe the assumption for these 
scenario in the relevant section below. 

Catalyst 1: Rising income 
Our rise income driver represent increase in consumer spending a well a overall 
spending on health care and education that result from increase prosperity (that is, rise 
GDP per capita) in countries. We have take GDP per caput projection a an exogenous 
input to our model for all driver related to change in spend. 

For consumer spending, we use univariate regression analysis to identify spending trend 
by category use 2014 GDP per caput and 2014 consumption per caput data for the 
46 country in our model. While GDP per caput change from 2014 to 2030 a the 
independent variable, we model change in spend by category for accommodation and food 
services, automobiles, clothing, financial services, food, household goods, leisure goods, 
leisure services, and utilities. (We exclude some category of consumer spending to avoid 
double counting, such a public transport, which could overlap with our infrastructure 
driver). An adjustment be make across category to cap overall consumption, to ensure 
that our regression analysis do not imply a major shift in consumption per capita. To do 
this, we scale overall consumption to a low and high scenario, base on consumption per 
caput projection from the GGM. We then multiply the 2014 and 2030 spend by 2014 and 
2030 job multipliers, respectively. The productivity-adjusted 2030 job multiplier account 
for an increase in productivity, which drive some consumption category to have negative 
job growth in country where productivity growth outstrips demand growth, such a the 
agriculture sector in India. Additionally, we use indirect job multiplier to capture the demand 
create in other sector that supply to these sectors. 

Goods and service model under rise income be determine to be tradable or non- 
tradable, and the labor demand for those which be tradable be distribute accord to 2014 
level of global trade. 

Given the discrepancy between country in funding model for education and health care, 
these driver have be size separately from the rest of consumer spending, despite some 
proportion of education and health care spending be fund directly by consumers. For 
both these sectors, we model the full sector, which would include that fund by consumer 
a well a public and private sector funding. 



135Jobs lost, job gained: Workforce transition in a time of automationMcKinsey Global Institute 

We see a trend towards increase number of job in education a GDP per caput rises. 
We model this relationship through univariate regression on student-teacher ratio and 
gross enrollment rate across primary, secondary, and tertiary level use 2014 data for 
all 46 country in our model. We also capture the effect of age populations; if there be low 
population growth and the population be aging, this decrease education jobs, and vice 
versa. The general formula we use is: 

We use this to model project education job in 2030, then subtract the number of job in 
2014 to size the incremental labor demand in education. We then use indirect job multiplier 
to capture job create in other sector that be supplier to the education sector. 

Catalyst 2: Health care: Rising income and age 
In addition to rise income increase demand for job in health care, age population 
in many country will likewise raise health-care demand. We model these effect of rise 
income and age together to avoid double-counting the increase in healthcare jobs. 

The change in the number of health-care job be model through bivariate linear regression 
with 2014 GDP per caput and age (share of population over 65 in 2014) a independent 
variable and health-care professional per 1000 people in 2014 a the dependent variable 
for all 46 country in our model. We use this trendline to model the increase in health-care 
professional a GDP per caput increase and population age from 2014 to 2030 levels. 
We include all part of the health-care delivery sector include hospital care, home care, 
nursing homes, and other support roles. We then use indirect job multiplier to capture job 
create in other sector that be supplier to the health-care sector. 

Catalyst 3: Development and deployment of new technology 
We identify trend between rise GDP per caput and spend on information technology. For 
enterprise IT spend, we find that a country’s GDP be correlate with the amount spent on 
hardware, software, and IT services. For consumer technology spend, we consider only the 
hardware and software component of spend, and find that the richer the population (i.e. 
the high GDP per capita) the high spend on technology goods. We use univariate linear 
regression analysis to find a relationship between 2014 GDP per caput a the independent 
variable and each category of IT spend per caput in 2014 (including consumer and 
enterprise spending) a the dependent variable across all 46 countries. These category 
of IT spend be then multiply by productivity-adjusted job multiplier for 2014 and 2030 
to calculate net new jobs. All data be base on historical baseline from Gartner’s Market 
Databook publish in the first quarter of 2017.158 Finally, we use indirect multiplier to 
capture job create in sector supply to the IT sector.

As the consumer technology element of rise income be capture within this driver, we 
omit it from the rise income driver. Likewise, since telecommunication and electric 
utility be capture in the infrastructure driver, we do not consider increase in technology 
infrastructure spend a part of our technology definition in order to avoid double-counting. 
Finally, this driver assumes technology spend growth accord to current trend and thus 
do not consider the scenario of extraordinary technology spend that be possible in 
more rapid automation scenarios. 

Catalyst 4: Infrastructure investment 
In our trendline scenario for infrastructure investment, we conduct univariate regression 
analysis with GDP per caput a the independent variable and infrastructure spend per 
caput a the dependent variable on 2014 cross-country data. From this, we estimate 
infrastructure spend in 2014 and in 2030, use GDP per caput projections. These 2014 
and 2030 infrastructure spend number be then multiply by 2014 and 2030 job multiplier 
for the construction sector, respectively, to estimate job in each year. 2030 job multipliers, 
a with other catalysts, be calculate use productivity growth a discuss below. The 
difference be the incremental addition of new infrastructure job between 2014 and 2030. 

In our step-up scenario, we model a step-up in which country have increase their 
infrastructure stock to a global benchmark of 70.5 percent of total GDP. This result in 
high run-rate infrastructure spending in order to attain and maintain the infrastructure 
70.5 percent benchmark, accounting for both GDP growth (accelerated in our step-up 
scenario) and depreciation. In all, this amount to between $4 trillion and $4.5 trillion 
annual spending for economic infrastructure (transport, water, and power) compare 
with $2.1 trillion to $3 trillion in the trendline scenario. We assume annual non-automation 
productivity increase range from 1.5 percent to 4.8 percent in some emerge market 
country base on historical trend (1.5 percent in China, 4.8 percent in Kenya, Nigeria, 
and the Philippines, and no productivity increase elsewhere). By the same method a the 
trendline scenario, we multiply 2014 and 2030 spend by job multiplier for the construction 
sector to estimate gross new jobs. Included in the range of our step-up scenario estimate 
be additional annual non-automation productivity increase in the remain emerge 
market country of 2.5 percent. This productivity adjustment would good indicate the 
range of possible outcome in emerge market countries; in advanced economies, give 
low historical growth in productivity, we do not assume non-automation productivity will 
increase even in the low range of the step-up scenario. Finally, we use indirect job multiplier 
to capture job create in sector that supply the construction sector. 

Catalyst 5: Residential and commercial building 
As with infrastructure, we have model two scenario for residential and commercial 
buildings. For the trendline scenario, we again conduct univariate regression analyses, 
just a we do for infrastructure. For the step-up scenario, we model an increase of stock 
in structure to a US benchmark of 2.3 time that of total GDP, in line with data from the 
Bureau of Economic Analysis, and adjust downward for double-counting with infrastructure, 
inclusion of industrial structures, and spending on equipment outside of the construction 
sector. This amount to $8.2 trillion to $9.8 trillion annual spending for building and 
structure (including residential, commercial and industrial structures) compare with 
$3.8 trillion to $5.5 trillion in the trendline scenario. As with the infrastructure catalyst, we also 
apply 1.5 to 4.8 percent productivity growth assumption in select country in the trendline 
scenario, and 2.5 percent annual non-automation productivity increase to remain 
emerge market country in the low range of the step-up scenario. 



137Jobs lost, job gained: Workforce transition in a time of automationMcKinsey Global Institute 

Catalyst 6: Energy transition and efficiency 
The energy transition driver capture the potential job creation due to the shift in mix of 
electricity generation. The potential increase in job in electric power generation due to 
increase in demand for power be capture in the utility category of consumer spending 
driven by rise incomes. We avoid double counting by isolate the mix shift effect in 
this driver. Using McKinsey model scenario for gigawatt (GW) capacity in 2030, 
we multiply project GW capacity by a job per GW multiplier across manufacturing, 
decommissioning, fuels, construction/installation, operation and maintenance by energy 
type (such a solar, coal, gas). Given the rapid and hard-to-predict change in productivity 
across the renewables value chain, we model a minimum scenario in which rapid 
productivity growth continues, and a maximum scenario in which productivity gain plateau. 
To model a step-up scenario, we increase the GW capacity shift more heavily towards 
renewables target that could help slow global temperature increase to two degree 
Celsius above pre-industrial levels. This increase shift result in great number of job 
create to change the energy generation mix by country. 

We model potential spend on energy efficiency use estimate from the International 
Energy Agency’s 2014 World energy investment outlook report. We use two scenario 
that the IEA models: a “New Policies Scenario” and a “450 Scenario.” In the New Policies 
Scenario, which be grouped with our other trendline drivers, “energy demand and supply 
projection reflect energy policy and measure that have be adopt a of early 2014, 
a well a other commitment that have be announced, but not implemented, take a 
cautious view of the extent to which these may be realized.”159 For our step-up analysis, we 
use the IEA’s 450 Scenario which “plots an emissions-reduction path for the energy sector 
consistent with the international goal to limit the rise to long-term average temperature to 
two degree Celsius.”160 In both scenarios, we use job multiplier to estimate the number of 
incremental job associate with the increase in spend that the IEA project between 2014 
and 2030, and use indirect multiplier to capture job create in other supply sectors. 

Catalyst 7: Marketization of currently unpaid work 
We model the marketization of currently unpaid work solely a a step-up labor demand 
driver. We use local time-use survey to understand the amount of time spent in various 
country on unpaid domestic work include cooking, cleaning, childcare and elder care. 
We decrease the time spent on these activity in each country use a linear coefficient 
between the minimum and maximum value across countries. We then make assumption 
around productivity gain in each activity through professionalization to estimate the 
potential for new labor demand creation. 

3. MACROECONOMIC ANALYSIS 
We use McKinsey’s Global Growth Model to dynamically model the US economy. Given 
both the unemployment and productivity effect of automation, we use the model to 
determine the GDP growth need to return the economy to full employment by 2030. 

Of the automation effect modeled, we directly include four channel by which automation 
affect the economy: unemployment displacement, capital investment, total factor 
productivity growth, and reemployment rate. Three of the four channel be output from 
the MGI automation model. We take the unemployment displacement a the midpoint 
displacement directly from the automation model; capital investment a the solution cost 
give in the automation model; and total factor productivity a the imply productivity 
growth from automation that would at the minimum result in constant total output. 

159 World energy investment outlook, International Energy Agency, 2014. 
160 Ibid. 



Technical appendix McKinsey Global Institute138 

Besides the output from the automation model, we also include a fourth channel, 
the reemployment rate, which describes how displacement actually translates into 
unemployment. Not every displace worker will enter unemployment; some will have the 
skill and the opportunity to quickly transition into a new role. We define the reemployment 
rate a the percentage of displace worker expect to return to work within the year; the 
remain displace worker enter unemployment. 

On top of the four channels, we model four different labor market scenarios. Each 
of the four scenario use a different reemployment rate—low, medium, high, or full 
reemployment—to describe condition such a labor market flexibility, labor market slack, 
skill and geographic mismatch, etc. that could influence the rate at which displace 
worker return to work. For the United States, we use a 25 percent reemployment rate in 
the low scenario, 49 percent reemployment rate in the medium scenario (the reemployment 
rate of displace worker in January 2010), 66 percent in the high scenario (the 
reemployment rate of displace worker in January 2016), and 100 percent reemployment 
in the full reemployment scenario. The model unemployment displacement and capital 
investment by country be held constant in all scenarios. For example, in the United 
States, the model unemployment displacement be 23 percent by 2030, and expect 
automation capital investment $145 billion by 2030. The reemployment rate for each of the 
labor market scenario differ by country and be estimate from literature and adjust 
for labor market flexibility factors. 

The GGM first forecast a baseline future without take into account the effect of 
automation. It then us the inputted unemployment displacement, capital investment, 
total factor productivity growth, and reemployment rate, and dynamically propagates these 
effect of automation throughout the model economy. The forecast unemployment 
rate, GDP growth rate, and average wage rate from the GGM be to be interpret by their 
deviation from the baseline state a a directional range of scenario for several possible 
future states. 

4. SKILLS AND WAGES ANALYSES 
In this analysis, we look at the net impact of (i) automation and (ii) labor demand creation at 
an occupation level, to understand which occupation could see high level of demand vs. 
decline by 2030. 

Baseline for skill and wage analysis 
The baseline for our skill and wage analysis be the 2014 employment level by occupation, 
adjust for the effect of automation and our labor demand drivers. Elements of the 
economy in which we have not size growth (such a defense) remain at 2014 level of 
employment; new occupation that do not currently exist do not show in this baseline. 

Mapping new labor demand and automation to job 
Our automation model be mapped to each of the 820 occupation code use by the 
US Bureau of Labor Statistics for all of the 46 country in our model. We multiply the 
percentage automation adoption rate in 2030 for each occupation by the size of each 
occupation in 2030 (which be assume to be the same percentage of labor force a in 2014). 
This provide u with a projection of how the employment level in job will be affected by 
automation in 2030. 



139Jobs lost, job gained: Workforce transition in a time of automationMcKinsey Global Institute 

To model the countervail effect on labor demand creation, we map our driver of demand 
accord to a list of associate occupation on a driver-by-driver basis. Most driver map 
to a specific sector, in which case we allocate incremental new job accord to today’s 
mix of job within a specify sector. In driver that affect a narrower range of jobs, we 
create more customize mapping to reflect reality. For example, for energy transition and 
efficiency, we map potential labor demand increase to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics’ 
categorization of “green jobs” and to the relevant job in fuels. Based on the sector of each 
direct job added, additional indirect job be create base on the specify job multiplier 
for a country. Indirect job be create accord to the mix of their sector. 

Combining these two calculations, we compare the total job displace by automation 
base on our 2030 baseline (today’s occupation mix, scale in proportion with the growth 
of labor force) to the job add by our driver to 2030. To calculate a percentage growth or 
decline, we divide this net change by today’s employment level for the occupation. 

Skills and educational categorization 
Our analysis take training requirement for job a a proxy for skill requirements. The five 
educational category use in our analysis are: less than secondary, secondary, associate 
degree, bachelor’s degree and advanced degree. These classification map to the five 
job-zones define by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics’ O*Net and take into account 
educational degrees, amount of training required, and year of experience necessary in 
order to qualify for a give job. Associate degree be more common in the United States 
than in the rest of the world and usually require two year of study. 

To optimize for consistency across our model and data quality, we use these educational 
requirement from the O*Net classification across all 46 countries. This simplify 
assumption be limit in case in which there be discrepancy among countries, but we 
find that requirement be broadly similar: the educational requirement to be a doctor be 
typically an advanced degree in most countries. 

Wage assumption 
In our analysis on the effect of automation and new labor demand on wages, we keep 
wage constant at 2014 levels; chemical engineers, economist and lawyer be in the 
high decile of wage earner in 2014 in the United States, where they remain for our 
analysis in 2030. 

In reality, we would expect wage to adjust to shift in response to automation and new 
labor demand. There could also be additional economic effect on wages, such a 
Baumol’s cost disease, or policy effect such a minimum wage legislation. Modeling 
these effect on wage be beyond the scope of our analysis, so we exclude them in favor of 
keep wage constant at 2014 levels. While we thus cannot say anything definitive about 
wage shift and be limited in any commentary on inequality, our approach allows u to 
identify relative shift between high-wage and low-wage occupations.
