Causal asymmetry be one of the great surprise in predictive modeling: The memory require to predict the 
future differs from the memory require to retrodict the past. There be a privileged temporal direction for 
model a stochastic process wherememory cost areminimal.Models operating in the other direction incur 
an unavoidable memory overhead. Here, we show that this overhead can vanish when quantum model be 
allowed. Quantum model force to run in the less-natural temporal direction not only surpass their optimal 
classical counterpart but also any classical model run in reverse time. This hold even when the memory 
overhead be unbounded, result in quantum model with unbounded memory advantage.

I. INTRODUCTION 

How can we observe an asymmetry in the temporal order 
of event when physic at the quantum level be time 
symmetric? The source of time’s barbed arrow be a long- 
stand puzzle in foundational science [1–4]. Causal 
asymmetry offer a provocative perspective [5]. It asks 
how Occam’s razor—the principle of assume no more 
cause of natural thing than be both true and sufficient to 
explain their appearances—can privilege one particular 
temporal direction over another. In other words, if we want 
to model a process causally—such that the model make 
statistically correct future prediction base only on infor- 
mation from the past—what be theminimumpast information 
wemust store? Are we force to store more data if we model 
event in one particular temporal order over the other 
(see Fig. 1)? 

Consider a cannonball in free fall. To model it future 
trajectory,weneed only it current position andvelocity. This 
remains true even when we view the process in reverse time.

the minimum memory require by any causal model Cþ and it 
retrocausal counterpart C−.

This exemplifies causal symmetry. There be no difference in 
the amount of information we must track for prediction 
versus retrodiction. However, this be not a obvious for more 
complex processes. Take a glass shatter upon impact with 
the floor. In one temporal direction, the future distribution of 
shard depends only on the glass’s current position, velocity, 
and orientation. In the opposite direction, we may need to 
track relevant information regard each glass shard to infer 
the glass’s prior trajectory. Does this require more or less 
information? This potential divergence be quantify in the 
theory of computational mechanic [6]. It be not only 
generally nonzero, but it can also be unbounded. This 
phenomenon implies that a simulator operating in the 
“less-natural” temporal direction be penalize with poten- 
tially unbounded memory overhead and be cite a a 
candidate source of time’s barbed arrow [5]. 
These study assume that all model be implement 

use classical physics. Could the observe causal asym- 
metry be a consequence of this classicality constraint? Here, 
we first consider a particular stochastic process that be 
causally asymmetric. We determine the minimal information 
need to model the same process in forward versus reverse 
time use quantum physics, and we prove that these 
quantity exactly coincide. More generally, we present 
systematic method to model any causally asymmetric 
stochastic process quantum mechanically. Critically, the 
result quantum model not only use less information 
than any classical counterpart but also than any classical 
model of the time-reversed process. Thus, quantum model 
can field a memory advantage that always exceeds the 
memory overhead incur by causal asymmetry. Our work 
indicates that this overhead can emerge when impose 
classical causal explanations. These result remain true even 
in case where causal asymmetry becomes unbounded. 

II. BACKGROUND 

A. Framework 

Consider a system that emits an output xt govern by 
some random variable Xt at each discrete point in time t. 
This behavior can be described by a stochastic process 
P—a joint probability distribution PðX⃖; X⃗Þ that correlate 
past behavior, X⃖ ¼ …X−2X−1, with future expectations, 
X⃗ ¼ X0X1…. Each instance of the past x⃖ ¼ …x−2x−1 
exhibit a conditional future x⃗ ¼ x0x1… with probabil- 
ity PðX⃗ ¼ x⃗jX⃖ ¼ x⃖Þ. 
Suppose that a model for this system can replicate this 

future statistical behavior use onlyH bit of past informa- 
tion. Then, thismodel can be execute by encode the past x⃖ 
into a state sðx⃖Þ ∈ S of a physical system Ξ of entropy H, 
such that repeat application of a systematic actionM onΞ 
sequentially generates x0; x1… govern by the conditional 
future PðX⃗jX⃖ ¼ x⃖Þ. The model be causal if, at each instance 
of time, all the informationΞ contains about the future can be 

obtain from the past [7]. Implementing it on a computer 
thengives u a statistically faithful simulationof theprocess’s 
realizations.The simplest causalmodel for a processPðX⃖; X⃗Þ 
be the model that minimizes H. 
The statistical complexity Cþ be define a the entropyH 

of this simplest model—it be the minimal amount of past 
information need to make statistically correct future 
prediction [13,14]. This measure be use to quantify 
structure in diverse setting [15–17], include hidden 
variable model emulate quantum contextuality [18]. 
Here, Cþ also field thermodynamic significance, have 
be link to the minimal heat dissipation in stochastic 
simulation and the minimal structure a device need to fully 
extract free energy from nonequilibrium environment 
[19–22]. 
Causal asymmetry capture the discrepancy in statistical 

complexity when a process be view in forward versus 
reverse time [23]. Consider an observer that encountersXtþ1 
before Xt. Their observation be characterize by the time- 
reverse stochastic process P− ¼ P−ðY⃖; Y⃗Þ where past and 
future be interchanged, such that Y⃖ ¼ … X1X0, while Y⃗ ¼ 
X−1X−2… and Yt ¼ X−ðtþ1Þ. A causal model for the time- 
reverse process then corresponds to a retrocausal model for 
the forward process PðX⃖; X⃗Þ. It generates a statistically 
accurate retrodiction of the conditional past PðX⃖jX⃗ ¼ x⃗Þ, 
use only information contain in the future x⃗. The 
statistical complexity of this time-reversed process C− 

(referred to a the retrodictive statistical complexity 
for P) quantifies the minimal amount of causal information 
we must assign to model PðX⃖; X⃗Þ in order of decrease t. 
Causal asymmetry capture the divergence ΔC ¼ 
jC− − Cþj. When ΔC > 0, a particular temporal direction 
be privileged, such that model the process in the other 
temporal direction incurs a memory overhead of ΔC. 
Note that the definition above be entropic measure and 

thus take operational meaning at the i.i.d. limit—i.e., 
modelingN instance of a stochastic process with statistical 
complexity Cþ require NCþ bit of past information, in 
the limit of large N. While this be the most commonly 
adopt measure in computational mechanics, single-shot 
variant do exist. The topological state complexity Dþ be 
particularly noteworthy [13]. It capture the minimum 
number of dimension (max entropy) Ξ must have to 
generate future statistics. A single-shot variant of causal 
asymmetry can thus be define by the difference ΔD ¼ 
jD− −Dþj between the topological state complexity of 
Pþ and P−. Here, we focus on statistical complexity for 
clarity. However, many of our result also hold in this 
single-shot regime. We return to this when relevant. 

B. Classical model 

Prior study of causal asymmetry assume all model 
be classical. In this context, causal asymmetry can be 
explicitly demonstrate use ε-machines, the provably

optimal classical causal model [13,14]. This involves 
divide the set of past into equivalence classes, such that 
two pasts, x⃖ and x⃖0, lie in the same class if and only if they 
have coincide future behavior, i.e., PðX⃗jX⃖ ¼ x⃖Þ ¼ 
PðX⃗jX⃖ ¼ x⃖0Þ. Instead of record the entire past, an 
ε-machine record only which equivalence class x⃖ lie 
within—inducing an encode function ε∶χ⃖ → S from the 
space of past χ⃖ onto the space of equivalence class 
S ¼ fsig, know a causal states. At each time step, the 
machine operates accord to a collection of transition 
probabilitiesTxij: the probability that an ε-machine initially in 
si will transition to sj while emit output x. The classical 
statistical complexity thus coincides with the amount of 
information need to store the current causal state 

Cþμ ¼ − 
X 
i 

πi log πi; ð1Þ 

where πi be the probability the past lie within si. Note that ε- 
machine be also optimal with respect to the max entropy 
[24], such that the topological state complexity Dμ of a 
process be the logarithm of the number of causal state [13]. 
Despite their provable optimality, ε-machines still appear to 
wastememory. The amount of past information they demand 
typically exceeds the amount the past contains about the 
future—the mutual information E ¼ IðX⃖; X⃗Þ. Observing an 
ε-machine’s entire future be insufficient for deduce it 
initial state. Some of the information it store in the present be 
never reflect in future statistic and be thus effectively 
erase during operation. In general, this waste differs 
betweenprediction and retrodiction, inducingnonzero causal 
asymmetry. 

C. Examples 

We illustrate this by examples, start with the per- 
turbed coin. Consider a box contain a single bias coin. 
At each time step, the box be perturbed, cause the coin to 
flip with probability p if it be in head (0) and q if it be in 
tail (1). The coin’s state be then emit a output. This 
describes a stochastic process Pþ0 . As only the last output be 
necessary for generate correct future statistics, Pþ0 have 

two causal states, correspond to the state of the coin. 
The statistical complexity hðπþ1 Þ thus represent the 
entropy of the bias coin, where πþ1 ¼ ½p=ðpþ qÞ� be 
the probability the coin be in head and hðxÞ ¼ −x log x − 
ð1 − xÞ logð1 − xÞ be the binary entropy. Furthermore, Pþ0 
be clearly symmetric under time reversal (i.e., Pþ0 ¼ P−0 ) 
and thus trivially causally symmetric. 
Suppose we postprocess the output of the perturbed coin, 

replace the first 0 of each consecutive substring of 0 
with a 2 (for example, …1000110100… becomes 
…1200112120…). This result in a new stochastic process, 
Pþh ðX⃖; X⃗Þ, call the herald coinPhþ, which also have two 
causal states, sþ1 ¼ fx⃖jx−1 ¼ 1g and sþ0 ¼ fx⃖jx−1 ≠ 1g. In 
fact, one can model Pþh ðX⃖; X⃗Þ by perturb the same bias 
coin in a box and modify it to output 2—instead of 0— 
when it transition from head to tail (see Fig. 2). Thus, the 
herald coin also have classical statistical complex- 
ity Cþμ ¼ hðπþ1 Þ. 
Its retrodictive statistical complexity, however, be higher. 

The time-reversed process P−h ðY⃖; Y⃗Þ represent an alter- 
native postprocessing of the perturbed coin—replacing the 
last 0 in each consecutive substring of 0 with a 2. Now, 
0 can be follow by 0 or 2, while 1 can be follow by 
anything, and 2 can only be follow by 1, induce three 
causal state s−j ¼ fy⃖jy−1 ¼ jg (see Fig. 2). This immedi- 
ately establishes a difference in the number of distinct 
configuration need for causal versus retrocausal model- 
ing. Indeed, Phþ field causal asymmetry, 

ΔCμ ¼ C−μ − Cþμ ¼ ð1 − π−1 ÞhðγÞ; ð2Þ 
where γ ¼ π−2 =ð1 − π−1 Þ and π−j ¼ P−h ðy⃖ ∈ s−j Þ. To under- 
stand this asymmetry, note that when model Phþ, we 
need only know if the previous output be 1 (i.e., current 
state of the coin) to decide whether a 0 should be replace 
by a 2. To model Ph−, however, one cannot simply look 
into the “future” to see if the system will output 1 next. 
Causal asymmetry thus capture the overhead require to 
accommodate this restriction. 
In general, causal asymmetry can be unbounded. In 

Appendix D, we describe the class of n-m flower processes,

FIG. 2. (a) The ε-machine for the process Pþh ðX⃖; X⃗Þ, create by flip a bias coin and emit outcome 2 when H → T, 0 when 
T → T, and 1 when T=H → H. This process have two causal state sþ1 and s 

þ 
0 , where the latter include all past end in either 0 or 2. 

(b) The time-reversed process P−ðY⃖; Y⃗Þ. Here, past end in 0, 1, and 2 now all lead to qualitatively different future behavior and must

where Cþμ scale a OðlognÞ while C−μ scale a OðlogmÞ. 
Note that n and m can be adjust independently, allow 
construction of process where ΔCμ > K for any give 
constantK. Settingm ¼ 2, for example, can yield a process 
where Cþμ can be make arbitrarily high, while C−μ ≤ log 3. 
When this occurs, the memory overhead incur for 
model the process in the less-natural direction scale 
towards infinity. 

D. Quantum model 

A quantum causal model be described formally by an 
order tuple Q ¼ ðf;Ω;MÞ, where Ω be a set of quantum 
states; f∶χ⃖ → Ω defines how each past x⃖ be encode into a 
state fðx⃖Þ ¼ jsx⃖i of a physical system Ξ; and M be a 
quantum measurement process. To model PðX⃖; X⃗Þ, 
repeat application of M on Ξ must generate correct 
conditional future behavior. In other words, application of 
M on a system Ξ in state jsx⃖i must (i) generate an output x 
with probability PðX0 ¼ xjX⃖ ¼ x⃖Þ and (ii) transition Ξ into 
a new state fðx⃖0Þ ¼ jsx⃖0 i, where x⃖0 ¼ x⃖x, such that 
L-repeated application of M will generate x0;…; xL−1 
with correct probability PðX0∶LjX⃖ ¼ x⃖Þ for any desire 
L ∈ Zþ [25]. The entropy of a model Q be give by 
the von Neumann entropy SðρÞ ¼ −Trðρ log ρÞ, where 
ρ ¼ PPðX⃖ ¼ x⃖Þjsx⃖ihsx⃖j. Thus, the quantum statistical 
complexity Cþq of a process can be compute by minimiz- 
ing SðρÞ over all valid model [26]. 
This optimization be highly nontrivial. There exists no 

systematic technique for construct optimal quantum 
model or for prove the optimality of a give candidate 
model. To date, Cþq have only be evaluate for the Ising 
chain [25]. However, this process be symmetric under time 
reversal, imply that ΔCμ be trivially zero. Nevertheless, 
recent advance show multiple setting where quantum 
model outperform optimal classical counterpart [27–31]. 
In fact, for every stochastic process where the optimal 
classical model be wasteful (i.e., Cþμ > E), it be always 
possible to design a simpler quantum model [27]. Indeed, 
sometimes the quantum memory advantage Cþμ − Cþq can 
be unbounded [32]. Could quantum model mitigate the 
memory overhead induced by causal asymmetry? 

III. RESULTS 

We study this question via two complementary 
approaches. The first be a case study of the herald 
coin—the aforementioned process that exhibit causal 
asymmetry. We pioneer method to establish it provably 
optimal quantum causal and retrocausal model and thus 
produce a precise picture of how quantum mechanic 
mitigates all present causal asymmetry. The second case 
study quantum model of arbitrary process with 
causal asymmetry. Here, Cþq and C−q cannot be directly 
evaluate but can nevertheless be bounded. In do so, we 

show that when force to model such a process in the less- 
natural direction, the quantum advantage always exceeds 
the memory overhead ΔCμ. 

A. The herald coin 

Let Phþ denote the herald coin process. Here, we first 
state the optimal quantummodels ofPhþ andPh−. We then 
outline how their optimality be established, leave detail 
of the formal proof to Appendix B. The optimal causal 
model Qþ have two internal states:

with associate encode function ϵþq ðx⃖Þ ¼ jsþi i if and only 
if x⃖ ∈ sþi . Given a qubit in state ϵþq ðx⃖Þ, Fig. 3 establishes the 
sequential procedure that replicates expect future behav- 
ior, i.e., sample Pþh ðX⃗jX⃖ ¼ x⃖Þ.

lapse the remain qubit into the quantum causal state for the next 
time step. In either circuit, retain only the state ofΞ (green circle) 
at each time step be sufficient for generate statistically correct 
prediction or retrodictions.

Meanwhile, the optimal quantum retrocausal model Q− 

have encode function ϵ−q ðy⃖Þ ¼ js−i i if and only if y⃖ ∈ s−i , 
where 

js−0 i ¼ j0i; 
js−1 i ¼

js−2 i ¼ j1i: ð4Þ 

The associate procedure for sequential generation of y⃗ a 
govern by P−h ðY⃗jY⃖ ¼ y⃖Þ be outline in Fig. 3. 
To establish optimality, we first invoke the causal-state 

correspondence: For any stochastic process with causal 
state fsig that occur with probability πi, there exists an 
optimal model Q ¼ ðϵq;Ω;MÞ, where the element of Ω 
be in one-to-one correspondence with fsig (see Lemma 1 
of Appendix A). Since the herald coin process have two 
forward causal states, we can restrict our computation of 
Cþq to quantum model where Ω ¼ fjψþ0 i; jψþ1 ig. 
Moreover, we can show that the data-processing inequality 
implies jhψþ0 jψþ1 ij ≤ 

ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi 
pð1 − qÞp ≡ F (see Lemma 2 of 

Appendix A). The monotonicity between jhψþ0 jψþ1 ij and 
the entropy of the result model, together with the 
observation that jhsþ0 jsþ1 ij ¼ F, then implies optimality 
ofQþ (see Theorem 1 in Appendix). This result establishes 
Cþq ¼ SðρþÞ for ρþ ¼ 

P 
iπ 

þ 
i jsþi ihsþi j. 

Proving the optimality of Q− be more involved. First, 
note that the causal-state correspondence allows u to 
consider only candidate model Q ¼ ðf;Ω;MÞ, where 
Ω ¼ fjψ−k igk¼0.::2 have three elements. The data processing 
inequality can then be use to establish the fidelity 

constraint jhψ−j jψ−k ij ≤ jhs−j js−k ij (see Lemma 2 of 
Appendix A). Let σ ¼ P π−k jψ−k ihψ−k j, with eigenvalue 
λk, and ρ− ¼ 

P 
π−k js−k ihs−k j, with eigenvalue λ−k . In 

Lemma 4 of Appendix B, we prove that for all choice 
of jψ−k i satisfy the fidelity constraint, λ−k majorizes λk. 
Thus, ρ− have minimal entropy among all valid retrocausal 
quantum models. 
Note that Qþ and Q− exhibit different encode func- 

tions (one map onto two code words, the other onto three) 
and invoke seemingly unrelated quantum circuit for 
generate future statistic (see Fig. 3). Nevertheless, direct 
computation yield 

Cþq ¼ C−q ¼ h

; ð5Þ 

where c¼(p2ð1þ4ð1−qÞqÞ−2pqþq2)=ðpþqÞ2 and hð·Þ 
be the binary entropy. Thus, ΔCq ¼ 0 for all value of 
p and q. This establishes our first result: 
Result 1. There exists stochastic process that be 

causally asymmetric (Cþμ ≠ C−μ ) but exhibit no such asym- 
metry when model quantum mechanically (Cþq ¼ C−q ). 
This vanish of causal asymmetry at the quantum level 

be not simply the result of saturate the bound give by E. 
Figure 4 show that E < Cþq ¼ C−q < Cþμ < C−μ for almost 
all value of p and q. While both quantum causal and 
retrocausal model reduce memory resource beyond 
classical limit [i.e., Cþq < Cþμ and C−q < C−μ—see 
Figs. 4(f) and 4(g)], they each still store some unnecessary 
information [Cþq ; C−q > E—see Fig. 4(i)]. 
Our result persist when consideringminimal dimensions, 

rather than minimal entropy require for causal modeling.

Cþq ¼ C−q and thus ΔCq ¼ 0.

Here, Phþ require only two causal state and thus can be 
model use a two-level system (Dþμ ¼ log 2). However, 
Ph− have three causal states.Modeling it thus require a three- 
level system (D−μ ¼ log 3). In contrast, the three quantum 
causal state of Ph− can be embed within a single qubit; 
thus, the dynamic of the herald coin can be model 
use a single qubit in either temporal direction. Therefore, 
this vanish of causal asymmetry also applies in single- 
shot settings. 

B. General process 

We now study quantum mitigation of causal asymmetry 
for general stochastic process by bound Cþq and C−q 
from above. Let Cminμ ¼ minðCþμ ; C−μ Þ represent the mini- 
mum amount of information we need to classically model 
PðX⃖; X⃗Þ when allow to optimize over the temporal 
direction. Meanwhile, let Cmaxq ¼ maxðCþq ; C−q Þ be the 
minimal memory a quantum system need when force 
to model the process in the least favorable temporal 
direction. In Appendix C, we establish the following: 
Result 2. For any stochastic process P, 

maxðCþq ; C−q Þ ≤ minðCþμ ; C−μ Þ: ð6Þ 

Equality occurs only if Cþμ ¼ C−μ ¼ E, such that P be 
causally symmetric. 
Consider any causally asymmetric process P, such that 

model it in the less-favorable temporal direction incurs 
memory overhead ΔCμ. Result 2 implies that this overhead 
can be entirely mitigate by quantum models. There exists 
a quantum model that be not only provably simpler than it 
optimal classical counterpart but be also simpler than any 
classical model of the time-reversed process P−. In Lemma 
7 (see Appendix C), we show that such model can be 
systematically construct and align with the simplest, 
currently known, quantum models—q-machines [33,34]. 
As a corollary, causal asymmetry guarantee both Cþq < 
Cþμ and C−q < C−μ ; i.e., a nonzero quantum advantage exists 
when model in either causal direction. 
A variant of these result also applies to topological state 

complexity. Suppose the number of causal state for P and 
it time reversal P− differ, such that Dþμ ≠ D−μ . Let Dþq and 
D−q , respectively, be the logarithm of the minimal dimen- 
sion need to model P and P− quantum mechanically. 
Appendix C also establishes the follow result. 
Result 3. For any stochastic process P, 

maxðDþq ; D−q Þ ≤ minðDþμ ; D−μ Þ: ð7Þ 

Given that there exists stochastic process where 
predictive and retrodictive topological complexity differ 
(e.g., the herald coin), this immediately implies the 
follow corollary. 

Result 4. The quantum topological complexity Dq can 
be strictly less than the classical topological complexityDμ. 
This solves an open question in quantum modeling— 

whether quantum mechanic allows for model that sim- 
ulate stochastic process use not only reduce memory 
but also reduce dimensions. 
These result have a particular impact when ΔCμ be 

exceedingly large. Recall that in the case of the n − 2 
flower process, Cminμ ≤ log 3, while Cþμ scale a Oðlog nÞ. 
Our theorem then implies that C�q ≤ Cminμ ≤ log 3. Thus, 
we immediately identify a class of process whose optimal 
classical model require a memory that scale a Oðlog nÞ 
and yet can be model quantum mechanically use a 
single qutrit. 

IV. FUTURE DIRECTIONS 

There be a number of potential relation between causal 
asymmetry and innovation on the arrow of time and 
retrodictive quantum theory. In this section, we survey 
some of these connection and highlight promising future 
research directions. 

A. Retrodictive quantum mechanic 

Consider the evolution of an open quantum system that be 
monitor continuously in time. Standard quantum trajec- 
tory theory describes how the system’s internal state ρðtÞ 
evolves, encapsulate how our expectation of future 
measurement outcome be update base on past obser- 
vations. Retrodictive quantum mechanic introduces the 
effect matrix EðtÞ—a time-reversed analogue of the density 
matrix ρðtÞ [35–37]. Note that EðtÞ propagates backwards 
through time, represent how our expectation of the past 
change a we scan future measurement outcome in time- 
reverse order. The original motivation be that ρðtÞ and 
EðtÞ combine yield a more accurate estimate of the 
measurement statistic at time t than ρðtÞ alone, allow 
improve smooth procedure [38–41]. 
While this framework and causal asymmetry differ in 

motivation and detail (e.g., monitoring be do in con- 
tinuous time, whereas we have so far only consider 
discrete time), there be also notable coincide concepts. 
The standard propagation equation for ρðtÞ parallel a 
causal model for observe measurement statistics, while it 
time-reversed counterpart govern EðtÞ parallel a cor- 
respond retrocausal model. It would certainly be inter- 
esting to see if such system exhibit either classical or 
quantum causal asymmetry. For example, do the resource 
cost of track EðtÞ differ from that of ρðtÞ under some 
appropriate measure [42]? 
Answering these question will likely involve significant 

extension of current results. Our framework presently 
assumes that the process evolves autonomously and that 
time be divide into discrete steps. These restriction will 
need to be lift by combine present result with recent

generalization of classical and quantum computational 
mechanic to continuum time [43,44] and input-dependent 
regime [21,45,46]. More generally, such development 
will enable a formal study of causal asymmetry in the 
quantum-trajectory formulation of open quantum systems. 

B. Arrow of time in quantum measurement 

Related to such open system be recent proposal for 
infer an arrow of time from continuous measurement 
[47]. These proposal consider continuously monitoring a 
quantum system initialize in state ρi, result in a 
measurement record rðtÞ with some probability P½rðtÞjρi�. 
Concurrently, the state of the system evolves through a 
quantum trajectory ρðtÞ into some final configuration 
ρðTÞ ¼ ρf. The goal be to identify an alternative sequence 
of measurements, such that for at least one possible outcome 
record r0ðtÞ occur with nonzero probability P½r0ðtÞjρf�, 
the trajectory rewinds. In other words, a system initially in 
state ρf will evolve into ρi, passing through all intermediary 
state in time-reversed order. An arrow of time emerges a 
P½rðtÞjρi� and P½r0ðtÞjρf� generally differ, such that one of 
the two direction occurs with great probability. An 
argument via Bayes’ theorem then assigns different prob- 
abilistic likelihood towards whether ρðtÞ occur in 
forward or reverse time. 
This framework provide a complementary perspective 

to our results. It aim to reverse the trajectory of the 
system’s internal state ρðtÞ, place no constraint on the 
relation between the measurement statistic govern rðtÞ 
and r0ðtÞ. In contrast, causal asymmetry deal with revers- 
ing the observe measurement statistic (as described by 
some stochastic process P) while place no restriction on 
the internal dynamic of the causal and retrocausal model 
(the two model may even field different Hilbert space 
dimensions, such a in the herald coin example). 
We also observe some strike parallels. Both work start 

out with some sequential data but no knowledge about 
whether the sequence occur in forward or reverse time. 
Both ask the follow question: Is there some sort of 
asymmetry single out one temporal direction over the 
other? In the emerge arrow of time from quantum 
measurement, we be give a trajectory ρðtÞ, and asym- 
metry arises from the difficulty (in term of success 
probability) of realize this trajectory in forward versus 
reverse time. Meanwhile, in causal asymmetry, we be 
give the observe measurement statistics, and an arrow of 
time arises from the difference in resource cost need to 
realize these statistic causally in forward versus reverse 
time. It would then be interest to see if a similar 
argument via Bayes’ theorem can be adapt to causal 
asymmetry. If we suppose that more complex machine be 
less likely to exist in nature (e.g., due to dimensional or 
entropic constraints), could we then argue whether a give 
stochastic process be more likely to occur in one causal 
direction versus the other? 

V. DISCUSSION 

Causal asymmetry capture the memory overhead 
incur when model a stochastic process in one 
temporal order versus the other. This induces a privileged 
temporal direction when one seek the simplest causal 
explanation. Here, we demonstrate a process where this 
overhead be nonzero when use classical model and yet 
vanishes when quantum model be allowed. For arbitrary 
process exhibit causal asymmetry, we prove that 
quantum model force to operate in a give temporal 
order always require less memory than classical counter- 
parts, even when the latter be permit to operate in either 
temporal direction. The former result represent a concrete 
case where causal asymmetry vanishes in the quantum 
regime. The latter implies that the more causally asym- 
metric a process, the great the resource advantage of 
model it quantum mechanically. 
Our result also hold when memory be quantify by max 

entropy. They thus establish that quantum mechanic can 
reduce the dimensionality need to simulate a process 
beyond classical limits. Indeed, our result isolate family 
of process whose statistical complexity grows without 
bound but can nevertheless be model exactly by a 
quantum system of bound dimension. These feature 
make such process ideal for demonstrate the practical 
benefit of quantum models—allowing u to verify an 
arbitrarily large quantum advantage in single-shot regime 
[24,48] and avoid the need to measure von Neumann 
entropy a in current state-of-the-art experiment [29]. 
One compelling open question be the potential thermo- 

dynamic consequence of causal asymmetry. In computa- 
tional mechanics,Cþμ have thermodynamical relevance in the 
context of prediction and pattern manipulation [19–22,49]. 
For instance, the minimum heat one must dissipate to 
generate future prediction base on only past observation 
be give byWþdiss ¼ kBTðCþμ − EÞ, where kB be Boltzmann’s 
constant, T be the environmental temperature, and the 
excess entropy E be symmetric with respect to time reversal. 
Therefore, nonzero causal asymmetry implies that flip 
the temporal order in which we ascribe prediction incurs 
an energetic overhead of ΔWdiss ¼ kBTΔCμ. In process 
where ΔCμ scale without bound, this cost may become 
prohibitive. Could our observation that ΔCq ≤ Cminμ imply 
that such energetic penalty become strongly mitigate 
when quantum simulator be take into account? 
A second direction be to isolate what property of 

quantum processing enable it to mitigate causal asymmetry. 
In Appendix C, we establish that all deterministic process 
be causally symmetric, such that C�μ ¼ C�q ¼ E (see 
Lemma 6 of Appendix C). Randomness be therefore 
essential for causal asymmetry. Observe also that the 
provably optimal quantum causal and retrocausal model 
for the herald coin both operate unitarily—such that 
their dynamic be entirely deterministic (modulo

measurement of outputs). Indeed, such unitary quantum 
model can always be construct [34], and we conjecture 
that this unitarity implies causal symmetry. However, it 
remains an open question a to whether the optimal 
quantum model be always unitary. 
Insights here will ultimately help answer the big out- 

stand question of whether the quantum statistical com- 
plexity ever display asymmetry under time reversal. 
Identifying any process for which such asymmetry persists 
implies that Occam’s preference for minimal cause can 
privilege a temporal direction in a fully quantum world. 
Proof that no such process exists would be equally exciting, 
indicate that causal asymmetry be a consequence of 
enforce all causal explanation to be classical in a 
fundamentally quantum world.

APPENDIX A: TECHNICAL DEFINITIONS 

We first introduce further technical notation and back- 
ground that will be use for subsequent proofs. 
Definition 1 (Quantum causal model) Consider an 

order tuple Q ¼ ðf;Ω;MÞ, where Ω be a set of quantum 
states; f∶χ⃖ → Ω be an encode function that map each x⃖ 
onto a state fðx⃖Þ ¼ jsx⃖i of a physical system Ξ; andM be a 
quantum process.Q be a quantum model for PðX⃖; X⃗Þ if and 
only if, for any x⃖ ∈ χ⃖, whenever Ξ be prepared in fðx⃖Þ, 
subsequent application ofM (i) generates an output x with 
probability PðX0 ¼ xjX⃖ ¼ x⃖Þ and (ii) transition Ξ into a 
new state fðx⃖0Þ ¼ jsx⃖0 i, where x⃖0 ¼ x⃖x [25]. 

Condition (i) guarantee that if a quantum model be 
initialize in state fðx⃖Þ, then the model’s future output 
X0 ¼ x will be statistically indistinguishable from the 
output of the process itself. Condition (ii) ensures that 
the internal memory of the quantum model be update to 
record the event X0 ¼ x, allow the model to stay 
synchronize with the sequence of output it have generate 
so far. Thus, a series of L repeat application ofM act 
on Ξ generates output x0∶L ¼ x0…xL−1 with probability 
PðX0∶L ¼ x0∶LjX⃖ ¼ x⃖Þ and simultaneously transition Ξ 
into the state fðx⃖x0∶LÞ. In the limit L → ∞, the model 
produce a sequence of output x⃗ ¼ x0x1… with proba- 
bility PðX⃗jX⃖ ¼ x⃖Þ. 
The entropy of a quantum model Q be give by 

CqðQÞ ¼ SðρÞ ¼ −Trðρ log ρÞ; ðA1Þ 
where Sð·Þ be the von Neumann entropy, ρ ¼ Px⃖πx⃖ρx⃖ for 
ρx⃖ ¼ jsx⃖ihsx⃖j, and πx⃖ ¼ PðX⃖ ¼ x⃖Þ. 
Definition 2 Q be an optimal quantum model for a 

process PðX⃖; X⃗Þ if, give any other model Q0, we 
have CqðQ0Þ ≥ CqðQÞ. 
Consider a stationary stochastic process PðX⃖; X⃗Þ, such 

that PðX0∶LÞ ¼ PðXt∶tþLÞ for any L ∈ Zþ, t ∈ Z. Let 
PðX⃖; X⃗Þ have causal state S ¼ fsig each occur with 
stationary probability πi. Define the conditional distribution 
PiðX⃗Þ ¼ PðX⃗jX⃖ ¼ x⃖ ∈ siÞ a the future morph of causal 
state si. We make use of the follow two result derive 
in Ref. [25]. 
Lemma 1 (Causal-state correspondence). Let PðX⃖; X⃗Þ 

be a stochastic process with causal state fsig. There exists 
an optimal model Q ¼ ðϵq;Ω;MÞ, where Ω ¼ fjsiig and 
ϵqðx⃖Þ ¼ jsii if and only if x⃖ ∈ si. 
This implies that we can limit our search for optimal 

model Q ¼ ðf;Ω;MÞ to those whose internal state Ω ¼ 
fjψ iig be in one-to-one correspondence with the classical 
causal states. In addition, it can be show that Ω must 
satisfy the follow constraint: 
Lemma 2 (Maximum fidelity constraint). Let PðX⃖; X⃗Þ 

be a stochastic process with causal state fsig, and let 
Q ¼ ðf;Ω;MÞ be a valid quantum model satisfy 
fðx⃖Þ ¼ jψ ii iff x⃖ ∈ si. Then, jhψ ijψ jij ≤ Fij, where Fij ¼P 

x⃗½Piðx⃗ÞPjðx⃗Þ�12 be the fidelity between the future morphs 
of si and sj. 
These definition assume that all element of Ω be pure. 

This be because computational mechanic considers only 
causal models—models whose internal state do not store 
more information about the future than what be available 
from the past. Specifically, let R be a random variable 
govern the state of a model at t ¼ 0. Then, IðR; X⃗jX⃖Þ be 
know a the oracular information, and it represent the 
amount of extra information R contains about the future X⃗ 
that be not contain in the past X⃖. For causal models,

IðR; X⃗jX⃖Þ ¼ 0 [8]. In Appendix E, we show that this allows 
u to assume that all element of Ω be pure without loss of 
generality. 

APPENDIX B: PROOFS OF OPTIMALITY 

Here, we formally prove that the quantum model for the 
herald coin give in Eqs. (3) and (4) be optimal. 

1. Optimality of the causal model 

Let Phþ denote the herald coin process, with the 
correspond ε-machine depict in Fig. 2(a). 
Theorem 1. Consider Qþ ¼ ðεþq ;Ωþ;MþÞ, where 

εþq ðx⃖Þ ¼ jsþi i if and only if x⃖ ∈ sþi , with

Ωþ ¼ fjsþ0 i; jsþ1 ig, and Mþ described by the quantum 
circuit in Fig. 3(a). Here, Qþ be an optimal quantum model 
for Phþ. 
Proof.—We prove this by contradiction. Assume there 

exists some Q ¼ ðf;Ω;MÞ such that CqðQÞ < CqðQþÞ. 
Lemma 1 implies that we can assume Ω ¼ fjψ0i; jψ1ig for 
some jψ0i and jψ1i and encode function fðx⃖Þ ¼ jψ ii if 
and only if x⃖ ∈ sþi , without loss of generality. Here, CqðQÞ, 
the von Neumann entropy of the ensemble fjψ ii; πþi g, be a 
monotonically decrease function of jhψ0jψ1ij [50]. Thus, 
CqðQÞ < CqðQþÞ implies that jhψ0jψ1ij > jhsþ0 jsþ1 ij ¼ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi

This be a contradiction. Thus, no such Q exists. □ 

2. Optimality of the retrocausal model 

Let Ph− denote the time reversal of the herald coin 
process, with the correspond ε-machine in Fig. 2(b). 
Theorem 2. Define Q− ¼ ðε−q ;Ω−;M−Þ, where 

ε−q ðy⃖Þ ¼ js−i i if and only if y⃖ ∈ s−i , with 

js−0 i ¼ j0i;

Ω− ¼ fjs−i ig, and the measurement process M− give in 
Fig. 3(b). Here, Q− be an optimal quantum model for Ph−. 
Below, we break down the proof of this theorem into a 

series of small steps. Each step be phrase a a lemma. 
Lemma 3. Let Q ¼ ðf;Ω;MÞ be a quantum model for 

Ph− satisfy fðy⃗Þ ¼ jψ ii iff y⃗ ∈ s−i . Then, up to a unitary 
rotation, 

jψ0i ¼ j0i;

maximum fidelity constraint, jhψ ijψ jij ≤ F−ij. Thus, 
hψ0jψ2i ¼ 0. Therefore, jψ0i ¼ j0i and jψ2i ¼ j1i up to 
a unitary rotation. We can then write jψ1i in the form above 
without loss of generality, a the coefficient of j2i can be 
make real and positive by choose a suitable definition of 
basis element j2i. Meanwhile, constraint on jhψ1jψ2ij ≤ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi

Our model described in Eq. (4) can be obtain by

Eq. (B4) (i.e., this corresponds to choose jψ0i ¼ js−0 i, 
jψ1i ¼ js−1 i, and jψ2i ¼ js−2 i). The subsequent lemma then 
establishes that this be the optimal choice. 
Lemma 4. For any quantum model Q ¼ ðf;Ω;MÞ of 

Ph− satisfy fðy⃗Þ ¼ jψ ii if and only if y⃖ ∈ s−i , 

CqðQÞ ≥ CqðQ−Þ: ðB5Þ 

In other words, Q−, a described by Eq. (4), be the low 
entropy (optimal) model that satisfies the causal-state 
correspondence. 
Proof.—By definition, CqðQ−Þ ¼ Sðρ−Þ for 

ρ− ¼ Piπ−i js−i ihs−i j, where π−i ¼ P−h ðy⃗ ∈ s−i Þ and the 
state js−i i be give in Eq. (4). We label the eigenvalue 
of this state from large to small by λ−0 , λ

Meanwhile, by the above lemma, CqðQÞ ¼ Sðρψ1Þ, where 

ρψ1 ¼ π−0 j0ih0j þ π−2 j1ih1j þ π−1 jψ1ihψ1j; 

and jψ1i be described by Eq. (B4). We label the eigenvalue 
of ρψ1 from large to small by λψ10 , λ

eiðω−ηÞ ¼ 1 [since any two complex number c1, c2 ∈ C 
satisfy jc1 þ c2j2 ≤ ðjc1j þ jc2jÞ2]. Using this and trigo-

However, by construction, ρ− only span a two-dimen-

that λ−0 þ λ−1 ≥ λψ10 þ λψ11 . Together, these result imply 
λ−≻λψ1 and therefore CqðQ−Þ ≤ CqðQÞ. □ 
By Lemma 1, Ph− have an optimal quantum model that 

satisfies the causal-state correspondence. Meanwhile, by 
Lemma 4, anyQ satisfy the causal-state correspondence 
must have CqðQÞ ≥ CqðQ−Þ. It follow that Q− be an 
optimal quantum model for Ph−. 

APPENDIX C: PROOF OF RESULT 2 

Here, we prove Result 2. To do this, we require some 
preliminary lemmas. The first connects the capacity for 
quantum model to improve upon their optimal classical 
counterpart with causal asymmetry. 
Lemma 5. If the classical and quantum statistical com- 

plexities of a processP coincide, such thatCþq ¼ Cþμ , thenP 
be causally symmetric and Cþμ ¼ C−μ ¼ E. 
Proof.—We first make use of the prior results, show 

that whenever classical model waste information, more 
efficient quantum model exist [27]. Specifically, Cþμ > E 
if and only if Cþq < Cþμ . Thus, Cþq ¼ Cþμ implies that

Cþμ ¼ E. It be therefore sufficient to show that Cþμ ¼ E 
implies C−μ ¼ E. 
We prove this by contradiction. Assume Cþμ ¼ E but 

C−μ > E. Now, Cþμ ¼ E implies HðS−1jX⃗Þ ¼ 0, where S−1 
be the random variable govern the causal state at t ¼ −1 
[14]. Thus, give x⃗, we can find a unique si such that 
PðX⃖ ¼ x⃖jX⃗ ¼ x⃗Þ be only nonzero when x⃖ ∈ si. It follow 
that the set τi ¼ fx⃗jPiðX⃗ ¼ x⃗Þ ≠ 0g form a partition on 
the space of all future (i.e., τi ∩ τj ¼ ∅ for i ≠ j). 
Furthermore, any two x⃖, x⃖0 ∈ si satisfy PðX⃗jX⃖ ¼ x⃖Þ ¼ 

PðX⃗jX⃖ ¼ x⃖0Þ, by definition of si. Thus, Bayes’ theorem 
implies that the τi partition the future into equivalence 
class x⃗ ∼ x⃗0 if and only if PðX⃖jX⃗ ¼ x⃗Þ ¼ PðX⃖jX⃗ ¼ x⃗0Þ 
[53]. Hence, fτig constitute the retrocausal states. Bayes’ 
theorem also yield PðX⃖ ¼ x⃖jX⃗ ¼ x⃗ ∈ τiÞ ≠ 0 only when 
x⃖ ∈ si. This impliesHðS−−1jX⃖ ¼ x⃖Þ ¼ 0, where S−−1 governs 
the retrocausal state at time t ¼ −1. Hence, C−μ ¼ E, which 
be a contradiction. □ 
It follow a a direct corollary of this result that causal 

asymmetry vanishes for deterministic process [i.e., proc- 
es where HðX⃗jX⃖Þ ¼ 0]. 
Lemma 6. Any deterministic process PðX⃖; X⃗Þ have 

ΔCμ ¼ 0. 
Proof.—Any deterministic process have E ¼ Cþμ [14,54]. 

Since E ≤ Cþq ≤ Cþμ , it follow that E ¼ Cþμ ¼ Cþq ; thus, 
accord to the above lemma, ΔCμ ¼ 0. □ 
Our next lemma make use of q-machines [33], the 

simplest currently know quantum models. Consider a 
process P ¼ PðX⃖; X⃗Þ whose classical ε-machine have a 
collection of causal state S ¼ fsig and transition proba- 
bilities Txij. Let k denote the cryptic order of PðX⃖; X⃗Þ, 
define a the small l such that HðSljX0∶∞Þ ¼ 0 
[28,33,54]. The q-machine of P have internal state jSii 
define by a recursive relation 

jSii ¼ jSiðl ¼ kÞi; where ðC1Þ

q 
jxijSjðl − 1Þi; ðC2Þ 

and jSið0Þi ¼ jii. The associate encode function sat- 
isfies fðx⃖Þ ¼ jSii whenever x⃖ ∈ si [28,33]. Let C̄q ¼ SðρÞ 
be the q-machine complexity—the amount of information a 
q-machine store about the past, where ρ ¼ PiπijSiihSij. 
Meanwhile, let the max entropy D̄q ¼ log tr½ρ�0 be the q- 
machine state complexity—the minimum dimensionality of 
any quantum system Ξ capable of store these internal 
states. Note that since q-machines be valid quantum 
models, Cþq ≤ C̄þq and C−q ≤ C̄−q . Likewise, Dþq ≤ D̄þq 
and D−q ≤ D̄−q . We now establish that the q-machine for 
P and it time reversal P− have coincide von Neumann 
entropy and coincide max entropies. 

Lemma 7. Let PðX⃖; X⃗Þ be a stationary stochastic 
process and P−ðY⃖; Y⃗Þ it time reversal, with q-machine 
complexity C̄þq and C̄−q , and q-machine state complexity 
D̄þq and D̄−q , respectively. Then, C̄þq ¼ C̄−q and D̄þq ¼ D̄−q . 
Proof.—We first introduce some compact notation. Let 

PðX⃖ ¼ x⃖; X⃗ ¼ x⃗Þ ¼ P 
x 
↔ and, similarly, PðX⃗ ¼ x⃗jX⃖ ¼ x⃖Þ ¼ 

Px⃗jx⃖, PðX⃗ ¼ x⃗jS−1 ¼ siÞ ¼ Piðx⃗Þ, a well a PðX⃖ ¼ x⃖Þ ¼ 
Px⃖ and Pðx⃖ ∈ siÞ ¼ πi. 
Now let jSþi i denote the internal state of theq-machine for 

PðX⃖; X⃗Þ, such that ρþ ¼ PiπijSþi ihSþi j and C̄þq ¼ SðρþÞ. 
From exist work [28,33], we know that 
liml→∞hSiðlÞjSjðlÞi ¼ hSiðkÞjSjðkÞi. Thus, let ωþðlÞ ¼P

We can verify that ωþ ¼ TrX⃖½ρX⃖ X⃗� and ω− ¼ TrX⃗½ρX⃖ X⃗�. 
Thus, Sðω−Þ ¼ SðωþÞ, and therefore, C̄þq ¼ C̄−q . The 
q-machine complexity of the forward and backward proc- 
es thus coincide. 
Note that the rank of ωþ and ω− must also 

coincide. Thus, an analogous argument establishes that

log tr½ρþ�0 ¼ log tr½ρ−�0, indicate the two model also 
have the same dimensionality. Therefore, D̄þq ¼ D̄−q . □ 
WenowproveResult 2.Consider any stochastic processP. 

First, assume P be causally asymmetric, such that ΔCμ ≠ 0. 
Note that this implies Cþμ ; C−μ > E (by Lemma 5). 
Meanwhile, Lemma 7 implies that C̄þq ¼ C̄−q . Thus, it be 
sufficient to show that C̄þq < Cþμ and C̄−q < C−μ , whenever 
Cþμ , C−μ > E. 
Note that for a general process, C̄q < Cμ if and only if 

the q-machine have two internal state with nonzero overlap 
hSijSji > 0 [56]. It be also previously establish that 
whenever Cμ > E, we can find some hSið1ÞjSjð1Þi > 0 
[27], a define by Eq. (C1). It follow from the iterative 
construction that hSijSji > 0, and thus C̄q < Cμ. Therefore, 
Cþμ > E implies C̄þq < Cþμ and C−μ > E implies C̄−q < C−μ . 
Hence, for any causally asymmetric P, 

maxðCþq ; C−q Þ < minðCþμ ; C−μ Þ: ðC7Þ 

Conversely, suppose maxðCþq ;C−q Þ¼minðCþμ ;C−μ Þ. Without 
loss of generality, we can assume Cþμ ≤ C−μ . This implies 
either (i) Cþq ¼ Cþμ or (ii) C−q ¼ Cþμ . In the case of (i), direct 
application of Lemma 5 implies Cþμ ¼ C−μ ¼ E. In the case 
of (ii), we have Cþμ ≥ C̄þq ¼ C̄−q ≥ C−q ¼ Cþμ , which implies 
Cþμ ¼ C̄þq . In other words, q-machines be not more efficient 
than ε-machines in model P. This be true if and only if 
Cþq ¼ Cþμ [27,28]. Thus, Lemma 5 again implies Cþμ ¼ 
C−μ ¼ E. This completes the proof. 

APPENDIX D: n-m FLOWER PROCESS 

The family of n-m flower process demonstrates how 
causal asymmetry can be potentially unbounded (see 
Fig. 5). The process have statistical complexity 
Cþμ ¼ 1þ 12 log½n�. In contrast, the time-reversed process 
will have at most mþ 1 causal states, and thus 
C−μ ≤ log½mþ 1�. Meanwhile, the predictive and retrodic- 
tive topological state complexity satisfy Dþμ ¼ log½nþ 1� 
and D−μ ≤ log½mþ 1�. Note that n and m can be adjust 
independently. Setting m ¼ 2, and allow n → ∞, yield 
diverge Cþμ but finite C−μ . Thus, ΔCμ also diverges to 
infinity. A similar divergence be witness for topological 
state complexity. 
Applying Result 2, we see that Cþq and C−q be both 

bound above by log 3. The same be also true for Dþq and 
D−q . Thus, quantum model of this process can fit within a 
single qutrit, whether model in forward or reverse time. 
In the specific case of the former, Cþμ and Dþμ diverge to 
infinity. Thus, we obtain a family of process whose 
quantum model field an unbounded memory advantage— 
in both the entropic and single-shot sense. 

APPENDIX E: EXCLUDING 
MIXED-STATE MODELS 

In this appendix, we consider more general causal 
modelsQ ¼ ðf;Ω;MÞ, which have the freedom to encode 
past 

fðx⃖Þ ¼ ωx⃖ ¼ 
X 
k 

qkðx⃖Þjψ x⃖kihψ x⃖kj ðE1Þ 

into mixed quantum states. We show that this do not 
allow for model that be more optimal than those that only 
encode past into pure quantum states. 
Theorem 3. Consider a stochastic process PðX⃖; X⃗Þ, 

with a causal model Q ¼ ðf;Ω;MÞ. If the internal state 
of Q be mixed, such that fðx⃖Þ ¼ Piqiðx⃖Þjψ x⃖i ihψ x⃖i j, then 
we can always find a causal model Q0 ¼ ðf0;Ω0;M0Þ such 
that f0ðx⃖Þ ¼ jsx⃖ihsx⃖j and CqðQ0Þ ≤ CqðQÞ. 
Proof.—Let PðX⃖; X⃗Þ have causal state S ¼ fsig. 

Suppose Q ¼ ðf;Ω;MÞ be an optimal causal model for 
PðX⃖; X⃗Þ, with mixed internal states. 
It be trivial to generalize the causal-state correspondence 

to mixed-state models. Thus, we can assume that Q have an 
encode function, where 

fðx⃖Þ ¼ ωi ¼ 
X 
k 

qkðsiÞjψ ðiÞk ihψ ðiÞk j ðE2Þ 

if and only if x⃖ ∈ si. Therefore, the internal state Ω ¼ 
fωig be in one-to-one correspondence with the classical 
causal states. 
Our proof make use of the requirement that causal 

model store no oracular information, i.e., IðR; X⃗jX⃖Þ ¼P 
x⃖Pðx⃖ÞIðR; X⃗jX⃖ ¼ x⃖Þ ¼ 0, whereR be the random variable 

FIG. 5. The n-m flower process, illustrate for the case m ¼ 2, 
and n even. Physically, this process can be generate by a set 
fd1;…; dng ofm-sided dice, where each die di be bias so that it 
land on side j ∈ f1;…; mg with probability pij (and, in general, 
the bias on each die be different, such that pij ≠ pkj for i ≠ k). We 
randomly select a die di, record the choice xt ¼ i. Afterwards, 
we role the die, transcribe the outcome j a xtþ1 ¼ jþ n.

govern the memory. Regrouping the past into causal- 
state equivalence class yield 

P 
si∈SπiIðR; X⃗jx⃖ ∈ siÞ ¼ 0, 

where πi be the probability that the past belongs to si. Thus, 
IðR; X⃗jx⃖ ∈ siÞ ¼ 0 for every si ∈ S. 
We have assume some element of Ω be mixed. In 

particular, suppose we have a specific ωi0 ¼ ω ∈ Ω with 
SðωÞ > 0, which occurs with probability πi0 ¼ π. Let x⃖ be a 
particular past such that fðx⃖Þ ¼ ω, and let Ψ ¼ fjψkig be a 
set of pure state that form an unravel of ω. There must 
exist some qk ∈ ½0; 1� such that ω ¼ 

P 
kqkjψkihψkj. Now, 

let OM be a quantum process that map ω to a classical 
random variable X⃗ govern by probability distribution 
PðX⃗jX⃖ ¼ x⃖Þ. By definition of a quantum model, this 
process can always be construct by concatenation of 
M act on a physical system Ξ. 
Let A represent the state of Ξ, and let B be the random 

variable that governs the result output of OM act on 
Ξ. Zero oracular information implies that A and B must be 
uncorrelated when condition on observe past x⃖. 
Therefore, OMðjψkihψkjÞ¼OMðjψ jihψ jjÞ¼OMðωÞ for 
all jψki, jψ ji ∈ Ψ. 
Now, consider the entropy of Q. By concavity of

Without loss of generality, we can assume that this

fjψ0ihψ0jg be a set of internal states, where ω be replace 
with jψ0ihψ0j, and define the encode function f00 such 
that f00ðx⃖Þ ¼ fðx⃖Þ, except when fðx⃖Þ ¼ ω, whereby 
f00ðx⃖Þ ¼ jψ0ihψ0j. Define a new quantum model 
Q00 ¼ ðf00;Ω00;MÞ. Clearly, CqðQ00Þ ≤ CqðQÞ. 
If any of the state in Ω00 be still mixed, then by 

repeat the above procedure, we can replace them with 
pure states, thereby construct a modelQ0 ¼ ðf0;Ω0;MÞ 
with pure internal state such that CqðQ0Þ ≤ CqðQÞ. □

[23] Note that in computational mechanic literature, causal 
asymmetry be often refer to a causal irreversibility 
[5]. Here, we choose the term causal asymmetry to avoid 
confusion with standard notion of irreversibility use in the 
physic community.

[26] Note that these definition implicitly assume we can only 
encode onto pure state Ω. We show in Appendix E that 
even when we allow the encode function to map directly 
onto mixed quantum states, it do not help—there be always 
a pure state quantum causal model with entropy SðρÞ ¼ Cþq 
(see Theorem 3).

[42] Note that since ρðtÞ and EðtÞ vary over a continuum, the 
memory cost of track either be likely to be unbounded. 
Thus, one may need to modify present approaches. Existing 
approach include the use of differential entropy [43] 
and study scale a we track the process to great 
precision [32].
