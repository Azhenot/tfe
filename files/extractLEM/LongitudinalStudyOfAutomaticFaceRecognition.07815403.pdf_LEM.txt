Longitudinal Study of Automatic Face 
Recognition 

Lacey Best-Rowden, Student Member, IEEE, Anil K. Jain, Fellow, IEEE, 

Abstract—The two underlie premise of automatic face recognition be uniqueness and permanence. This paper investigates the 
permanence property by address the following: Does face recognition ability of state-of-the-art system degrade with elapse time 
between enrol and query face images? If so, what be the rate of decline w.r.t. the elapse time? While previous study have 
report degradation in accuracy, no formal statistical analysis of large-scale longitudinal data have be conducted. We conduct such 
an analysis on two mugshot databases, which be the large facial age database study to date in term of number of subjects, 
image per subject, and elapse times. Mixed-effects regression model be apply to genuine similarity score from state-of-the-art 
COTS face matcher to quantify the population-mean rate of change in genuine score over time, subject-specific variability, and the 
influence of age, sex, race, and face image quality. Longitudinal analysis show that despite decrease genuine scores, 99% of 
subject can still be recognize at 0.01% FAR up to approximately 6 year elapse time, and that age, sex, and race only marginally 
influence these trends. The methodology present here should be periodically repeat to determine age-invariant property of face 
recognition a state-of-the-art evolves to good address facial aging. 

Index Terms—face recognition, facial aging, longitudinal study, mixed-effects models, multilevel models, random effects.

1 INTRODUCTION 

FACIAL recognition technology have rapidly mature overthe last two decade to the point where it be now uti- 
lized in many commercial and law enforcement application 
for person recognition (e.g., mobile face unlock and de- 
duplication of driver’s licenses). Automatic face recognition 
system operating on face image acquire in control 
conditions, such a mugshot or driver’s license photos, 
have achieve accuracy a high a 99% true accept rate 
(TAR) at a false accept rate (FAR) of 0.1% in large-scale eval- 
uations conduct by the National Institute of Standards 
and Technology (NIST) [1]. 

Technological advancement in automatic face recogni- 
tion have progressively tackle challenge cause by vari- 
ations in facial pose, illumination, and expression (collec- 
tively call PIE variations). Current effort (e.g., [2], [3]) be 
break ground on robustness to “faces in the wild” (e.g., 
image post on the web) to account for PIE, occlusion, 
and partial face images. Comparatively, age variation 
(i.e., large time lapse between pair of image be com- 
pared) have receive considerably less attention in the face 
recognition community. 

Published study on facial age in the context of au- 
tomatic face recognition have primarily employ cross- 
sectional technique where a population of individual who 
differ in age be analyze accord to difference between 
age group [1], [4], [5], [6], [7]. However, cross-sectional 
analysis cannot adequately explore age-related effect be- 
cause assumption of independent observation require that 
there be only one measurement per individual in the study. 
Past and future measurement be either not consider or

be summarize into a single measurement which loses in- 
formation; trend of individual over time be not analyzed. 
Hypotheses about facial age are, instead, longitudinal by 
nature and require multiple measurement of the same 
individual over time to reveal trend in comparison score 
with respect to facial aging. 

To what extent facial age affect the performance of 
automatic face recognition system be of more than aca- 
demic concern. Because the appearance of the face change 
throughout a person’s life, most identity document con- 
taining face image expire after a designate period of 
time; U.S. passport be only valid for five year for minor

and ten year for adults, while U.S. driver’s license typi- 
cally require renewal every five years. Additionally, to our 
knowledge, ensure that a new (more recent) photo have 
be submit for renewal be not verified, especially for 
renewal by mail or online. Validity period of such identity 
document may be too long if these photo be to be use 
with state-of-the-art face match systems. Fig. 1 show 
that elapse time of eight to ten year between two face 
image can cause false non-match errors. Studying how the 
actual comparison score change over time be important for 
understand the implication of operating with a global 
threshold1 (e.g., de-duplication and other open-set scenar- 
ios) on face recognition accuracy. 

While longitudinal study for automatic iris recognition 
[8] and fingerprint recognition [9] have be published, to 
our knowledge, no large-scale longitudinal study of auto- 
matic face recognition performance have be report in 
the literature. We aim to fill this gap by address the 
follow question: How robust be state-of-the-art automatic 
face recognition system to facial aging? In this paper, we 
conduct a longitudinal analysis of the performance of state- 
of-the-art COTS face matcher on two longitudinal face 
image database consist of repeat criminal offender 
(mugshots) from two different law enforcement agency 
(see Table 2). The COTS matcher use here be among the 
top-ranked performer in the FRVT 2013 face recognition 
evaluation [1]. The contribution of this paper can be sum- 
marized a follows: 

1) Longitudinal analysis of two of the large longitudinal 
database study to date. LEO LS contains 31,852 im- 
age of 5,636 subjects, and PCSO LS contains 147,784 
image of 18,007 subjects, where the average time span 
between a subject’s multiple image acquisition be 6.1 
and 8.5 years, respectively. Such large-scale database 
allow for evaluation of performance at low FAR value 
(e.g., 0.01% and 0.1%). Previous study (e.g., [4], [5]) 
evaluate at 1% FAR and higher. 

2) Determine the age-invariant property of current state- 
of-the-art face matchers. Rates of change over time in 
genuine comparison score be analyze use mixed- 
effect regression models, which be appropriate for 
longitudinal data. In do so, we quantify (i) the 
population-mean rate of change in genuine score over 
time and (ii) the variability in subject-specific longitu- 
dinal trend (i.e., how closely individual in the pop- 
ulation follow the population-mean trend). We also 
investigate the influence of age at enrollment, sex, race, 
and face image quality. 

3) Methodology and analysis tool for advance the devel- 
opment and evaluation of age-invariant face recognition 
algorithms. The analysis conduct in this paper can 
be apply to any matcher and any database. Periodic 
reevaluation will be necessary a face recognition tech- 
nology evolves to good address facial aging.2 

Our previous longitudinal analysis of automatic face 
recognition be first publish in [10]. The present work

same decision threshold for all subject across all comparisons.

ers, the code of our longitudinal analysis will be make publicly avail-

extends and refines our previous study in significant ways. 
The primary difference be a follows. (i) We study longitu- 
dinal effect of both age (elapsed time) and age (biological 
age); [10] only study elapse time. (ii) Genuine score be 
compute to represent a scenario where the young image 
of each subject be enrol in a gallery (a subject with ni total 
image have ni − 1 scores, whereas [10] compute all 

(

genuine scores). Comparing query image to an enrollment 
image (a fix point in time) simplifies the complex correla- 
tion structure that be present for all pairwise comparisons. 
(iii) We analyze an additional longitudinal face database 
(namely, LEO LS) from a different law enforcement agency 
than the PCSO LS database use in [10], and a different 
COTS matcher be use to obtain genuine score for LEO LS. 
Still, longitudinal analysis show similar result for both 
database and matchers. 

The remainder of this paper be organize a follows. Sec- 
tion 2 highlight related work on facial age a it pertains to 
automatic face recognition. Section 3 detail the two longitu- 
dinal face database use in this study. Section 4 explains the 
methodology use for longitudinal analysis. Section 5 give 
result for both the PCSO LS and LEO LS face databases. 
Section 6 summarizes our observation about the current 
longitudinal capability of automatic face recognition. 

2 RELATED WORK 
Almost all of the publish study that investigate the 
effect of facial age on automatic face recognition perfor- 
mance adopt the follow approach: (i) divide the database 
(face pairs) into partition depend on age group or time 
lapse, (ii) report summary performance measure (e.g., TAR 
at fix FAR) for each partition independently, and then 
(iii) draw conclusion from the difference in performance 
across the partitions. Such an approach have lead to the 
follow general conjecture [11]: (i) Face recognition per- 
formance decrease a the time elapse between two image 
of the same person increase (e.g., [4], [5], [6]). (ii) Faces of 
old individual be easy to recognize/discriminate than 
face of young individual (e.g., [1], [6]). See Table 1 for a 
summary of these studies.3 

Partitioning of data (images or subjects) base on age 
group or time lapse be often arbitrary and varies from one 
study to another. Erbilek and Fairhurst show that differ- 
ent age group partitioning result in different performance 
trend for both iris and signature modality [14]. Further- 
more, this cohort-based analysis with summary statistic 
cannot address whether age-related performance trend be 
due to change in genuine (same subject) comparison scores, 
impostor (different subjects) comparison scores, or both. 

Multilevel (hierarchical or mixed-effects) statistical mod- 
el have be use for determine important factor (co- 
variates) to explain the performance of face recognition 
systems. Beveridge et al. [18] apply generalize linear mixed 
model to verification decision (accept or reject) make by 
three algorithm in the FRGC Exp. 4 evaluation. In addition 
to eight level of FAR a a covariate, they analyze gender, 
race, image focus, eye distances, age, and elapse time. The 
limitation of this study include (i) the maximum elapse 

3. Studies that address develop age-invariant face recognition 
algorithm (e.g., [12], [13]) be beyond the scope of this paper.

metric (face and speech) performance trend over time, but 
the database use only contains 150 subject and the elapse 
time be less than two years. The longitudinal study on face 
recognition in this paper follow the general methodology

and age-invariant face recognition, be FG-NET [15] and 
MORPH [16]. Panis et al. [20] provide a recent overview 
of research that have utilized the FG-NET database. While 
the public release of these database greatly encourage 
progress in these areas, the database be not suitable for 
longitudinal analysis because (i) FG-NET contains only 82

number of subject with multiple image over time (only 317

database property (see Table 2). 

Cross-Age Celebrity Dataset (CACD) [17] be recently re- 
leased, contain 163,446 image of 2,000 celebrity across 
10 years. However, because the image be download 
from the web (via Google search), the unconstrained quality 
make it difficult to statistically model the effect of facial 
aging. Variations in pose, illumination, expression, etc., 
may largely influence the trend in similarity scores. Such 
covariates be difficult to quantify in order to “tease out” 
these effect from the longitudinal effects, so standardize 
image (near-frontal, neutral expression, uniform illumi- 
nation) be preferable for the longitudinal study conduct in 
this paper. Relatively constrain images, such a mugshots, 
help to ensure that other effects, such a PIE variations, be 
capture in the noise term in the statistical models. For the 
above reasons, our longitudinal analysis utilizes two new 
longitudinal face databases, detailed in Section 3. 

3 LONGITUDINAL FACE DATABASES 
Operational face image datasets maintain by government 
and law enforcement agency can contain longitudinal 
record of individual of magnitude that be infeasible to 
collect in laboratory setting (e.g., elapse time over 10+ 
years). These agency routinely collect face image of the 
same individual over time and have be do so for rel- 
atively long durations, primarily for application involve 
driver’s licenses, visa and passport applications/renewals, 
frequent travelers, and multiple arrest of repeat criminal 
offenders. The source of face image in our longitudinal 
analysis be mugshot bookings. While we acknowledge that 
lifestyle factor (e.g., drug5 and alcohol use, trauma, etc.) 
may increase age rate for some individual in this pop- 
ulation (adult repeat criminal offenders), these accelerate 
agers be expect to be outlier in the statistical model in 
our analysis; the overall trend should be relatively robust 
to this factor. Additionally, we be not able to access any 
other longitudinal face data. We do attempt to use longitu- 
dinal face image from the State Department visa databases. 
However, we discover that roughly 5% of genuine face

ual reuses the same photo for a visa renewal application), 
so the correspond inaccurate age information render it 
unsuitable for longitudinal study. 

The two database use in this longitudinal study (LS), 
denote LEO LS and PCSO LS, be subset of subject 
and image from two large mugshot database initially 
consist of 3.7 and 1.5 million images, respectively. The 
follow criterion be use to compile the subsets: (i) Each 
subject have at least 4 (LEO LS) or 5 (PCSO LS) face image 
that be (ii) acquire over at least a 5 year time span, and 
(iii) each pair of consecutive image be time-separated by at 
least one month. Database statistic be show in Fig. 2. 

The facial variation in the PCSO S and LEO LS 
database be well-controlled because the mugshot adhere 
to standard similar to those detailed in the ANSI/NIST- 
ITL 2011 face image standards.6 The standard specify that 
mugshot should be capture at frontal pose, with neutral 
expression, uniform illumination, and a background set to 
18% gray, for examples. Because these database be both 
from operational sources, some confound factor be 
still present, such a minor pose and expression variation 
(see Fig. 6). We also observe rare occurrence of facial 
occlusion or injury, a show in Fig. 4, but have retain 
such image in this study. 

For both databases, we only include white and black 
race subject in this study because there be too few subject 
of other race to do a meaningful statistical analysis. Since

3.2 PCSO LS Face Database 

The PCSO LS database consists of 147,784 operational 
mugshot of 18,007 repeat criminal offender book by the 
Pinellas County Sheriff’s Office (PCSO) from 1994 to 2010. 
Each subject have an average of 8 image over an average

makeup of the PCSO LS database include 11,002 white 
and 7,004 black subject where 14,882 subject be male 
and 3,124 be females. Example face image from PCSO LS 
be show in Fig. 6. Each book record in PCSO LS 
contains both the date of birth and the date of arrest (actual 
date be unavailable for LEO LS, only the age be 
provide to us). 

3.3 Face Comparison Scores 

Face comparison score (similarities) be obtain from 
various commercial face matcher with the aim of evalu- 
ating current state-of-the-art longitudinal performance. Two 
matcher be apply to the PCSO LS database, and com- 
parison score be obtain from four different matcher 
for the LEO LS database.8 As show in Table 3, COTS-A 
and COTS-B be the overall most accurate matchers. Due 
to space limitations, longitudinal result be only report 
for COTS-A and COTS-B throughout the remainder of the 
paper. COTS-A and COTS-B be both among the top-3 
performer in the FRVT 2013 [1]. 

The original mugshot image be input to each COTS 
matcher, and a total of 26,216 and 129,773 genuine score 
be compute for the LEO LS and PCSO LS databases, 

7. In the United States, a juvenile be typically under the age of 17. 
8. Comparison score and ancillary information (sex, race, age) for 

the LEO LS face image database be provide by the Image Group,

respectively, under the scenario where each subject’s set 
of face image be compare to his/her enrollment image. 
Genuine comparison scores, sij , between the enrollment 
and jth face image of subject i be standardize so 
yij = (sij−μ)/σ, where μ and σ be the mean and standard 
deviation of the genuine score from all subjects. This stan- 
dardized response, yij , be in term of standard deviation 
from the mean of the genuine distribution, which allows 
interpretation of coefficient from mixed-effects regression 
model a quantify the change in genuine score a β 
standard deviation per year. Fig. 7 show the distribution 
of COTS-A and COTS-B standardize genuine scores. 

The response variable for all mixed-effects model in this 
study be standardize genuine comparison scores. How- 
ever, to evaluate face recognition performance, trend in 
genuine score should be consider in context with an 
impostor distribution. For both the LEO LS and PCSO LS 
databases, we compute all possible impostor score (5.5 
million and 11.1 billion, respectively) to calculate threshold 
at different fix FAR values. The threshold at 0.01% FAR, 
for example, be use to determine when genuine score drop 
below the threshold, cause false rejection errors. 

4 MIXED-EFFECTS MODELS 

Mixed-effects model (also know a random-effects, multi- 
level, and hierarchical models) be widely use in various 
scientific discipline for study data that be hierarchi- 
cally structured, include longitudinal data of repeat 
observation over time [22], [23]. In our case, face image 
be grouped by subject because we have repeat obser- 
vations of each individual in our study. When data be 
structure in such a manner, response from the same clus- 
ter/group/individual be correlate with each other and 
across time (for longitudinal data). Mixed-effects model en- 
able analysis of variation in the response (here, standardize 
face comparison scores) that occurs at different level of the 
data hierarchy.

Fig. 6: An example of cross-sectional vs. longitudinal analysis. (a) Face image of six example subject from the PCSO LS 
database. The enrollment face image (leftmost column) be the young image of each subject, and all query image be 
in order of increase age. In this study, genuine similarity score be compute by compare the query image of each 
subject to his/her enrollment image. In (b), a cross-sectional approach (ordinary least square (OLS) linear regression) be 
applied, which incorrectly assumes that all the score be independent. In (c), OLS be instead apply six times, separately to 
each subject’s set of scores. The slope estimate by cross-sectional analysis (black dot line) be much flatter than the slope 
of subject-specific trend in (solid color line in (c)). The longitudinal analysis in this paper utilizes mixed-effects models, 
which provide “shrunken” OLS estimate for each subject, where the OLS trend shrink towards a population-mean trend 
[22], [23], further accounting for the correlation that exists between score from the same subject. 

Ideally, longitudinal data collection would observe all 
individual in the study follow the exact same schedule 
over the entire duration of interest. However, longitudinal 
data be typically not this nicely structure because it be 
difficult (and expensive) to collect, or it must be analyze 
retrospectively, a be the case with the mugshot database 
use in this study. Instead, longitudinal data be most often 
time-unstructured and unbalanced, meaning individual in the 
study population be observe at different schedule and 
have different number of observations. For the mugshot 
databases, this translates to different rate of recidivism for 
each subject. Fig. 2 show that subject in the LEO LS and 
PCSO LS database have anywhere from 4 to more than 20 
mugshots, and Fig. 5 show that the age span of the subject 
be highly unstructured. 

Mixed-effects model can handle imbalanced and time- 
unstructured data and be preferable over other approach 
because they model both the mean response (fixed effect 
define the population-mean trend), a well a the covariance 
structure (random effect allow deviation of individual 
from the population-mean). In longitudinal data, this co- 
variance structure have a complicate form which stem from 
the fact that error term be not independent (as be assume 

in standard linear regression). The remainder of this section 
provide detail of the model and covariates of interest. 

4.1 Model Formulations 
Given ni face image of subject i, let AGEij denote the 
absolute age of the ith individual for the jth face image, 
where AGEij < AGEik for j = 0, . . . , ni − 2 and k = j+1, 
. . . , ni − 1 (i.e., the ni image be order by increase 
age). To begin with, assume that the young image (first 
acquisition) of each subject be enrol in the gallery, and 
let AGEie = AGEi0 denote the age of individual i at 
enrollment where AGEie < AGEij for j = 1, . . . , ni − 1. 
We can compute mi = ni − 1 genuine comparison score 
by compare every other image to the enrollment image. 
Hence, in this scenario, yij (j = 1, . . . , mi) be the comparison 
score between the jth face image of individual i and his/her 
enrollment image. AGEij be the age of the jth query/probe 
image of subject i, so the elapse time between enrollment 
and query image be �Tij = AGEij −AGEie. 

When study age-related effect on automatic face 
recognition performance, there be two different, albeit 
closely related, time-varying covariates which be of pri- 
mary interest: (i) the elapse time between image acquisition

and (ii) the absolute age of the subject in the two face image 
be compared. Below, we discus mixed-effects model 
which include these and other covariates. 

4.1.1 Function of Elapsed Time 
The simplest notion of face recognition performance over 
time be a function of the elapse time between a subject’s 
enrollment and query face images, f(�Tij). A linear mixed- 
effect model with two level (to account for subject-specific 
trends) and a single covariate for elapse time can be 
formulate a follows. At level-1, the comparison score yij 
between the enrollment and jth query image of subject i can 
be model a a linear function of �Tij : 

yij = ϕ0i + ϕ1i�Tij + εij , (1) 
where the ith individual’s intercept, ϕ0i, and slope, ϕ1i, be 

ϕ0i = β00 + b0i, 

ϕ1i = β10 + b1i. 
(2) 

The level-1 equation in (1) model within-subject longitudinal 
change in yij where a subject’s score can vary around 
his/her linear trend by εij (level-1 residual variation). The 
level-2 model in (2) account for between-subject variation 
in comparison score because each subject’s intercept and 
slope parameters, ϕ0i and ϕ1i, respectively, be model 
a a combination of fix and random effects. The fix 
effects, β00 and β10, be the grand mean of the population 
intercept and slopes, respectively, and define the overall 
population-mean trend, while the random effects, b0i and b1i, 
be subject-specific deviation from the population-mean 
parameters. Since each subject can have his/her own inter- 
cept and slope parameters, mixed-effects model be flexible 
in handling/allowing for biometric zoo effect [24], [25] 
(some subject generally have high or low scores). Fig. 6 
show six example subject from the PCSO LS database at 
different ages, with their subject-specific trend in genuine 
score over time show in Fig. 6c. 

The random structure of the above two-level model 
include the level-1 residuals, {εij}, a well a the random 

effects, b0i and b1i, which can be thought of a level-2 
residuals. The distributional assumption of these two error 
term are: 

εij ∼ N(0,σ2ε) (3) 
and [

b1i 

]

([ 
0 
0 

] 
, 

[ 
σ20 σ01 
σ10 σ 

2 
1 

]) 
, (4) 

where N(., .) denotes a Gaussian distribution. 
Substituting the level-2 equation for subject-specific 

intercept and slope into the level-1 model in (1), the 
composite form of the two-level mixed-effects model is: 

yij = 
[ 
β00 + b0i 

] 
+ 
[ 
β10 + b1i 

]�Tij + εij . (5) 
Here, the model term inside the two bracket in (5) corre- 
spond to all coefficient for the intercept and slope terms. 

When the error term be equal to their assume mean 
of zero, (6) reduces to the population-mean trend of yij = 
β00 + β10�Tij . The grand mean intercept β00 quantifies the 
expect marginal mean comparison score when �Tij = 0. 
Note that this intercept be not particularly meaningful, a our 
data do not contain any same-day comparisons. However, 
interpretation of β00 do give u some notion of difference 
in subject’s comparison score at a project baseline of 
zero year elapse time. The primary coefficient we be 
interested in be β10 which quantifies the expect change 
in mean comparison score per one-year increase in elapse 
time since enrollment. Because this model, a well a all 
others consider in this paper, include random term for 
both intercept and slope (b0i and b1i), we can also analyze 
the variation in the population parameter (i.e., difference 
in the trend of individual in the population). 

4.1.2 Function of Elapsed Time and Age at Enrollment 
If rate of change in comparison score be steeper or flatter 
throughout an individual’s lifetime, then face recognition 
performance may also be a function of absolute age. If we 
add the age of the enrollment image to (5): 

yij = 
[ 
β00 + β01AGEie + b0i 

] 
+ 
[ 
β10 + b1i 

]�Tij + εij . (6)

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE 8 

Because AGEie be a fix effect for each subject (time- 
invariant), the above composite model actually have a two- 
level specification with the same level-1 model in (1). Hence, 
AGEie cannot improve the model fit at level-1 (within- 
subject); it can only influence the level-2 subject-specific 
variations.9 The population-mean trend for (6) is: 

E(yij) = β00 + β01AGEie + β10�Tij 
= β00 + β01AGEie + β10(AGEij −AGEie). (7) 

By definition, �Tij be a center version of AGEij , where 
the center term (AGEie) be subject-specific. Hence, the 
model for age a a function of elapse time and age at 
enrollment, f(�Tij , AGEie), be mathematically equivalent 
to a model for age a a function of the age of the query 
image and age at enrollment, f(AGEij , AGEie): 

E(yij) = β00 + β01AGEie + β10AGEij . (8) 

The two model in (7) and (8) will result in the same 
estimate for longitudinal change, β10. What distinguishes 
them be the interpretation of the coefficient β01 quantify 
the effect of AGEie. Note the relationship between the two 
models: β(8)01 = β 

(7) 
01 − β(7)10 . Hence, β(8)01 be the “contextual” 

effect that model the difference between the within- and 
between-subject effect of age [26].10 The significance of 
subject age at enrollment in (8) be test with the null 
hypothesis of H0 : β01 = 0, whereas restrict inference be 
need to test significance in (7) because the null hypothesis 
must instead be H0 : β01 = β10. 

The relationship between these two model (CT and 
CA) be similar to common approach for decouple the 
longitudinal and cross-sectional effect of a time-varying 
covariate. A time-varying covariate at level-1 (e.g., age or 
elapse time) exhibit variability within, but also between 
individuals; model which assume that the within- and 
between-individual effect be equal do not properly esti- 
mate either of these effect [23], [26], [27], [28]. Typically, 
the time-varying covariate be “centered” on subject-specific 
means, so a to remove between-subject variation at level-1 
of the model. 

4.2 Model Comparison and Evaluation 
The goal of statistical model be to find a model that 
include substantive predictor and excludes unnecessary 
one (parsimony). A common approach be to fit increasingly 
complex model to successively evaluate the impact of 
add different covariates [22]. Models can be compare 
use goodness-of-fit measure base on log-likelihood 
statistics: deviance, Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), and 
Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Deviance quantifies 
how much bad the current model be compare to the 
(hypothetical) saturate model that include all possible co- 
variate to perfectly fit the data. Because the log-likelihood 
(LL) of the saturate model be zero, 

Deviance = −2[LLcurrent − LLsaturated] = −2LLcurrent. (9) 
9. Comparing all image of a give subject to her fix enrollment 

image mean that AGEij and �Tij be perfectly correlate at level-1 
(within-subject) of the model. Hence, we cannot include both of these 
covariates; the effect of age must be add a a level-2 covariate. 

10. The equality β(8)01 = β 
(7) 
01 − β(7)10 hold for mixed-effects model 

with random intercepts, and be approximately true for model with both 
random intercept and random slopes.

Fig. 7: Distributions of standardize genuine comparison 
score from the two longitudinal face database use in this 
study: (a) COTS-A on PCSO LS and (b) COTS-B on LEO LS. 
There be a total of 129,773 and 26,216 genuine score in (a) 
and (b), respectively. 

Deviance can be use to compare nest model (i.e., the 
more complex model can be reduce to the simpler model 
by place constraint on it parameters) that be fit to the 
same data. To compare non-nested models, AIC and BIC 
penalize the log-likelihood base on the complexity of the 
models11 and the sample size. Smaller value indicate good 
fit for all three goodness-of-fit measures.12 

Further comparison of model depend on whether the 
successive model have include a time-invariant (e.g., sex, 
race) or time-varying (e.g., face image quality) covariate to 
the baseline model. For both cases, pseudo-R2 statistic can 
be use to measure the proportional reduction in level- 
2 variance (σ20 , σ 

2 
1) and level-1 residual variance (σ 

2 
ε ) at- 

tributable to inclusion of time-invariant and time-variant 
covariates, respectively. 

5 RESULTS 
We first focus on analysis of the PCSO LS database, start 
with simpler model (i.e., Model A and BT) and progress 
to more complex model include covariates for subject 
sex/race and face image quality. We then present result for 
the LEO LS database. Recall that model be discuss in 
Section 4 and equation be provide in Table 4. All model 
in our analysis be fit with full maximum likelihood (ML) es- 
timation via iterative generalize least-squares (GLS) use 
the lme4 package (v1.1-9) [29] for R (v3.2.2). 

5.1 Model Assumptions 

While mixed-effects model be capable of handle non- 
Gaussian response distribution (e.g., COTS-A genuine 
score in Fig. 7a), the error term must follow Gaussian dis- 
tribution. Fig. 8a show normal probability plot of the level- 
1 residuals, εij , from fitting Model BT to genuine score 
from the PCSO LS database. Since significant departure 
from linearity be observe at the tails, we cannot verify 
that the model assumption hold; normal probability plot 
of random effects, b0i and b1i, also depart from linearity 

11. For full ML estimation, the number of parameter include both 
the fix effect and the variance components. 

12. For AIC and BIC, the magnitude of the reduction in model fit be 
difficult to interpret.

error in subject IDs. 

(Figs. 8b, 8c). This behavior be observe for other model 
a well, preclude the use of standard error for formal 
hypothesis test of parameter [30]. 

When parametric model assumption be violated, it be 
common to resort to non-parametric bootstrap to estab- 
lish confidence interval for the parameter estimates, a 
follow in Yoon and Jain [9]. Hence, for the PCSO LS 
database, we conduct a non-parametric bootstrap by case 
resampling [30]; 1,000 bootstrap replicates be generate 
by sample 18,007 subject with replacement. Multilevel 
model be fit to each bootstrap replicate, and the mean 
parameter estimate over all 1,000 bootstrap be reported. 
Tests for fix effect parameter can be conduct by ex- 

amining the bootstrap confidence intervals.13 Table 5 give 
the bootstrap parameter estimate (with 95% confidence 
intervals), variance components, and goodness-of-fit for the 
model in Table 4. 

5.2 Unconditional Means Model (Model A) 

The simplest mixed-effects model be the unconditional 
mean model, which partition the total variation in com- 
parison score by subject. Denoted Model A in Table 4, and 
with composite form of yij = β00+b0i+εij , b0i be the subject- 
specific mean and β00 be the grand mean. Similar to analysis of 
variance (ANOVA), Model A provide initial estimate of 
the within-subject variance σ2ε (i.e., deviation around each 
subject’s own mean comparison score) and the between- 
subject variance σ20 (i.e., deviation of subject-specific mean 
around the grand mean). The intraclass correlation coef- 
ficient (ICC) quantifies the proportion of between-subject 
variation in the response, ρ = σ20/(σ

component for Model A show in Table 5 indicate that 
between-subject difference in genuine score (i.e., biometric 
zoo) account for 38.7% (ρ = 0.3873) of the total variation 
in genuine score from the PCSO LS database. Baseline 
goodness-of-fit measure be also show in Table 5. 

5.3 Unconditional Growth Model (Model BT) 

The next model to consider in longitudinal analysis be the 
unconditional growth model that include the time-related 
covariate. In our case, we add elapse time, �Tij , a well 
a random effect for slopes, b1i, to Model A, result 
in Model BT. Table 5 show that Model BT estimate that 
PCSO LS genuine score decrease by 0.1364 standard de- 
viations per one-year increase in elapse time (see solid 
black line in Fig. 9). Comparing the level-1 residual variation 
of Models A and BT, elapse time explains 35.6% of the 

13. The null hypothesis of the parameter equal to 0 can be reject at 
significance of 0.05 if the 95% confidence interval do not contain 0.

Fig. 9: Results from Model BT on COTS-A genuine 
score from the PCSO LS database. The bootstrap-estimated 
population-mean trend be show in black (bootstrap confi- 
dence interval be too small to be visible). The blue and 
green band plot region of 95% and 99% confidence, respec- 
tively, for subject-specific variation around the population- 
mean trend. Grey dot line additionally add one stan- 
dard deviation of estimate residual variation, σε. Hence, 
Model BT estimate that 95% and 99% of the subject trend 
fall within the blue and green bands, but score can vary 
around their trends, extend to the grey dot lines. 
Thresholds at 0.01% and 0.1% FAR for COTS-A be show

variation in a give subject’s genuine score around his/her 
own average genuine score.14 

Longitudinal change estimate by Model BT implies that 
the population-mean trend will drop below the threshold for 
0.01% and 0.1% FAR after 19.1 and 24.0 year elapse time, 
respectively, but this only provide insight into performance 
on subject in the population with average (or higher) 
genuine score over time. A reliable face recognition system 
must be able to recognize much more than just 50% of the 
population it encounters, so we be also interested in the 
spread of the population around the population-mean trend. 
Do all subject closely follow the population-mean trend, or 
be there large variability between subjects? Do biometric zoo 
effect extend to rate of change over time? 

Using the estimate variance component for slope and 
intercept (σ20 , σ 

2 
1 , and σ01), we compute a 2D confidence 

ellipse (random effect be assume to be 2D Gaussian 
distributed) to define a region that contains, for example, 
95% of the estimate subject-specific parameters. In order to 
translate from the 2D space of intercept and slope to obtain 
a confidence region for genuine score versus elapse time, 
we sample 100 combination of intercept and slope param- 
eters along the contour of the confidence ellipse, compute 
the predict genuine score for each of the 100 trends, and 
define the confidence region a between the minimum and 
maximum predict score for different value of elapse 
time. Results be show in Fig. 9. 

From the confidence band of subject variation in Fig. 9, 
we infer that genuine score for 99% of the population 
will remain above the threshold at 0.01% FAR for up to 

14. Using pseudo-R2 = (σ2ε(A)− σ2ε(BT ))/σ2ε(A).

of the population after 7 year (i.e., false reject error would 
occur, on average, for 5% of subject after 7 year since 
enrollment). Similarly, at a high FAR of 0.1%, 99% of sub- 
jects can be recognize up to 8.5 year elapse time, which 
reduces to 95% after 10.5 years. Fig. 10 show face image 
from six example outlier subject whose estimate trend 
lie outside the 99% region of confidence due to extreme 
intercept and/or slopes; subject significantly deviate from 
the population spread due to alignment errors, face quality 
issue (illumination, facial occlusion), and change to facial 
hair, for example. 

5.4 Age at Enrollment (Models CT and D) 

We next investigate whether the population-mean trend in 
genuine score over time depend on a subject’s absolute age 
(i.e., whether variation in subject-specific trend observe in 
Model BT can be explain by difference in subject age). 
The significance of the AGEie term in Model CT suggests 
a negative linear relationship between age at enrollment and 
genuine scores, but the magnitude of β01 be relatively small. 

To further test the complexity of the effect of age 
at enrollment, we add additional term associate with 
AGEie, result in Model D (see Table 4). The hypothesis 
of interest be 1) old subject be easy to recognize than 
young subjects, and 2) young subject age at faster 
rate than old subjects. These two hypothesis manifest in 
young subject have low genuine scores, on average, 
and steeper negative rate of change. Table 5 show that

Fig. 11: Model E fit to COTS-A genuine score from the 
PCSO LS database. Population-mean trend be plot by 
subject demographic of sex and race and for five different 
age at enrollment (20 to 60 years). Each trend line rep- 
resents seven year of elapse time after enrollment. For 
example, the solid blue line begin at AGEij = 20 year 
represent the average decrease in genuine score for white 
male enrol at age 20 with query image until age 27. 

the interaction term AGEie × �Tij in Model D be not 
significantly different from zero because the 95% confidence 
interval for β11 contains zero; hence, we cannot conclude 
that subject enrollment age have a linear effect on rate of 
change in COTS-A genuine scores. The statistically signif- 
icant β02 coefficient indicates a quadratic relationship be- 
tween subject enrollment age and intercepts, and goodness- 
of-fit measure be low compare to Model BT. However, 
further compare to Model BT, level-2 variation in random 
effect for intercept (σ20) be only reduce by 0.4% after 
include AGEie terms. The difference between score for 
different age at enrollment be marginal compare to the 
change in score due to elapse time; the change in score 
between a 20 year-old and a 30 or 50 year-old (at enrollment) 
be equivalent to only 7 and 5 month of elapse time (within- 
subject longitudinal change), respectively. 

5.5 Sex and Race (Model E) 

Model E in Table 4 be use to test the effect of subject 
sex and race. First, we observe that Model E result in 
good model fit than Model D (deviance for Model E be 
285,712 compare to 286,967 for Model D). The main effect 
of subject sex be statistically non-zero at significance level of 
0.05, but the main effect of subject race be not (the 95% boot- 
strap confidence interval contains 0). Male genuine score 
at baseline (�Tij = 0 years) be 0.3987 standard devia- 
tions high than female scores. Significant interaction with 
elapse time indicate that rate of change in genuine score 
depend on both sex and race; population-mean slope be 
−0.0113 and −0.0267 standard deviation steeper for male 
and black subjects, respectively. Population-mean trend 
separate by subject demographic be show in Fig. 11 
for different age at enrollment. while male genuine score 
decrease at slightly faster rate than female scores, male 
be clearly easy to recognize with high genuine score

5.6 Face Image Quality (Model Q) 
Adding level-2 covariates (i.e., time-invariant value for 
each subject, such a AGEie) cannot improve the fit of the 
model at level-1 (within-subject). Table 5 show that the 
level-1 residual variation σ2ε (i.e., deviation of score around 
each subject’s own linear trend) be quite large when time 
be the only level-1 covariate for all model consider thus 
far. One standard deviation of level-1 residual variation 
estimate by Model BT (and similarly Models CT and D) 
be equivalent to 4.6 year of elapse time (calculated as√ 

σ2ε/β10 = 
√ 
0.3912/−0.1372). This be visually show by 

the dot grey line in Fig. 9. 
Level-1 residual variation can only be reduce by level-1 

time-varying covariates (i.e., image-specific); in this section 
we investigate whether face image quality measure can 
be use to improve the model fit. The quality measure 
consider be interpupillary distance (IPD) and a “frontal” 
score, both of which be output by COTS-A. While high 
frontalness indicates good quality, the range of the frontal 
score have little meaning, since it computation be proprietary. 
We standardize (z-score) the frontalness score so we can 
interpret model parameter a standard deviation from the 
mean of the frontalness score from all image in PCSO LS. 

After find that neither of the quality measure alone 
explain variation in genuine score a well a Model BT with 
only elapse time a covariate (details be omit due to 
space limitations), we then add the quality measure to 
Model BT, result in Model Q in Table 4. Table 6 give

estimate level-1 residual variation and goodness-of-fit for 
model with frontalness, IPD, and both frontalness and IPD 
(Model QF, QI, and QFI, respectively). Model QF have a good 
overall fit than Model QI. Table 7 give the elapse time 
for when population-mean score cross threshold at 0.001% 
and 0.01% FAR for different value of frontalness and IPD. 
Note how change frontalness have a great impact on 
when population-mean genuine score cross the threshold 
than change in IPD. Model QFI with both measure of 
quality further reduces both the level-1 residual variation 
and value of goodness-of-fit values. 

The value of 100 and 120 pixel for IPD in Table 7 be 
chosen because we observe systematic change in IPDs 
over time (see Fig. 12); in particular, mean IPD varies around 
100 pixel from 1994–2002 but increase to a consistent ∼120 
pixel start in 2003. This observation, along with corre- 
spondence with Pinellas County Sheriff’s Office, suggests 
that book agency begin to adhere to image standard 
around this time. To investigate whether this aspect of the 
data confounds the estimation of longitudinal effect (face 
image in late year may be of high quality), we also 
test for a difference in slope prior to 2003 versus after 
2003 by use a piecewise linear formulation for the mixed- 
effect model (with a breakpoint at 2003). We found that 
slope after 2003 be significantly flatter (less negative). 

Additional face quality factor know to cause change 
in face recognition performance be illumination, expres- 
sion, and occlusions. However, there be no widely accepted 
method for quantify such variation in face image and 
do so be beyond the scope of this paper. 

5.7 LEO LS Database 

Table 8 give result for the model in Table 4 fit to COTS- 
B genuine score from the LEO LS database. Fixed-effects 
parameter estimate be give with standard errors; boot- 
strap be not conduct for LEO LS model because 
the error term good follow Gaussian distribution (see 
Fig. 8). Model result be summarize a follows. 

Model A estimate that 40% of the total variation in 
genuine score be due to between-subject differences. The 
longitudinal change in genuine score estimate by both 
Model BT and Model CT indicates that a one year increase 
in elapse time decrease genuine score by β10 = −0.1699 
standard deviations. From the confidence band of subject 
variation in Fig. 13 (estimated by Model BT), we infer that 
genuine score for 99% of the population will remain above

Fig. 14: Model E for COTS-B genuine score from the

different age at enrollment (20 to 60 years). Each trend line

involve AGEie result in significant effect of enrollment 
age in Model D. The significant β02 coefficient indicates 
a downward quadratic relationship between age at en- 
rollment and average genuine score (similar to COTS-A 
on PCSO LS). Furthermore, the significant interaction term 
AGEie ×�Tij indicates that longitudinal change in score 
tends to vary with subject’s age at enrollment; a 10-year 
increase in subject age result in a longitudinal slope that 
be β11 = −0.0098 standard deviation steeper. Population- 
mean rate of change range from −0.1784 to −0.1490 stan- 
dard deviation per year for subject with age at enrollment 
of 20 to 50 year (calculated a β10 + β11AGEie). Recall that 
age at enrollment have no effect on rate of change for COTS- 
A on PCSO LS. 

Model E result indicate that intercept be 0.0565 and 
0.4238 standard deviation high for black and male sub- 
jects, respectively (so, black-male subject have intercept 
that be 0.4803 standard deviation high than white- 
female subjects). Slopes be not statistically different for 
black and white subjects, but the population-mean slope for 
male be steeper (i.e., more negative) than for females. These 
population-mean trend be show in Fig. 14 for different 
age at enrollment. Fig. 14 also show that the difference 
between subject race be minor compare to difference 
between male and females, a be also the case for COTS-A 
on the PCSO LS database. 

6 CONCLUSIONS 

We present a longitudinal study of automatic face 
recognition, utilize two large operational database of 
mugshots, PCSO LS (147,784 image of 18,007 subjects, 
avg. 8 image per subject over avg. 8.5 years) and LEO LS 
(31,852 image of 5,636 subjects, avg. 6 image per subject 
over avg. 5.8 years), where each subject have at least four face 

image acquire over at least a five-year time span. Lin- 
ear mixed-effects regression model be use to analyze 
variation in genuine score due to elapse time, age, sex, 
and race, a well a subject-specific difference in score (i.e., 
biometric zoo effects). Face similarity score be obtain 
from state-of-the-art COTS matcher for both the PCSO LS 
and LEO LS databases. Based on our analysis, we make the 
follow observation (statements apply to both database 
and matchers): 

� Population-mean trend indicate that genuine score 
significantly decrease with increase elapse time between 
enrollment (gallery) and query (probe) images, a expected. 
However, population-mean trend (average genuine scores) 
do not fall below threshold at 0.01% FAR until after 15 year 
elapse time. This suggests that in a practical application, an 
average individual’s genuine score decrease at a rate that 
will not affect the recognition accuracy at 0.01% FAR until 
more than 15 year since enrollment. 

� Significant subject-specific variability around the 
population-mean trend be observed; genuine score for 
some subject decline at much faster rate than the 
population-mean. Analysis of the estimate variance in 
subject-specific parameter (intercepts and slopes) allow 
for estimation of subject-based accuracy (i.e., how many 
subject be estimate to be falsely rejected, rather than 
standard image-based accuracy calculations). For example, 
the model estimate that genuine score for 99% of the 
population will remain above the threshold at 0.01% FAR 
until 6.5 year elapse time for PCSO LS and 5.5 year for 
LEO LS. Other calculation (e.g. 95% of the population) be 
also within approximately one year for both databases. 

� Subject-specific variance in rate of change (i.e., linear 
slopes) be only marginally attributable to subject age at 
enrollment, sex, and race. Subject sex be the most signifi- 
cant factor for between-subject difference in genuine scores, 
with male have significantly high genuine score than 
females. The magnitude of the difference suggests that false 
reject error may occur approximately two year early for 
female than for male (assuming that a global threshold be 
use operationally). 

� While the model fit improve for more complex mod- 
el incorporate simple measure of face quality (for the 
PCSO LS database), the model be still limited for prediction 
purposes. The within-subject variability (i.e., level-1 residual 
variance) be still quite large. All model consider in this 
study indicate that one standard deviation in genuine score 
due to short-term variation (e.g., illumination, hairstyle, 
etc.) be approximately equivalent to the change in genuine 
score due to ±4 year of elapse time (for these particular 
database and matchers). 

Longitudinal analysis, in general, be an important, yet 
very difficult, problem. To the best of our knowledge, no 
proper statistical analysis have yet be conduct for study- 
ing face recognition performance on a large population over 
period of time longer than five years. In this paper, we 
attempt to analyze the covariates of interest that be 
available to u (elapsed time, age, sex, race, some measure 
of quality), but there be additional covariates that cannot 
be account for because we do not have the information 
(e.g., camera characteristics, IPD for the LEO LS database, 
expression variations, etc.). Despite this, the longitudinal

study on automatic face recognition present here utilizes 
two of the largest, deepest, and long (in term of number 
of subjects, number of image per subject, and time span of 
subject images, respectively) face image database study 
to date, and the COTS matcher be representative of current 
state-of-the-art. Given that the performance of face recog- 
nition system continue to improve, longitudinal analysis 
should be conduct periodically to reevaluate robustness 
to facial age (and other covariates). 

Future work includes: (i) Evaluation of face identification 
(both closed-set and open-set) performance over time. Ob- 
servations about recognition accuracy in this paper apply to 
verification scenario (i.e., one-to-one comparisons) operating 
with a global threshold. (ii) Development of a single face 
quality measure for mugshot type face images. (iii) Lon- 
gitudinal analysis on different face crop (particularly, 
pre-cropped image to exclude most of the hair region) to
