Mobile device have become an inseparable part of our everyday life. They be use to transmit an ever-increasing 
amount of sensitive health, financial and personal information. This expose u to the grow scale and 
sophistication of cyber-attacks. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) can provide unconditional and future-proof data 
security but implement it for handheld mobile device come with specific challenges. To establish security, 
secret key of sufficient length need to be transmit during the time of a handheld transaction (~1s) despite 
device misalignment, ambient light and user’s inevitable hand movements. Transmitters and receiver should 
ideally be compact and low-cost, while avoid security loopholes. Here we demonstrate the first QKD 
transmission from a handheld transmitter with a key-rate large enough to overcome finite key effects. Using 
dynamic beam-steering, reference-frame-independent encode and fast indistinguishable pulse generation, we 
obtain a secret key rate above 30kb/s over a distance of 0.5m under ambient light conditions. 

Guaranteed by the law of physics, Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)1–3 provide an ultimate level of security, and 

uniquely it be the only technology know to-date that can monitor eavesdropping activities. Since it inception in 1984, 

development of QKD have be largely focus on secure large-scale infrastructures4–6 use long distance fibre 

transmission7–11 and free space transmission between fix terminals12–14 QKD transmission have also be demonstrate 

from large mobile vehicle such a trucks15, planes16 and air balloons17. Today, there be increase demand for security in 

handheld device such a mobile phone and wearable technologies. A QKD protect link between handheld device and 

the terminal would provide the key for encryption with verifiable security for any wireless communication system, range 

from indoor wireless network (e.g. Wi-Fi) to access control and near field communication (NFC) mobile payment 

applications. This technology could also prevent ATM skim attacks, where a $2 billion loss worldwide in 201518 be 

estimated, by transmit the quantum encryption key from the mobile device securely to the ATM terminal. A short- 

range free-space implementation of QKD could address these security challenge and provide a high degree of security. 

For a handheld QKD system to be practical, it need to be compact and low-cost19–21, and crucially, it must also be able to 

transmit a secure key in a time suitable for a handheld transaction (~1s). If the size of the transmit key be too small it be 

not mathematically secure, so during this short span of time, a number of qubits large enough to overcome finite key effect 

must be exchanged22–24. The system must therefore provide a stable communication link take into account the user’s 

unavoidable hand movement, which lead to translation and rotation of the mobile device. Previous work by Mélen, G. et 

al.21 obtain intermittent key transmission from a handheld device by use one-side beam-steering and mechanical 

waveplate rotation in the receiver. Here we address these issue by use a novel agile dual-MEMS mirror-based beam- 

steer system combine with a reference frame independent (RFI) QKD protocol to provide wider angular, translational 

tolerance and rotational independence respectively. This result in the first stable quantum link from a handheld device 

able to transmit a secure key in less than a second. 

In order to compensate for hand-held operation instabilities, we characterise typical hand-movement and accordingly 

design a system with optimal latency and tolerance. Based on this evaluation, we implement the system use MEMs 

mirror for beam-steering at both end of the link. Their orientation be control by a track system use LED beacon 

and Position sense detector (PSD) at both end of the steer system. This implementation allow u to obtain a wide 

angular coverage and minimise latency, thus guarantee the robustness against hand movements. 

The RFI QKD protocol propose by Laing, A. et al. 25, and experimentally demonstrate by Wabnig, J. et al.26 allows 

polarization encode without the requirement of align the polarization bases. In this protocol the qubits be encode 

and measure in three polarization base (horizontal-vertical, diagonal-anti-diagonal, circular left-circular right). Only one 

of those base need to have a fix alignment between the transmitter and the receiver. As the circular basis be unaffected 

by relative rotation of the transmitter and the receiver in polarization encoding, it be therefore use to transmit the secret 

keys. The two linear base can have any relative alignment and be use to ass the security parameter of the quantum 

channel. Based on this protocol, we demonstrate a practical quantum secure wireless link between a terminal and a 

handheld device use a steerable optical link. 





Results 
QKD transmitter and receiver modules. The RFI QKD transmitter and receiver module be represent in Figs. 1a and 

1b respectively. RFI QKD be base on the transmission and detection of qubits encode in three bases. Here the qubits be 

implement by polarization encode faint pulses. In order to produce these 6 optical states, we use 6 resonant-cavity Light 

Emitting Diodes (RCLEDs, 650nm). The light produce by each of the RCLED be collimate and transmit through a 

set of Polarizing Beam Splitters (PBS), non-polarizing Beam Splitters (BS) and waveplates (WP). The polarization of the 

light produce by each RCLED be thus purify and rotate in order to exit the transmitter in one of the 6 require 

polarization states. The optical signal be then attenuate by a neutral density (ND) filter to obtain faint pulses. In order to 

avoid side-channel attacks27 the optical state originate from all the RCLEDs must be identical apart from their 

polarizations. This mean that their spatial, spectral, and time profile should be identical. Spatial and spectral 

indistinguishability be achieve by use a spatial filter with a diffraction limited pinhole and a spectral filter with a 

passband narrower than the sources’ emission spectrum (see Methods). Fig. 2a show the result spectrum from the six 

sources. Time profile of the light emit by each source be measure by a single photon detector collect photon at 

the output of the transmitter. The result statistics, show on Fig. 2b, exhibit a very good timing overlap. 

In the demonstration the RCLEDs be driven by a 6-channel pattern generator. Every 4ns (i.e. a 250MHz repetition rate), 

a 1ns pulse be generate in one of the six channels, this channel be determine by a pseudo-random pattern. The voltage 

level drive each channel be adjust to ensure that the output power be identical for the 6 polarizations. The power be 

then reduce to 0.07 photon per pulse with a neutral density (ND) filter. This value be chosen to obtain a sufficiently 

small probability for a pulse to contain more than one photon (see Methods).

(e) Experimenter hold the hand-held transmitter. Also show the receiver module in use. 





The receiver module (Fig. 1b) have a similar structure to the transmitter. First, the light be spectrally filter with the same 

passband a the transmitter filter. Then, light propagates through the same PBS, BS and WP arrangement a the transmitter, 

which split the light accord to it polarization and distributes it to six different channels. Light be then couple into six 

lensed multimode fibres, which be connect to the Silicon Avalanche Photo-Detectors (SiAPD) use for photon counting. 

Agile beam-steering module. The beam-steering module must compensate for hand movement, and ensure that the 

angular misalignment of the transmitter and receiver remains within the field of view of the QKD communication system. 

The angular fluctuation of typical hand movement be analyse by measure the position of a hand-held laser pointer 

spot a a function of time. Fig. 3a show the complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) of the angle create 

by hand-movement. This indicates the speed at which any correction must be make to the field of view of the optical 

system. Our receiver’s the field of view, which be set by the numerical aperture of the lensed multimode fibre and 

associate optics, be 0.1 degree. This mean that correction must be make within approximately 42ms. 

Different technique can be use to allow the terminal to locate each other before communication. The QKD signal be too 

weak for tracking. Using wavelength-division-multiplexing, two beacon signal be add to system to allow simultaneous 

track and QKD operation. To minimise the system latency, a scheme use independent LED beacon be use here. 

Each terminal have a beacon that indicates it position, and a position sensitive detector (PSD) to measure the location of 

the beacon on the other terminal. This dual beacon system allows the two terminal to track each other independently, 

result in low-latency. Fig. 1c show the system we use for dynamic beam-steering. A green LED beacon (520nm) 

align with the QKD optical mode be use in the transmitter, to indicate it position to the receiver, allow it to perform 

adjustment of it field of view. For the receiver to evaluate the transmitter’s position, light from the beacon enters the 

receiver and be divert to a PSD via a MEMs steer mirror. The PSD then measure the angle of arrival of the beacon 

light, create a signal that steer the MEMs mirror until the beacon light be centre on the PSD. This set the receiver 

mirror angle so that photon come from the direction of the QKD transmitter will be couple into the lensed fibres. The 

receiver also have a co-aligned infrared LED beacon (850nm), which allows the transmitter to orientate it MEMs mirror 

and steer the QKD photon towards the receiver. In operation, coverage of +/-4o be achieved, a show in Fig. 3b.

and the photon detections. 



QKD performance evaluation. Initial static test be undertaken, for different steer angles. It be found that the 

optical element in the beam-steering system (and to a small extent the beam splitter inside the transmitter and the receiver) 

introduce an undesired birefringence lead to polarization rotation of the QKD beams. RFI QKD be tolerant to 

polarization rotations, but not to ellipticity alterations, so a WP be add inside the beam-steering module to compensate 

for this. The induced birefringence be also dependent on the MEMS mirror angle, which varies, and therefore cannot be 

compensate with a static WP, but it be found that the increase in the error rate remain within 3% over the whole 

steer range. 

In order to ensure absolute secrecy of the transmit key, the raw key that be transmit with the circularly polarize 

photon need to be process use error correction and privacy amplification codes. These reduce the key size to a 

fraction of it original size, call the secure key fraction. This secure key fraction be calculate base on correlation 

between the number of photon transmit in each polarization state and the number of detection in each receiver channel, 

use the method described in the Methods section (based on Wabnig, J. et al.26). These calculation take into account 

potential polarization impurity and non-orthogonality and it include finite key analysis. 

In order to demonstrate the robustness of our system against axial rotation (i.e. rotation around the transmission direction) 

we introduce a rotate half-wave plate between the emitter and the receiver, which be equivalent to a rotation of the 

transmitter by an angle equal to twice the value of the waveplate angle. The secure key fraction a a function of the 

equivalent rotation angle be show on Fig. 4. Here the secure key fraction be calculate for 0.5s key transmissions. We 

can see that not only transmission of secure key be possible for any angle but the secure key fraction remain between 

40% and 60% over a 360 degree rotation. The secure key fraction be also calculate by use the BB84 protocol with the 

same photon counts, and therefore keep two base out of three to calculate the key fraction. In this case we can see that 

the system performance would drop very quickly with the transmitter angle. RFI protocol be superior to BB84 for each 

point except for the angle of 170 degrees. This be due to the fact that the calculation we use for the BB84 curve assumes 

perfect polarization orthogonality, while our RFI calculation take the most pessimistic possibility without assume 

perfect polarization. 



Rotations around the other ax induced small modification of the photons’ polarization but with minor effect on the 

secure key fraction. The secure key fraction over the whole possible range of deflection of the mirror remain between 

35% and 65%. 

The system operates in normal ambient light condition (>400 lux from incandescent light bulbs). The detector dark count 

rate be 370 counts/s per detector, and the noise due to ambient light be 600 photons/s per detector. The beacon LEDs 

additionally contribute approximately 570 photons/s per detector. These number be small compare to the ~1M photons/s 

that be detect for the QKD link, and induced error rate due to these impairment be negligible. 

Quantum Key Distribution from a handheld device be demonstrate by hold the transmitter and point it at a static 

receiver. The whole optical assembly include the QKD and beam steer module be part of the mobile handheld 

device, while the electrical instrument be static and connect to the handheld part by cables. Two set of experiment 

be performed. First, in order to illustrate the fluctuation of the asymptotic key rate in real time, measurement be 

perform while the experimenter hold the device perform a series of voluntary movements. To calculate this

error corrected, privacy amplify key length) be plot a a function of the relative axial angle between the transmitter and the receiver. 

The value be calculate from a 0.5s data transmission for each point, for a fix position of the terminals. The relative axial angle 

between the transmitter and the receiver be simulated by rotate a half-wave plate between the terminals. 



asymptotic key rate, short (4ms) sample of QKD transmission be collect every 100ms, which be the time require to 

process the photon arrival times. Fig. 5a show the vertical and horizontal angle of the two MEMS mirror a well a the 

axial angle. Mirror angle be derive from the apply voltage while the axial angle be derive from the photon statistics, 

which depend on the polarization angle (see Methods). The alignment system be switch on after 4s, and no data be 

receive before this point. Then we can see that the experimenter move the transmitter up, down, left, right and finally 

performs an axial rotation.

detect photon divide by the total number of emit photon (i.e. 0.07 x 250MHz), while the error rate only take into 

account the photon use for the secure key (i.e. photon transmit and receive in the Z basis). After start the steer

system, the transmission stabilizes at around 3% with a few short drop and the error rate be approximately 6%. Fig. 5c 

show an estimation of the asymptotic key rate a a function of time, indicate a rate of approximately 30kb/s with very 

few drop to zero. Fluctuations in this rate be due to the short measurement samples. 

Second, in order to demonstrate the performance of our system during a real handheld transaction, include the finite key 

effects, a series of 14 separate measurement be perform with a duration of 0.5s each, while the experimenter be 

hold the transmitter without any intentional movement. The average value of the secure key rate, after the finite key 

effect be take into account, be 45kb/s with a standard deviation of 10kb/s. These result show that our system can reliably 

transmit secret key long enough to overcome the finite key limitation in a very short time. 



Discussion 

In this paper, we have successfully construct the first quantum wireless prototype for handheld usage fulfil finite key 

requirements. The beam-steering technique use maintain a motion-stabilized communication link, which allow 

sufficient secure key to be transmit with a high throughput under hand-movement and typical ambient light levels. 

A number of improvement be possible. An increase key rate could be achieve by use a decoy state protocol28,29, For 

full mobile device integration, further miniaturization of the emitter could be obtain by fabricate the RCLEDs on a 

single chip and combine the polarization with photonic waveguide a previously demonstrate with VCSELs20. The 

steer system could also be miniaturize by take advantage of the fast improvement and size reduction of laser-based 

pico-projection systems30. 

The success of wireless QKD technology could introduce an unprecedented level of data security to merchant and 

customer alike. Making QKD economical and practical enough be essential to overcome the adoption barrier before 

security threat start to appear with the increase of compute power and efficiency of hack techniques. This 

demonstration of handheld quantum wireless prototype represent a major step towards real-world quantum security for 

mobile applications. 



Methods 
Fabrication of QKD transmitter and receiver modules. The light source use in the receiver be resonant cavity LEDs (RCLEDs) 

with a central wavelength of approximately 656 nm and a spectral width of 7nm. In order to ensure identical transmission spectra, a 
spectral filter with a passband (1.5 nm centre at 658 nm) narrower than the RCLED emission spectrum be use to select the light that 

will be transmitted. The choice of RCLEDs over laser diode or LEDs be important for this application. First, RCLEDs have a wider 

spectrum than lasers, without multiple mode structure. The disparity between the central wavelength of the different RC-LEDs be 

small than the spectral width, the light go through a narrow band filter will be similar for each RC-LED (Fig. 2a). This be very 

difficult to achieve with laser because they need to be tune with a tolerance small than their individual modes’ width and filter 

with a narrower filter. Second, RCLEDs can be modulate faster than LEDs, make it possible to transmit a large number of photon 

compare to the constant detector noise rate and thus, increase the key rate. The spatial filter be compose of a first aperture with a 
1mm diameter follow by a focus lens (f=6.24mm) and a second aperture with a 5 micron diameter (comparable to the Airy disk 

diameter). This ensures any difference in mode profile or propagation direction between source be eliminated. The light be then 

collimate with an f=11mm lens. Both the transmitter and receiver base plate be fabricate use aluminium terminate with modify 

16mm cage plate to house the spatial filter and to enable easy integration with the beam-steering system. Alignment of the receiver’s 

lensed multimode fibre be achieve use spherical bearing to give the degree of freedom required. All component be fix in 

place use UV cure adhesives. A 10dB neutral density (ND) filter be add after the transmitter to obtain the require faint pulse 

intensity. Waveplates (WP) be add in the transmitter and receiver steer module to correct for their induced birefringences. The 

WP angle around vertical axis a well a the relative angle of the QKD and steer module be adjust to obtain perfectly circular 

polarization in the Z basis. We also take advantage of the fact that the additional WP act essentially a a quarter waveplate to swap 

the X and Z basis by rotate the QKD receiver module by 45 degree. This allows u to have the Z basis (used for the secure key) nearer 

to the receiver input. By construction this make the detection probability and the polarization purity high than when the Z basis be at 

the opposite end of the receiver. 

Beam-steering module. Commercial Position sense detector (PSDs) and MEMS mirror (ϕ=4.2mm) be used. For the mirror, large 

area lead to longer latency, mainly due to the inertia, but lead to a good reliability by reflect more off-axis beams. This PSD and 

MEMS mirror combination enable a low latency suitable for an agile correction of hand-movement. Diverging beacon LEDs (LED 

Engine Inc. 520nm for transmitter and 850nm for receiver) be used. The wavelength be chosen to ensure enough separation 

between the weak QKD signal at 658nm and the strong beacon signals, and to help aim to the receiver with 520nm visible light. 

Dichroic beam splitter of FF750 and FF562 (Semrock Inc.) be used. 

QKD secure key rate calculations. Our security analysis take into account that, in real implementations, not only reference frame of 

the transmitter and the receiver can be rotate with respect to each other, but also that there be always a degree of misalignment within a 



reference frame. This induces non-orthogonality within a basis and mutual bias between bases. Our analysis also take into account 

differ detector efficiencies. This be achieve by use an explicit device model and minimise the key rate over possible model 

parameters. The calculation of the secret key fraction can be pose a an inference problem: give the measurement and a device model, 

what be the maximum amount of information an eavesdropper can posse about the distribute key? 

Following the derivation in Wabnig, J. et al.26 we can express the secret key fraction a 

𝑟 = 𝑆𝑚𝑖𝑛 − ℎ ( 
1 − 𝐶𝑍𝑍 + 𝜎𝛿𝐶𝑍𝑍 

2 
). 

We take into account imperfect measurement device that can lead to a large number of additional parameters, such a non- 

orthogonality in the preparation and measurement base and detector efficiencies, which can be collect into the vector 𝜶. The usable 
entropy be obtain a the minimum over all parameter 𝜶, 𝜆1,2 

𝑆𝑚𝑖𝑛 = min 
𝛼,𝜆1,𝜆2 

𝑆𝑈(𝜆1, 𝜆2) . 

The parameter have to obey the constraint impose by the observation 

𝑓𝑖(𝑚) − 𝜎𝛿𝑓𝑖(𝒎) ≤ 𝑓𝑖[𝒒(𝜶, 𝜆1, 𝜆2)] ≤ 𝑓𝑖(𝒎) − 𝜎𝛿𝑓𝑖(𝒎), 

where 𝒎 be a matrix contain all relevant detector counts, 𝒒 be the correspond probability of observe a detector count accord 
to the device model, the 𝑓𝑖 be the function define the different constraints, the 𝛿𝑓𝑖 be their correspond variance and 𝜎 be chosen 
to give a certain probability that the estimate usable entropy be too high. In our parameter estimation step we use a set of 21 constraint 

consist of 9 correlation functions𝐶𝐴𝐵 , 𝐴, 𝐵 = 𝑋, 𝑌, 𝑍, the six probability that a photon be prepared in a certain polarisation 
direction 𝑃𝐴±, 𝐴 = 𝑋, 𝑌, 𝑍 and the six probability to detect in a certain detector 𝐷𝐵±, 𝐵 = 𝑋, 𝑌, 𝑍. For each function 𝑓𝑖 we can give 
the standard deviation 𝑓𝑖 . To obtain the secret key fraction we need to subtract the observe relative entropy in the key base from the 
usable entropy 

The full set of measurement enables u to calculate a reference frame independent key rate. From the detector count we can construct 

9 correlation function 

𝐶𝐴𝐵 = 
𝑚++ 

𝐴𝐵+𝑚−− 
𝐴𝐵−𝑚+− 

𝐴𝐵−𝑚−+ 
𝐴𝐵 

𝑚++ 
𝐴𝐵+𝑚−− 

𝐴𝐵+𝑚+− 
𝐴𝐵+𝑚−+ 

𝐴𝐵 , 𝐴, 𝐵 = 𝑋, 𝑌, 𝑍, 

where the 𝑚±± 
𝐴𝐵 be the four different detector count give that the qubit be prepared in direction 𝐴 ± and detect in direction 𝐵 ± . 

In the case of orthonormal preparation and measurement bases, these can be directly identify with the qubit correlation functions. 

Each preparation and each detector be associate with a direction on the Poincaré sphere, give by a unit vector. Since we aim to use 

the z-basis for the key bit we can identify two preparation direction with the ± 𝑧 direction on the Poincaré sphere, without 
overestimate the secret key fraction. Each direction be parametrised by two variable (e.g. azimuth and polar angle), result in a total 

of 20 free parameters. Different absorption may occur in the preparation channels, and similarly detector may have different efficiencies. 

With six possible preparation direction and six possible detection direction this add another set of 12 parameters. The quantum channel 

can be represent by a two parameter two qubit density matrix in a simplification over the more commonly employ Bell diagonal 

density matrix. This result in a model with 34 free parameters. The secret key fraction be then obtain a the minimum over all 

parameter that fulfil the constraint impose by the measurements, e.g. from the correlators 𝐶𝐴𝐵; in our case a set of 21 constraints. For 
the number of detector count approach infinity the constraint be equalities, but for a finite number of observation the value can 

lie within an interval determine by the number of count and the desire uncertainty. A small number of count will lead to large 

uncertainty in the correlation function and therefore to low result for the secret key fraction. Finally, since we don’t use single photon 

source in the transmitter, we need to consider the occasional transmission of multi-photon pulses, which could be exploit by an 

adversary able to non-destructively detect those pulse and extract one of the photons. According to Poisson statistics, the probability 

for a pulse to contain 1 photon be approximately 0.07 and the probability to have more than one photon be approximately 0.072/2. This 

mean that amongst the detection event we use to build the secret key, a proportion equal to 0.035 be accessible by the adversary, which 

be very small compare to the overall secure key fraction (~0.5). In any case, privacy amplification and error correction will use a key 
fraction slightly low than the theoretical limit to ensure an extra guaranty of secrecy. 

Axial angle estimation. The correlators define in the above section can also be use to estimate the relative axial angle between the 

QKD base of the transmitter and the receiver. Several combination of correlators can be use to calculate the angle. This calculation 

base on single photon count be intrinsically noisy. In order to reduce this noise a median of the different possible way to retrieve the 

angle  be calculated: 

= median ( atan2(CXY,CXX)+45, atan2(CYX,CXX)+ 45, -atan2(CYX,CYY) -135, -atan2(CXY,CYY) -135). 

The 45 degree rotation be due to the rotation of the QKD module in the receiver a explain in the “Fabrication of QKD transmitter and 

receiver modules” section of the Methods. This calculation be base on the photon counts, a low transmission doesn’t allow u to 
retrieve an accurate angle. This be why there be a miss section in Fig. 5a around 9.5 seconds. This corresponds to a transmission drop.
