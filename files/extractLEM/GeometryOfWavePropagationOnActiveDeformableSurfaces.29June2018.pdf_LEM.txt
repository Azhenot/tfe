Fundamental biological and biomimetic processes, from tissue morphogenesis to soft robotics, rely on the propagation of chemical and mechanical 

surface wave to signal and coordinate active force generation. The complex interplay between surface geometry and contraction wave dynamic 

remains poorly understood, but it will be essential for the future design of chemically driven soft robot and active materials. Here, we couple prototypical 

chemical wave and reaction-diffusion model to non-Euclidean shell mechanic to identify and characterize generic feature of chemomechanical wave 

propagation on active deformable surfaces. Our theoretical framework be validate against recent data from contractile wave measurement on ascidian 

and starfish oocytes, produce good quantitative agreement in both cases. The theory be then apply to illustrate how geometry and preexist discrete 

symmetry can be utilized to focus active elastic surface waves. We highlight the practical potential of chemomechanical couple by demonstrate 

spontaneous wave-induced locomotion of elastic shell of various geometries. Altogether, our result show how geometry, elasticity, and chemical 

signal can be harness to construct dynamically adaptable, autonomously move mechanical surface waveguides.
