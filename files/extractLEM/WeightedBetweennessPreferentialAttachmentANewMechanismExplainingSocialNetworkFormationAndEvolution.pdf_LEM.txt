Weighted Betweenness 
Preferential Attachment: A New 
Mechanism Explaining Social 
Network Formation and Evolution 
Alexandru Topirceanu1, Mihai Udrescu1 & Radu Marculescu 2 

The dynamic of social network be a complex process, a there be many factor which contribute to 
the formation and evolution of social links. While certain real-world property be capture by the 
degree-driven preferential attachment model, it still cannot fully explain social network dynamics. 
Indeed, important property such a dynamic community formation, link weight evolution, or degree 
saturation cannot be completely and simultaneously described by state of the art models. In this 
paper, we explore the distribution of social network parameter and centrality and argue that node 
degree be not the main attractor of new social links. Consequently, a node betweenness prof to 
be paramount to attract new link – a well a strengthen exist link –, we propose the new 
Weighted Betweenness Preferential Attachment (WBPA) model, which render quantitatively robust 
result on realistic network metrics. Moreover, we support our WBPA model with a socio-psychological 
interpretation, that offer a deeper understand of the mechanic behind social network dynamics. 

Despite the widespread use of the Gaussian distribution in science and technology, many social, biological, and 
technological network be good described by a power-law (Zipf) distribution of node degree (the node degree 
be the number of link incident to a node). The Barabasi-Albert (BA) model, base on the degree-driven prefer- 
ential attachment, generates such scale free network with a power-law distribution of node degree P(k) = k−λ. 
In fact, degree preferential attachment (DPA) be widely consider to be one of the main factor behind complex 
network evolution (the scale-free topology generate with the BA model be able to capture other real-world 
social network property such a a low average path length L)1,2. However, recent research challenge the idea 
that the scale free property be prevalent in complex networks3. Additionally, the degree-driven preferential attach- 
ment model have well-known limitation to accurately describe social network (i.e., complex network where 
node represent individual or social agents, and link represent social tie or social relationships), owe to the 
follow considerations: 

• People be physically and psychologically limited to a maximum number of real-world friendships; this 
imposes a saturation limit on node degree4,5. Conversely, in the BA model no such limit exists. 

• People have weight relationships, i.e., not all tie be equally important: an average person know roughly 
350 persons, can actively befriend no more than 150 people (Dunbar’s number)4, and have only a few very 
strong social tie (links)6. The BA model do not account for such link weights7. 

• The structure and dynamic of community in social network be not accurately described with DPA7–11. 

To address these issues, recent research have combine the DPA model with property derive directly from 
empirical data. For instance, there exist proposal which add the small-world property to scale-free model 
(e.g., Holme-Kim model12, evolve scale-free networks13) or the power-law distribution to small-worlds (e.g., 
the Watts-Strogatz model with degree distribution14, multistage random grow small-worlds15, evolve 
small-worlds16, random connectivity small-worlds17). Other research proposal extend Milgram’s experiment18,

e.g., static-geographic19 and cellular20 models. However, all these model be still not accurate enough when com- 
par against real-world social networks. 

To good understand the real-world accuracy problem, we perform a topological analysis on a variety of 
real-world network datasets and show that node betweenness (which express the node quality of be “in 
between” communities) be power-law distribute and–at the same time–correlated with link weight distributions. 
Our empirical finding align well with previous research in some particular cases11,21. Such empirical piece of 
evidence suggest that, for social networks, the node degree be not the main driver of preferential attachment; 
therefore other centrality may be good attractor of social ties. We conclude that node betweenness–as oppose 
to node degree or any other centrality metric–is the key attractor for new social ties. 

Consequently, a the main theoretical contribution, we introduce the new Weighted Betweenness Preferential 
Attachment (WBPA) model, which be a simple yet fundamental mechanism to replicate real-world social net- 
work topology more accurately than other state-of-the-art models. More precisely, we show that the WBPA 
model be the first social network model that be able to replicate community structure while it simultaneously: (i) 
explains how link weight evolve, and (ii) reproduces the natural saturation of degree in hub nodes. 

Finally, we further interpret WBPA from a socio-psychological perspective, which may explain why node 
betweenness be such an important factor behind social network formation and evolution. 

Results 
Centrality statistics. We investigate the distribution of node betweenness on a variety of social network 
datasets: Facebook user (590 nodes), Google Plus user (638 nodes), weight co-authorships in network sci- 
ence (1589 nodes), weight online social network (1899 nodes), weight Bitcoin web of trust (5881 nodes), 
unweighted Wikipedia vote (7115 nodes), weight scientific collaboration network (7343 nodes), unweighted 
Condensed Matter collaboration (23 K nodes), weight MathOverflow user interaction (25 K nodes), 
unweighted HEP citation (28 K nodes), POK social network (29 K nodes), unweighted email interaction (37 K 
nodes), IMDB actor (48 K nodes), Brightkite OSN user (58 K nodes), Facebook - New Orleans (64 K nodes), 
respectively Epinions (76 K nodes), Slashdot (82 K nodes) and Timik (364 K nodes) on-line platforms. To improve 
the robustness of our analysis, we ensure data diversity by consider network datasets with different sizes, 
weight and unweighted, and represent various type of social relationship (see Methods). 

Our first observation be that, in all datasets, node degree, node betweenness, link betweenness, and link 
weight (for datasets with weight links) be power-law distributed. Moreover, the power-law slope of degree 
distribution be steeper in comparison with node betweenness distribution. More precisely, a present in Fig. 1a, 
the average degree slope be γdeg = 2.097 (standard deviation σ = 0.774) and the average betweenness slope be 
γbtw = 1.609 (σ = 0.431), meaning that γdeg be typically 30.3% steeper than γbtw across all datasets (details in SI.1. 
Social network datasets statistics). Also, for all consider datasets there be a significant non-linear (polynomial 
or exponential) correlation between node betweenness and node degree (see Fig. 1b); this further suggests that 
node betweenness may be the source of imbalance in node degree distribution. The statistic for the entire dataset 
collection be present in SI.1. 

The second observation be that–unlike node degree–node betweenness be significantly more correlate with 
the weight of the incident links. After assess the correlation between both node betweenness and node degree 
with the weight sum of all adjacent links, we argue that betweenness act a an attractor for strong ties. For 
example, for the co-authorships weight network with 1589 nodes23, the top 5% link accumulate 27.4% of the 
total weight in the graph; these top 5% link be incident to node which amass 80.2% of the total node between- 
ness, but only 14.9% of the total node degree (see Fig. 2–further numerical detail in SI.1, Table 2). In all analyze 
weight datasets, node betweenness correlate with incident link weight by ratio that be 2.5–9 time high 
than node degree–link weight association (additional detail in SI.1, Fig. 2). 

The first observation indicates a significant correlation between node degree and node betweenness but it 
do not necessarily imply causation. However, the second observation be that betweenness attracts strong link 
which, in turn, trigger more imbalance in degree distribution; this suggests that node betweenness be behind

highlight for node degree (blue) and node betweenness (red). (b) Non-linear correlation of node betweenness 
and node degree in a representative weight on-line social network (OSN)22 with 1899 nodes. These result 
show that, in social networks, degree and betweenness have a power-law distribution (with a steeper slope for 
degree), and that there be a non-linear correlation between the two centralities.

network evolution, while the power-law degree distribution be only a by-product. The importance of node 
betweenness be further support by the analysis of centrality dynamics. To this end, we provide the example of 
an on-line social network, UPT.social, which be intend to facilitate social interaction between student and 
member of faculty at University Politehnica of Timişoara, Romania24. Right after it launch in 2016, UPT.social 
attract hundred of users, and the entire dynamical process of new link formation be record a snapshot 
of the first 6 week (T0 − T5). As exemplify in Fig. 3 (and further detailed in SI.3, Fig. 6), the node with high 
betweenness become the principal attractor of new social ties; we also note that the top 3 node attract new 
edge at time snapshot T2 be the one which maximize their betweenness beforehand, and then trigger a sub- 
sequent degree increase. As shown, once node degree begin to saturate (T3 − T5), node betweenness drops, a 
node fulfill their initial bridging potential. 

Betweenness preferential attachment (BPA). In what follows, we propose the betweenness preferential 
attachment model (BPA) and conjecture that–for social networks–it be more realistic than the degree preferential 
attachment (DPA) model. The fundamental difference between the degree-driven and betweenness-driven pref- 
erential attachment be illustrate in Fig. 4; the upper panel show that, under the DPA rule, the node with high 
degree (colored in orange) gain an even high degree. In contrast, the low panel in Fig. 4 show that, under the 
BPA rule, the node with high betweenness (orange) attract more link and increase their degrees; in turn this 
decrease their betweenness via a redistribution process, thus limit the number of new link for high-degree 
node a a second order effect. This may explain why, in real-world networks, the number of new link be limited 
for high degree node (i.e., degree saturation). 

WBPA model. Besides validate the BPA mechanism, we also realize that all the empirical network data gath- 
ered in a real-world context be weighted, even if the information about link weight be not always available. For 
example, there be no link weight information in our Facebook and Google Plus datasets, yet these network be 
clearly part of a weight social context in which each link have a distinct social strength. Realistic network evolve 
accord to a mechanism which considers link weights, therefore we develop the weight BPA (WBPA) algo- 
rithm to characterize the social network evolution.

to link with weight within the top 1% to 100% percentile (a) in the Geom network (7343 nodes, 11898 links), 
and (b) in the Co-authorships network (1589 nodes, 2742 links). The Betweenness/Degree ratio (B/D) range 
between 2.5–9, highlight that top link weight be predominantly incident to high betweenness nodes, rather 
than high degree nodes.

The WBPA algorithm for link weight assignment accord to the fitness-weight correlation be give in Fig. 5 
and discuss below. In the case of WBPA, the fitness f be node betweenness. Note that even though link weight 
wij be not use directly during the growth phase, they have a significant second order impact: Betweenness 
depends on the shortest path in the graph, which in turn be highly dependent on link weights. Link weight 
be update in step 3 of the WBPA algorithm, and whenever a weight becomes ≤0, the correspond link be 
removed. 

Weighted BPA Algorithm (WBPA). 

1) Distribute weights: Begin with an arbitrarily connect graph G with node V and bidirectional link E 
(i.e., for ∀eij ∃ eji). A weight wij be add for each link eij in the graph, so that wij be proportional to fitness fj of 
the target node vj. For each node vi, all incident link weight wij be normalize so that the outgo weight- 
ed degree be 1. 

2) Growth (BPA): At every step, a new node vk be introduced; the new node try to connect to n (1 ≤ n ≤ V) 
exist node in G. The probability pi that vk becomes connect to an exist node vi be proportional to 
fitness fi. Therefore, we have = ∑ ∈p f f/i i j V j where the sum be make over all node in the graph. 

3) Dynamic weight redistribution: Once a new node vk becomes connect to an exist node vi, weight wki 
and wik be initialize with the normalize fitness fi and fk respectively. As the weight outgo degree 
of node vi increase by wik, every other weight wij be rescale with −wik/n, where n be the previous number 
of neighbor of node vi. 

Figure 4. The mechanism of degree preferential attachment (DPA) versus betweenness preferential 
attachment (BPA) depict in term of acquire new link and limit the (excessive) accumulation of degree 
over time. In DPA, node with high degree attract even more links, and thus node degree increase ad infinitum. 
Conversely, in BPA, node attract new link because of their high betweenness will eventually lose their 
betweenness in favor of their neighbor nodes, thus limit the acquire degree.

Assessing the realism of WBPA. WBPA defines complex interaction between link weight and node 
centralities, hence we expect emerge phenomenon such a n-order effects. Therefore, a mathematical analysis of 
WBPA would be cumbersome and beyond the scope of our paper. Instead, a validation strategy, we test WBPA 
against several preferential attachment (PA) model to explore which one produce the most realistic social net- 
work topology. To this end, we quantify preferential attachment accord to a fitness function f which express 
the capability of individual node to attract new connection (e.g., if f be chosen to be node degree Deg, then we 
reproduce the classic BA model2). We consider f a one of the follow network centralities: degree Deg (DPA 
model), betweenness Btw (WBPA model), eigenvector centrality EC (ECPA model), closeness Cls (ClsPA model), 
and cluster coefficient CC (CCPA model). Each node centrality be define in the Methods section. The com- 
parison between synthetic and real-world network be do through topological similarity assessment support 
by the statistical fidelity metric25, alongside standard deviation and p-values. Fidelity take value ϕ ∈ [0, 1] with 
1 represent a network that be identical with the reference network (see the Methods section for more details). 

We also make use of the follow graph metric to characterize and compare networks: average degree (AD), 
average path length (APL), average cluster coefficient (ACC), modularity (Mod), graph diameter (Dmt), and 
graph density (Dns). We start by measure the distribution of these six metric on the 18 select real-word 
datasets. To ass which centrality be the most appropriate a fitness function, we start by generate network 
accord to each PA model, of increase sizes: N = {1K, 2K, 5K, 10K, 50K, 100K} nodes; the full statistical result 
be present in SI.2. Best fitness for preferential attachment. Aggregating the statistical result from SI.2–Fig. 4 
(real-world data) and Fig. 5 (PA networks), we provide an intuitive visual comparison in Fig. 6 between the 
average evolution of the six graph metric on the real-world data (N = 590 to N = 364 K nodes), and on the 
degree-driven and betweenness-driven PA networks. 

To good illustrate the comparison between the synthetic PA network and the real-world datasets, we present 
the trend line for each graph metric in Fig. 6; for the real-world data network the trend line be green-dotted, for 
Btw fitness network be blue, and for Deg fitness network be red. On close inspection, we uncover the following: 

• AD in real data evolves differently than in PA networks. 
• APL evolution in real data resembles Btw network much good than Deg networks. We measure a statisti- 

cal fidelity of ϕBtw = 0.925 and ϕDeg = 0.853. 
• ACC evolution in real data resembles Btw more than Deg, with statistical fidelity of ϕBtw = 0.665 and 

ϕDeg = 0.515. 
• Mod evolution in real data resembles both network very well, with statistical fidelity of ϕBtw = 0.814 and 

ϕDeg = 0.812 (a slight advantage for the Btw networks). 
• Dmt evolution in real data resembles Deg more than Btw. Even though we see the same type of increase, 

Deg produce longer diameter a see in the majority of real-word data. The measure statistical fidelity 
be ϕBtw = 0.796 and ϕDeg = 0.836. 

• Dns evolution in real data resembles both networks, with statistical fidelity of ϕBtw = 0.634 and 
ϕDeg = 0.634. 

For simplicity, Fig. 6 include only Deg and Btw PA network in the comparison with real-world data; the full 
numerical data–with all PA network models–are detailed in Table 1. All these result demonstrate the superior 
realism provide by the WBPA in comparison to the classic DPA principle, a well a in comparison to PA driven 
by other node centrality such a eigenvector, closeness or cluster coefficient. 

We strengthen our analysis by present several direct comparison between real network and synthetic PA 
networks, generate with the same node size a the real-world reference networks. The comparison be make 

Figure 5. Network evolution accord to the Weighted BPA algorithm. (a) All bidirectional link E in graph G 
be initialize with weight wij and wji, respectively. Each outgo link weight of node v1 be proportional to the 
fitness function (indicated a w f∼ ) of the target neighbor nodes, and then normalize such that the sum of 
outgo weight be 1. (b) New node v6 connects to exist one v1–v5 base on probability that be 
proportional to the normalize fitness (p f∼ ) of the target nodes. Say, v6 connects only to v1 base on fitness f1. 
(c) Once v6 and v1 connect, node v1 assigns a weight w1−6 on the new link that be proportional to fitness f6. As 
such, a proportional weight ratio of w1−6/4 be subtract (indicated with a minus sign) from the four already 
exist links. If any of the newly result weight drop below 0, the correspond link be remove from node 
v1. According to the BPA principle, the fitness f be represent by the node betweenness centrality.

work) to serve a baseline. The standard deviation for each synthetic dataset metric be symbolize with a ± sign.

The mechanism of preferential attachment which we adopt in our paper be a fundamental, yet generic and 
simple framework. State of the art study which be specifically aim at create realistic topology propose 
algorithm with a far increase complexity. Therefore, intuitively, it be expect that state of the art model like 
Cellular (Cell)20, Home-Kim (HK)12, Toivonen (TV)26, or Watts-Strogatz with degree distribution (WSDD)14 
etc., will generate more realistic topology in term of the six discuss graph metrics. To test this hypothesis, we 
further generate such synthetic network of size N = 10,000 and compare them with WBPA, DPA network and 
several real-world datasets. The result be provide in Table 3, show that not only be WBPA superior to DPA 
and PA model driven by other centrality but, in most case (i.e., 10 out of 13), it outperforms the other synthetic 
model in term of topological fidelity a well. For readability purpose we do not add information about the 
standard deviation of each synthetic model here; this information may be found in SI.4, Tables 4 and 5. 

To offer the diversity require by a robust test of our model, we also include unweighted network in our col- 
lection. A fair comparison between WBPA network (which be all weighted) and the large and unweighted 
example networks, require that all weight on our WBPA algorithm output be discarded. In this comparison, we 
start by generate WBPA network of 10,000 nodes, then make all weight >w 0ji become 1, thus obtain 
unweighted BPA networks. 

The upper half of Table 3 contains the average fidelity of WBPA, DPA and the two null model networks, 
towards the real-world reference networks. The low half of Table 3 contains the other state of the art synthetic 
networks. Our WBPA obtains the high fidelity towards most empirical references, e.g., 13–68% high ϕFB, 
21–81% high ϕOSN, 4–47% high ϕTK than all other synthetic models. As such, we prove the increase realism 
of our model in comparison with some elaborate state-of-the-art model (briefly described in SI.4, and quanti- 
fied in SI.4, Table 4). Compared to DPA, our model produce network with high fidelity values; when average 
over all empirical network we obtain: 0 831Btwφ = . and 0 777Degφ = . . 

We note that the WBPA model produce a specific distribution of the Betweenness/Degree (B/D) ratio. To 
this end, we measure B/D distribution on all datasets (weighted and unweighted), a well a on our synthetic

WBPA-generated networks, use the Gini coefficient (a Gini coefficient take value between 0 and 1, with value 
closer to 0 represent a more uniform dispersion of data) to evaluate data dispersion27. The Gini value obtain 
on the empirical data be give in Table 4: all empirical datasets, whether weight or unweighted, have their Gini 
coefficient within a similar range, i.e., the average real-world Gini be greal = 0.5193 ± 0.071. Indeed, for WBPA 
network with 10,000 nodes, we have an average Gini coefficient of gWBPA = 0.4962 ± 0.0282, which be very close 
to the real-world B/D Gini value (−4.5%). Additionally, we generate 10 of each random, small world, and PA 
network of 10,000 nodes. For these synthetic network we obtain the correspond Gini value in Table 4. The 
PA network (except WBPA) produce an average gPA = 0.7784 ± 0.0128, whereas the random network produce 
an average Gini grand = 0.9374 ± 0.0013. These result point out two key aspects: (i) the B/D dispersion in other PA 
and other state-of-the-art synthetic model differs significantly from real-world social networks, and (ii) WBPA 
produce network with B/D distribution that be closer to the real-world. 

Two specific B/D distribution be exemplify in Fig. 7a,b for the Google Plus and POK user networks, 
respectively. Figure 7c,d present the B/D distribution for the DPA and WBPA networks. The visual similarity 
inspection reveals WBPA a the only synthetic model capable of reproduce the real-world B/D ratio (see SI.1, 
Fig. 3 for additional examples). 

The WBPA realism be also back up by the centrality distribution analysis. The power-law slope for degree 
and betweenness distribution in WBPA (γdeg = 1.391 and γbtw = 1.171) be very similar to the real-world dis- 
tributions from the Centrality statistic section (see Fig. 1) and SI.1, Table 1, meaning that the degree slope be 
steeper than the betweenness slope (with 18.8%). Similar to the real-world cases, we obtain a polynomial fit for 
the node betweenness-degree correlation in WBPA (y = 0.246x2 + 329.8x − 3569.4, with correlation coefficient 
R2 = 0.9977). 

Discussion and a Socio-Psychological Interpretation 
From a computational standpoint, node betweenness be significantly more complex to compute in comparison 
with node degree. However, when individual make assessment of social attractiveness in real-world situa- 
tions–which be essential for drive preferential attachment and establish new social links–they do not rely 
on execute algorithm or other type of quantitative evaluations. Instead, individual make decision base

on qualitative perceptions30. In light of the quality over quantity hypothesis propose by social psychology31, we 
argue that node betweenness be a far good indicator of social attractiveness than node degree, because the quality 
of be “in between” can be easily and quickly perceived, due to the fact that human be good at observe 
qualitative aspect (e.g., difference and diversity) than quantitative ones32. This idea be support by an experi- 
mental study on how people favor invest in few qualitative social ties, rather than numerous low quality 
ties32. Our result indicate that WBPA provide a more accurate social network topological model, be able 
to reproduce real-world community structure a well a to explain degree saturation and link weight evolution. 

We believe that the WBPA model transcends the mere topological perspective on social relationship evolu- 
tion. As such, in the field of social psychology, individual be perceive a social creature who strive for social 
recognition, validation, approval and fame7,19,33,34. Indeed, individual tend to connect to two type of other 
nodes: individual who be popular in their community (i.e., typically they have high degree), and individual 
who connect multiple community (having high betweenness). While the former type of interconnection be 
mostly related to the popularity of individual within local communities, it appear to be an epiphenomenon of 
the latter. 

Also, state of the art have previously identify that social network have apparent (degree) assortative mixing, 
while, technological and biological network appear to be disassortative in nature34,35. The study in35 explains 
this a most network have a tendency to evolve, unless otherwise constrained, towards their maximum entropy 
state–which be usually disassortative. A similar debate be introduce by Borondo et al. base on the concept of 
meritocracy versus topocracy36. The author discus the critical point at which social value change from be 
base on personal merit, to be base on social position, status, and acquaintances. In the context of social net- 
works, we interpret this issue a follows: in our ego-networks the balance between friend with less influence and 
one with more influence than u translates into betweenness assortativity. Indeed, connect to person with 
high betweenness and increase our tie strength with them (through, say, a stable social relationship), we our- 
self become, in turn, more influential social bridges. This propagation of influence determines other persons, 
with low betweenness, to interact with u and direct more tie strength towards us. 

Towards this end, we introduce the concept of social evolution cycle, which revolves around betweenness assor- 
tativity rather than degree assortativity34,35,37. According to our approach, individual become more influential 
over time by increase their own betweenness. Therefore, the exhibition of one individual’s desire to increase his/ 
her betweenness be two-fold: it attracts new tie (i.e., increase in degree), and it creates strong tie (i.e., increase 
in link weight); this process continue for the next generation of individual who aspire to climb the social ladder. 
As shown, this conclusion be support by the evolution of network generate with WBPA. 

We envision two way of improve an individual’s social status. The first choice relies on force tie strength 
inside the exist neighborhood to increase first, follow by an increase in influence. The second choice relies 
on increase influence first by broadening the neighborhood to influential agent (BPA principle), which will in 
turn trigger an increase in tie strengths. We consider the second choice a the more plausible social process, a 
detailed and explain in Fig. 8. 

We conclude that the WBPA model be quantitatively more robust than DPA, a it can reproduce more accu- 
rately a wide range of real-world social networks. Such a conclusion mean that node degree be not the main 
driver in social network dynamics. Instead, node betweenness be a much good indicator of social attractiveness, 
because it drive the formation of new social bonds, a well a the evolution of social status of individuals. From a

B/D distribution in our WBPA network model, a oppose to the DPA network, be very similar to that found in 
real-world networks.

socio-psychological standpoint, individual (intuitively) perceive node’s betweenness a the capacity of bridging 
communities, irrespective of it degree. As shown, WBPA be a subtle mechanism at work that be able to replicate 
the social network community structure. Also, WBPA explains the dynamic accumulation of degree and link 
weights, a well a the eventual degree saturation, a a second order effect. Consequently, we believe our work 
pave the way for a new and deeper understand of the mechanism that lie behind the dynamic of complex 
social networks. 

Methods 
Real-world datasets. All data use in this study be select to facilitate a thorough analysis of node 
betweenness and degree, a well a measure the realism of synthetic networks. The real-world datasets have 
be chosen base on diversity of both context and network size. Prior study confirm that data mining from 
source such a Facebook or Google Plus be reliable for realistic social network research38,39, and indicate a strong 
correlation between the real-world and virtual friendship of people40,41.

for the topological analysis of data be give in SI.1. Furthermore, to quantify the specific distribution of B/D 
ratio introduce in this paper we make use of the Gini coefficient–borrowed from the area of economics where 
it be use to evaluate data dispersion27. 

In SI.2 we present the preferential attachment analysis base on combination of two and three node centrali- 
ties. Given a graph G = (V, E), with node vi ∈ V and link eij ∈ E, we define the basic graph centrality and metric 
use throughout the paper. We represent the adjacency matrix a W = {wij}, which contains either the weight of 
the link for any link eij, or 0, if no link exists. If the network be unweighted, then each wij = 1. 

The degree ki of a node vi (also denote a D) be define a k wi ij= ∑ . In case of direct networks, there be a 
differentiation between in-degree and out-degree, but that be beyond the scope of this subsection. The average 
degree AD of the graph be calculate over all node as1:

of the individual’s influence (betweenness). (c) Other node with less influence start connect to the initial 
individual. At this point, the initial node have become a predominant receiver of new ties, a emphasize by the 
new violet links.

[−1/2, 1). If it be positive, then the number of link within a cluster exceeds the expect number. Also, a high

where d(vi, vj) be the distance (number of hops) between the two node vi and vj. 
The most common centrality base on the random walk process be the Eigenvector centrality (EC), which 

assumes that the influence of a node be not only determine by the number of it neighbors, but also by the 
influence of each neighbor23. The centrality of any node be proportional to the sum of neighbor centralities1. 
Considering a constant λ, the EC be formally define as:

Assessing network fidelity. In order to ass the structural realism of the generate social networks, 
we use the statistical fidelity ϕ, which be proven to offer reliable insight on complex network topologies25. The 
fidelity metric ϕ numerically capture the similarity between any graph topology G* with respect to another ref- 
erence graph G (i.e., a complex network G = (V, E)). More precisely, by measure and compare their common 
individual graph metrics, a maximum fidelity of 1 represent complete similarity, while a minimum fidelity of 0 
represent complete dissimilarity between the two compare topologies. Of note, the fidelity be not dependent 
on the choice of metric of interest, however it be customizable to allow a weight comparison. Depending on 
the context of the problem, any numerical value (i.e. metric) that be representative for the model can be used. The 
definition and proof of statistical fidelity ϕ be detailed in25. 

Definition 1. Given a reference topology G, and any other network G* be compare to G, the arithmetic 
fidelity Aϕ 

∗, which express the similarity between G* and G, be define as:

In equation 8, i be the index of the metric which describes the two network be compared, and n be the total 
number of metric use in the comparison. In this paper we compute the fidelity between multiple synthetic 
topology and the empirical social network references. These reference datasets be chosen because they have 
typical real-life social network features. The fidelity comparison be make relative to the set of relevant network 
metric (indexed by i). 

In this paper, fidelity be measure by take into consideration the follow topological characteristics: aver- 
age degree AD, average path length APL, average cluster coefficient ACC, modularity Mod, diameter Dmt, and 
density Dns.
