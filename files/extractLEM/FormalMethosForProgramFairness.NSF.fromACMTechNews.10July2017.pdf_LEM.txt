ABSTRACT 

As software permeates our personal lives, corporate world, and bureaucracy, more and 
more of our critical decision be be delegate to opaque algorithms. These algorithm 
have thus become powerful arbitrator of a range of significant decision with far-reaching 
societal impact. However, an algorithm carry out a sensitive task could potentially 
discriminate ? advertently or inadvertently ? against certain groups. The overarch goal 
of this project be to enable automate reason about fairness of such decision-making 
programs. The result from this project be integrate in teach curricula, thus raise 
awareness about fairness in automate decision making. The project train graduate 
student in a unique and inter-disciplinary environment. 

This project investigates various notion of fairness, inspire by the law and recent work 
in the area, and cast them through the formal lens of program verification. The project 
develops technique for certify that a program be fair under a give population, and 
technique for automatically repair unfair program to make them fair. From a technical 
viewpoint, this project develops novel probabilistic program verification and synthesis 
technology that, while focus on the problem of fairness, be general and expand the 
reach of current technologies. Specifically, the project develops novel probabilistic 
verification technique base on volume computation. Furthermore, the project develops 
program repair and debug technique for probabilistic programs.
