Optical atomic clocks, due to their unprecedented stability1–3 
and uncertainty3–6, be already be use to test physical 
theories7,8 and herald a revision of the International System of 
Units9,10. However, to unlock their potential for cross-disciplin- 
ary application such a relativistic geodesy11, a major chal- 
lenge remains: their transformation from highly specialized 
instrument restrict to national metrology laboratory into 
flexible device deployable in different locations12–14. Here, 
we report the first field measurement campaign with a trans- 
portable 87Sr optical lattice clock12. We use it to determine the 
gravity potential difference between the middle of a mountain 
and a location 90 km away, exploit both local and remote 
clock comparison to eliminate potential clock errors. A local 
comparison with a 171Yb lattice clock15 also serf a an impor- 
tant check on the international consistency of independently 
developed optical clocks. This campaign demonstrates the 
excite prospect for transportable optical clocks. 

The application of clock in geodesy fulfils long-standing pro- 
posals to interpret a measurement of the relativistic redshift Δ νrel 
between clock at two site a the associate gravity potential differ- 
ence Δ U = c2 Δ νrel/ν0 (ν0 be the clock’s frequency and c the speed of 
light)11. National geodetic height system base on classical terrestrial 
and satellite-based measurement exhibit discrepancy at the deci- 
metre level16. Optical clocks, combine with high-performance fre- 
quency dissemination techniques17,18, offer an attractive way to resolve 
these discrepancies, a they combine the advantage of high spectral 
resolution with small error accumulation over long distances17,19. 

A clock-based approach to geodesy with a capability competitive 
with current technique require high clock performance: a frac- 
tional frequency accuracy of 1 × 10−17 corresponds to a resolution 
of about 10 cm in height. Furthermore, it be important to realize 
that the side-by-side frequency ratio have to be know to determine 
the remote frequency shift Δ νrel. Taking the uncertainty budget of 
optical clock for grant harbour the possibility of errors, because 
very few have be verify experimentally to the low 10−17 region 
or beyond4, 6, 17,20. A transportable optical clock not only increase 
the flexibility in measurement site but mitigates the risk of unde- 
tected error by enable local calibration to be performed. 

The test site chosen for our demonstration of chronometric level- 
ling11 with optical clock be the Laboratoire Souterrain de Modane 

(LSM) in France, with the Italian metrology institute INRIM in 
Torino serve a the reference site. The height difference between 
the two site be approximately 1,000 m, correspond to a fractional 
redshift of about 10–13. From a geodetic point of view, LSM be an 
interest location at which to make such measurements: first it 
be locate in the middle of the 13 km long Fréjus road tunnel (rock 
coverage 1,700 m), and second the area exhibit long-term land 
uplift (Alpine orogeny) accompany by a secular gravity potential 
variation. Furthermore, LSM lack the metrological infrastructure 
to independently validate component of the clock and the envi- 
ronmental control on which the operation of optical clock usually 
relies. The air temperature be high (∼ 26 °C), with fluctuation of 
several Kelvin at the transportable clock, and the humidity be very 
low. Working hour be also severely restrict for safety reasons, 
a problem that be further compound during our measurement 
campaign by interruption due to blast cause by construction of 
a new tunnel nearby. Even without this additional source of seis- 
mic noise, the acoustic noise level in the laboratory be high. The 
select location thus constitutes a challenge but realistic testbed 
with practical relevance. 

The transportable 87Sr lattice clock be (compared with laboratory 
clocks) design to be compact, with robust optical parts12. The 
physic package be less than 0.6 m3 in size, and we use laser bread- 
board with mechanical stress-resistant fibre couplers21. All com- 
ponents except the reference cavity of the interrogation laser be 
rigidly mount in a car trailer (size 2.2 m × 3 m × 2.2 m), and vibra- 
tion isolation be provide by rubber dampers. The trailer interior be 
temperature stabilized, while the small volume of the trailer hinders 
air exchange and generates hot spot with more than 10 K tempera- 
ture rise. However, the optic and the physic package be place 
apart and shield from these and be stable to within 0.4 K after an 
initial temperature rise of about 1 K. The transportable ultrastable 
reference cavity for the clock interrogation laser be rigidly mount 
to endure transport12. It be place next to the trailer to avoid it 
performance be degrade by vibration induced in the trailer’s 
air conditioning system. The vibration amplitude in the trailer be a 
factor of ten large than under typical laboratory conditions, lead 
to a correspond increase in clock instability. A reference reso- 
nator with low acceleration sensitivity or an active feed-forward 
system may in the future remedy this inconvenience22.

The Sr clock be operate in both locations, LSM and INRIM, to 

eliminate the need for a priori knowledge of the clock’s frequency. 
A schematic outline of the experiment be give in Fig. 1. LSM and 
INRIM be connect by a 150 km noise-compensated optical 
fibre link (see Methods). At LSM, a transportable frequency comb 
measure the optical frequency ratio between a laser resonant with 
the Sr clock transition at 698 nm and 1.542 µ m radiation from an 
ultrastable link laser transmit from INRIM. In this way, the fre- 
quency of the optical clock at LSM could be directly related to the 
frequency of the link laser even without a highly accurate absolute 
frequency reference. In addition to the optical carrier, the fibre link 
be use to disseminate a 100 MHz radiofrequency reference sig- 
nal from INRIM for the frequency comb, frequency counter and 
acousto-optic modulators at LSM (see Methods). At INRIM, a cryo- 
genic Cs fountain clock23 and a 171Yb optical lattice clock15 serve a 
references. The connection between the clock at INRIM and the 
link laser be provide by a second frequency comb. 

Ten day after arrive at LSM in early February 2016, the first 
spectrum of motional sidebands on the 1S0–3P0 clock transition be 
record from the 87Sr transportable clock, mark the point at 
which a recharacterization of the clock could begin. This set-up 
time include general logistics, power and thermalization of the 
equipment, installation of reference frequency equipment, realign- 
ment of optical fibre couplings, individual test of all subcompo- 
nents and magnetic field compensation for load the atom into 
the lattice. The operation of the lattice clock (see Methods) be 
similar to the procedure described in previous works12. 

The transportable clock operate less reliably in the environ- 
mental condition at LSM than in initial test at PTB before trans- 
port. Vibrations cause by the tunnel blasting mention early lead 
to degradation of the light delivery for the first cool stage of the 
magneto-optical trap (MOT; see Methods), which in turn lead to 
interruption due to insufficient atom number. The low-humidity 

environment also hamper the air conditioning in the trailer, caus- 
ing the Ti:sapphire laser use to create the optical lattice to overheat, 
further shorten the clock operation period and thus the evalu- 
ation of some contribution to the clock uncertainty budget. The 
blackbody radiation (BBR) shift be still control to the level of 
3 × 10−17. For these reasons, during the allocate time in the tun- 
nel simultaneous operation be achieve only with the primary Cs 
fountain clock at INRIM and not with the high-stability Yb lattice 
clock. Although the Yb lattice clock at INRIM operate reliably for 
the majority of the time, the commercial lattice laser for the clock 
fail just before the characterization of the transportable clock have 
be completed. With the transportable clock operating for 2.8 h 
over two day at the end of the LSM campaign in mid-March 2016, 
the instability of the fountain clock (2.2 × 10−13 τ−1/2, where τ be give 
in seconds) pose a limitation on the uncertainty of the frequency 
measurement. We therefore apply a hydrogen maser a a flywheel24 
to reduce the statistical uncertainty of the measurement: the maser’s 
frequency be rapidly and accurately calibrate by the optical clock, 
and due to the frequency stability of the maser this calibration be 
valid for longer period of time. This make it possible to extend 
the average time to 48 h (see Methods), lead to an uncertainty 
of 17 × 10−16 associate with the measurement time. With system- 
atic uncertainty of the Sr and Cs clock of 2.6 × 10−16 and 3 × 10−16 
respectively (see Table 1, Methods and ref. 23), the frequency of 
the Sr lattice clock at LSM be measure by the fountain clock at 
INRIM with an uncertainty of 18 × 10−16 (see Fig. 1). 

As note earlier, an initial frequency comparison at a common 
gravity potential be require to transform a general frequency mea- 
surement or clock comparison into a chronometric level mea- 
surement. For this reason, the Sr apparatus be move to INRIM in 
April 2016 for local clock comparisons. There, it be directly link 
to the INRIM frequency comb. In the process, small upgrade 
be make to the set-up for the cool light distribution and the

link (length 150 km) to the Italian national metrology institute INRIM in Torino (red line). There, a primary Cs fountain clock and a 171Yb optical lattice 
clock be operate (right). At both sites, frequency comb be use to relate the frequency of the 1S0–3P0 optical clock transition and the 1.5 µ m laser

thermal management in the car trailer. With these changes, the 
availability of the Sr clock be improve significantly, allow for 
several hour of data take per day after the initial set-up phase 
be completed. With systematic uncertainty comparable to the 
first campaign and a fountain instability of 3.6 × 10−13 τ−1/2, the total 
uncertainty be reduce by a factor of two to 9 × 10−16 (see Methods 
for Sr transition frequencies). In this chronometric level dem- 
onstration, we resolve a relativistic redshift of the optical lattice 
clock of 47.92(83) Hz (Fig. 1), from which we infer a potential dif- 
ference of 10,034(174) m2 s−2 (The number in the parenthesis be 
the 1σ uncertainty refer to the correspond last digit of the 
quote results.). This be in excellent agreement with the value of 
10,032.1(16) m2 s−2 determine independently by geodetic mean 
(see Methods). Though our result do not yet challenge the clas- 
sical geodetic approach in accuracy, it be the first demonstration of 
chronometric level use a transportable optical clock. 

With the increase reliability of the transportable Sr clock, we 
be also able to measure it optical frequency ratio R with the 
Yb lattice clock15 operate on the 1S0–3P0 transition at 578 nm. 
In total, 31,000 s of common operation of the two optical clock 
and the frequency comb be achieve over a period of 7 days. 
This optical–optical comparison (Fig. 2) show much high sta- 
bility than the optical–microwave one. Consequently, the optical 
frequency ratio measurement be limited by the systematic uncer- 
tainty of the clock (Table 1), rather than by their instability. This 
demonstrates the key advantage of optical frequency standards: 
they be able to achieve excellent uncertainty in short averag- 
ing time even though they may operate less reliably than their 
microwave counterparts. 

The 171Yb/87Sr frequency ratio measure on different day be 
summarize in Fig. 3, which also show previous measurement of 
this ratio. After average (see Methods), we determine the ratio to 
be R = νYb/ νSr = 1.207,507,039,343,338,41(34). Independent mea- 
surements of particular optical frequency ratio be important to 
check the consistency of optical clock worldwide25, and be key to 
establish more accurate representation of the second26 a pro- 
vided by the International Committee for Weights and Measures 
(CIPM) a a step towards a future redefinition of the second. To 
our knowledge, this be the only optical frequency ratio that have 
be measure directly by three independent research groups27–29; 

however, our measurement differs from the most accurate pre- 
vious measurement by two standard deviation (Fig. 3), and the 
origin of this difference will require further investigation by the 
research group concerned.

Note that, even with the only slightly improve transportable Sr 
apparatus a use at INRIM, chronometric level against the Yb 
lattice clock with considerably improve resolution would be pos- 
sible. We expect that the transportable clock with improve reli- 
ability will be able to achieve an uncertainty of 1 × 10−17 before, for 
example, BBR-related uncertainty pose a limitation to the pres- 
ent set-up. Instabilities of 1 × 10–15 τ–1/2 be realistic with the cur- 
rent interrogation laser; low instability will require an improve 
reference cavity. The uncertainty will enable height difference of 
10 cm to be resolved, which be a relevant magnitude for geodesy in 
region such a islands, which be hard to access use conventional 
geodetic approaches. As metrological fibre link become more 
common, chronometric level along their paths30 will become a 
realistic prospect.

Methods 
Operation of lattice clocks. The realization and operation of the 171Yb (I = 1/2) 
and 87Sr (I = 9/2) clock be very similar and have be present in detail12, 15,21. 
Ytterbium and strontium atom be cool to microkelvin temperature in two- 
stage MOTs, exploit the strong 1S0–1P1 and weaker 1S0–3P1 transition (at 399 nm 
and 556 nm for Yb and 461 nm and 689 nm for Sr, respectively). The atom be then 
trap in one-dimensional optical lattice operating at the magic wavelengths31 
λYbmagic ≈ 759 nm and λSrmagic ≈ 813 nm, which to first order give a zero differential 
light shift between the 1S0 and 3P0 states. 

Finally, the atom be prepared for spectroscopy in a single magnetic sublevel 
mf by optical pumping. As a result, shift due to cold collision and line pull be 
reduced. The two π transition from the mf = ± 1/2 sublevels in Yb (mf = ± 9/2 
in Sr) be probed alternately at approximately halfwidth detunings so that the 
interrogation laser be lock to their average transition frequency. This effectively 
remove the linear Zeeman shift. 

Uncertainties of lattice clocks. Here, we discus the most important uncertainty 
contribution list in Table 1. More detail of the method use to evaluate these 
uncertainty be give in ref 15,24 and 12. 

Lattice light shifts. The lattice of the Yb clock be operate at νl = 394,798.238 GHz 
with a trap depth U0 = 196(4)Er (Er be the lattice recoil energy) and an atomic 
temperature of 7(3) µ K a determine by sideband spectroscopy32. We measure 
the linear shift near the magic wavelength while the non-linear induced lattice light 
shift can be calculate use data from ref. 27. 

For the Sr lattice clock, the typical lattice depth be about 100Er a measure 
from sideband spectra32. These also yield an atomic temperature of about 3.5 µ K. 
The light-shift cancellation frequency be determine earlier; a reference resonator 
serve a a wavelength reference during the experiment discuss here. The 
uncertainty of the linear lattice light shift allows for a possible resonator frequency 
change of 50 MHz cause by vibration and shock during transport and change 
due to potential variation of the scalar and tensor light shift cause by geometrical 
change or change of the environmental magnetic field33. Without transport, the 
resonator frequency stay stable within 1 MHz for weeks, but relaxation during 
transport cannot be excluded. In future measurement campaigns, a determination 
of the light-shift cancellation wavelength will be make at the site of measurement. 
Higher-order light shift be calculate use the coefficient in the same 
reference. As a check, three of the measurement in Fig. 2 be perform with a 
deeper lattice of about 160Er, which result in uncertainty for the linear lattice 
light shift and higher-order shift of 29 × 10−17 and 1 × 10−17, respectively. No 
significant variation of the measure frequency ratio R be observed. 

Density shift. The density shift be evaluate in both lattice clock by vary the 
interrogate atom number. Corrections for change of the atomic temperature have 
be apply for the Sr clock. The low uncertainty of the density shift at LSM be due 
to the low atom number and thus density with which the clock be operate there. 

BBR shift. The influence of BBR on the clock frequency have be discuss 
elsewhere3,4,34–36. Temperatures of the atomic environment be measure with 
calibrate platinum resistance thermometers. The uncertainty of the BBR shift be 
mostly related to temperature inhomogeneity. The representative temperature and 
it uncertainty be derive from the extreme temperature found on the apparatus 
(the atomic oven be treat separately12,15) follow the procedure described in 
ref. 37 for a rectangular probability distribution. The difference between the BBR 
correction at LSM and INRIM be cause by different temperature inside the 
trailer, a this temperature depends slightly on the outside temperature. 

Other uncertainties. The uncertainty of servo error, second-order Zeeman shift 
and line pull be reduce at INRIM by adjustment of experimental parameters, 
which be possible due to the more reliable operation. 

H-maser a flywheel. A flywheel oscillator with good stability and high reliability, 
such a an H-maser, can be use to extend the average time between a less reliable 
system such a our Sr lattice clock and a Cs primary clock with low stability24. 
The frequency ratio νSr/νCs be thus determine from the frequency ratio νSr/νH 
and νH/νCs use datasets with different lengths. The noise of the flywheel result in 
different average frequency for these two intervals, but the additional uncertainty 
can be calculated24 if the noise be well characterized, a it often be for masers. The 
calculation relies on Parseval’s theorem, and us the noise spectrum of the maser 
together with the Fourier transform of a weight function that represent the two 
average intervals. For the full measurement-related uncertainty, this extrapolation 
uncertainty be combine with the statistical uncertainty of the maser calibration 
by the optical clock and the maser–Cs clock ratio over the extend interval. We 
model the maser noise by a superposition of flicker phase noise 6 × 10−14 τ−1 
(1 × 10−13 τ−1), white frequency noise 5 × 10−14 τ−1/2 (4.5 × 10−14 τ−1/2) and a flicker 
noise 1.7 × 10−15 (1 × 10−15) in March (May) 2016, respectively. 

Gravity potential determination. To provide an accurate reference for the 
chronometric levelling, a state-of-the-art determination of the gravity (gravitational 

plus centrifugal) potential be performed, target the best possible uncertainty 
for each clock site. Spatial variation of the gravity potential be most important; 
correspond temporal variation (mainly due to solid Earth and ocean tides) be 
below 0.07 m2 s−2 for the potential difference between INRIM and LSM38. 

The static (spatially varying) gravity potential or correspond potential 
difference can be determine by two classical geodetic methods39. The first be 
geometric level (together with gravity observation along the level path). 
The second (the so-called GNSS/geoid approach) us GNSS position (ellipsoidal 
heights) and the result from gravity field modelling, that is, a high-resolution 
(quasi)geoid model base on terrestrial and satellite gravity data. Both method 
can be formulate in term of either potential or height quantities. In the follow 
discussion, metric unit base on height be generally prefer for simplicity, but 
correspond potential value can easily be obtain by multiply the height 
value by an average gravity value (e.g. 9.81 m s–2). Geometric level be accurate 
at the millimetre level over short distances40, but a a differential technique it can 
deliver only potential difference and be susceptible to systematic errors, which may 
accumulate to the few-decimetre level over continental distances. On the other 
hand, the GNSS/geoid approach can deliver absolute potential values; in this case 
the uncertainty depends mainly on the quality of the regional (quasi)geoid models, 
but the uncertainty of the GNSS position also have to be considered. 

New gravity measurement be make around the clock site at INRIM 
and LSM to improve the reliability and uncertainty of the geopotential field 
modelling. These measurement include spot check of the largely historic 
gravity database (consistency check), and the addition of new observation in 
area so far void of gravity data (coverage improvement). Separate gravity survey 
be carry out around INRIM and LSM, result in 36 and 123 new gravity 
points, respectively. The gravity survey include one absolute gravity observation 
at INRIM and another at LSM, while the remain point be observe with 
relative gravity meter (relative to the establish absolute points), with 11 gravity 
point be locate inside the Fréjus tunnel. Maps give an overview of the 
distribution of gravity observation be give on the ITOC project page41. 
These new gravity observation a well a some other gravity update 
(e.g. for Germany) be integrate into the terrestrial gravity database, 
the start point be the version use to compute the previous European 
Gravimetric (Quasi)Geoid, EGG200816. A consistency check between the new 
and exist gravity measurement show no significant difference between 
the two data sets, confirm the quality of the entire database. However, 
a re-evaluation of the combine data-set reveal some old station with 
obviously wrong positions, mainly locate in France; these station lie offroad 
and show large discrepancy between station and digital elevation model heights, 
and be therefore exclude from the (quasi)geoid computation. 

A new (quasi)geoid model, EGG2015, be compute in a similar way to 
the previous EGG2008 model, use the remove–compute–restore procedure 
and the spectral combination approach, combine a global long-wavelength 
satellite gravity model with high-resolution terrestrial gravity and terrain data16. 
In addition to the new gravity measurements, enhancement include the use of 
a fifth-generation GOCE global geopotential model (GOCO05S)42 and a spectral 
weight scheme adapt to the GOCE model. The large difference between 
the EGG2015 and EGG2008 input gravity value be about 3.5 × 10−4 m s−2; for the 
output (quasi)geoid grid the large difference be about 0.15 m. By far the large 
difference be around the LSM site; they result from the new observation in area 
previously void of gravity data and from the removal of gross error related to some 
point in France with incorrect positions16. However, the maximum (quasi)geoid 
change at the two clock site be less than 0.03 m. The uncertainty of EGG2015 
be estimate in the same way a for EGG2008, result in a standard deviation 
of 2 cm, which hold for area with a good coverage and quality of the terrestrial 
gravity field data, such a around INRIM (best-case scenario). However, around 
LSM the remain data gap in inaccessible area and the strong spatial gravity 
field variation cause by the high mountain lead to a high uncertainty 
estimate of about 4 cm. 

The final relativistic redshift correction for the INRIM/LSM clock comparison 
be derive by the GNSS/geoid approach, although geometric level and 
gravity measurement be use to transfer the gravity potential from the near 
GNSS station to the reference marker adjacent to the clock at INRIM and 
LSM. The GNSS/geoid approach be chosen because the level data for Italy 
be rather old and do not include gravity corrections43, and because the GNSS/ 
geoid approach be not affected by systematic level errors. This result in 
a gravity potential difference of 10,029.7(6) m2 s−2 between the two reference 
markers, and 10,032.1(16)m2 s−2 between the actual clock position at LSM and 
INRIM, respectively. The final uncertainty of the gravity potential difference 
between the reference marker near to the two clock position (about 6 cm in 
term of height) include contribution from the (quasi)geoid in the Alpine region 
(approximately 5 cm, neglect correlations16), the GNSS position (1–2 cm) 
and the level connection (< 1 cm, mainly from the tunnel portal to LSM). 
The large uncertainty for the actual clock position be because, for convenience 
and in view of the uncertainty of the chronometric level experiment, the 
height difference between the clock location and the correspond 
reference marker (less than 10 m apart) be determine use a simple 
spirit level rather than by geodetic levelling.

INRIM–LSM frequency transfer. The remote clock comparison be perform by 
compare the frequency of a link laser at 1,542.14 nm, sent from INRIM to LSM 
by a telecom optical fibre, with the frequency of the clock operate in the two 
locations. Two fibre frequency comb span the spectral gap between the link 
laser and the clock interrogation lasers. The comb employ the transfer oscillator 
principle44, make the measurement of the optical frequency ratio immune to 
the frequency noise of the combs. The frequency of the link laser be stabilize 
use a high-finesse cavity, whose long-term drift be remove by a loose phase-lock 
to a H-maser via a fibre frequency comb. As a result, the beat note with the comb 
remain within a small frequency interval, facilitate long-term operation and 
reduce potential error arise from any counter de-synchronization between 
INRIM and LSM17. 

The link laser use a multiplexed channel in the telecom fibre. Its path be 
equip with two dedicate bidirectional erbium-doped fibre amplifier that allow 
a phase stable signal to be generate at LSM through the Doppler noise cancellation 
technique17,18. The contribution of fibre frequency transfer to the total fractional 
uncertainty be assess to be 3 × 10–19 by loop back the signal from LSM use 
a parallel fibre. The occasional occurrence of cycle slip be detect by redundant 
counting of the beat note at INRIM. At LSM, the signal be regenerate by a diode 
laser phase lock to the incoming radiation with a signal-to-noise ratio great than 
30 dB at 100 kHz bandwidth; this ensure robust and cycle-slip-free operation. 

In addition to the optical reference, a high-quality radiofrequency signal 
be need at LSM to operate the Sr clock apparatus (frequency shifter and 
counters) and the frequency comb. Given the impossibility of have a GNSS- 
disseminate signal in the underground laboratory, a 100 MHz radiofrequency 
signal be deliver there by amplitude modulation of a second 1.5 µ m laser that 
be transmit through an optical fibre parallel to the first. At LSM, the amplitude 
modulation be detect on a fast photodiode, amplify and regenerate by an 
oven-controlled quartz oscillator at 10 MHz to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. 
The inherent stability of the free-running fibre link be in this case enough to deliver 
the radiofrequency signal with a long-term instability and uncertainty small 
than 10-13. This result uncertainty contribution to the optical frequency ratio 
measurement be below 1 × 10–19. 

Averaging of the optical frequency ratio data. We make eight different optical 
frequency ratio measurement with a total measurement time of 15 h over a 
period of one week in May 2016 (Fig. 3). The data acquire on different day have 
different statistical and systematic uncertainties. We apply a statistical analysis 
that considers the correlation between the measurement from the different 
systematic shift where the covariance matrix of the eight daily measurement be 
use to calculate a generalize least square fit for the average25,45. We regard 
the systematic uncertainty of the clock (Table 1) a fully correlated, while the 
statistic related to the measurement duration be uncorrelated. 

Absolute frequency of the Sr lattice clock. The chronometric level can 
be view from an alternative perspective: If we assume that the conventional 
measurement of the gravity potential difference be correct then we can deduce an 
average absolute frequency value of 429,228,004,229,873.13(40) Hz for the Sr lattice 
clock. The accuracy of the absolute frequency measurement achieve with the 
transportable clock be comparable to several recent measurement with laboratory 
systems24,46–61. 

Averaging the previously publish value give a frequency of 
429,228,004,229,873.05(05) Hz. Together with the average Yb clock transition 
frequency of 518,295,836,590,863.75(25) Hz derive from other references15,62–66, 
a Yb/Sr frequency ratio of 1.207,507,039,343,337,97(61) can be calculate (Fig. 3). 
This average assumes that there be no correlation between the different 
measurements.
