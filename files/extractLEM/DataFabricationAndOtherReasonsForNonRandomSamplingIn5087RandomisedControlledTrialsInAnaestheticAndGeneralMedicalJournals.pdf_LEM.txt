Summary 

Randomised, control trial have be retract after publication because of data fabrication and inadequate ethical approval. Fabricated data 

have include baseline variables, for instance, age, height or weight. Statistical test can determine the probability of the distribution of means, 

give their standard deviation and the number of participant in each group. Randomised, control trial have be retract after the data 

distribution have be calculate a improbable. Most retract trial have be write by anaesthetist and publish by specialist anaesthetic 

journals. I want to explore whether the distribution of baseline data in trial be consistent with the expect distribution. I want to determine 

whether trial retract after publication have distribution different to trial that have not be retracted. I want to determine whether data 

distribution in trial publish in specialist anaesthetic journal have be different to distribution in non-specialist medical journals. I analyse 

the distribution of 72,261 mean of 29,789 variable in 5087 randomised, control trial publish in eight journal between January 2000 and 

December 2015: Anaesthesia (399); Anesthesia and Analgesia (1288); Anesthesiology (541); British Journal of Anaesthesia (618); Canadian 

Journal of Anesthesia (384); European Journal of Anaesthesiology (404); Journal of the American Medical Association (518) and New England 

Journal of Medicine (935). I chose these journal a I have electronic access to the full text. Trial p value be distort by an excess of baseline 

mean that be similar and an excess that be dissimilar: 763/5015 (15.2%) trial that have not be retract from publication have p value that 

be within 0.05 of 0 or 1 (expected 10%), that is, a 5.2% excess, p = 1.2 × 10 . The p value of 31/72 (43%) trial that have be retract after 

publication be within 0.05 of 0 or 1, a rate different to that for unretracted trials, p = 1.03 × 10 . The difference between the distribution of 

these two subgroup be confirm by comparison of their overall distributions, p = 5.3 × 10 . Each journal exhibit the same abnormal 

distribution of baseline means. There be no difference in distribution of baseline mean for 1453 trial in non-anaesthetic journal and 3634 

trial in anaesthetic journals, p = 0.30. The rate of retraction from JAMA and NEJM, 6/1453 or 1 in 242, be one-quarter the rate from the six 

anaesthetic journals, 66/3634 or 1 in 55, relative risk (99%CI) 0.23 (0.08–0.68), p = 0.00022. A probability threshold of 1 in 10,000 identify 8/72 

(11%) retract trial (7 by Fujii et al.) and 82/5015 (1.6%) unretracted trials. Some p value be so extreme that the baseline data could not be 

correct: for instance, for 43/5015 unretracted trial the probability be less than 1 in 10 (equivalent to one drop of water in 20,000 Olympic-sized 

swim pools). A probability threshold of 1 in 100 for two or more trial by the same author identify three author of retract trial (Boldt, Fujii 

and Reuben) and 21 first or correspond author of 65 unretracted trials. Fraud, unintentional error, correlation, stratify allocation and poor 

methodology might have contribute to the excess of randomised, control trial with similar or dissimilar means, a pattern that be common to 

all the survey journals. It be likely that this work will lead to the identification, correction and retraction of hitherto unretracted randomised, 

control trials.
