Abstract 

We have design a single-pixel camera with image around corner base on computational 

ghost imaging. It can obtain the image of an object when the camera cannot look at the object 

directly. Our image system explores the fact that a bucket detector in a ghost image setup 

have no spatial resolution capability. A series of experiment have be design to confirm our 

predictions. This camera have potential application for image around corner or other similar 

environment where the object cannot be observe directly.

I. INTRODUCTION 

Ghost image (GI) be first realize by Pittman et.al. in 1995 by employ entangle 

photon pair generate from spontaneous parametric down conversion [1]. At the begin 

of the 21st century, it be realize that GI could also be perform with classical light 

[2–10]. In this system, a thermal light beam be split into two beam by a beam splitter. 

One beam be project onto an object. The light reflect from or passing through the 

object be collect by a bucket detector with no spatial resolution. The other beam be sent 

to a detector with spatial resolution. Finally the image be reconstruct by correlate the 

signal from these two detectors. The possible application of GI in military and civilian have 

be study by many groups, such a high-order correlation ghost image [11, 12], lensless 

ghost image [13–18], ghost image through turbulence [19–22]. Nevertheless, a charge 

couple device (CCD) be need to measure the intensity fluctuation in a typical thermal 

light GI, because the intensity fluctuation with spatial resolution of a typical thermal light 

can not be predicted. Meanwhile, a beam splitter be also needed. These factor limited the 

development of the practical application of GI system in daily life. 

Computational ghost image (CGI) be propose in 2008 by Shapiro [23]. The intensity 

fluctuation of light in CGI be artificially modulated. The random, yet known, speckle 

pattern be project onto an unknown object. The spatial information of detector signal 

be not needed, therefore a photodiode (PD) can be use to replace a CCD [24]. The need for 

the beam splitter and camera be remove in CGI, which help GI system become simpler and 

more applicable. The practical application of CGI be developed by more and more group 

[25–34]. The speed and quality of image have both be improved, such a the real-time 

video with the single-pixel detector [31] and the improvement of the signal-to-noise ratio 

for different system [32, 33]. Moreover, some feature of CGI which the traditional camera 

do not have have be also propose and realized, such a 3D image of CGI [34], image 

of CGI through turbulence and against scatter [26, 35]. They make CGI more significant 

in real life. 

In this paper, we study a feature of CGI that image an object without look at 

it directly, which can be thought a a single-pixel camera with image around corners. 

This camera be base on the technique of single-pixel detector with CGI system. Traditional 

camera cannot obtain the image when it dose not see the object directly. However, the single- 

2 



pixel camera with image around corner can get the image under the same condition. Other 

group also have achieve image with similar ability [36]. Their experiment be base on the 

speckle autocorrelation and phase-retrieval algorithm. The scatter medium be need a 

lens. We use a different approach to achieve the same idea and only a single-pixel detector 

be needed. 

The article be organize a follows. In Sec.II, we report the experimental result of CGI 

and image around corner with the single-pixel detector, respectively. The discussion 

about the physic of the single-pixel camera with image around corner be in Sec.III. 

Section IV summary our conclusions. 

II. EXPERIMENT 

In this article, a series of experiment be design to study the single-pixel camera with 

image around corners. The first experiment be show in Fig. 1 (a), which be the basic 

scheme of CGI with a single-pixel detector. The light source be a projector (BenQ MW526). 

Speckle patterns, control by computer, be project onto an object. The object be a 

transparent pattern “XJTU” and the size of each letter be 0.2 cm∗0.3 cm. The distance 

between the projector and object be 30 cm. The transmit light through the object be 

receive by a single-pixel detector (Thorlabs DET36A/M). The function of the detector be 

to obtain the intensity of light in one position. Figure 2(a) show the image of the object in 

the common CGI. 

To test CGI against scattering, a ground glass be place between the object and the 

detector a show in Fig. 1 (b). Light through the scatter medium will be scatter in 

all directions. Figure 2(b) show the image of XJTU under this condition. The signal- 

to-noise ratio (SNR) of Fig. 2(a) and 2(b) be 18.02 dB and 17.92 dB, respectively. The 

result indicate that the quality of the image be nearly the same a that of the image in CGI 

without scatter media. SNR be define a SNR = s̄(2)/σn, where s̄ be average of the signal 

intensity, and σn be the variance of the background intensity [27]. The difference between 

the average intensity of the bright and dark region of image be regard a the signal, and 

the variation of dark background be consider a the noise. 

Based on the above results, this image technology be exploit a a single-pixel camera 

with image around corners. The characteristic of CGI against scatter be employed.

FIG. 1. Experimental setup of CGI. (a) be the basic scheme of CGI. A projector be control by 

computer which project a series of speckle pattern onto an object. The object be transparent 

letter “XJTU”. The transmit light be receive by a single-pixel detector. (b) be the scheme of 

CGI with scatter media. A ground glass be place between the object and the detector. The 

light transmit through the object will be disturbed by this media. 

FIG. 2. The image of the letter “XJTU” in CGI. (a) be the result of letter “XJTU” without 

scatter media. (b) be the image in CGI with scatter media. Two result be both calculate 

by 18,000 random patterns. 

Figure 3(a) show the experimental scheme of the single-pixel camera with image around 

corners. The same object “XJTU” be used. Speckle pattern be control a 40∗40 matrix 

of black and white square by computer. And the ratio of white and black square be 0.11 

in the patterns. The change speckle pattern be project onto the object. The distance

FIG. 3. The scheme of single-pixel camera with image around corners. (a) be the basic scheme. 

The transparent letter “XJTU” be imaged. A light tight baffle between the object and the single- 

pixel detector be use for prevent the detector obtain the light from the object directly. (b) 

be the scheme with scatter media. (c) be the scheme of image a three-dimensional object with 

rough surface. This diffuse object be a common toy for child (a plane model). 

between the projector and object be 30 cm. The transmit light through the letter be 

reflect by the rough white wall. The distance between the object and the wall be 15 cm. 

The single-pixel detector, which be 12 cm away from the wall, collect the reflect light. A 

light tight baffle be insert between the object and the single-pixel detector to avoid the 

detector receive the signal from the object directly. The result be show in Fig. 4(a), 

where the letter be image clearly. To study the ability of this camera against scattering, 

a rotate ground glass (5 cm behind the object) be place between the object and the 

detector. The rotate speed of the ground glass be 1,200 cycles/min. The result be show 

in Fig. 4(b). The SNR of the image in Fig. 4(a) and Fig. 4(b) be 17.34 dB and 17.51 dB, 

5 



respectively. They indicate that image around corner with the single-pixel detector can 

image clearly whether there be the scatter medium or not. Especially, we use white paper a 

the distraction. Two piece of paper be place at the different location behind the object. 

One be 120 mm behind the object and the other be 10 mm in front of the detector. The result 

be show in Fig. 4(c) and the SNR be 18.58 dB. 

FIG. 4. The image of the letter “XJTU” by the single-pixel camera with image around corners. 

(a) be the result of letter “XJTU” without scatter media. (b) be the image through a rotate 

ground glass. (c) show the result when the ground glass be replace by the white paper. Two 

piece of paper be place at two different locations. The thickness of paper be 0.05 mm. 

Figure 3(c) show the scheme of image the diffuse object by the single-pixel camera 

with image around corners. A three-dimensional object with rough surface be use a 

the image target. The inset in Fig. 5(a) be this diffuse object (a common toy plane for 

children). The size of object be 55 mm∗32 mm. Speckle pattern be irradiate on this 

diffuse object. The intensity of light reflect from the object and the wall be very weak. 

In addition, the environment light be significantly strong. Under the circumstances, the 

detector will receive more light from environment than from the object. Traditional camera 

generally get a picture with the misty light. The light becomes disorder and the image be 

blur because of the reflection on the diffuse object and the wall. However, the single-pixel 

camera with image around corner can image the object under the same condition. The 

result of image by the camera with image around corner be show in Fig. 5(a), where 

the toy be image clearly. The SNR of the image in Fig. 5(a) be 23 dB. The diffuse object 

be more difficult to be image than the simple transmission object, therefore the number 

of speckle pattern be increase to 50,000 to get a clear image. In addition, the resolution 

can be control by the computer. When the size of speckle pattern becomes smaller, the 

resolution of the image becomes higher. Fig. 5(b) be the result when the resolution increase 

to 4 time good than (a). All the detail of the object in Fig. 5(b) become more obvious. 

The SNR of the image becomes 20 dB. All result show that the single-pixel camera with 

6 



image around corner can image the diffuse object when the camera cannot look at object 

directly. 

FIG. 5. The image and object in the experiment of image around corner with the single-pixel 

detector. The inset picture in (a) be the diffuse object (a common toy for children). (a) and (b) 

show the result of image. The number of pattern which be use to image in two picture be both 

50,000. The resolution ratio of (b) be 4 time good than (a). 

III. THEORY AND DISCUSSION 

The image of the object in CGI be obtain via calculate the second-order correlation, 

g(2)(x, y) = 
〈Icom(x, y)Idet〉 

〈Icom(x, y)〉 〈Idet〉 
, (1) 

where 〈〉 mean ensemble average. Icom(x, y) be the intensity distribution of speckle pattern 

which be control by computer. Idet be the intensity detect by the single-pixel detector. 

Idet = 

∫∫ 
Iobj(x 

′, y′)T (x′, y′)dx′dy′, (2) 

where Iobj(x 
′, y′) be the intensity of light in the object plane. T (x′, y′) be the transmission 

function of the object. Equation (1) can be simplify a [4] 

g(2)(x, y) = 1 + 
〈∆Icom(x, y)∆Idet〉 

〈Icom(x, y)〉 〈Idet〉 
, (3) 

where ∆Icom(x, y) and ∆Idet be the intensity fluctuation to their ensemble averages, respec- 

tively. It show that g(2)(x, y) depends on the second-order intensity fluctuation correlation 

〈∆Icom(x, y)∆Idet〉. Light first propagates from the source to one point on object, and then 

7 



through this point arrives in the detector plane. When the intensity fluctuation of the de- 

tector signal contains the intensity fluctuation of light through this point on the object, the 

value of g(2)(x, y) on the same location of that point in the picture would be great than 

1. At last, the object would be image on the picture. When a ground glass be insert 

between the object and the detector, light be scatter in all directions. If the scatter be 

strong enough, the intensity of the transmit light through all point on the object would 

be close to homogeneous distribution in space. The single-pixel detector can only obtain 

part of light which be fully scattered. Furthermore, the light intensity be relatively weak. 

Nevertheless, this part of light still contains all information of object, which mean that the 

single-pixel detector can get the information of the intensity fluctuation of light from every 

point on the object. In addition, the signal of detector Idet also contains the intensity of 

light from the ground glass. Because the intensity from the glass and that from computer 

be independent, there be no correlation between them. The effect from the ground glass 

will disappear when 〈∆Icom(x, y)∆Idet〉 be calculate [22]. The image of the object can 

still be recover successfully. However, the visibility of the image will become low since 

the background 〈Icom(x, y)〉 〈Idet〉 relatively increases. According to the above equation and 

discussions, CGI can still image letter of XJTU through the scatter media. Figure 2(b) 

show the result with scatter medium be similar a the image in CGI without scatter 

media. Furthermore, the SNR of the image of the transparent object in CGI be studied. 

Figure 6 show the SNR of the image change with the number of collect pattern in both 

cases. The difference of two case be whether the scatter medium exists. Under two different 

conditions, the curve have a good coincide. It illustrates that the scatter medium behind 

object have little effect to the quality of the image. 

When the scatter medium becomes a reflection type, image around corner with the 

single-pixel detector can be achieved. The transmit light through the object reach the 

white wall which replaces the former ground glass. Light with the information of the object 

will be scatter into every direction in the room, so the information of the object can be 

obtain in many places. Idet will contain the intensity of light reflect from the object, 

the white wall and optical noise. However, there be no correlation between the intensity of 

light control by computer and all intensity of light except reflect from the object. It 

will be the same calculation a the one of CGI with scatter medium if the transmission 

function of the scatter medium be replace by the reflection function of the white wall. The 

8 



FIG. 6. The SNR of images. The SNR of the image of the transparent object in CGI be measure 

in two cases. One case, which be represent a square, be that the scatter medium exists. The 

other case, which be represent a circle, be that the scatter medium do not exist. The tendency 

of SNR with the increase number of speckle pattern be shown. 

image of the object will be show in the area where g(2)(x, y) be great than 1. Imaging 

through scatter layer and around corner be also study by some researcher [36, 37]. 

They apply the memory-effect for speckle correlation [36] and the Fourier-domain shower- 

curtain effect [37] to image the object. The difference between the strategy be that our 

image system be a kind of “direct imaging” which be base on simple product of intensity 

of a bucket detector and preset speckle patterns. It do not need a complex computation 

such a phase retrieval algorithms. The image only need that the correlation be calculated. 

Moreover, the detector in our experiment be a single-pixel detector which be simpler than the 

high-megapixel camera. 

When a diffuse object instead of the transmission object be imaged, the intensity would 

multiply by the reflection function instead of the transmission function of the object in 

Eq.(2). Light with the information of the object will be scatter again. The information of 

the object can be obtain in many place even though the intensity of light be still extremely 

weak. Under this condition, there be still correlation between the intensity of light control 

by computer and the intensity of light from the object. In the end, the image of object will 

appear a if the sight of the single-pixel camera with image around corner can bypass the 

barrier.

IV. CONLUSIONS 

In conclusion, we design and accomplish the image around corner with the single- 

pixel detector by a series of experiment about CGI with a single-pixel detector. This 

image around corner with the single-pixel detector obtains part of light reflect from 

the wall and cannot “see” the diffuse object directly. However, it still can obtain the image 

of the object. We analyze the feature of the camera without image optimisation, so this 

camera still have great potential in enhance image quality and speed. With optimize 

algorithm to make CGI faster and the experimental equipment connect by a wireless 

system, the single-pixel camera with image around corner can be a powerful equipment 

in image around corner and obstacle in real world.
