Cardiac afferent activity modulates the 
expression of racial stereotype 
Ruben T. Azevedo1,2, Sarah N. Garfinkel3,4, Hugo D. Critchley3,4 & Manos Tsakiris1,2 

Negative racial stereotype tend to associate Black people with threat. This often lead to the 

misidentification of harmless object a weapon held by a Black individual. Yet, little be 

know about how bodily state impact the expression of racial stereotyping. By tap into 

the phasic activation of arterial baroreceptors, know to be associate with change in the 

neural processing of fearful stimuli, we show activation of race-threat stereotype synchro- 

nized with the cardiovascular cycle. Across two establish tasks, stimulus depict Black or 

White individual be present to coincide with either the cardiac systole or diastole. 

Results show increase race-driven misidentification of weapon during systole, when bar- 

oreceptor afferent fire be maximal, relative to diastole. Importantly, a third study examine 

the positive Black-athletic stereotypical association fails to demonstrate similar modulation 

by cardiac cycle. We identify a body–brain interaction wherein interoceptive cue can mod- 

ulate threat appraisal and racially bias behaviour in context-dependent ways.

We seem more 'racist' when expose to alarm picture during active part of heartbeat cycle... OK and then :) 



R 
ecent statistic from USA reveal that Black Americans be 
more than twice a likely to be unarmed when kill during 
encounter with police a White people1. This be a strike 

example of how implicit stereotype in physiologically arouse 
context may influence behaviour even among those who do not 
consciously endorse them. Notably, laboratory research have 
replicate this pattern among university students2 and police 
officers3,4, demonstrate that people be more likely to 
misidentify harmless object a weapon when associate with a 
Black individual5 and be more prone to ‘shoot’ unarmed Black 
targets2–4. 

At the neural level, research have show that the mere 
perception of Black individual may trigger a pattern of neuro- 
physiological response consistent with rapid activation of the 
threat-signalling system, such a increase activity in the 
amygdala6 and enhance startle potentiation6,7. Of interest, two 
study have explore the effect of anxiety in the expression of 
Black-threat association and found that high cortisol reactivity to 
stress may exacerbate vigilance for racial threat cues8 and reduce 
the ability to control stereotypic behaviour9. These study hint to 
an influence of alter state of psycho-physiological arousal 
on racially bias behaviour, especially in relation to anxiety 
and alter pattern of physiological response (for example, 
ref 10–12). However, the physiological afferent mechanism that 
underpin the feedback of physiological state to the brain be 
typically overlooked. One contribute factor to this oversight be 
the relative difficulty in characterize the mechanism through 
which bodily state interact with perception and cognition, 
because it be methodologically challenge to disentangle afferent 
‘body-to-brain’ effect from efferent ‘brain-to-body’ response or 
arousal-related mental states13,14. 

One prominent channel of body and brain communication be 
that conveyed by baroreceptors, pressure and stretch-sensitive 
receptor within the heart and surround arteries. Within each 
cardiac cycle, burst of baroreceptor afferent activity encode the 
strength and timing of each heartbeat be carry via the vagus 
and glossopharyngeal nerve afferent to the nucleus of the solitary 
tract15. This represent the major mechanism for fast and short- 
term regulation of blood pressure, through which increase in 
blood pressure trigger a parasympathetic-mediated reflex slow 
of the follow heartbeat and induce sympatho-inhibitory 
peripheral vasodilatation13,15,16. Importantly, this be also the 
principal route that communicates to the brain the dynamic state 
of the heart, enable the representation of cardiovascular arousal 
within viscerosensory brain regions, and influence ascend 
neuromodulator system implicate in emotional and 
motivational behaviour17. Because arterial baroreceptor be 
activate by the arterial pulse pressure wave, their phasic 
discharge be maximal during and immediately after the cardiac 
systole, that is, when the blood be eject from the heart, and 
minimal during cardiac diastole, that is, between heartbeats18,19. 
Capitalizing on this, recently developed experimental paradigm 
propose that it be possible to explore the impact of this 
interoceptive signal on psychological process by timing the 
brief presentation of stimulus to the different phase of the cardiac 
cycle. In particular, it be observe that when certain category 
of stimulus be present during systole versus diastole, stimulus 
processing be enhance or attenuated. This be typically take a 
evidence that concurrent baroreceptor fire modulates brain– 
body interaction across a variety of psychological domains, 
include the processing of sensory20,21 and painful18,22 stimuli, 
and cognitive process such a short-term23 and long-term24 

memory. Of particular interest for the present study, previous 
research use this experimental approach found that the neural 
representation of certain emotional stimuli, such a fearful facial 
expressions, be co-modulated with baroreceptor signals25,26. In 

particular, the detection and appraisal of fearful face be enhance 
at systole and diminish at diastole, when the central repre- 
sentation of cardiovascular arousal is, respectively, maximal and 
minimal. At the neural level, these baroreceptor-related effect in 
the processing of threat stimulus be thought to be associate with 
change in the engagement of brain system involve in 
emotional processing and autonomic regulation include the 
amygdala and the insula19,26,27. 

Thus, this experimental approach allows the presentation 
of stimulus in discrete yet short-term physiological context 
(baroreceptor activation or quiescence) to individuate the pote- 
ntial influence that heart-to-brain signal have on cognition and 
behaviour without induce the subjective experience of alter 
cardiovascular arousal17. Here, we apply this strategy to 
investigate how the cardiac cycle modulates the processing 
(Study 1) and behavioural expression (Study 2) of racial 
stereotypes. On the basis of the know effect of cardiac cycle 
in fear processing17,26, we expect that racial stimulus present 
at systole, compare with those present at diastole, would be 
associate with great racial bias when activate threat-related 
stereotype (Studies 1 and 2) but not when associate with 
positive racial stereotype (Study 3). 

Results 
Cardiac effect in weapon identification task. In Study 1, we 
use the weapon identification task (WIT)5, a task design to 
ass the implicit stereotype of Black individual a dangerous. 
Participants be require to make fast discrimination between 
image of handgun or tool prim with picture of Black or 
White individuals’ face (Fig. 1). Because face perception acti- 
vates semantic knowledge associate with each group category 
(for example, Black-threat), the presence of racial bias be typically 
reflect by improve identification of handgun and reduce 
identification of tool when precede by Black prime compare 
with White primes5,9. We time the presentation of the prime to 
coincide with the systolic (that is, B300 m after the R-wave) or 
diastolic (that is, B500 m after the R-wave) phase of the cardiac 
cycle. This show that afferent cardiac activity influence 
the expression of racial bias, a demonstrate by the signi- 
ficant three-way interaction prime (Black/White)� object 
(tool/weapon)� cardiac cycle (systole/diastole) on a repeat 
measure ANOVA (n¼ 30) on accuracy rates, F(1,29)¼ 36.58, 
Po0.001, Z2¼ 0.56. The interaction prime� object be also 
significant, F(1,29)¼ 24.69, Po0.001, Z2¼ 0.46, replicate the 
overall racial bias pattern typically observe in this task. Breaking 
down the interaction accord to object type confirm this 
effect in the identification of both tool (F(1,29)¼ 19.36, 
Po0.001, Z2¼ 0.40) and weapon (F(1,29)¼ 14.13, P¼ 0.001, 
Z2¼ 0.32). Planned comparisons, use two-tailed pair t-tests 
(n¼ 30), reveal good identification of weapon (t(1,29)¼ 5.06, 
Po0.001, Cohen’s d¼ 0.92) after Black (versus White) prime 
and tool (t(1,29)¼ 8.44, Po0.001, Cohen’s d¼ 1.54) after White 
(versus Black) prime at systole but not at diastole (tso0.71, 
Ps40.45, Cohen’s dso0.13; Fig. 1). In other words, the 
processing of racial cue when the central signal of cardiac 
activity be maximal (at systole), compare with when it be 
minimal (at diastole), result in an increase in stereotypic errors. 
Importantly, the cardiac cycle modulation of prime effect be 
dependent on semantic association between the prime and the 
object, since Black face present at systole diminish the 
identification of tool yet improve the identification of weapons. 
We also carry out analysis on accuracy accord to the signal 
detection theory (SDT)28 to explore how the ability to discri- 
minate between tool and weapon (d0) and bias in response 
tendency (C) varied accord to prime type and cardiac cycle.

For that, we calculate separate d0 and C index a a function of 
prime and cardiac cycle and enter them into separate prime 
(Black/White)� cardiac cycle (systole/diastole) repeat meas- 
ures ANOVAs (n¼ 30). Analyses on d0 index reveal that 
neither the interaction nor the main effect be significant 
(Fs(1,29)o0.93, Ps40.34, Zs2o0.031). Conversely, both the 
interaction prime� cardiac cycle (F(1,29)¼ 42.01, Po0.001, 
Z2¼ 0.59) and main effect of race (F(1,29)¼ 20.25, Po0.001, 
Z2¼ 0.41), but not the main effect of cardiac cycle (F(1,29)¼ 0.06, 
P¼ 0.82, Z2o0.01), be found to have significant effect in 
C. Together, SDT result confirm that cardiac cycle do not 
influence object discrimination per se (d0) but enhance the 
response bias (C) a a function of prime type. 

According to theory of implicit cognition29,30, performance 
in this task be a product of different sub-processes that can be 
categorize a automatic, that is, the activation of racial asso- 
ciations, and controlled, that is, the ability to detect a correct 
response and overcome automatic associations. Using the perfor- 
mance dissociation procedure (PDP)5,30, we be able to compute 
independent estimate of these sub-processes and explore the 
effect of cardiac cycle in each of them. For that, index of 
automatic and control processing be enter into separate 
repeat measure ANOVAs (n¼ 30) with prime (Black/White) 
and cardiac cycle (systole/diastole) a within-subject factors. 
Interestingly, an effect of cardiac cycle be observe in automatic 
(F(1,29)¼ 28.13, Po0.001, Z2¼ 0.49) but not in contro- 
lled process (F(1,29)¼ 0.91, P¼ 0.35, Z2¼ 0.03), such that 

present prime at systole lead to enhance activation of racial 
stereotypes. In other words, a control behaviour fail due to 
the need to provide time-constrained decisions, automatic 
association influence behaviour, particularly when prime 
be present at systole. Conversely, neither the interaction 
of prime� cardiac cycle (automatic: F(1,29)¼ 0.35, P¼ 0.56, 
Z2¼ 0.01; controlled: F(1,29)¼ 2.0, P¼ 0.17, Z2¼ 0.06) nor the 
main effect of prime (automatic: F(1,29)¼ 2.29, P¼ 0.14, 
Z2¼ 0.07; controlled: F(1,29)¼ 1.16, P¼ 0.29, Z2¼ 0.04) be 
significant, suggest a similar influence of cardiac cycle on the 
automatic processing of Black-weapons and White-tools associa- 
tions. It should be note that the seemingly unexpected associa- 
tion White-tools be in fact a consequence of contextual contrast 
effect typically observe in evaluative prim tasks31. That is, 
give the predominant association Black-threat in this task, non- 
threaten object are, by contextual contrast, associate with 
White face lead to a response pattern reflect the 
association White-thus-safety-thus-tool. 

Cardiac effect in first person shooter task. In Study 1 we 
investigated, for the first time, of how incoming afferent physio- 
logical signal may impact the modulation of racially bias 
behaviour. In Study 2, we extend these finding to situation 
require threat-related decision-making in complex scenarios. The 
first person shooter task (FPST)2 be design to recreate the 
real-life scenario in which a police officer need to make the

between picture (targets) of tool and weapon that be precede by picture (primes) of a White or a Black male face. Prime onset be synchronize

split-second decision of whether to shoot or not a pote- 
ntially arm individual. In each trial, participant be present 
with a photo of a White or Black male hold either a gun 
or a harmless object in his hand. Participants be require to make 
the time-constrained decision to ‘shoot’ or ‘not to shoot’ base 
on whether the person be hold a gun or another object, respec- 
tively. Typically, participant be more likely to shoot unarmed 
Black individual than unarmed White individuals2–4. By timing 
the onset of stimulus presentation to coincide with cardiac systole 
or diastole, we test the influence of afferent cardiovasc- 
ular information on the expression of racial bias (Fig. 2). 
Similarly to Study 1, the three-way interaction object (weapon/no 
weapon)� race (Black/White)� cardiac cycle (systole/diastole) on 
the repeat measure ANOVA (n¼ 30) on accuracy rate be 
found to be significant, F(1,29)¼ 5.40, P¼ 0.027, Z2¼ 0.16, 
confirm the effect of cardiac cycle on racially bias decision- 
making. The prime� object interaction, F(1,29)¼ 4.38, P¼ 0.045, 
Z2¼ 0.13, be also significant, replicate the overall racial bias 
pattern typically observe in this task. Separate analysis on the 
cardiac cycle� race interaction for each object type reveal that 
the phase of the cardiac cycle modulate racially bias response 
to unarmed targets, F(1,29)¼ 6.24, P¼ 0.018, Z2¼ 0.18 (main 
effect of race: F(1,29)¼ 5.21, P¼ 0.030, Z2¼ 0.15; main effect of 
cardiac cycle: F(1,29)o0.01, P¼ 0.98, Z2o0.01). Planned compa- 
risons, use two-tailed pair t-tests (n¼ 30), further reveal that 
participant ‘shot’ more often unarmed Black target than White 
target when the stimulus be present at systole, t(1,29)¼ 3.02, 

P¼ 0.015, Cohen’s d¼ 0.55, but not at diastole, t(1,29)¼ � 0.46, 
P¼ 0.71, Cohen’s d¼ 0.08 (Fig. 2). Thus, in line with Study 1, 
present stimulus during period of enhance representation of 
cardiac activity be associate with increase salience of racial cues, 
lead to an increase likelihood of shoot ‘unarmed’ Black 
individuals. However, cardiac cycle do not modulate racial bias on 
arm trials, F(1,29)¼ 1.08, P¼ 0.31, Z2¼ 0.04 (main effect of race: 
F(1,29)¼ 0.80, P¼ 0.38, Z2¼ 0.03; main effect of cardiac cycle: 
F(1,29)¼ 0.02, P¼ 0.88, Z2o0.01). While we have predict cardiac 
cycle to modulate behavioural response to arm target a well, 
these result be not surprising a this task may be less sensitive to 
the detection of cardiac cycle effect over racial cue in the ‘armed’ 
condition for at least two reasons: (i) task instruction encourage 
participant to provide a ‘shoot’ response (see ‘Methods’ section) 
lead to generalize high accuracy in ‘armed’ trials. Cardiac 
cycle effect may be less likely to be observe when performance 
approach celling levels; (ii) in these trial an objectively 
threaten stimulus be present independently of the target’s race 
which may further hinder the observation of the expect bias in 
activation of racial threat stereotype by cardiac cycle. 

We also carry out SDT analysis by submit d0 and C 
index to separate race (Black/White)� cardiac cycle (systole/ 
diastole) repeat measure ANOVAs (n¼ 30). Results on d0 
index reveal that while neither race nor cardiac cycle 
influence object discrimination (Fs(1,29)o1.03, Ps40.32, 
Zs2o0.034), the interaction be significant (Fs(1,29)¼ 4.72, 
Ps¼ 0.038, Zs2o0.14), suggest different ability to discriminate

object held by a Black or White person a a function of cardiac 
cycle. However, post hoc analyses, use two-tailed pair t-tests 
(n¼ 30), fail to identify difference between condition 
(ts(1,29)o2.04, Ps40.11, Cohen’s dso0.38) and therefore these 
result should be interpret with caution. No significant 
interaction nor main effect in response criterion a a function 
of race and cardiac cycle (Fs(1,29)o3.02, Ps40.093, Zs2o0.10) 
be found. The apparent contrast result between ‘C’ and 
main analysis in accuracy rate should be explain by the fact 
that, a discuss above, performance approach celling level in 
the ‘armed’ conditions. That is, while d0 and C index 
simultaneously considers decision in both ‘armed’ and ‘unarmed’ 
conditions, baroreceptor effect be only found to modulate race 
bias in ‘unarmed’ trials. 

In condition of relative ambiguity and/or when act under 
pressure, such a when a police officer need to make a split- 
second decision of whether to shoot or not, contextual cue may 
have a strong influence on judgment and behaviour. Although 
seemingly irrelevant for the discrimination between a weapon 
and a harmless object, social (for example, Black versus White 
individuals) and contextual (for example, dark alley versus rich 
neighbourhood) cue may shift perceptual judgment and 
increase the probability of perceive the situation a threating32. 
Likewise, emotional state of anger33, anxiety and sustain state 
of psycho-physiological arousal enhance vigilance to threat- 
related stimuli34 and influence racially bias behaviour8,9. We 
extend these observation by demonstrate the discrete power of 
fine-grained dynamic communication of cardiovascular arousal 
wherein preconscious fluctuation in interoceptive afferent 
activity amplify the impact of racial cue in biasing threat- 
related behaviour. Importantly, our result identify for the first 
time, bottom-up body-to-brain correlate for racially bias 
behaviour. This represent a clear departure from the traditional 
approach that do not differentiate afferent from efferent effects. 
That is, past study measure physiological response to racial 
stimulus or use anxiety enhance technique that, although 
elicit state of bodily arousal8,9, do not disentangle the discrete 
modulatory effect of afferent bodily signal from that of anxiety- 
related cognitive processing. In contrast, our approach in which 
the critical physiological condition be likely to reflect rapid 
neurally signal cardiovascular states, allow u to observe 
within-participant fluctuation in the expression of racial bias and 
explore the influence that body-to-brain signal may have on 
social threat processing and intergroup biases. 

Cardiac effect in sport-fruits identification task. However, 
racial bias toward Black individual be not uniformly negative 
(for example, associate with threat). Depending on the context, 
different stereotype may be activated. In Study 3, we investigate 
if the report effect of cardiovascular interoceptive signal can 
be generalize to positive racial association portray Black 
individual a athletic35,36. The sport-fruits identification task35 be 
a modify version of the WIT in which participant be 
require to discriminate between picture of fruit and sport- 
object precede by picture of White or Black faces. Once more, 
we time the presentation of prime to coincide with the systolic 
or diastolic phase of the cardiac cycle (Fig. 3). While the three- 
way interaction prime (Black/White)� object (fruits/sport- 
objects)� cardiac cycle (systole/diastole) of the repeat 
measure ANOVA (n¼ 30) be not significant (F(1,29)¼ 0.30, 
P¼ 0.59, Z2¼ 0.01), the two-way prime� object be significant 
(F(1,29)¼ 11.36, P¼ 0.002, Z2¼ 0.28), replicate the typically 
observe bias in object identification by racial primes. Breaking 
down the interaction accord to object type confirm 
improve identification of sport-objects (F(1,29)¼ 6.26, 

P¼ 0.018, Z2¼ 0.18) precede by Black (versus White) face 
and increase accuracy in the discrimination of fruit 
(F(1,29)¼ 8.24, P¼ 0.008, Z2¼ 0.22) precede by White (versus 
Black) faces. However, cardiac cycle do not modulate this bias in 
either case (Fs(1,29)o1.05, Ps40.31, Zsso0.035; Fig. 3). 
Analyses of d0 reveal that neither the cardiac cycle� prime 
interaction (repeated measure ANOVA, n¼ 30) nor the main 
effect be significant (Fs(1,29)o0.51, Ps40.48, Zs2o0.02). 
Conversely, an effect of prime (F(1,29)¼ 9.38, P¼ 0.005, 
Z2¼ 0.24) could be observe in response bias, show that 
Black prime induced a great tendency to provide the sport- 
object response. Neither the main effect of cardiac cycle 
(F(1,29)¼ 2.1, P¼ 0.149, Z2¼ 0.07) nor the interaction be 
significant (F(1,29)¼ 1.18, P¼ 0.29, Z2¼ 0.04), confirm that 
cardiac cycle do not modulate racial bias. Thus, together these 
study show that cardiac cycle effect on the expression of 
implicit racial bias be not the same across all social stereotype (see 
Supplementary Note 1 for a statistical comparison between Study 
1 and Study 3). Importantly, the fact that prime in Study 3 
induced a robust behavioural bias confirms that the result 
report in Studies 1 and 2 do not reflect a general baroreceptor 
effect over pure perceptual or inhibitory processes37,38 but instead 
depend on the contextual and semantic content of the activate 
associations. 

Black-threat and Black-athletic stereotype differ in several 
ways, but perhaps, most significantly they differ in term of 
valence and salience of the associate emotions. This might be the 
key for the different result observed. The impact of incoming 
interoceptive information on the activation of semantic and 
affective reaction should depend on the relevance that bodily 
state of arousal have in the expression of the associate emotion 
and contingent behavioural response. In condition of high vigil- 
ance, such a when discriminate between a weapon and a 
harmless object, the feedback of bodily state may be particularly 
informative in guide behaviour. Conversely the positive, and 
presumably motivationally less relevant, stereotype Black-athletic 
may rely to a lesser extent on bodily information. This be in line 
with previous research show preferential baroreceptor-related 
modulation in the processing of certain emotional categories, 
notably fear17,26. We suggest that those form of bias associate 
with strong emotional, or motivational, content may be parti- 
cularly sensitive to feedback of cardiovascular arousal, a reveal 
by the potentiation of effect within the cardiac cycle. 

Discussion 
There be a grow consensus that the continuous dynamic 
cortical representation of internal bodily states, such a the one 
conveyed by cardiac afferent signals, shape emotion and set the 
foundation for a sense of self a the basis for subjective 
experience13,14,39–43. It be also believe that preconscious short- 
term fluctuation in baroreceptor activity provide the physio- 
logical context through which body–brain effect can modulate 
the processing of, and subsequent neurophysiological response 
to, sensory18,20–22 and emotional25,26 stimuli. Here, by synchro- 
nizing stimulus presentation to this signal we be able to 
investigate, without induce sustain state of psycho- 
physiological arousal, how the processing of complex social 
stimulus and associate behavioural consequence may change in 
condition in which the representation of cardiac activity in the 
brain be maximal compare with when it be minimal17. Although 
causal relationship between baroreceptor fire and racially 
bias behaviour be difficult to confirm empirically, our result 
suggest that this interoceptive mechanism may constitute a 
channel for body-to-brain influence in the processing of 
motivationally salient social stimuli. In particular, we propose

that, in the context of alertness to threat-signalling stimuli, 
heighten representation of cardiac signal in the brain may 
enhance the salience of social cue and promote the expression of 
negative racial stereotypes. 

Arterial baroreceptor signal be carry by cranial nerve 
X and XI directly to the nucleus of the solitary tract, which in turn 
have proximate connection with region such a the thalamus and 
the amygdala. The observation of the enhance activation 
of a negative racial stereotype by cardiac afferent information 
be likely to be underpinned by functional change in these region 
and in particular within the amygdala, a centre already implicate 
in baroreceptor effect on the processing of salient19 and 
fear stimuli17,26. Moreover, specific amygdala nucleus play central 
role in cod the salience and associative relevance of 
perceptual stimuli44–46, particularly in the context of threat 
processing, include the modulation of attention to fear-relevant 
stimuli, fear conditioning and regulation of autonomic state 
of fear and anxiety47,48. Amygdala nucleus be also engage in 
out-group face perception, threat detection and learn of social 
fears49,50. Interestingly however, amygdala activity to racial 
out-group stimulus be modulate by the social-cognitive goal and 
the presence of threat-related cues51,52. Thus, the observe 
exaggeration of racial bias in a highly salient, threat-related 

context be likely to be mediate through modulation of amygdala 
responsiveness by interoceptive signal originate in phasic 
arterial baroreceptor activity. In other words, in the context of 
alertness to threat-signalling stimuli, amygdala response to 
relevant environmental cue may be modulate by the strength 
and quality of the cardiac signals. 

Another possible parallel mechanism relates to the know inhi- 
bitory effect of cardiovascular baroreceptor fire on activity 
within high order cortical region include dorsolateral pref- 
rontal cortex, via influence on thalamocortical gating, reduce 
the ability to inhibit prepotent responses38. The implication 
would be that baroreceptor activity would increase the expression 
of racial stereotype by compromise the ability to overcome 
undesirable automatic responses. While these mechanism be 
not mutually exclusive, two piece of evidence favour the tentative 
explanation of enhance activation of semantic association 
mediate by amygdala. First, our PDP analysis pinpoint an effect 
over automatic but not control processes. Second, Black- 
athletic stereotype also activate prepotent response but these 
be not modulate by cardiac timing. Future study may help to 
elucidate this further. 

It could be tempt to interpret the pattern of result obse- 
rved in study 1 and 2 a evidence for extinguish bias at

experimental paradigm use in Study 1 in which participant (n¼ 30) need to discriminate between picture (targets) of fruit and sport-objects that be 
precede by picture (primes) of a White or a Black male face. As in Study 1, we synchronize prime onset to coincide with the cardiac systole or diastole. 

(b) Cumulative frequency of stimulus onset (ms) relative to the R-wave peak for each cardiac cycle condition. Trials be then re-coded a-posteriori

Excluded time interval be displayed in lighter shades. (c) Average accuracy rate (and standard errors) a a function of object type, race and cardiac cycle. 

Primes successfully induced response bias a reflect by the prime� object interaction. In particular, we observe great accuracy in the identification of 
sport-objects precede by Black (versus White) face and improve identification of fruit precede by White (versus Black) faces. However, in contrast 

with Study 1, this effect be not modulate by cardiac cycle. Together with the result from Study 1, Study 3 show that cardiac cycle effect in the 

processing of racial cue be context dependent, such that the salient negative association Black-threat, but not the positive Black-athletic stereotype, be 

modulate by baroreceptor-mediated effect of interoceptive feedback.

diastole but such interpretation should be do with caution. The 
experimental approach use here compare relative contribution 
of the central representation of cardiovascular arousal in the 
processing of certain social stimulus by tap into the extreme 
of ongoing fluctuation of baroreceptor activity which co-vary 
with the cardiac cycle. Past research on cardiac timing argues for 
the relative nature of baroreceptor effect (for example, 
ref 26,38), that is, a relative enhancement of fear processing at 
systole and an inhibition at diastole26. Garfinkel et al.26 also 
show that the relative inhibition of fear processing at diastole 
be particularly evident among low anxiety individuals, and 
suggest that the diminish inhibition of threat processing in 
anxious individual may reflect a mechanism contribute to the 
exacerbation of fear signal in anxiety. While we have not 
measure anxiety level among our participants, we speculate that 
a similar mechanism may be at play here. Inhibition of racial bias 
at diastole may reflect a mechanism through which the signal 
of threat by member of a social group be attenuated. It be know 
that anxiety and sustain state of arousal impact and exacerbate 
intergroup biases10–12. Without inhibitory mechanism such a 
the one propose here racial association would be more likely to 
escalate over time, promote anxiety and reduce the ability to 
control racial bias. This account be consistent with current 
amygdala-centred model of learn and expression of aversive 
social associations49,50, accord to which the amygdala nucleus 
serve two main functions: (i) form and store association between 
somatosensory state and representation of particular stimulus 
(for example, Black individuals); (ii) and mediate the physio- 
logical response to the associate stimuli. Our result build up on 
this by suggest the influence of the relative strength or 
weakness of afferent cardiac sensation in the flexible enhan- 
cement and suppression of amygdala responsiveness to conditio- 
ned stimuli. However, further research be need to determine 
how interoceptive signal contribute to the promotion of anxiety 
in intergroup interactions. 

Lastly, while the present research focus on threat-related 
processes, we have no reason to believe that these association 
between cardiac cycle and the potentiation of social association 
be specific to race or fear processing. Indeed, we predict the 
extension of these effect to other social groups/stereotypes 
associate with substantial affective or motivational relevance. 
We suggest this may be an important body-to-brain mechanism 
affect the processing of salient social signal and subsequent 
action accordingly. In line with current account highlight the 
predictive inferential nature of the brain, the (mis)perception of a 
gun or an object be a consequence of prediction-based perception 
shape by previous social association and concurrent bodily 
signal (53). Future research should investigate the neural 
underpinnings of these effects, a well a the functional correlate 
and the apparent inhibition of negative racial bias in condition of 
quiescent baroreceptor firing. To the extent that this body-to- 
brain mechanism can be use a an intervention to accelerate 
unlearn of fear or threat-related stimuli, our result may have a 
substantial impact in the development of training intervention in 
professional setting where negative stereotype may play a 
crucial role. 

Methods 
Participants. In Study 1, data be collect from 32 (24 females; mean age¼ 21.8, 
s.d.¼ 4.4) White healthy volunteers. Data from two participant be exclude from 
analysis due to incorrect use of response key or noisy electrocardiogram (ECG) 
signal. Thus, the final sample comprise 30 (22 females; mean age¼ 22, s.d.¼ 4.5) 
participants. In Study 2, data be collect from 35 (26 females; mean age¼ 22.0, 
s.d.¼ 4.6) non overlap White healthy volunteers. Data from five participant 
be exclude due to report difficulty in discriminate the different type of 
stimulus (see Supplementary Methods 1). The final data set comprise 30 (21 
females; mean age¼ 22.2, s.d.¼ 3.6) participants. In Study 3, the sample comprise 
30 new healthy volunteer (67% White; 30% Asian; 7% mix White-Asian; 25 

females; mean age¼ 21.6, s.d.¼ 3.7; see Supplementary Fig. 1 for control analysis 
related to participants’ race). Data from one additional participant (White female) 
be exclude from analysis due to suspicion of incorrect use of the response key 
(accuracy rate between 9 and 49%). All participant give write inform 
consent. All study be approve by the Departmental Ethics Committee, 
Department of Psychology, Royal Holloway University of London. 

ECG recording. Three disposable ECG electrode be place in a modify lead I 
chest configuration: two electrode be position underneath the left and right 
collarbone and another on the participant’s low back on the left side. The 
ECG signal be record with a Powerlab 8/35 (Powerlab, ADInstruments, 
http://www.adinstruments.com/) use LAbchart 8 Pro software. The sample rate 
be 1,000 Hz and a hardware band-pass filter (Bio Amp 132) between 0.3 and 
1,000 Hz be applied. Heartbeats be detect online with a hardware base 
function (fast output response), which identifies the ECG R-wave with a delay 
small than 1 m (www.adinstruments.com/) by detect when the amplitude 
exceeds an individually define threshold. Internal lab report use this method 
confirm that the software present the stimulus receives the transistor-transistor 
logic (TTL) pulse signal a heartbeat and be able to process it within o2 ms. 

Because our design include the presentation of a mask/background image up 
to 600 m before the prime/target picture onset, and therefore previous to the 
reference R-wave, the timing of occurrence of the reference heartbeat have to be 
predicted. This be achieve with a custom-made software, implement in Matlab 
(Matworks, http://uk.mathworks.com/), base on the timing of the three precede 
R-waves. The reliability of this predictive method be test by measure 
a-posteriori the time distance between stimulus onset and the previous R-wave. The 
histogram of cumulative frequency of stimulus onset (ms) relative to the R-wave 
peak for each cardiac cycle condition be displayed in Figs 1–3b. Despite the high 
predictive power of our method, some overlap between systolic and diastolic trial 
be present. To address this issue, trial be re-coded accord to the actual 
stimulus onset. Following previous literature, the systolic period be define a 
200–400 m after the R-wave (for example, ref 18,26,54), which be the period of 
maximal representation of baroreceptor afferent activity and when cardiac cycle 
effect be typically observed. Diastole, the remain period of the cardiac cycle, 
be define a 450–800 m after the R-wave. Stimuli present between 400 and 
450 m be exclude a the 400–450 m window represent a challenge for the 
accurate classification of systole/diastole. For example, physiologically, the 
presentation of a stimulus at 395 m should not be too different from another 
present at 405 m but with this classification method they be expect to have 
opposite effects. Trials in which stimulus be present after 800 m or between 
0–200 m after the R-wave be also exclude to avoid the possibility that target 
onset (which follow immediately primes) partially overlap with the systolic 
period. Across the three study percentage of exclude stimulus be small than 
10.5%. 

Study 1. Weapons identification task. Stimuli consist of black and white photo 
adapt from5,55. Primes be photo of a Black or White male face with neutral 
expression55. Twelve Black and 12 White model be used. Target stimulus 
consist of a photo of a handgun or a tool (for example, wrench, pliers). Six 
different tool and handgun be used. Presentation timing be adapt to 
allow synchronization with the cardiac cycle. The prime be present for 200 m 
with the onset time to coincide either with the end of the systolic phase (that is, 
B300 m after the R-wave) or during the diastolic period (that is, B500 m after 
the R-wave). Immediately after, the target be present for 150 ms. These 
presentation timing be adopt so that prime be present at systole or 
diastole and target onset occur outside the critical systolic period. This allow 
u to investigate the effect of baroreceptor activity in the activation of racial 
stereotype and not in the processing or response to threat-related objects. Before 
the prime and after the target a mask be present for 600 and 300 ms, 
respectively, independently of cardiac cycle condition. A fixation cross in the centre 
of the screen be displayed between trials. inter-trial interval consist in the 
(variable) time period necessary to detect four heartbeat and predict the timing of 
the subsequent cardiac cycle during which the stimulus would be presented. 
Participants’ task be to press the ‘i’ key, with their right hand, if the target be a 
weapon and the ‘e’ key, with their left hand, if the target be a tool. They be 
instruct to be a fast and accurate a possible and be told that failure to 
provide an answer within 500 m would lead to a feedback warn ‘Please try to be 
quicker’. Nevertheless, to allow reaction time analyses, response latency up to 
650 m be collected. Response key associate with weapon and tool be not 
counterbalance across participants. This may not be ideal, a it may lead to an 
unbalanced use of the dominant hand to identify one of the target and influence 
the ability to quickly respond to weapon versus tools. Nevertheless, give the 
within-participant-and-target nature of our effect of interest, it should have no 
influence on the observe behavioural pattern related to cardiac cycle effects. 
A total of 264 trials, 33 per condition, be present in a fully randomize order. 
Half-way through the task, participant be ask to rest for at least two minutes. 
In order to familiarize participant with the stimulus and task procedures, two 
practice block be administered. In the first practice block, comprise of 12 trials, 
no prime be present and no time limit be give for target identification. The

second practice block consist of 12 trial in which prime and the response time 
limit be introduced. 

Accuracy rate (that is, on-time correct response divide by the number of 
trials) be analyse both through standard analysis of variance, that is, prime 
(Black/White)� object (tool/weapon)� cardiac cycle (systole/diastole) ANOVA, 
and accord to SDT. In the SDT analyses, separate d0 and C index be 
estimate a a function of prime and cardiac cycle and enter into separate prime 
(Black/White)� cardiac cycle (systole/diastole) ANOVAs. ‘Hit rates’ be define 
a the percentage of correct response to weapon and ‘false alarms’ a the 
percentage of incorrect response to tools. 

We have also use the PDP to estimate the contribution of automatic 
(PDP-automatic) and control (PDP-control) process to performance in this 
task. PDP-control index be estimate separately for Black and White prime 
condition by subtract error rate on stereotype incongruent trial (Black-Tool 
and White-Weapon, respectively) from accuracy on stereotype congruent trial 
(Black-Weapons and White-Tool, respectively). PDP-automatic index be 
compute by divide error rate on stereotype incongruent trial by the respective 
reciprocal of PD-control scores5. Cardiac cycle effect be explore by estimate 
these index separately for trial at systole and diastole. 

All P value from post hoc comparison be correct use the Newman– 
Keuls method. Analyses of reaction time reveal equivalent result 
(Supplementary Fig. 2). Please refer to online Supplementary Information for: 
(i) analysis refer to participant’s individual interoceptive accuracy56 

(Supplementary Note 2) and (ii) a Figure show the distribution of stereotypic 
error across participant at the different phase of the cardiac cycle 
(Supplementary Fig. 3a). 

Study 2. First person shooter task. Stimuli consist of picture take from2,3 
depict White and Black male individual hold a handgun or another object 
(for example, mobile phone, wallet). Participants be instruct to act a a police 
officer and ‘shoot’ the target by press the key ‘i’, with their right hand, if he have 
a gun and ‘not to shoot’ him by press the ‘e’ key, with their left hand, if he do 
not have a gun. Response key associate with weapon and tool be not 
counterbalance across participants. Each trial begin with the presentation of a 
background image (for example, a street, a park) for 400–500 m after which the 
target image be superimpose for 200 ms. The presentation of the target be time- 
lock to coincide with systole (that is, B300 m after the R-wave) or diastole 
(that is, B500 m after the R-wave). Unlike previous research with this task, we do 
not present a random number of background before the target onset due to time 
constrains link with the synchronization with heart timings. A fixation cross be 
present on the centre of the screen for the entire inter-trial-interval. The task 
comprise a total of 180 trial (23 per condition) but only 148 different picture 
be used, meaning that 32 pictures, randomly select for each participant, be 
present twice. Stimuli to be present at systole and diastole be also randomly 
select for each participant. Half-way through the task, participant be ask to 
rest for at least two minutes. The task include two block of practice trials, 
comprise by 12 trial each. The image present be different from those use 
in the experimental task. No time limit be give for response in the first practice 
block. In the second block the response time limit be introduced. 

Participants be told that if they fail to make a key press within 650 m they 
would receive the feedback ‘Please try to be quicker’. Nonetheless, to allow reaction 
time analyses, response up to 1,000 m after target onset be collected. 
Participants be award and deduct point on the basis of their performance 
(shooting arm targets: þ 10 points; not shoot unarmed targets: þ 5 points; 
shoot unarmed targets: � 20 points; not shoot arm targets: � 40 points; 
fail to give an answer within 650 ms: � 10 points). These payoff be 
implement to partially simulate the payoff matrix experienced by police officer 
on the street2. They be also told that the 3 best player from the entire pool of 
participant would be award a reward (d20–first place; d10–second place; 
d5–third place). Accuracy feedback and update total of point be provide after 
each trial (see Supplementary Methods 1 for further details). 

Accuracy rate (that is, the ratio between on-time correct response and the 
number of valid trials) be analyse both through standard analysis of variance 
and accord to SDT. Here, ‘hit rates’ be define a the percentage of correct 
response in the ‘shoot’ condition and ‘false alarms’ a the percentage of error in 
the ‘don’t shoot’ condition. P value from post hoc comparison be correct 
use the Newman–Keuls method. 

Participants also carry out the Implicit Association Test55 to measure how 
performance in the FPST relates to general implicit attitude towards Black 
individual (See Supplementary Note 3). Please refer to online Supplementary 
Information for: (i) analysis of reaction time (Supplementary Fig. 4) and 
(ii) a Figure show the distribution of stereotypic error across participant at 
the different phase of the cardiac cycle (Supplementary Fig. 3B) 

Study 3. Sport-fruits identification task. Procedures and experimental design be 
equivalent to that of Study 1 with the exception of the target stimulus used. Here, 
participant have to discriminate between picture of fruit (for example, apple, 
grapes, cherries) and sport-objects (for example, basketball ball, weights, skate- 
board)35. This task tap into the stereotype of Black individual a athletic35,36. Ten 

black and white picture of each stimulus category be used. The ‘e’ and ‘i’ key 
be assign to fruit and sport-related objects, respectively. 

As in Study 1, accuracy rate (that is, on-time correct response divide by the 
number of trials) be analyse both through standard analysis of variance and 
accord to SDT. In the SDT analyses, ‘hit rates’ be define a the percentage of 
correct response to sport-objects and ‘false alarms’ a the percentage of incorrect 
response to fruits. 

Analyses of reaction time reveal equivalent result (Supplementary Fig. 5). 
Please refer to online Supplementary Information for a Figure show the 
distribution of stereotypic error across participant at the different phase of the 
cardiac cycle (Supplementary Fig. 3C).
