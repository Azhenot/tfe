Nanoscale metal inclusion in or on solid-state dielectric be an integral part of modern 

electrocatalysis, optoelectronics, capacitors, metamaterials and memory devices. The 

property of these composite system strongly depend on the size, dispersion of the 

inclusion and their chemical stability, and be usually consider constant. Here we 

demonstrate that nanoscale inclusion (for example, clusters) in dielectric dynamically 

change their shape, size and position upon apply electric field. Through systematic in situ 

transmission electron microscopy studies, we show that fundamental electrochemical 

process can lead to universally observe nucleation and growth of metal clusters, even for 

inert metal like platinum. The cluster exhibit diverse dynamic behaviour govern by 

kinetic factor include ion mobility and redox rates, lead to different filament growth 

mode and structure in memristive devices. These finding reveal the microscopic origin 

behind resistive switching, and also provide general guidance for the design of novel device 

involve electronics and ionics.

he ability to control and manipulate metal inclusion (for 
example, individual metal clusters) inside a solid-state 
medium will greatly expand the function and create new 

class of material (for example, metamaterials) and device for 
electronic, magnetic, photonic, chemical and optoelectronic 
applications1–6. Such ability have be demonstrated, for 
example, with scan tunnel microscopy tools1. However, 
manual manipulation use scan tunnel microscopy be 
slow and inefficient, and not device-friendly compare with 
method such a use local electric fields. Indeed, device base 
on the field-driven migration of metal inclusion (such a resistive 
switch or memristive devices)7–9 have attract broad interest 
recently and have show great potential a a disruptive 
technology for a number of application include nonvolatile 
memory10–13, logic14–16 and neuromorphic computing17. In 
these devices, the resistive switch be normally attribute to 
filament formation cause by the movement of metal inclusion 
in the insulate dielectric film9,10,18–20. Attempts to 
microscopically study the filament growth process have be 
carry out use scan probe microscopy15,21 and high- 
resolution transmission electron microscopy19,20,22–24 techniques. 
For example, a recent experiment reveals different filament 
growth modes20 and show that filament formation can be 
achieve in the form of metal nanoclusters. However, a critical 
question be raise regard the fundamental, microscopic 
origin of the growth and migration of the nanoclusters inside 
dielectrics25, and whether the different and seemingly contradict 
experimental result can be reconcile within the same theoretical 
framework. 

Here we directly reveal the microscopic origin of the dynamic 
growth and migration process of metal nanoclusters in 
dielectric and show that the field-driven migration be a universal 
behaviour, even for inert metal such a Pt. We show the different 
migration mode can be explain in the electrochemical model 
framework, driven by both thermodynamic and kinetic factors. 
Specifically, we show that in conventional insulator the metal 
cluster can be treat a bipolar electrode (BPEs), and can 
dissolve from their original location and nucleate and redeposit 
at new position closer to the counter electrode in a process 
driven by the compete electrochemical process occur at 
the two polarize sides. We show this fundamental process can be 
use to explain the diverse filament growth mode observe 
experimentally, and predict and verify the growth mode at 
different limit cases, therefore reconcile the different 
experimental result obtain early within a generalize 
theoretical framework10,20,22. By tune kinetic factors, we 
further show different nanocluster dynamic can be observe in 
the same device, lead to the transition between different 
filament growth modes. 

Results 
Dynamic migration of metal nanoclusters. In situ transmission 
electron microscopy (TEM) study be first conduct on bulk 
sample consist of individual metal nanoclusters embed in 
the bulk of a dielectric film. This approach enables detailed 
analysis and track of individual cluster and ensures the 
migration occurs inside the bulk of the film. By trace the 
dynamic motion of the same nanocluster under electric field in an 
in situ TEM setup for different material system (Ag, Cu, Pt, Ni), 
we successfully reveal fundamental atomic/ionic dynamic that 
be universally applicable. 

The experimental strategy be illustrate in Fig. 1a–d, use Ag 
nanoclusters a an example. An array of Ag nanoclusters be 
embed inside the SiO2 film by anneal a stack SiO2/Ag/ 
SiO2 structure with a B1-nm-thin Ag layer. Inert Au electrode 

be then deposit to apply electric field across the SiO2/Ag/ 
SiO2 stack (see Methods). SiO2 be select a the dielectric layer 
in this study because it be the most important dielectric material 
in the semiconductor industry and be also widely use for other 
device include memristive devices18,26,27. Successive focus 
ion beam (FIB) lift-out, patterning, and thin process be 
subsequently perform to prepare an array of Au/SiO2/Ag 
nanoclusters/SiO2/Au device with individual top electrode 
and share bottom electrode for cross-sectional TEM study 
(Fig. 1b–d). During in situ TEM analysis, the top Au electrode of 
a device be contact by a movable W probe, whereas the bottom 
Au electrode be ground (Fig. 1d). Figure 1e show a TEM image 
of one of the embed Ag nanoclusters along it [011] zone axis, 
with the correspond fast Fourier transformation result 
displayed in Fig. 1f, which clearly reveal the crystalline face- 
center cubic structure of the Ag cluster. 

When an electric field be applied, evolution and migration of 
the embed Ag nanoclusters can be regularly observed, a 
show in Fig. 1g–l (also see Supplementary Movie 1). The 
nanoclusters have diameter of B5 nm and the apply voltage 
be 3 V correspond to an electric field of B0.8 MV cm� 1. 
Notably, at location 1 (marked by the upper arrow) dynamic 
interaction between a pair of Ag nanoclusters be observed. As 
show in Fig. 1g–i, the cluster on the left (upstream in the 
direction of the electric field) be gradually dissolve and merge 
into another cluster on the right side (downstream), result in 
an overall movement of Ag cluster along the direction of the 
apply electric field. Similarly, cluster 2 (marked by the middle 
arrow) and 3 (marked by the low arrow) be also gradually 
dissolved. Cluster 2 disappear (Fig. 1k) and left a void in the 
film a show in Fig. 1j,k. Additionally, a cluster 3 be dissolve 
a new cluster, name cluster 4, emerge nearby, a marked by the 
low circle in Fig. 1k,l. 

These behaviour have be repeatedly observe in different 
devices. Figure 1m–p show the interaction between another pair 
of Ag nanoclusters, and illustrates the gradual dissolution of 
the original cluster upstream and the nucleation and growth 
of another cluster downstream. The original Ag cluster be 
completely dissolve and left a void behind in the original position 
(marked by circle in Fig. 1p, see Supplementary Movie 2), and 
effective growth along the field direction be achieved. 

The dynamic evolution of metal nanoclusters reveal by 
in situ TEM can be consistently explain in the theoretical 
framework of electrochemical redox process in BPEs with 
strong influence from kinetic effects. Under an electric field inside 
the dielectric, the metal nanoclusters can be treat a 
BPEs25,28,29, with an effective cathode (d–) face the field 
direction and an effective anode (dþ ) on the opposite side, a 
show in Fig. 1q. In this model, Agþ ion will be generate from 
the anode side of the cluster via electrochemical oxidation 
processes. The Agþ ion will drift along the electric field and 
become reduce when they reach a cathode (for example, the 
cathode side of another Ag cluster downstream). In the current 
experimental setup, there be no Ag supply to the first Ag cluster 
upstream, so it experience only net oxidation and thus gradually 
dissolves. The create Agþ ion can be reduce and deposit onto 
the second nanocluster downstream. If oxidation on the anode 
side of the 2nd nanocluster be suppress (due to, for example, 
kinetic limitation discuss later), the 2nd nanocluster will 
experience net growth. As a result, the first cluster merges into the 
2nd nanocluster downstream, result in an effective cluster 
displacement along the electric field, a show in Fig. 1q–s. It be 
worthwhile note that charge neutrality need to be maintain 
in the nanocluster after the generation of Agþ ions. The possible 
process involve reduction of another Agþ ion at the cathode 
side of the BPE, escape of the trap electron, or through

another reaction process (for example, reduction of moisture 
or proton27). In addition, the redox and migration process of a 
specific cluster be determine by the local electrochemical and/or 
structural environment sense by the cluster and be affected by 
the film inhomogeneity and electric field distribution, so the 
cluster dynamic be stochastic in nature. For example, out of the 
five Ag cluster show in Fig. 1g–i, the three marked cluster 
migrate to different new location at different times, while the 
other two cluster do not undergo apparent oxidation process 
within the measurement time frame. 

We note the formation of the 2nd nanocluster inside the 
SiO2 film require first a nucleation process, that is, the initial 

formation of a critical nucleus. This process can be regard a a 
chemical process of formation of stable atomic configuration to 
minimize the excess surface energy and allow further growth. The 
free enthalpy of nucleation be give by30: 

DGðNcÞ ¼ NceDjþFðNcÞþNce ð1Þ 
Where Nc be the number of atom constitute the critical 

nucleus; DG be the free enthalpy of nucleation; Dj be the voltage 
drop (a part of the apply voltage, depend on the position of 
the nucleus); F the surface energy contribution and e be the strain 
energy per atom. Dj, F and e will have significant influence on 
the nucleation a a function of the particular local chemical,

electrical and mechanical property of the oxide matrix. As a 
result, the nucleation process be spatially selective instead of be 
homogenous, a show in Fig. 1 and Supplementary Movies 1–4. 
If nucleation could not proceed, the Agþ ion can reach the Au 
counter electrode and become reduce there. This appear to be 
the case for cluster 2 in Fig. 1g–l. However, a significant geometric 
change may not be observe in this case due to the much large 
volume of the electrode. 

These analysis show that kinetic factor (for example, the 
interplay between the redox rate at the cathode/anode side of 
the BPE, nucleation rate and ionic migration speed) of the 
electrochemical redox reaction and ionic drift strongly influence 
the dynamic of the metal nanoclusters. The evolution of the 
shape and size of a cluster can be determine by the competition 
between the oxidation and reduction rate on the cathode and 
anode side of the BPE, which can be described a 

dVi 

dt 
/ Gired�Giox ð2Þ 

where Vi be the volume of cluster i, and Giox (G 
i 
red) be the oxidation 

(reduction) rate for the Ag atom (ions) on the anode and 
cathode side of cluster i, respectively. 

For two neighbour cluster (i and i� 1) with small distance, 
we can approximate the ion exchange a 

Gired ¼ Gi� 1ox ð3Þ 
accounting for the conservation of the Ag material. In system 
with more cluster interact electrostatically, the different 
growth rate will be affected by the distance between the clusters, 
their relative position to each other and their sizes. These factor 
account for the electric field strength and the overall evolution of 
the system (for example, the conduct filament in a memristive 
device20). 

In light of the above understandings, the experimental result 
that the cluster upstream merge into their counterpart down- 
stream, for example, cluster 1 and 3 in Fig. 1g–l and the cluster 
in Fig. 1m, can be explained. Figure 1m–p show simulation 
result use equation (2–3) by assume Giox ¼ 0 for the 2nd 
nanocluster (Methods). The simulation confirms the experimen- 
tal observation (Fig. 1m–p). Other behaviour can also be 
expect from equation (2), a will be elaborate later. As the 
electric field be continuously applied, the cluster splitting and 
merge process can be repeated, result in an effective 
displacement (movement) of the cluster along the electric field 
(Fig. 1s) towards the counter electrode. Since SiO2 be an 
amorphous insulator rather than a homogeneous electrolyte, the 
condition for ion migration and nucleation be inhomogeneous 
and depend strongly on the local microstructure, electric field 
distribution, electrochemical environment and presence of 
defects, a observe in Fig. 1g–p. 

We have extensively study the behaviour of different metal 
systems, include active metal such a Ag and Cu a well a 
inert metal such a Ni and Pt. The volume of the source material 
be also varied systematically. Among these materials, Ag and Cu 
be widely recognize a the material of choice for the formation 
of metal filament and most commonly use in resistive memory 
devices9,10,12,18. Compared with Ag, in situ TEM study on Cu 
have show essentially similar results. As displayed in Fig. 2a–f, 
after apply a voltage of 6 V, 3 Cu cluster be found to have 
nucleate and grown between the embed Cu source and the 
counter Au electrode (Fig. 2b, Supplementary Movie 3). As the 
size of the newly form cluster 1–3 grow larger, these cluster 
also become oxidize (Fig. 2c–f), since the polarization strength 
of the cluster (P) be proportional to the cluster radius (r), 
that is, P¼E � r(cosy� cosl) (where y and l be angle use to 
define the position on the cluster surface)25. The electro- 

chemical process of the cluster thus enter a second stage 
and Giox4G 

i 
red applies. While cluster 1 and 2 be gradually 

dissolved, cluster 3 underwent another splitting-merging 
process and grow into cluster 4 that be even closer to the 
counter electrode. The dynamic behaviour of cluster 3 and 4 
highlight the rapidly evolve kinetics of the BPEs, include 
GioxoGired during initial growth (Fig. 2b), and subsequent 
transition to Giox4G 

i 
red during the dissolution process 

(Fig. 2c–f). Significantly, these process lead to a step-by-step 
movement of the metal inclusion along the electric 
field direction, and reveal the microscopic nature of the 
formation and dissolution process of conduct filament in 
dielectrics. 

In general, Giox and G 
i 
red can be impact by many factor such 

a material properties, local electric field, the amount of available 
atoms/ions and charge compensation. As a result, complex 
electrochemical dynamic be expected, which could in turn lead 
to significantly different filament growth behaviour that explain 
the contradict report in the literature10,20,22,25. For example, 
in our experiments, the Pt cluster that be form after the first 
nucleation process (Fig. 2g) be never found to be dissolve 
again within the time frame of the in situ experiments, probably 
due to the low Giox for the newly form Pt clusters. In another 
case for Ni clusters, persistent reduction of Ni ion (supplied from 
the large Ni source) onto the cathode side of an exist Ni cluster 
lead to a backward growth towards the Ni source, a show in 
Fig. 2i–l (also see Supplementary Movie 4). Since the volume of 
the Ni source be hardly changed, the deposition of the Ni ion 
lead to a backward connection between the nanocluster BPE and 
the Ni source (Fig. 2n). It should be note that the backward 
growth in this case be still different from the conventional 
electrochemical metallization (ECM) model10,12,18, a the 
reduction process do not initiate from the counter electrode 
but instead from a BPE inside the dielectric. As a result, the 
filament will form an extension of the anode instead of the 
cathode a predict by the ECM model. 

We have investigate dozen of device base on different 
materials, and found it to be universally true that the apparent 
movement of metal nanoclusters be always along the direction 
of the electric field (Figs 1 and 2). Different electric fields, 
however, be require for the migration of different metal within 
the measurement time frame of several minutes, a show in 
Fig. 2h for Ag, Cu, Ni and Pt. The dissolution/nucleation of 
embed Ag cluster inside SiO2 be found to be the easiest, 
typically require an electric field of o1 MV cm� 1, while the 
electric field require for Cu movement be slightly high but 
roughly in the same level. In contrast, the more inert Ni and Pt 
cluster require much high electric field of 3–5 MV cm� 1. The 
different electric field require for the cluster migration reflect 
the electrochemical activity of the different metal and this 
observation explains why Ag and Cu be more suitable for metal 
filament-based memristive devices9,10,12,18. In general, the ease of 
displacement of nanoclusters show a tendency to increase a a 
function of the polarizability of the half-cell reaction, that is, the 
Agþ /Ag redox reaction be typically consider in liquid 
electrolyte a ideally non-polarizable, whereas the polarizability 
increase in the series Cu-Ni-Pt. Moreover, Ni- and Pt-ions 
have high charge number and sizes, and their diffusion in 
solid be suppress in contrary to Ag- and Cu-ions be well 
know a one of the most mobile ion in solids. 

Filament growth dynamics. The control migration of 
nanoclusters can be use to design and tune the operation of 
novel electric devices. For example, memristive device be base 
on the formation of conductive filament and the insight gain

from the migration of discrete metal nanoclusters naturally 
explains the filament growth dynamic in memristive devices. 
Specifically, the different filament growth mode observe 
experimentally20,22 can now be reconcile in the same theoretical 
framework. In a simplified, qualitative model, the filament growth 
dynamic may fall into four different regime depend on the 
kinetic factors. When the ion mobility (m) and the redox rate Gi 

be high and homogeneous (case a), the ion can reach the inert 
electrode without agglomerating, thus avoid nucleation within 
the insulate film so filament growth initiate from the inert 
electrode, and the large amount of ion supply (due to high Gi) 
lead to an invert cone-shaped filament12,18 with it base at the 
inert electrode interface, a schematically show in Fig. 3a. This be 
in agreement with the filament growth in conventional ECM 
devices, and corresponds to material system with high ionic 
conductivity (that is, large amount of ion and high ion 
mobility). An experimental proof for case a be the in situ TEM 
observation on device base on Cu–GeTe electrolyte22. In 
contrast, in the other extreme of low and inhomogeneous m and 
low Gi (case b, Fig. 3b), the ion can pile and reach the critical 
nucleation condition inside the dielectric and further filament 
growth be fulfil by cluster displacement via the repeat 
splitting-merging process show in Fig. 1. An experimental 
example be the filament growth in amorphous Si, where 
the filament be initiate from the active electrode and grows 
towards the inert electrode a discrete nanoclusters20. This case 

corresponds to material system with very low ionic conductivity. 
Instead, if the ion mobility be low while the redox rate be high 
(case c), nucleation can occur inside the dielectric while large 
amount of atom can be deposit onto the cathode side of the 
nuclei, lead to gap fill show in Fig. 3c. This case 
corresponds to observation in Fig. 2i–l. After a connection 
between the nucleus and the active electrode be made, the process be 
repeat thus again lead to an effective forward growth 
towards the inert electrode. Finally, if the ion mobility m be high 
while the redox rate Gi be low (case d), nucleation only occurs at 
the counter electrode but the limited ion supply mean reduction 
predominately occurs at the edge with high field strengths, thus 
lead to branch filament growth towards the active electrode, 
a show in Fig. 3d. This case corresponds to the experimental 
observation in sputter SiO2 films20, whose open structure and 
high defect density result in high m than evaporate SiO2. The 
different experimental observation can thus be fully account 
for in this generalize framework base on fundamental 
electrochemical processes. In general, the ion mobility in a 
give dielectric m determines the nucleation site and the 
direction of the filament growth, while the redox rate 
Gidetermine the ion supply and the geometry of the filament. 
By tune these kinetic factors, different growth mode and 
filament geometry can be potentially control in a systematic 
fashion. In practice, the local m and Gican be affected by 
variation in the local defect density, defect energy profile and

local electrochemical potential so different migration mode may 
be observe simultaneously in the same system. 

To experimentally verify the theory, we perform in situ TEM 
study in actual resistive memory structures. The device consist 
of a Ag/SiO2/W structure with an evaporate SiO2 film cover a 
W probe. Compared with sputter SiO2, the evaporate SiO2 
here have less defect and low m, therefore this system in general 
fall into the low m, low Gi regime. The device be directly form 
inside the TEM column by connect a high-purity Ag wire with 
a movable W probe coat with the SiO2 film (Fig. 4a, Methods). 
Representative result for a device with a B40-nm-thick SiO2 
film be show in Fig. 4b–e (also see Supplementary Movie 5). 
The first visible filament growth in the SiO2 film be the 
appearance of several Ag cluster near the Ag electrode after 
B3 min (Fig. 4b). This be in agreement with the nucleation of 
metal nanoclusters in Figs 1 and 2. These cluster then behave a 
BPEs during subsequent growth. As expected, over time these 
cluster move closer to the inert electrode, follow the 
splitting-merging process discuss early (Fig. 1m–p) and 
correspond to case b. Due to the high concentration of Agþ 

ion near the Ag electrode and therefore the high probability to 
overcome the nucleation barrier, more Ag cluster will be 
nucleate near the Ag electrode inside SiO2 and the repeat 

nucleation and growth lead to the filament shape a observe 
Fig. 4d. As predict for case b, this growth mode lead to a 
conically shape filament (Fig. 4d,e) with it base at the Ag/SiO2 
interface and expand towards the inert electrode. Such growth 
direction be in contrast to the conventional ECM growth model 
for solid electrolytes10,18 but can be explain by the generalize 
framework discuss above. The overall growth of the filament 
can be then characterize by the step-by-step movement of 
Ag cluster component driven by the electrochemical kinetics, 
a illustrate by Fig. 4f–j (more detail can be found in 
Supplementary Note 1). 

Additionally, a feature reminiscent of a void be observe in 
the SiO2 film at the interface region in Fig. 4d,e, after large 
amount of Ag atom have pass through. The void formation be 
a clear sign of plastic deformation of the dielectric film due to 
increase mechanical stress that be introduce into the SiO2. 
Similar void have also be observe for the case of discrete 
nanoclusters (for example, Fig. 1j–l,p). Apart from facilitate fast 
ion diffusion, the void (channels) provide space for continuous 
movement of Ag cluster in a bootstrapping fashion a show in 
Fig. 4d,e. As the exist Ag cluster move away towards the inert 
electrode new Ag cluster can move in and fill the void with 
reduce strain energy component (equation 1), facilitate the

filament growth towards the inert electrode. The observation of 
the void channel formation and the dynamic step-by-step 
filament growth process will be fundamentally important for 
the understand and optimization of memristive device 
operations. 

Analysing the filament growth dynamic also reveals effect 
that can have significant practical implication for device 
operations. For example, Fig. 5a show current–time (I–t) 
dependence of a Ag/SiO2/W device with a limited Ag source by 
reduce the contact area between the Ag electrode and the SiO2 
film. The correspond dynamic filament growth TEM image 
be show in Fig. 5b–f (also see Supplementary Movie 6). The 
device be initially in a high-resistance state and no filament 
growth be observed. At B100 s, an abrupt resistive change be 
observe correspond to the formation of conduction chan- 
nel(s) inside the electrolyte (the dark region within the SiO2) a 
show in Fig. 5c,d. The filament formation, however, require the 
consumption of the Ag electrode which serf a the Agþ ion 
supply. Notably, in Fig. 5a it be found that the current drop 
spontaneously after the initial filament formation. Close exam- 
ination of the TEM recording reveals that the current drop be 
due to the depletion of the Ag source (the Ag electrode) at the Ag/ 
SiO2 interface (Fig. 5e,f) lead to the breakage of the contact. 
This find particularly be of critical significance for memristive 
device operation a the device be scale towards the 10 nm 
range. The depletion of electrode be less of a concern for large- 
scale device with a virtually infinite Ag reservoir compare with 
the volume need to form the filament (see Supplementary 
Fig. 1, Supplementary Movie 7, Supplementary Note 2). However, 
the consumption of the electrode material be no longer negligible 
when the device size be push close to the scale limit, for 
example, where the electrode size be comparable with the filament 
size. For example, Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary 
Movie 8 show that when the device size shrink to 30–40 nm, the 
immediate contact to the filament at the Ag electrode/SiO2 
interface can be lose after the initial filament growth, even though 
overall electrical contact appear to be intact. 

The broken electrical contact can be cure by refill the 
gap at the Ag electrode/SiO2 interface when positive voltage 
be continuously apply on the Ag electrode (Fig. 5h,i, 

Supplementary Movie 9). The surface diffusion of atom from 
the bulk of the Ag electrode into the gap be believe to drive this 
process, mediate by inhomogeneous electric field distribution 
around the gap31. Figure 5j show the electric field distribution 
through a multiphysics simulation (Methods). A highly 
nonuniform electric field distribution be reveal and noticeably 
high electric field intensity be see in the vicinity of the nanogap, 
consistent with the observation that Ag atom migrate towards 
the nano-gap region and refill the gap over time (see 
Supplementary Fig. 3, Supplementary Note 3). 

Finally, we show that different growth mode can coexist in the 
same device when the growth dynamic can be properly tuned, a 
show in Fig. 6. After an initial growth period characterize by 
the step-by-step bootstrapping growth mode (Fig. 6b–h, also see 
Supplementary Movie 10), the Ag cluster suddenly transform 
into a much larger, dominant filament in Fig. 6i, accompany by 
a significantly increase in current of 41mA (Fig. 6a). Here the 
newly form filament have a much wider base on the W cathode 
side and grows backwards towards the Ag electrode, and be much 
more solid, imply a transition to the conventional ECM 
growth mode show in Fig. 3a. The structure of the new, solid 
filament be analyse use high-resolution transmission electron 
microscopy, where (111) plane of elemental Ag be clearly 
resolve (Fig. 6j) suggest the filament corresponds to a 
crystalline Ag wire. The transition to the ECM mode (with high m 
and Gi) can be explain by the increase of the device 
temperature due to the formation of the original filament, lead 
to significantly increase m and Gi (refs 18,32). The increase in 
Agþ ion mobility mean that the ion have a much high 
probability to reach the W cathode instead of pile inside the 
oxide through nucleation, a the increase temperature retard 
stable nucleus formation33. The combination of these effect 
suppresses the step-by-step cluster growth but enhances the rate 
of direct Agþ reduction at the W cathode, lead to the 
conventional ECM growth. 

Discussion 
To summarize, we report fundamental electrochemical dynamic 
of metal inclusion inside conventional solid-state dielectrics.

The cluster interaction and formation process be strongly 
affected by kinetic factor lead to different shape and growth 
mode of the cluster that can be observe experimentally. Four 
type of metal system and two type of device structure be 
studied, and base on these extensive experimental observations, 
we suggest a generalize framework govern the electrochemi- 
cal dynamic of the metal clusters. The nanoclusters be found 
to act a BPEs under electric field, with their dissolution and 
nucleation process mediate by the compete electrochemical 
reaction on both sides. By control the kinetic factor 
include ion mobility and redox rates, different growth mode 
can be achieve and verify experimentally. This framework well 
explains the apparently contradict experimental observation 
of filament growth in memristive devices, and provide critical 
insight into the principle of device operations. Our qualitative 
model may help to develop a more quantitative and microscopic 
model for electric field-induced nanoionics base on two main 
kinetic factors, ion mobility and redox rate. These finding can be 
readily expand to material and device system where control- 
ling the metal inclusion dynamic (or avoid such) be critical 
and will have significant theoretical and practical impacts. 

Methods 
in situ TEM. The in situ TEM experiment be carry out use a Nanofactory 
scan tunnel microscopy platform inside a JEOL 3011 TEM operating at 
300 kV. For sample with embed metal clusters, the bottom electrode be 
grounded, while the top electrode be individually address by the movable W 
probe, control by a piezomotor in the Nanofactory system. For the Ag/SiO2/W 
devices, the specimen be prepared by deposit a conformal SiO2 film on a W 
probe (Bruker), and the probe be then mount on the moveable end of a single- 
tilt TEM holder. A high-purity Ag wire (99.99%, Goodfellow) be fix on the 
other end of the TEM holder, serve a the active electrode. The Ag/SiO2/W 
device structure be form inside the TEM column when contact be achieve 
between the probe and the Ag wire. During in situ experiment on both type of 
devices, electrical signal be apply to the device and measure through 
a low-noise Keithley 4200 semiconductor characterization system. The movie be 
record simultaneously with the electrical measurements. 

Preparation of FIB samples. The TEM specimen with embed Ag, Cu, Ni and 
Pt metal nanoclusters be prepared by FIB. First, Au film (400 nm) with a NiCr 
adhesion layer (20 nm) be deposit on SiO2/Si substrate by electron beam 
evaporation, serve a the bottom electrodes. Afterwards, a SiO2 layer with a 
thickness of B20 nm be evaporated, follow by the evaporation of thin Ag, Cu, 
Ni or Pt metal layers. A second SiO2 layer with a similar thickness of B20 nm be 
then evaporated. The sample be then subject to rapid thermal anneal 

process in Ar. The metal layer form nanoclusters embed in the SiO2 film 
during anneal when the metal film be thin enough (B1 nm). Afterwards, a 100- 
nm thick Au film be evaporate to form the top electrode. The TEM specimen 
be then prepared out of these sample by successive FIB lift-out, pattern and 
thin processes. The device be design in such a configuration that all the 
device in the same sample have individual top electrode while share the bottom 
electrode. The lift-out, pattern and thin process be conduct on a 
dual-beam FIB system (FEI Helios Nanolab 650 FIB workstation). During FIB 
patterning, low-energy Gaþ milling with extreme care be use to obtain high- 
quality and thin TEM specimen in order to reduce the projection effect cause by 
cluster distribution in the Z direction. 

Preparation of sample on W probes. Silicon dioxide film be deposit on W 
tip in high vacuum at a low evaporation rate of 0.01 nm s� 1 by electron beam 
evaporation. The SiO2 film thickness be adjust in the range of 10–50 nm. The 
sample be checked by TEM, and the SiO2 film be found to be fully 
conformal. 

Simulations. Electric field simulation be perform use a COMSOL multi- 
physic package base on finite element analysis. Simulations on cluster movement 
dynamic via splitting and merge process be perform use a custom 
Matlab code base on equation (2–3) by assume Giox ¼ 0 for the nanocluster 
downstream. The two interact nanoclusters be model by perfect sphere 
with a constant total volume, and the maximum distance between the two spherical 
surface (from the leftmost position on the left sphere to the rightmost position on 
the right sphere) be assume fix when their diameter vary during the elec- 
trochemical oxidation and reduction processes.
