AI computer may soon be able to 

create new 3-D shape just by look 

at two 2-D images, such a photos, 

say Purdue University professor 

Karthik Ramani, and also come up with 

shape for new image such a by

WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. — A new 

technique that us the artificial 

intelligence method of machine learn 

and deep learn be able to create 3-D 

shape from 2-D images, such a 

photographs, and be even able to create 

new, never-before-seen shapes. 

Karthik Ramani 

(https://engineering.purdue.edu 

/ME/People/ptProfile?id=12331), 

Purdue's Donald W. Feddersen Professor 

of Mechanical Engineering, say that the 

"magical" capability of AI deep learn be 

that it be able to learn abstractly. 

"If you show it hundred of thousand of shape of something such a a car, if you 

then show it a 2-D image of a car, it can reconstruct that model in 3-D," he says. "It

New technique for an old challenge!!! 



Computers use a new artificial 

intelligence technique developed at 

Purdue University can create 3-D 

shape from 2-D images, such a these 

photograph of airplanes. The 

technique could help technology such 

can even take two 2-D image and create a 3-D shape between the two, which we 

call 'hallucination.'" 

When fully developed, this method, call SurfNet, could have significant 

application in the field of 3-D search on the Internet, a well a help robotics 

and autonomous vehicle good understand their surroundings. 

Perhaps most exciting, however, be that the technique could be use to create 3-D 

content for virtual reality and augment reality by simply use standard 2-D 

photos. 

"You can imagine a movie camera that be take picture in 2-D, but in the virtual 

reality world everything be appear magically in 3-D," Ramani says. "Inch-by-inch 

we be go there, and in the next five year something like this be go to 

happen. 

"Pretty soon we will be at a stage where human will not be able to differentiate 

between reality and virtual reality."

inch we be go there, and in the next 

five year something like this be go to happen. 

"Pretty soon we will be at a stage where human will not be able to differentiate 

between reality and virtual reality." 

The computer system then learns both the 3-D image and the 2-D image in pairs, 

and then be able to predict other, similar 3-D shape from just a 2-D image. 

"This be very similar to how a camera or scanner us just three colors, red, green 

and blue—known a RGB—to create a color image, except we use the XYZ 

coordinates," he says. 

Ramani say this technique also allows for great accuracy and precision than 

current 3-D deep learn method that operate more use volumetric pixel (or 

voxels). 

"We use the surface instead since it fully 

defines the shape. It's kind of an 

interest offshoot of this method. 

Because we be work in the 2-D 

domain to reconstruct the 3-D structure, 

instead of do 1,000 data point like you 

would otherwise with other emerge 

methods, we can do 10,000 points. We 

be more efficient and compact."

One significant outcome of the research would be for robotics, object recognition 

and even self-driving car in the future; they would only need to be fit with 

standard 2-D cameras, yet still have the ability to understand the 3-D environment 

around them. 

Ramani say that for this research to be developed, more basic research in AI will 

be needed. 

"There's not a box of machine learn algorithm where we can take those and 

apply them and thing work magically," he says. "To move from the flatland to the 

3-D world we will need much more basic research. We be pushing, but the 

mathematics and computational technique of deep learn be still be invent 

and largely an unknown area in 3-D."

SurfNet: Generating 3D shape surface use deep residual network

3D shape model be naturally parameterized use vertex and faces, i.e., 

compose of polygon form a surface. However, current 3D learn paradigm 

for predictive and generative task use convolutional neural network focus on a 

voxelized representation of the object. Lifting convolution operator from the 

traditional 2D to 3D result in high computational overhead with little additional 

benefit a most of the geometry information be contain on the surface boundary. 

Here we study the problem of directly generate the 3D shape surface of rigid and 

non-rigid shape use deep convolutional neural networks. We develop a 

procedure to create consistent ‘geometry images’ represent the shape surface of 

a category of 3D objects. We then use this consistent representation for category- 

specific shape surface generation from a parametric representation or an image by 

develop novel extension of deep residual network for the task of geometry 

image generation. Our experiment indicate that our network learns a meaningful 

representation of shape surface allow it to interpolate between shape 

orientation and poses, invent new shape surface and reconstruct 3D shape 

surface from previously unseen images.
