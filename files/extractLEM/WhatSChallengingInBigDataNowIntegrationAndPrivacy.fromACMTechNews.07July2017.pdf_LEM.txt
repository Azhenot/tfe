Michael Stonebraker be a Turing 

Award winner

What’s Challenging in Big Data Now: Integration and Privacy 
Alex Woodie 

It’s be say many time before, but it’s worth state 

again: big data present large opportunity for 

improve business and society, but it also involves 

sizable compute challenges, a well a moral 

challenges. A panel of renowned professor in the 

field expound on the obstacle block big data’s 

path forward during a recent meeting of the 

Association of Computing Machinery (ACM). Privacy 

and integration issue lead the way. 

In celebration of the 50th anniversary of the A.M. 

Turing Award, which be sometimes call the “Nobel Prize of computing,” the ACM convene a 

gathering of some of the brightest mind in computing, include Michael Stonebraker, an adjunct 

professor at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) and the 2014 

winner of the Turing Award. 

When ask what challenge big data represent in a super-connected world with 25 billion data- 

generate devices, Stonebraker comment that two of the three “Vs” have basically be 

solved. 

“If you have a volume problem and you’re interested solely in run SQL-style business 

intelligence on a lot of data, in the data warehouse market, there be at least a few dozen 

production petascale warehouse that do exactly this day in and day out,” say Stonebraker, who 

create the Vertica MPP database now sell by HPE. “[T]he volume problem be basically solve 

and shouldn’t get much harder in the future.” 

Similarly, the data velocity problem be under control. “If you 

want to process a million message a second, current stream 

processing engine can do this quite easily,” he said. “I’m not 

aware of anybody that want to go faster than that….I don’t 

consider the velocity issue to be all that difficult.” 

But the third “V,” the one that pertains to variety, be a potential 

deal-breaker, accord to Stonebraker, who label it the 

800-lb. gorilla in the corner of the room. 

“As near a I can tell, [data variety] be what be cause 

problem for nearly every major enterprise on the planet,” he 

said. “I think what be go to kill everybody isn’t necessarily 

the number of connect devices, but the variety of 

independently-constructed data source that enterprise be 

go to want to put together. Whether you’re talk about 

healthcare, manufacturing, or financial services, all of these 

independently structure database be go to be a killer.” 

David Blei, a professor at Columbia University and a winner 

of the ACM-Infosys 2013 Foundation Award, say there be 

great opportunity to benefit from big data, but also some 

unmet challenges. 

“If you take the example of gene and diseases, it’s an important computer science and statistic 

problem that’s unsolved,” Blei said. “Data scientist be look to answer how we take data that 

we observe from the world and use it to identify causal connection between two variables.” 

Dealing with the uncertainty and bias that can arise from base conclusion around 

correlation be something that all big data practitioner must tackle. It’s also something that 

Daphne Koller, an adjunct professor of computer science at Stanford University and an ACM- 

Infosys 2007 Foundation Award, brought up during the panel. 

“Bias will always be a challenge, and there isn’t a single, magic 

solution,” Koller said. “The big question is, How do we 

disentangle correlation from causation?…I’ll turn to healthcare for 

an example: the gold standard in the medical state be that of 

randomize case control. In the case of web data, it’s call A/B 

testing—basically tech industry jargon for the same type of 

control.” 

Although A/B test be not perfect a a randomize case control, 

it’s “about a good a tool a we’ve be able to develop for 

address some of the confounders,” she continued. 

“Unfortunately, this type of control be not feasible in all cases.” 

Where A/B test be not feasible, practitioner must take pain to 

ensure that “processes [are] carefully scrutinize to check for 

different confounders and to look for any and all correlation that 

give rise to the phenomenon be viewed,” she continued. “It’s a 

process that require a lot of thought and a lot of care and cannot 

be overstate in it importance.” 

While there be many challenge with the data science and technical aspect of big data, there 

be also moral questions, a well a question of privacy. Vipin Kumar, the regent professor and 

William Norris chair in Large Scale Computing at University of Minnesota, say these challenge 

come to a head in healthcare. 

“Healthcare data about the population at large can be analyze to create individualize

concern about possible misuse of these kind of 

information, such a discrimination in hire or in 

purchasing health insurance, if this information be not 

handle properly. The healthcare community be on the 

front line in this area, but, give the complexity of 

issue involved, progress in address these concern 

be very slow.” 

Big data have the potential to help society in massive 

ways, but it will require solve thorny privacy question 

that go right to the heart of the matter, Stonebraker says. 

“Privacy be a really good big data question,” he says. 

“Imagine this simple example: you show up at your 

doctor’s office and have an x-ray do and you want the 

doctor to run a query that show who else have x-ray 

that look like yours, what be their diagnosis and what 

be the morbidity of the patients. That require 

integrate essentially the country’s entire online medical database and presumably would 

extend to multiple country a well. 

“While that be a daunt data integration challenge, because 

every hospital chain store it data with different formats, 

different encoding for common terms, etc., the social value 

gain from solve it be just huge,” Stonebraker continues. 

“But that also creates an incredibly difficult privacy problem, 

one that I believe be not a technical issue. Because by and 

large, if you’re look for an interest medical query, you’re 

not look for common events; you’re look for rare events, 

and at least to my knowledge, there aren’t any technical 

solution that will allow access to rare event without indirectly 

disclose who in fact the event belong to.” 

We must find the right balance between make data public 

and respect people’s privacy. It’s a question of “how public 

be too public,” say Professor Blei. 

“To me, we get the most bang for our buck if we make 

everything public; however, that’s go to have some serious 

security and morality issue with it, so we shouldn’t do that,” 

the ACM Fellow said. “But make everything completely 

private and not benefiting from that data also doesn’t seem 

like a great option. I think this be a difficult, thorny issue. It life 

at the intersection of policy, philosophy, morality, computer 

science, data science, and machine learning.” 

There be no simple answer to question like these. But consider the societal good that will 

come from solve them, it’s a challenge that must be undertaken.
