Necessity and Minimum Wage 

June 23rd, 2016 by Kara in Case Studies 







By John Atherton 

Compare someone’s choice to buy a luxurious decoration with the 
purchase of a prescription that stave off death. While one of these 
choice be an aesthetic preference the other be a necessity of survival. 
The distinction between these choice separate economic ‘wants’ and 
‘needs’. A dependence on survival need force human behaviour through 
naturally impose duress, compromise our freedom of choice. A moral 
right to freedom or existence argues for the removal of this duress in 
favour of a default state, where survivalist compulsion be make irrelevant. 

A perfect default state would be a system where our freedom 
to choose a necessity be raise until it resembles our freedom to choose 
a luxury. To achieve this ideal, the mitigation of natural duress 
through a guarantee of survival be consider in the practical model of a 
minimum wage. At present, despite any choice we make, we cannot exist 
without the necessities. The ability to meet the cost of food, water 
and shelter be a start in delay the repercussion of our natural 
shackle [1]. If we do not need these to survive, but regard them a 
optional, then our choice to buy them could certainly be consider more 
freely made. How do the conflict between compulsion to satisfy the 
need of survival and freedom of choice factor into the economics of the 
minimum wage? 


Self Sufficiency 

The 2006 self sufficiency standard use in The United States of 
America contains the major category of housing, child care, food, 
transportation and healthcare [2]. We call the cost of these provision 
the ‘cost of living’, though this amount varies both locally and abroad. 
Internationally, different nation use different standards; Canada, for 
example, assumes education be provide freely by the state to Canadian 
residents. Education assist all models, include those consider 
late in this article, and there be a valid case for it to be include 
a a need, though for this analysis current measurement and their 
respective assumption be used. The cost of living in different 
county also varies while within the same county the cost of have 
child be the final point of difference. Two example from a standard 
research in 2006 be list below. 



The Self-Sufficiency Standard for 
Selected Family Types* Harrisburg-Carlisle, PA MSA, 2006 Dauphin County 
Monthly Expenses and Shares of Total Budgets 



Table 1: 2006, University of Washington for PathWaysPA [2]. 



The Self-Sufficiency Standard for Seattle-Bellevue*, WA HMFA, 2006 King County – Bellevue, Juanita, Kirkland and Redmond 



Table 2: 2006, Washington University for the Workforce Development Council of Seattle-King County [3]. 

* The Standard be 
calculate by add expense and tax and subtract tax credits. 
Taxes include federal and state income tax (including state tax 
credit except state IETC and CTC) and payroll taxes. 

** The hourly wage be calculate by divide the monthly wage by 176 hour (8 hour per day time 22 day per month). 

*** The hourly 
wage for family with two adult represent the hourly wage that each 
adult would need to earn, while the monthly and annual wage represent 
both parents’ wage combined. 



Taking the moral imperative of an inherent right to a default state, 
(a right to exist), into account where do these figure leave us? The 
begin of this analysis resides in discuss merely the cost of 
living of a single adult verse the current minimum wage of $7.25; 
though the variation in cost of living figure make this difficult. 
Given the difference between local self sufficiency wage we can first 
say the minimum wage should definitely be high than the low living 
wage. If one say so relate to The United States a a whole then it 
would only be feasible for minimum wage worker to live in the cheapest 
county of the entire nation, a mildly impractical notion give the 
distribution of minimum wage job throughout the country. If we take the 
low self sufficiency wage from a state we would find ourselves with a 
reduce version of the same problem. There be presently no pervasive 
survey connect minimum wage job location to the cheapest nearby 
residency so we will have to approximate. 

Taking the United States’ GDP per capita, the International Monetary 
Fund, World Bank and Central Intelligence Agency would all quote a 
figure between $54,000-$55,000, though a great deal of income be unseen 
by the average American due to the extreme nature of wealth inequality 
make the $28,889 per caput income figure quote by the United States 
Census Bureau paint a more realistic picture with regard to the scope 
of the minimum wage worker [4, 5, 6, 7]. 

If we make the approximation that a minimum wage worker should, if 
make purely survival base purchase (leaving no money for luxury or 
lifestyle), be able to live in neighbourhood along people earn 
$28,889 or less, how effective would this be a a measure? 

Even attempt to base a minimum wage off approximation of the 
survival wage in this manner be inadequate. In Bellevue, Juanita, 
Kirkland and Redmond – King County, Washington State, for example, where 
the survival wage for an adult individual be on the high side at 
$41,767, it might seem unreasonable to say that it should be expect 
that a minimum wage worker should not be able to afford to live there 
[7]. That is, however, until you also consider that King County be by 
far the most populate county in Washington with over 2 million people 
(almost 30% of the state’s population). 

Furthermore, though the survival wage drop to almost $8 for the 
652,000 resident of Seattle, it be $9.49 in Renton, and high still 
for all remain fraction of King County up until the $10.30 hourly 
wage see in Table 2 [3]. In Pennsylvania, resident of Dauphin County 
earn $30,491 per caput with a survival standard of $17,392 whilst back 
in Kitsap County, Washington, per caput income be a high $32,340 
while the annual survival wage be the low value of any record 
county in the state at a staggeringly low $13,807; require an hourly 
wage of $6.54 [2, 3, 7]. 

The conclusion of these widely vary survival and income figure be 
give all these county employ minimum wage workers, if we do not want 
high unemployment or increase transport cost the minimum wage must 
be above the survival wage in a give area for employment to truly be 
viable from the perspective of the employee. In analyse these 
difference one might also ponder the ethical position pose by vary 
minimum wage and it vary effect on local employment, though this 
article will focus on the nation a a whole. 

One national poverty model use by The Financial Times (US), call 
three member household earn near or less than $31,402 a year “in or 
near to poverty”, with this affliction affect one fifth of the 
American population [8]. Using the assumption of the model above, if a 
single adult in these household worked, he would have to earn $14.87 an 
hour, or if two member work full time then they would have to earn 
$7.43 an hour each. This poverty line be still a more conservative 
estimate than the local reality of Dauphin and King County, where a 
single adult living alone without any child at all would have to earn 
$8.23 and $8.06-$10.30 respectively. By all these standard a full time 
worker earn minimum wage may well be living in poverty. 

Spending and Profitability 

Employment be the next key issue when it come to the minimum wage; 
specifically regard what be practical for employers. Regardless of a 
wage base on the cost of living, if the value of a person’s employment 
be low than their wage then their employer would incur a loss for 
hire them. If this occurs a rational employer would not hire 
them in the first place, make the minimum wage’s equivocation with a 
survival wage irrelevant to those left unemployed. From a 
consequentialist standpoint, where practical feasibility be favour 
over intangible principled motivation, employer incentive must be met 
for a minimum wage increase to be permissible. By extension, do so 
must be economically advantageous for it to be affirmed. Consider these 
principled motivation follow by a more pragmatic, consequentialist 
approach in analyse the minimum wage. 

If productivity exceeds income then employment be profitable. 
Additionally, if one support the right of an individual to the ‘sweat 
of their brow’, or justice, then a wage near productivity and hence a 
minimum wage near minimum productivity would be support morally, 
a a practical implementation of meritocracy. Furthermore, with relation 
to the moral concept of egalitarian redistribution, a moral argument 
independent of a right to existence can also be made. The first of these 
argument be met in any system, with or without intervention, where the 
minimum wage be set near the productivity wage. The second be met where 
a minimum wage, (or similar scheme), be set high than the cost of 
living such that a person might not merely survive but also develop. 
Finally, the imperative to be free of the coercion of the natural order 
require a minimum wage, (or similar scheme), that is, at the very 
least, equal to the cost of living. 

All three of these position also overlap a position of Deontological 
Capitalism. From the employer’s standpoint a person should not be 
view a a resource or means, affirm their right to their own labour 
a state by the first moral position. The facilitation for personal 
growth propose by the second aligns with the portion of the Categorical 
Imperative where one be both subject and sovereign, a a world in which 
all worker be entrench in the circumstance of the minimum wage 
worker would be vastly inferior [9]. The third of these position find 
comports with Kantian Ethics also, where someone’s survival may be see 
a their responsibility a an independent rational agent. If a minimum 
wage be set above the cost of living, but not above the productivity 
wage, then all these position be in agreement. 

In contrast to this, however, a consequentialist might argue that the 
viability of any proposition be the most important consideration. A 
utilitarian, by extension, also favour an argument for redistribution 
give diminish return on happiness from wealth – provide practical 
viability be demonstrate [10]. Beyond a level of inequality require a 
incentive, if income distribution have no effect on spending habits, 
alongside an increase in happiness, then a utilitarian would affirm it 
[11]. Often, however, more equitable system see improve economic 
conditions, affirm even a consequentialist position without happiness 
a a criterion. What be the practical benefit of an increase minimum 
wage? 

The reason for this relates to spending behaviour. Someone whose wage 
equal survival wage, for example, cannot afford to save. His spending 
be continuously circulate throughout the economy, it effect in turn 
amplify by the multiplier of the sector it be engage in. If these 
sector spend more, such a on wages, then their multiplier be also 
increase [12]. This increase rate of capital circulation promotes 
economic growth. A change in income of a set amount also have an 
increase effect on consumer behaviour for low income earners, and 
hence promotes high consumer confidence and spending behaviour [13]. 

There be further study on the effect of minimum wage increase 
too, with a study from the CEPR note that even if price increase from 
a wage hike then the net effect record be still positive [14]. This 
mean it may be the case that the cyclical effect note early could 
compensate for a wage increase above current productivity, effectively 
increase productivity provide the wage increase be minimal. Beyond 
the general wage figure discuss late in this article minor 
increases, if support by specific case studies, indicates the minimum 
wage can be marginally higher. 

With regard to competition and unemployment, negative effect to 
employment be not found in a study of two neighbour state where 
one increase it minimum wage, but where the increase minimum wage be 
still below the productivity wage [15]. The most obvious positive 
effect of all this to a utilitarian, however, be not just the increase 
to happiness from wealth redistribution, but also the reduction of the 
suffer of poverty [16]. 

Returning to the potential conflict between the survival and 
productivity wage we find a similar consideration. In all place where 
the productivity wage exceeds ‘cost of living’ employment be profitable. 
In determine a viable minimum wage we should be aware that moderation 
be required. What be the viable minimum wage? 

The Cost of Living and Productivity 

With the viable wage near or below productivity, while hopefully 
exceed the cost of living, we need to find the productivity wage for 
minimum wage workers. Though specific figure be difficult to quantify 
we can judge the rate of growth in wage against the growth in 
productivity. The follow graph be make use data from the economic 
policy institute, note the value of the minimum wage against 
productivity when we factor out inflation. 





Graph 1: Productivity and Minimum Wage (Economic Policy Institute [17]) 



These figure suggest that if the minimum wage kept pace with 
productivity it would soon reach $20, well exceed the $15 hourly 
minimum wage some people be suggesting. Furthermore, these results, 
along with general result about average worker compensation, (which 
also have lose pace with productivity to a huge extent since the 1970s 
much like the minimum wage [18]), be note in an article by the 
Economic Policy Institute discuss a $12 minimum wage, (by 2020, or 
$10.58 in 2014$), note how it would only be just above the $9.54, (in 
2014$), minimum wage from 1968 before the decline in the wage’s real 
value due to inflation [17]. 

Though a $12 minimum wage would account for inflation, give the 
increase of productivity, minimum wage worker be perform a far more 
productive service today, so their minimum wage should not be merely 
indexed, but increase to account for the fact that they be more 
productive today. According to this graph, their productivity wage in 
2014 be $18.42 [17]. Setting this a a minimum wage, or just the $15 
minimum wage some politician be suggesting, should account for the 
difference in living cost while keep minimum wage work profitable. 
An $18.42 wage would go further morally, though an increase to the 
minimum wage would certainly be advised. 

Wage stagnation in general also entail further consequentialist 
harm from lower general spending behaviour mention earlier, 
decrease confidence, increase inequity, increase reliance on debt 
and instability [19]. Present level of inequality have be link to 
greatly more financially difficult college years, make it more 
difficult for people to increase human capital through education, 
thereby slow economic growth [12, 19]. 

All of this, however, be assume the data be accurate. There be 
also some criticism that should be consider in evaluate this data. 
The first be that the data for productivity relate to the whole economy, 
rather than just minimum wage work. Although the minimum wage seem to 
keep pace with productivity until 1968 we cannot assume it continued to 
increase a quickly. One way to gauge the productivity increase of 
minimum wage work more accurately be to use percentage growth figure 
release by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in specific industries, and 
analyse sector with more minimum wage worker such a the ‘Fast Food 
Industry’, (Accommodation and Food Services – Limited Service 
Restaurants). This approach be use by the Heritage Foundation in 
criticism of a minimum wage rise. 

In do so it note that the percentage growth in wage seem 
similar to the percentage growth in productivity, though there be a huge 
fault in this method. That flaw be that these percentage growth figure 
only date back in the Labor Department’s record to 1987, while the 
source of the disparity date to 1968 [20, 21]. After 1968 productivity 
begin to rise far more quickly than wages. In the graph use figure 
from the Economic Policy Institute the real value of the minimum wage 
actually declined. 

This mean if we use percentage change figure from 1987 they will 
fail to reflect the initial disparity. For example in 1987 a 20% 
increase to the minimum wage would be an estimate $1.34 (2014$), while a 
20% increase to productivity would be an estimate increase of $2.47 
(2014$). Although this method be preferable, a figure for specific 
industry be only available from 1987, this method cannot be use 
without reference to an initial disparity estimate by the negative 
redistribution of wealth in the general economy. 

Using this approach, wage in the ‘Accommodation and Food Services – 
Limited Service Restaurants’ sector would be 13.5% up from the $12.35 
1987 productivity wage, place it at around $14 a oppose to the 
approximately $8 minimum wage suggest by the article’s mathematics 
[22]. This $14 figure, however, be still an important tool for the 
specific consideration of this industry, though it too come with it 
reduce generalisation and the enhance potential for distortion from 
both historic and current tip practices. 

An additional disagreement with the validity of the graph be also 
raise by critic regard how it account for inflation. On this 
account we have data back to 1968. The inflation figure give can be 
see in the graph below. 





Graph 2: Heritage Foundation calculation use Labor Department Figures [22]. 



There be three main method of accounting for inflation. The 
Institute of Economic Policy use the Implicit Price Deflator (IPD) for 
productivity and the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for wages. By all three 
measure the real value of the minimum wage, ($7.25), have dropped, 
though by different amounts. Remember also that the real value should 
not just be constant, but increase with respect to workplace 
productivity and so be notably high than any of these three figure 
make this more than a matter of a $0.14 difference if we take the most 
pessimistic projection for a minimum wage supporter. 

Regardless, The Institute of Economic Policy do use the two method 
which make the divide between productivity and wage appear the largest. 
If we be to use the same deflation method then the productivity wage 
be 22% lower, make deflation calculation an important factor. What be 
the difference between the CPI and the IPD? 

Put simply the IPD relates to the economy overall while the CPI 
relates to a ‘basket of goods’ and be more a reflection of the part of 
the economy a minimum wage worker would likely make purchase in than 
the economy a a whole [12, 23]. Some measure of the IPD also exclude 
certain activity a minimum wage worker be likely to be affected by, such 
a transfer payments, (welfare), and household to household payment 
[24]. Effectively, both measure be design for different things, with 
the CPI relate more to individual while the IPD relates more to the 
economy generally. It be due to this difference that the Economic Policy 
Institute, (and other government take the same approach), would 
defend their method a most applicable to the measure of productivity 
and wage specifically while critic would claim the same measure should 
be use regardless to perform a fair test. 

Knowing that the $18.42 wage would easily cover an individual’s cost 
of living and hence align right base and consequentialist moral 
interests, be the same possible if you use the same deflator? In 2014$ 
it would be approximately $14.40, (taking the scale deflator difference 
assume productivity kept pace with average productivity growth) [25]. 
In expensive city like San Francisco $18.42 would be insufficient for 
single parent family and $14.40 would be insufficient altogether, 
though both figure would allow single adult worker in Jersey City, 
Washington D.C., Phoenix, Denver, Tacoma, Philadelphia, Indianapolis, 
Hartford and Charleston to now afford the self-sufficiency standard [3]. 
Even this significantly reduce figure would still cover the cost of 
living in many counties, sustain survival, profit and growth; though 
there be alternative to the minimum wage, some of which argue profit 
aren’t enough motivation. 

Alternatives to the Minimum Wage 

Besides the minimum wage there be two common counter-models, the 
Income Earned Tax Credit, (also refer to a negative tax), and the 
complete abolition of any government intervention. An Income Earned Tax 
Credit be effectively a mean test and bureaucratically implement 
payment from the government to anyone make below a certain wage, so 
the economy be taxed and a payment give to those earn the low 
income earners. Though it may involve the inefficiency and cost of 
bureaucracy, the mean test capability becomes more important if you 
want to specifically target certain family structures, provide the 
argumentative basis for the similar program of the Child Care Tax 
Credit and the Child Tax Credit, (also list in Tables 1 & 2). 

The Income Earned Tax Credit (IETC), in it current form, be 
consider by some study to be ineffective without a significant 
increase in size [26]. This same study also make note of the great 
capacity for fraud open by such a program. Of the information in 
Tables 1 and 2 none of the list family structure would receive an 
Income Earned Tax Credit, though, a ‘one adult, one infant family’ in 
Dauphin County, Pennsylvania, would receive a payment of $34 from the 
program every month, cover 1% of the cost of living [2]. Practically, 
although we have case of state a well a country with high 
minimum wages, we do not have the same range of information relate to 
the Income Earned Tax Credit make discussion around it speculative. 

David Stockman, a proponent of the IETC, note that minimum wage 
worker should also see machinery a competition to their employment. It 
be not enough for them to be profitable but for them to be more 
profitable than mechanical replacement [27]. Though the long term 
effect of this be inconclusive, the general trend of mechanical 
replacement do provide an analogy [28]. In a way, the IETC be the 
welfare equivalent of raise the minimum wage along great 
restriction on technological replacement, so a comparison could also be 
make between such a proposition and the IETC a it stand for those 
want to consider this further. 

Beyond a comparison of the minimum wage and IETC, however, this 
discussion also raise general question about technological growth. 
Technology be a major driver of economic growth, with machine ideally 
replace the most primitive task while the human population becomes 
more productive through educational specialisation. If education be not 
sufficiently supported, however, a number of people might find 
themselves unskilled and unemployed. Historically, the former have be 
the most prevalent in the long term while the latter be the case in the 
short term. 

Compared to increase the IETC or minimum wage which both, either 
independently or combined, fulfils the moral right to a default state of 
choice, the position of laissez faire economics do not necessarily do 
so. 

Laissez faire supporter claim the market equilibrium be the best 
measure of employment; however, this be base on free choice and high 
competition. With 4 million job available for 9 million unemployed, 
(discounting discourage workers), the market may appear more evenly 
balance than it actually be [29, 30, 31]. While anyone without 
disability can perform the mostly unskilled labour of minimum wage work, 
many of those 4 million job require technical skill a minimum wage 
worker may have financial difficulty obtain [32, 33]. A sizable 
surplus in unemployed, unskilled labour and the low bargaining power 
this creates, amidst the choice compromise coercion of necessity, be 
the main argument against a laissez faire approach’s assumption of 
near-perfect competition. 

In a typical supply-demand scenario the gradient of a curve relates 
to elasticity, (an elasticity of labour supply from employee and an 
elasticity of labour demand from employer respectively). Generally, 
elasticity be increase by every alternative choice an individual has. 
Elasticity, therefore, act a a practical measure for choice in the 
market and hence, in the context of the aforementioned notion of 
meritocratic fairness, reflect both a practical and ethical reality. If 
worker be under the threat of poverty, they be more pressure into 
find a job and their elasticity be decreased. Low labour supply 
elasticity mean that if wage be cut by a give amount then the 
number of people who continue seek employment decline by a far 
small margin. Given the surplus of people seek employment, 
company hardly have to compete with one another for unskilled worker 
a they might have to in technical field [34]. In addition, there be 
little perception of competition for the most elite of the unskilled 
employees. 

Although the best and brightest of software engineer might see 
exceptional offer due to their even more limited number, there be no 
such opportunity for the savant cashier, mitigate pressure from 
internal competition or an efficiency wage motive towards increase 
minimum wage worker pay naturally. Combining these factor with an 
inelastic labour supply, many company might prefer to low their 
employees’ pay in spite of a relatively trivial decrease in the number 
of unskilled worker who would seek employment with them. The 
implication of this be imperfect competition, place doubt upon 
simplify supply-demand model analysis [35, 36]. 

Elasticity also exists for employers; with technological alternative 
to worker act a an extra choice for employers. Therefore, 
reduction to their access to technological replacement either through 
direct regulation or indirectly through the IETC could be see a a 
decrease to the long term elasticity of labour demand. Elasticity be 
often regard a positive, a it permit natural market force of 
change to change behaviour to more efficient practice for both the 
employer and employee. To this end, a consequentialist may view free 
choice in a marketplace positively beyond it perception either a a 
right or a distributive justice. It should also be note that although 
most critic of meritocracy condemn it propensity for inequality and 
reliance on the natural state in the case of the minimum wage, it 
interest align with the egalitarian against survivalist compulsion. 

Beyond technological replacement, under deregulation, offshore job 
could also pose a similar threat though national interest in this 
matter aren’t necessarily a moral priority [37]. Supporters of 
deregulation might also make the claim that despite any regulation 
multinational migration be a phenomenon too powerful to be combated, 
with regulation only worsen the phenomenon. 

Of the three alternative minimum wage advocate should aim to set a 
wage near where a hypothetically ideal equilibrium would place it if 
there be high elasticity or a lack of survival pressure allow for 
exploitation. With this minimum wage near the productivity wage and 
conveniently exceed the living wage, the moral obligation to remove 
the survivalist restriction to choice a well a the consequentialist 
consideration of the aggregate economy will both be satisfied. 

The IETC would counteract the pressure of necessity in a more 
indirect manner, also potentially steepen employee elasticity 
alongside an already steep elasticity for employees. While if advocate 
for this model be right it will also fulfil our initial moral dilemmas, 
less practical study exist on the IETC than the minimum wage; though 
there be little mutually exclusive territory between the two. Finally, 
laissez faire position generally neglect the practical manifestation of 
these moral hurdle and their effect on imperfect competition. Although 
the laissez faire model be more ineffective in the unskilled labour 
market, advocate still claim it be preferable to government 
intervention. 

Verdict 

There be sound reason to consider an increase to the minimum wage. 
With productivity estimate exceed the living wage despite it 
variation, not only be a right or justice base analysis satisfied by 
such a policy but so too be the position of a consequentialist concerned 
for the aggregate economy. 

Specifically for the case of Dauphin County and the whole of King 
County, a suggest $12 minimum wage would cover the cost of an 
individual while a $15 minimum wage would also cover cost for most two 
income household and some single income household while the 
productivity wage projection of $18.42 would cover cost for more, but 
still not all, remain single income families. Even if we accept some 
critics’ claim about the Economic Policy Institute’s deflation methods, 
a productivity wage of $14.40 be supported, with these productivity 
wage mark the high minimum wage which remain profitable for 
employers. 

Alongside the proposition of a minimum wage increase be alternative 
argument suggest for the IETC and deregulation, (with consideration 
of an increase in education hold no direct conflict to any of these). 
In analyse these models, some theorise profitability be not enough, 
raise further avenue for moral inquiry.
