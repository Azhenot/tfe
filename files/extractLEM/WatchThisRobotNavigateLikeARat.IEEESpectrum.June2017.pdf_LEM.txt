Rats be nimble navigators, able to find their way around, under, and over obstacles, and through the tightest spaces. Roboticists 

have long dream of give their creation similar navigation skills. To be useful in the real world, robot must be able to find their 

way around on their own. Some be already learn to do that in 

, 

, 

, and 

—and in the case of 

, entire cities. Despite that progress, robot still struggle to perform the task for which they’re design even under mildly 

challenge conditions.

At the , in Brisbane, Australia, 

and his collaborator have spent the past 14 year hone a robot 

navigation system model on the brain of rats. This biologically-inspired approach, they hope, could help robot navigate dynamic 

environment without require advanced, costly sensor and computationally-intensive algorithms.
