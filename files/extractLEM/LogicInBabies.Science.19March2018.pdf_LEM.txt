PSYCHOLOGY 

Logic in baby 
12-month-olds spontaneously 
reason use 
process of elimination 

By Justin Halberda 

T 
he success of science rest on our hu- 

man ability to reason logically. But 

where do this ability come from? 

Is it an inherent attribute of mind 

that even a young child might pos- 

sess, or be it a hard-won accomplish- 

ment master late in life? On page 1263 

of this issue, Cesana-Arlotti et al. (1) reveal 

that one essential form of logical inference, 

process of elimination, be within the toolkit 

of 12-month-old infants. This reveals the 

early know foundation of our human 

ability to reason logically. The race to doc- 

ument the range of early logical ability 

share by infants, adults, and nonhuman 

animals, and to determine how these foun- 

dational ability empower our broader ca- 

pacities to reason, have begun. 

Every scientific method require a sup- 

port logic. For Francis Bacon (2), this 

be unfettered empirical observation fol- 

low by induction (reasoning from many 

case to form a general principle). Karl 

Popper (3) stress the importance of hy- 

pothesis test and the ability to refute 

hypothesis found to be false (science a 

an extend instance of process of elimi- 

nation). And Thomas Kuhn (4) highlight 

the dramatic change that occur during 

scientific revolutions, in which wholly new 

model of phenomenon be create through 

model building and abduction (sometimes 

call “inference to the best explanation”). 

Examples of such revolution be the Co- 

pernican Revolution (5) produce the 

heliocentric model of the solar system, 

and the Einsteinian Revolution of special 

relativity in which space and time become 

one (6). In each of these case (induction, 

hypothesis testing, abduction), the work 

of science be support by an underlie 

logic. No logic, no science. 

Where do our human faculty to reason 

logically come from? At the end of the pre- 

vious century, Susan Carey suggest that 

such logic might be deep in our develop- 

mental roots: A young child might reason 

use intuitive theories, models, and abduc-

and avoid infect conspecific on the basis 

of olfactory cue associate with the alter 

chemical composition of infect feces (2). 

Thus, whereas prey “fear” predators, parasite 

avoidance be more akin to disgust—an innate 

aversion to cue associate with parasite (1). 

As with predator avoidance, parasite avoid- 

ance incurs cost such a alter social inter- 

actions, reduce reproductive opportunities, 

diminish foraging, and increase energy 

expenditure (4). To predict when parasite 

avoidance be most likely to occur and under- 

stand it consequences, it must be integrate 

into the same trade-off framework that be 

widely apply to predator avoidance. 

Beyond it direct effect on hosts, parasite 

avoidance have cascade effect at a range of 

scale and in various system (5). Ants and 

their parasitoids provide a useful model 

system for study the cascade effect of 

parasite avoidance on herbivory. Azteca ant 

experimentally expose to parasitoid fly 

dramatically reduce their activity level to 

avoid infection. This reduces the ants’ ability 

to attack their herbivorous prey, the coffee 

berry borer, and allows the latter to consume 

more coffee berry (6). Such ecological im- 

pact of parasite avoidance be not limited 

to top-down effect on vegetation; they also 

alter mutualism, competition, and predation. 

Like the predator-induced landscape of 

fear, a parasite-induced landscape of dis- 

gust (see the figure) have far-reaching con- 

sequence for population dynamics, specie 

interactions, and ecosystem structure. How- 

ever, whereas direct effect of predator be 

naturally restrict to prey specie (7), a par- 

asite-induced landscape of disgust extends to 

all animals, include very large specie and 

top predator that be typically immune to 

predation (8). For example, a recent synthesis 

by Moleón et al. show that carnivore avoid 

forage on other carnivore carcass and 

rarely engage in cannibalism (9). Feeding on 

conspecific increase disease transmission, 

and forgo this food resource reduces expo- 

sure to share parasite (10). At a landscape 

level, this avoidance behavior dramatically 

alters the amount of carcass material that 

be available in an ecosystem, with important 

downstream effects. For instance, carcass 

not consume by mammalian scavenger 

may support more diverse and abundant 

arthropod commun ities (9). Furthermore, 

when carcass decompose, their nutrient 

input increase plant growth (11). Like the 

ecosystem-level impact of predator avoid- 

ance, the ecosystem-level impact of parasite 

avoidance be likely to be substantial. 

Parasite and predator avoidance can exert 

oppose pressure on host and prey species. 

For example, tadpole increase their activity 

level to protect themselves from trematode 

infection, but this increase their susceptibil- 

ity to visual predator (12). The tadpole fear 

and avoid both predator and parasites, but 

do not perceive these threat a equal. When 

experimentally force to choose between pre- 

dation and parasitism risk, tadpole opt for 

infection (13). This make sense because pre- 

dation have a large short-term fitness effect 

than do parasitism, and the optimal behav- 

ior avoids the great immediate threat. 

However, parasite and predator avoidance 

be not always mutually exclusive. For in- 

stance, avoid predator feces protects prey 

against both predator and their parasite 

(14), and, when animal group together, they 

dilute their risk of attack by both predator 

and some parasite (for example, ticks, bot- 

flies) (15). Although predator avoidance have 

receive more attention, parasite avoidance 

also have strong effect on foraging, move- 

ment, and social interaction (1). 

Parasite avoidance be likely to have impor- 

tant consequences. For example, grazing ani- 

mals such a cows, sheep, and horse avoid 

fecal contaminate forage (4), and change 

livestock practice to recognize the need and 

capability of animal to avoid parasite will 

reduce the cost associate with avoidable 

livestock diseases. Furthermore, conservation 

planning and projection may benefit from 

knowledge of how shrink and fragment 

habitat limit the ability of animal to avoid 

risky site and conspecifics. As population of 

large predator continue to decline, parasite 

avoidance may become a relatively strong 

driver of ecological processes. Integrating 

parasite into the ecology of fear be thus cru- 

cial to understand the general ecological 

and evolutionary effect of parasite on eco- 

system and predict how ecosystem be 

likely to respond to the rapidly change en- 

vironments of the Anthropocene. j

tion, much like a professional scientist (7). 

Other developmental psychologist push 

this further and suggest that even infant 

might be understood to be little scientist 

draw inference in the cradle about ob- 

jects and cause (8). But suggestion like 

these be frequently met with incredulity 

(9): After all, it often feel like logical rea- 

soning be effortful, conscious, and even lin- 

guistically base (10). These characteristics, 

if accurate, would seem to preclude the pos- 

sibility that preverbal infant could engage 

in any such process. 

Cesana-Arlotti et al. ask whether pre- 

linguistic 12- and 19-month-old infant 

would spontaneously reason use process 

of elimination. This be a form of inference 

also know a disjunctive syllogism or mo- 

dus tollendo ponens—it be any argument of 

the form: A or B, not A, therefore B. Cesana- 

Arlotti et al. rely on one of the few behav- 

iors baby voluntarily engage in—looking 

at whatever they find most interest (11). 

They measure infants’ look at comput- 

erized vignette in which two different ob- 

jects (A and B) be show be hidden 

behind a wall. Infants watch a a cup 

scoop one of the object from behind 

the wall, and then come to rest next to the 

wall—critically, only the topmost edge of 

the contain object could be see peek 

out of the cup, such that infant could not 

tell for sure whether the object be A or B. 

At this moment, infant could have form 

a disjunctive thought—for example, “either 

the object in the cup be object A or it be ob- 

ject B.” Next, this ambiguity be resolved: 

The wall drop to reveal that object A be 

behind the wall, but the content of the cup 

remain hidden. This be the moment of po- 

tential elimination, and an opportunity for 

infant to draw a key inference—“because 

object A be not in the cup, object B must be 

in the cup.” Finally, infants’ expectation for 

the cup’s content be tested: Either the 

expect object (object B) or, surprisingly, 

another object A emerge from the cup. 

Infants look longer at the surprising out- 

come—an indication that their expectation 

be violate and a hint that they be 

seek further information to resolve the 

conflict (12). 

Potentially even more exciting, infant 

also show sign of make the necessary 

inference along the way—for example, 

upon see which of the two object be 

behind the wall, but before the cup’s con- 

tent be revealed, infants’ pupil dilate 

and they tend to shift their fixation to 

the cup (consistent with them infer 

which object must be inside). This pattern 

suggests that infant use the information 

they have see to reason through a disjunc- 

tive syllogism (A or B, not A, therefore 

B). There be also additional version 

of these vignette that manipulate the 

precise sequence of hiding and revealing, 

which allow the author to determine 

what specifically the infant be remem- 

bering and expect during each moment. 

The careful craft of stimulus and clever 

analysis of infants’ spontaneous look 

behavior by Cesana-Arlotti et al. show u 

that infant have the capacity to reason 

by process of elimination. By contrast, 

whereas nonhuman animal such a dog 

face similar situation of ambiguity may 

ultimately form the right conclusion, they 

appear to arrive at this hunch use an as- 

sociative rather than logical process (13). 

Unwinding the similarity and difference 

among infant, child, adult, and animal rea- 

soning ability be an important task for 

the future, a be determine why, despite 

be deployed by infants, reason feel 

effortful and why human often “go with 

our gut” and rely on heuristic and bias 

rather than logical inference (14). 

A new field, study the foundation of 

logical abilities, be emerging. As with other 

success of developmental psychology 

in recent decade [as in work on the psy- 

chology of number, language, and theory 

of mind (15)], this new field will make use 

of behavior and brain study with infants, 

children, and adults; study of nonhuman 

animal abilities; study of the correlation 

between reason and other abilities; and 

training study to determine where we 

all begin and how maturation and experi- 

ence build upon these foundations. It be a 

thrill time for u a scientists—using 

logical reason to understand how we 

reason logically. j
