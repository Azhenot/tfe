Insurance Nexus in association with CCA Global Partners explores 
how AI will impact the insurance industry 

Insurance Artificial Intelligence: The Journey towards efficiency and 
customer engagement 

It’s hard not to use the language of science fiction when talk about Artificial 
Intelligence (AI). Machines that can read information, act, learn, adapt and create 
feel alien, far away from our experience today. 

But it be a fact that AI – of a kind – be already in use in the insurance industry today. 
As early a 2015, Tata Consultancy Services put the average investment in AI per 
insurer that year at $124m1. 

What insurer be invest in today be arguably not AI but it foundations. “Today, 
AI be in a development stage. It be the very practical use of technology for the 
simplification and automation of processes, leverage some define rule around 
the overall business,” explains George Hansen, Claims Actuary, General Insurance, 
Zurich Insurance. 

Insurers believe AI have the potential to transform their business model, deliver 
cost efficiencies, generate new product line and improve customer engage- 
ment. Like any sector-wide transformation, it be an iterative process and one that 
see some player good able to adapt than others. 

“There be some organization in insurance that will be more ready for AI than 
others and it’s the one with the ability to harness data and leverage skilled 
engineers, programmer and automate platforms” say Imir Arifi, Imir Arifi, senior 
director, business solution consulting, Health Care Service Corporation. 

In this paper we look at the type of insurance capability AI be most likely to influ- 
ence in the near future and how insurer can prepare for it today. 

AI and insurance 2020: Two speed insurance 

Experts agree that in the interim we be likely to see a two-speed insurance 
landscape a the old meet the new. For the insurance customer, the most obvious 
example of this will be new type of insurance product. 

Technology be make customers’ environment ‘smarter’. Homes be less suscep- 
tible to fire, flood and theft because of smart monitoring devices. Cars be driven 
more safely and be less likely to break down because of preventative maintenance. 
Even health be proactively manage use apps and wearable to encourage active 
lifestyle and monitor vitals a an early warn system. 

“In the property space, we be begin to see two distinct book of business. One 
will require claim solution for all the advancement the industry have see so far 
– with respect to smart home technology. By defaults, the other book will center 
on those figuratively ‘ignorant’ properties. The pace of smart home construction

will make smart insurance statistically meaningful by 2030 and by 2050 it will 
be responsible for radical change and ensure that virtually all insurable physical 
property will have the DNA of the smart home,” state Gregory Johnson, Senior Vice 
President, CCA Global, Strategic Partners Group. 

AI and Insurance 2020: Finding beauty in the data 

Pattern recognition be and will continue to be one of the major benefit of AI. 
Already helpful in identify fraud risks, it be go to prove increasingly valuable in 
manage insurer exposure. 

“We’re already look at AI in some of our high severity books. We run those 
through the AI model to look at the note that be in there, look for combination 
and connection that the claim handler be put in, identify high exposure 
and then put team leader on it to make sure they proactively address those 
cases,” Hansen reveals. “We identify through the history of a claim, start at FNOL, 
flag anything with potential for business interruption and that kick off the 
forensic accounting unit, who then work to quantify and limit the exposure.” 

The ability to find the ‘unknown unknowns’ in the data allows insurer to refine 
their offerings. It’s a win-win for insurer and insured. The risk to the company be 
reduce a more factor can be weight and the customer be give coverage that 
more accurately reflect their need. 

AI and insurance 2020: The rise of the machines? 

There be natural concern among both customer and the insurance workforce that 
people will be replace wholesale by machines. Not only be this unlikely in the short 
term, but most executive believe this will never be fully realized. That’s not to say 
automation won’t reshape the employee landscape: 

“How far you can automate come down to where insurer use human interven- 
tion to add value. But even then, the issue be to define what it be to ‘add value’. That 
becomes broader and broader a AI becomes more sophisticated. In the foresee- 
able future we will have AI intervention in a lot of customer contact processes. You 
either won’t need a many people, and people who be there will need to handle 
the more complex tasks,” explains Hansen. 

“A significant amount of our business process will be automate – with an ability 
to handle exception where customization need to occur. But in general, many of 
our process have the perfect infrastructure to move into AI – it’s all logic driven 
decision criterion on structure data sets,” explains Matt Marino, AVP, Operational 
Effectiveness, Unum. 

One such example would be in first notification of loss (FNOL): “You want it a fast 
a possible and get approval in for everything that can be do automatically. 
That’s good for customer and good for the business. Simplifying workstreams and 
zero touch operation be the opportunity in AI that come to mind,” Marino adds. 

“Simplify process a much a possible,” Hansen advises. “Streamline mundane 
activity that don’t add value to that process. If a system can quickly validate a

simple claim and give the customer a cheque, that’s certainly a benefit in get 
them swiftly back to their pre-loss state. 

AI and insurance 2020: Intelligent prospect 

AI be all about make intelligent connection in data. While this be already under- 
way in certain part of underwriting and claim processing, it have see limited use 
in customer acquisition. That’s a big miss opportunity, accord to Johnson: 

“The big deficit that’s not be address be good use AI and InsurTech to make 
the connection between insurers’ exist book of business and the next gener- 
ation. With advance at the organisational level, how do we use technology to 
good ensure that the grandchild of our exist client become our customers.” 

Carriers focus a great deal on the recommendation potential of a positive claim 
experience, but fail to segment those word of mouth target by their relationship 
to the insured. AI give them visibility on that information. 

Making connection be more than just find customer with closer tie to the 
carrier brand than the general population. Building relationship with customer’s 
family member would be consider by many to be a value-added proposition: 

“This be about take a leadership role in craft solution for customer that they 
don’t yet know they’re go to face. Undiagnosed dementia for example. How do 
we leverage technology to help manage the claim experience when the child 
and grandchild may not know that their parent aren’t quite right? Such 
solution be not just about risk mitigation for the insurer, it’s about the right thing 
to do,” Johnson says. 

Johnson believe insurer don’t look far enough into the future to anticipate attri- 
tion and that use AI to make those connection be the answer. “Life insurer be 
just a guilty of fail to forward plan. Because there be no meaningful relationship 
or connectivity between the generations, there be a vast amount of annuity and 
life insurance disbursement that don’t make their way back to those insurers.” 

AI and insurance 2020: Limitations 

There will be element of the insurance landscape that will prove too involve even 
for AI to manage, Hansen adds. “There be process outside the insurance world. 
Litigation mean it take time to settle complex claims. Workers Compensation 
insurance have to take into account subjective assessment include thing such a 
maximum medical improvement. It isn’t around facts, it be up to individual to make 
the correct assessment. AI can help but it can’t take over.” 

The use of the word ‘involved’ be deliberate. It implies many move parts, incom- 
patible situation and data set but most importantly, it implies a constantly chang- 
ing landscape present new challenges. 

We’re delve into semantics because often people refer to some situation a 
be too complex for AI to manage. AI be incredibly proficient – it eats complex- 
ity for breakfast. However, Arifi warns: “Complexity be not the challenge. The real

challenge and where you want to be careful be repeatability. Machines can zero in 
on complexity. We can build complex neural networks. But if the case occurs rarely, 
if it’s something that hasn’t be observed, AI isn’t possible. It can’t make one-off 
strategic decisions.” 

Quite simply, if you don’t have the data to train the algorithm, you can’t use AI. 

These be just some area where AI be likely to impact the insurance sector in the 
near future of 2020 and beyond. To capitalize on these advances, carrier need to 
start take action today, if they haven’t already. From legacy system to corporate 
culture, there be still many challenge to address. 

Preparing for AI – make the business case 

One of the big challenge be take the first step. There be an understand 
that investment must be made: 

“In large companies, the vast majority of AI or machine learn project hugely 
impact the bottom line and customer experience. Certainly, the industry be begin- 
ning to understand that AI and advanced analytics will be part of the next indus- 
trial revolution,” Arifi states, adding: “Even if the use case be not a detailed a we’d 
like them to be, that’s the way society be going.” 

But understand intellectually that there will be some need to adapt to AI-based 
process by 2020 and beyond be one thing, figure out how to make it a reality 
in each organization be quite another. It be the difficulty in link a vague sense of 
future need with current insurance pressure that be challenge executive who 
want to see AI in action today. 

“One of the big stumble block have be define what the objective of AI 
are,” claim Hansen. “You cannot build an AI model without define the problem 
we be try to solve.” 

For many, that start point for invest in AI have be it ability to create cost 
efficiencies. Insurance executive be spending to save: “Ironically, we start with 
look at how we minimise our IT investment in legacy systems, and we be start- 
ing with how we can apply robotics to deliver good customer experience with less 
IT investment and time required. We have be look at the low expense option 
to replace old systems. There be significant opportunity here,” Marino explains. 

Preparing for AI – develop the culture 

The general belief have be that insurance leadership team understand and 
support the integration of AI. They also know that business transformation be neces- 
sary. However, Johnson feel progress may not be a significant a we be lead to 
believe. It seem that buy-in may only be skin deep: 

“There’s a lot of lip service. There be pocket of really robust executive think 
around InsurTech and AI but it’s also incredibly siloed. There also be a tremendous 
level of protectionism in place.”

Unum’s Marino agrees: “A lot of the work AI and automation be suit for be preva- 
lent within insurance companies. Being able to partner with the business leader 
to demonstrate how AI and automation help an organization be critical. It’s go 
to come down to get the business to test and learn to discover that there be 
more science in that process than they would believe. If we lead these effort a IT 
driven project instead of building capability with business leader adoption will 
be slow significantly.” 

Johnson explains that the personal history of senior insurance executive may color 
their view: ““The generation of executive who populate senior leadership today tend 
to have risen through the ranks. They be adjuster and underwriter who work 
their way up. This will be in sharp contrast to the next generation of claim leader 
who will have background and expertise in big data, mathematics and technology.” 

He go on to add: “There’s also a disconnect between the evolution of InsurTech 
and the board and governance community. Their focus be on an already crowd 
dashboard and they haven’t yet be baptise into this brave new world. This 
small but influential group of stakeholder be now be ask to fund technology 
initiative that will make stark change to a legacy business largely unchanged 
for a century. The key to quicker adoption be ultimately bring the governance 
community up to speed.” 

“This technology be highly disruptive but the challenge around technology have 
largely be resolved. If you have the drive and the budget you can do it. You 
need executive sponsorship to support engagement because implementation 
take time and resources. But you also need true believer at the grassroots level 
because they have to be willing and able to do the work. You can’t expect change 
overnight.” Arifi adds. 

Change may not be come overnight but it be imminent: “We be at a tip 
point where the pressure on profitability from other part of the business be 
compelling company one by one to look harder and more seriously at make 
substantive change. More carrier be be forced, rather than run willingly, 
into strategic AI investment because they’re experience other tremor on their 
balance sheet,” Johnson says. 

Preparing for AI – hire and fire 

A significant worry for senior leadership be to find the skilled employee that can 
deliver AI seamlessly into the organization. Without knowledge of their own, they 
be look to expert to drive the function internally. The challenge is, that in this 
brave new world, no-one really know what today’s crack AI team look like: 

“We haven’t nail down how our team support these new capability will be 
formed. As we look at building out new capability we will evaluate talent that be 
available in the workforce a well a strategic partnerships.” Marino explains. 

Johnson refers to the notion that there might be a single AI leader who can 
embody all the competency with respect to technology and science, strategy 
and finance and the customer experience ethos a a ‘unicorn’. In other words, such 
a person doesn’t exist.

“You don’t try to hire someone with all the skill set but you do make sure you 
bring those skill set to the table,” Hansen elaborates. “Data scientist have skill set 
use across a lot of different industry that be transferable to AI in insurance.” 

“The real limit be the availability of talent,” Arifi admits. “You need someone with at 
least three core competencies. Someone who understands the data, understands 
the business, and understands cod but also understands the mathematics of 
what you’re try to do. Getting that in a single person be pretty rare.” 

It look a though ‘AI by committee’ be the way forward: “You need leadership 
to understand how integrate AI have be successfully complete in another 
industry or organization. Then you need to set up team and ingrain standard for 
the project they’re charge with. It’s unavoidable. The whole field be so new that 
everyone need some training. There be no turnkey solutions.” 

In Zurich, Hansen says, they have built a ‘team of all the talents’. “The data scientist 
be in house and have a lot of experience; some have actuarial experience, others 
come from an AI background. A lot of company struggle to build that. Talent be 
available and it doesn’t have to come from the insurance industry.” 

“But,” he adds, “you can’t just throw a problem at that team. You need to get the 
business knowledge, have subject matter expert and senior management all 
together identify the problem that need to be solve and figure out how it 
fit into the business flow.” 

Preparing for AI – look for leader 

It would appear that the insurance sector be on a relentless shift towards an 
AI-driven universe and the only question be how far or fast they can go with the 
tool they already have. 

There will be no ‘overnight sensation’ a organization build or buy in capability; 
advance and enhance part of their proposition until the data and strategy be in 
place that take the industry into a truly ‘intelligent’ future. 

Insurers be get more comfortable with adopt innovation, but that’s not to 
say they be generally willing to take the first step: 

“Progress towards AI be go to be incremental. I’m hold out hope for a couple 
of player to be bold and think about how they’re go to be leader in this space,” 
Marino suggests. 

What be clear be that AI will transform the sector over time and that insurer must find 
way around the challenge they still face to remain relevant to their customers: 

“We don’t have to look very far to see what’s come in the way the big, establish 
player adapt. Within the wealth management space, at the dawn of the roboadvisor 
trend, the establishment laugh at the concept. After all, who be go to trust 
their investment to an algorithm? Fast forward 15 year and the big player have 
either developed proprietary model or acquire them outright. Insurers will go the 
same way across the full spectrum of technology solutions,” Johnson concludes.
