Majorana fermion be a hypothetical particle that be it own antiparticle.We report transport 
measurement that suggest the existence of one-dimensional chiral Majorana fermion 
mode in the hybrid system of a quantum anomalous Hall insulator thin film couple 
with a superconductor. As the external magnetic field be swept, half-integer quantize 
conductance plateau be observe at the location of magnetization reversals, give a 
distinct signature of the Majorana fermion modes. This transport signature be reproducible 
over many magnetic field sweep and appear at different temperatures. This find may 
open up an avenue to control Majorana fermion for implement robust topological 
quantum computing. 

M 
ajorana fermion, propose by Ettore 
Majorana in 1937 (1), be a putative elemen- 
tary spin-1/2 particle with the unusual 
property of be it own antiparticle. In 
condensed-matter systems, analog of 

Majorana fermion can be realize a quasipar- 
ticles of topological state of quantum matter, 
such a the n = 5/2 quantumHall state (2), Moore- 
Read–type state in the fractional quantum Hall 
effect (3), two-dimensional (2D) px + ipy spinless 
superconductors (4), strong spin-orbit couple 
semiconductor-superconductor heterostructures 
(5, 6), and ferromagnetic atomic chain on a 
superconductor (7, 8). Viewed a a supercon- 
ducting analog of the quantum Hall state (9), 
a chiral topological superconductor (TSC) in two 
dimension have a full pair gap in the bulk 
and an odd number N gapless chiral Majorana 
fermion mode at the edge (10, 11). The funda- 
mental aspect of the Majorana fermion mode 
and their non-Abelian braiding property can be 
potentially use to implement topological qubits 
in fault-tolerant quantum computation (12–15). 
Numerous scheme to accommodate Majorana 

fermion mode in superconductors couple with 
topological matter have be propose (16–31). 
The Majorana zero mode, a 0D version of the 
Majorana fermion, be a charge-neutral bound state 
that exists strictly at zero energy. Its existence 
could be spectroscopically demonstrate by the 
“zero-bias conductance anomalies”modulated by 
external electrical/magnetic field (20–27, 32). 
Although these observation provide promising 
signature of Majorana bound states, it be difficult 
to energetically resolve the contribution from 
other effects, such a Kondo correlations, Andreev- 
bound states, weak antilocalization, and reflec- 
tionless tunnel (20–22, 33–35). 
In contrast, a recent theoretical proposal fo- 

cu on the direct transport signature of the 1D 
Majorana fermion mode (16–18). The 1DMajorana 
fermion mode satisfies the propagate wave 
equation originally propose by Ettore Majorana 
(1). A series of theoretical result (16–18, 36) sug- 
gests that a chiral TSC base on a quantum anom- 
alous Hall insulator (QAHI) might be a promising 
host of 1D Majorana fermion mode because the 
chiral Hall state can be achieve without strong 
external magnetic fields, preserve supercon- 
ductivity. To break time-reversal symmetry, the 
single-domain phase of the QAHI require an 
external field of ~0.1 T, which be more than one 
order of magnitude low than the critical field 
of typical superconducting metals. By modu- 
lating the external field, topological transition 
can lead eventually to the establishment of single 
chiral Majorana edge mode (CMEMs). 
When a superconductor be couple to a QAHI 

thin film—i.e., a magnetic topological insulator 
thin film—a reversal of the magnetization can 
induce a series of topological phase transitions. 
The propose scheme be demonstrate in Fig. 1A, 
(i) to (vii), where a superconducting region be 
introduce in the middle of a QAHI channel. The 
effective Hamiltonian of the QAHI region be

ing a trivial surface gap (the Chern number C = 
0 state). m0 and m1 be the hybridization gap 
and the parabolic band component, respective- 
ly. The Chern number of the system be C = l / |l| 
for |l| > |m0|, where |C| be equal to the number of 
the chiral edge channels; for |l| < |m0|, C becomes 
0. As a result, by adjust the external magnetic 
field, a transition between a normal insulator 
(NI) with C = 0 (zero plateau, Hall conductance 
sxy = 0) to a QAHI with C = ±1 (integer plateau, 
sxy = ±e 

2/h) can be achieve (38, 39). In the middle 
of the QAHI bar, the proximity to an s-wave super- 
conductor drive the QAHI into a superconduct- 
ing regime, where a finite superconducting pair 
amplitude be induced to the surface of the QAHI, 
and in this case the system can be described by

Here, m be the chemical potential and D1,2 be

ciple, each chiral edge state in the quantum Hall 
regime be topologically equivalent to two iden- 
tical copy of CMEMs, such that the total Chern 
number be even (N = 2C in this case). The key to 
achieve a single CMEM be to induce a topological 
phase with an odd Chern number to separate 
the two copy of CMEMs (16). When the struc- 
tural symmetry be preserve between the top 
and bottom surface states—i.e., D = D1 = D2— 
the topological transition in the TSC region can 
only occur betweenN = ±2 [Fig. 1A, (i) and (vii)] 
and N = 0 (iv), where the QAHI region expe- 
rience a NI-QAHI-NI transition, thanks to the 
surface hybridization. The topological phase tran- 
sitions for all three region be synchronized, and 
the two CMEMs cannot be distinguish from 
each other. However, when the structural inver- 
sion symmetry be broken, the pair amplitude 
of the top and bottom surface be different 
(D1 6¼ D2), and phase withN = ±1 [Fig. 1A, (ii), 
(iii), (v), and (vi)] emerge (17, 18, 36). The half- 
integer conductance of the system can be de- 
rive from the scatter matrix for the two 
QAHI edge state at the entrance and exit of

the TSC, which allows for a calculation of the 
propagation of charge and, therefore, the elec- 
trical conductivity (see the supplementary 
text). 
To experimentally identify the CMEM, we fab- 

ricate a QAHI-TSC device (Fig. 1B). The QAHI 
bar with dimension of 2 mm by 1 mm be imple- 
mented use a magnetic topological insulator 
thin film (Cr0.12Bi0.26Sb0.62)2Te3 grown on a 
GaAs (111)B substrate by molecular beam epitaxy. 
The Fermi level be within the surface gap without 
the assistance of electric-field tune with a gate 
(38). Because the hybridization gap, m0, be impor- 
tant to control the propose topological phase 
change, the QAHI film thickness be precisely con- 
troll to be six quintuple layers, i.e., around 6 nm 
(38, 40). Across the central part of the QAHI bar, 
a superconductor bar (8 mm by 0.6 mm) be depos- 
ited, which contains a 200-nm layer of Nb protect 
by a 5-nm layer of Au. A control QAHI Hall bar of 
the same dimension be also fabricate near the 
TSC device on the same wafer. The field-dependent 
total longitudinal conductance (s12) be obtain 
by passing an alternate current (I12 in Fig. 1B) 
through the outer two probe and measure the 
potential drop across the inner two probe (Fig. 1B, 
point 1 and 2). In the control QAHI device, trans- 

verse and longitudinal resistivity be obtain 
use the standard Hall bar setup (Fig. 1B, right). 
The single CMEM correspond to N = ±1 

can be identify experimentally by a unique 
transport signature of a half-integer longitudi- 
nal conductance plateau (0.5 e2/h) during the re- 
versal of the magnetization (17, 18, 36). When the 
external field be large enough, the device fully 
reach the QAHI scheme (C = ±1). In the TSC 
region, both of the two CMEMs exist, form 
the phase of N = ±2. Because the two CMEMs 
be topologically equivalent to one QAHI state 
(C = ±1), all incident edge mode can almost 
perfectly transmit through the device, a show 
in Fig. 1A, (i) and (vii) [compared with (viii) in 
the QAHI regime], lead to s12 = e 

2/h (to be 
discuss in Fig. 2C). When the magnetic field 
be reduced, the TSC region experience the first 
topological phase change, lead toN = ±1, such 
that one of the pair CMEMs vanishes. Because 
the QAHI region be still in the C = ±1 phase, 
the incident QAHI state can transmit only one 
of the CMEMs to the TSC region, whereas the 
other CMEM be almost perfectly reflected. This 
lead to the separation between the two CMEMs 
in the incident QAHI state [Fig. 1A, (ii) and (vi)], 
such that a half-integer plateau of the longitu- 

dinal conductance would occur (to be discuss 
in Fig. 2C). Further reduce the magnetic field 
drive the QAHI region to the NI phase (C = 0), 
where the surface hybridization gap shuts down 
the conduct channel (s12 = 0). Although the 
TSC region still experience two more topological 
transition (N = –1, 0, 1), no current should go 
through in these cases, a show in Figs. 1A, (iii), 
(iv), and (v). Thus, during every reversal of the 
magnetization, s12 present a half-integer plateau 
close to the coercive fields. 
The transport channel form by the CMEM of 

N = ±1 be experimentally demonstrate by the 
longitudinal conductance signal of the QAHI-TSC 
device. Figure 2A illustrates the temperature- 
dependent upper critical field ðm0H⊥C2Þ in the out- 
of-plane direction of the Nb bar use a standard 
four-probe method (magenta configuration in 
Fig. 1B). Here, the zero-resistance temperature 
(corresponding to the temperature at which the 
zero-resistance state be just achieved) be extract 
from the temperature-dependent resistance char- 
acteristics under different perpendicular mag- 
netic field (Fig. 2A, inset). The result m0H

follow the standard linearize Ginzburg-Landau

of the topological superconductor device a show in the left of (B) evolve 
during a sweep of the external magnetic field (i) to (vii). This sweep start 
by saturate the magnetization along +z (i), and then the field be reduce 
to zero. Further increase the field along –z initiate the reversal of the 
magnetization (ii). During this reversal, the QAHI enters the trivial insulate 
state (C = 0), such that the system evolves to (iii), (iv), and (v), consecutively. 
When the magnetization be close to a full saturation along –z, the 
transport configuration be driven to (vi). Finally, when a large negative field 
be apply to fully reverse the magnetization, the system end up with (vii). 
Likewise, when the field be swept from –z to +z, the system evolves in 
a similar manner, but the current direction be opposite to those in (i) to

backscattering for TSCN=±2 [(i) and (vii)], while Majorana mode transmit 
through the TSCN=±1 [(ii) and (vi)]. The last Hall bar (viii) demonstrates

(s12) of the TSC device be obtain by passing a current (I12) and 
measure the potential drop across point 1 and 2. To characterize the 
upper critical field ðm0H⊥C2Þ of the Nb bar, it temperature-dependent 
resistance be measure use an independent four-probe method by 
passing a current ISC and measure the voltage VSC under different 
perpendicular magnetic field strength (see also Fig. 2A, inset). On the right 
side, to obtain the Hall conductance (sxy) of the QAHI device, longitudinal 
(Vxx) and transverse (Vxy) voltage be measure when passing a current I0. 

The potential drop across the entire Hall bar ðV 012Þ be also independently

similar magnetic field. These plateau be close 
to the predict value (0.5 e2/h) where the trans- 
port in the TSC region be dominate by the 1D 
channel of the CMEM in the N = ±1 phase 
[see Fig. 1A, (ii) and (vi)]. Despite the fact that 
Majorana fermion be charge neutral, the two 
CMEMs at the two edge of the TSCN=±1 con- 
stitute a coherent charge basis that transmits 
exactly one-half of the incoming charges. At 
20 mK, distinct plateau with the quantize 
value of 0.50(±0.06) e2/h be see at both shoul- 
ders of the s12 valley (Fig. 2C). Outside the half- 
plateau regimes, when the magnetization be fully 
saturated, the conductance reach a quantize 
value of 0.98(±0.04) e2/h, indicate the C = ±1 / 
N= ±2 phase [see Fig. 1A, (i) and (vii)]. On 
the other hand, during the reversal of the mag- 
netization, s12 dip into a valley correspond 
to the NI phase of the QAHI region [see Fig. 
1A, (iii), (iv), and (v)]. Ideally, the NI phase should 
completely shut down the QAHI channels, lead- 
ing to zero-conductance plateaus. However, this 
require an ultra-smooth sample such that the 
electrostatic fluctuation throughout the device 
be small than the hybridization gap (~4 meV) 
induced by the couple between the top and 
bottom surface state of the QAHI thin film. 
Thanks to the proximity effect, band-bending may 
occur at the Nb cover region, such that the 
device may not be fully insulate a expected, 
result in a vanishingly small but observable 
residual s12 of ~0.05 e 

2/h observe in the NI phase 
(Fig. 2C). Furthermore, in this field range, the 
resistance between lead 1 and 2 can increase 
to a high a 10 to 100 MW (or even higher), which 
be comparable to the internal resistance of the 
lock-in amplifier instrument, make the accurate 
measurement of s12 very challenging. Consistent 
with the phase transition during the magnetic 
reversal, the half-integer plateau (or kinks) occur 
at every reversal of the magnetization in the hys- 
teresis loop. Such magnetization reversal can 
also be see in a QAHI device with it Hall con- 
ductance (sxy) plot in Fig. 2D align to Fig. 
2C, where two intermediate zero plateau (sxy ~ 0) 
induced by the NI-QAHI transition occur at the 
coercive field HC = ~±170mT (38, 40). In these 
half-integer plateau (Fig. 2C), the transport in 
the TSC region is, in principle, purely dominate 
by a collection of chiral Majorana fermion a 1D 
edge modes. This feature be distinct from the 
“zero-bias conductance anomalies” induced by 
0D Majorana bound state (20, 22, 27, 32), and 
be a a hallmark signature associate with the 
chiral Majorana edge transport channel in the 
TSCN=±1 phases. 
To further confirm the transport signature of 

the CMEMs in theN = ±1 phase, we carry out 
measurement at high temperature (Fig. 3A). 
With increase temperature, the thermal broaden- 
ing of the transport window gradually smear 
the half-integer plateaus, which become kink of 
finite slope and then eventually disappear 
above 400, 470, and 390 mK for Devices I (Fig. 
3B), II (fig. S2A), and III (fig. S2B), respectively. 
In all three devices, the kink at high-field re- 
versals be always narrower than the low-field 

plateaus, and they vanish early a the temper- 
ature increases. This discrepancy between low- 
field and high-field reversal may be attribute 
to the magnetic field hinder the superconduct- 
ing phase. Although the external magnetic field 
be low than the critical field of the Nb bar (as 
show in Fig. 2A), the interfacial exchange couple 
between the Nb and the QAHI may provide a 
much large effective field, which suppresses the 
superconducting phase in the TSC region. 
Other effect that might lead to the observe 

transport signatures, such a the Barkhausen 
effect (41), must be rule out. When domain 
be small and not strongly pin by impurities, 
domain wall abruptly jump during the magne- 
tization reversal, and the resultant stochastic 
Barkhausen step therefore often appear in 
bunch that be irreproducible during different 
magnetic field sweeps. These step mainly occur 
at small magnetic field (fig. S3), and none of 
them could reach Rxx = 2 h/e 

2 (supplementary 
text). In contrast, the CMEM-induced half-integer 

plateau in Device I can be reproduce (fig. S4) 
with clear temperature trace (Fig. 3A), and they 
occur both in low-field and high-field case (Fig. 
2C). When large domain be pin by impur- 
ities or defects, some Barkhausen step can be 
retraceable at large magnetic fields, a show in 
fig. S2A for Device II. However, these step can 
be strongly suppress with improve sample 
quality, a show in Fig. 3A for Device I and fig. 
S2B for Device III. Among all three devices, only 
the 0.5 e2/h plateau survive in all cases, suggest- 
ing that they originate from a fundamentally 
different mechanism. Only the backscattering 
originate in the TSCN=±1 phase could lead to 
such a half-quantized conductance that persists 
in different batch of devices. Any backscattering 
process from the TSCN=±2 or the NSCN=0 phase 
would have a considerably small Andreev 
scattering, which cannot explain the half-integer 
conductance. 
Another alternative explanation of the half- 

integer s12 might be that the two QAHI region

and right QAHI bar in series. Thus, s12 gradually decrease a the field increase and quantizes 
to ~0.5 e2/h when the field reach about 4 T. (B) Schematic configuration of a TSC device for the 
conductance measurements. The three-terminal conductance (s13 and s23) be obtain by passing 
a current from either the QAHI lead to the superconductor Nb (I13 and I23) and measure the 
correspond potential drop (across point 1-3 and 2-3). (C and D) The result s13 and s23 a 
function of external magnetic fields, respectively. The dash line align with those in Fig. 2, C and 
D; the arrow indicate magnetic field sweep directions. During the transition to a TSC (N = ±1), 
both s13 and s23 become close to e 

2/h but almost vanish otherwise, consistent with the theoretical 
prediction of the single CMEMs.

could have be connect in series by a non- 
superconducting, topologically trivial Nb cover 
region. To address this issue, two additional trans- 
port measurement be carry out use Device 
I, a explain below. 
First, s12 be obtain at high magnetic field 

a show in Fig. 4A, use the same setup a Fig. 
1B. After the magnetic field eliminates the super- 
conduct phase in both layers, s12 indeed reach 
~0.5 e2/h, suggest the scenario of two QAHIs 
connect in series a expected. This occurs when 
the external field exceeds ~4 T, the anticipate 
upper critical field of the Nb layer show in Fig. 2A. 
This behavior suggests that the Nb cover region 
be indeed in a TSCN=2 phase before s12 start 
to drop back to ~0.5 e2/h. If the half-integer 
plateau below the critical field be induced by 
this trivial picture, they would have persist all 
the way throughout large field (fig. S5E). The 
coexistence of these 0.5 and 1.0 e2/h plateau in 
Fig. 4A rule out this trivial picture, provide 
again strong evidence that the low-field half- 
integer plateau (within ±300mT) have an origin 
different from that of the high-field one (4 to 7 T) 
and be likely associate with CMEMs. 
Second, s13 and s23 be measure between 

electrode 1-3 and 2-3 at 20 mK, respectively, 
use the setup show in Fig. 4B. If the TSC 
be a trivial normal metal, the system should 
be equivalent to a QAHI that be directly contact 
with two electrodes. Thus, a typical sxx behavior 
of a QAHI (Fig. 3C) should be observed—i.e., 
both s13 and s23 would exhibit two valley at 
±150 mT (C = 0) and then reach e2/h after the 
magnetization saturates (C = ±1)—as show in 
fig. S5F. However, the measurement (Figs. 4, C 
and D) show four peaks, instead of two valleys, in 
both s13 and s23, coincide with the half-integer 
plateau give by the measurement of s12. The 
height of these peak reach ~0.9 e2/h, very 
close to the quantize value expect from the 
Andreev reflection of a single CMEM (N = ±1) 
(36) (for an elaborate theoretical explanation 
use the Laudauer-Büttiker transport picture, 
see the supplementary text). This result also dem- 

onstrates that superconductivity in the QAHI 
layer be indeed induced owe to the proxim- 
ity effect; otherwise, the observe peak would 
not occur, and the conductance would remain 
small throughout the magnetic field scan. 
The QAHI-superconductor system be real- 

ized a a prototype of the chiral TSC in two 
dimensions; more complex layout could be 
engineer to host the bound state of Majorana 
fermion in solid state and enable their manip- 
ulation. The Majorana fermion mode be pre- 
dicted to be topologically protect and thus may 
become a building block for robust topological 
quantum computing.
