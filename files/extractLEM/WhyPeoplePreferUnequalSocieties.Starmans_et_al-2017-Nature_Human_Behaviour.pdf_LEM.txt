PERSPECTIVE 
PUBLISHED: 7 APRIL 2017 | VOLUME: 1 | ARTICLE NUMBER: 0082 

We live in an age of inequality—or at least in an age of wor-rying about inequality. Pope Francis remark that “ine-quality be the root of social evil”, while President Obama 
call economic inequality “the define challenge of our time”. A 
recent Pew report found that Europeans and Americans judged 
inequality a pose the great threat to the world, beating reli- 
gious and ethnic hatred, pollution, nuclear weapons, and disease 
like AIDS. A majority of respondent in each of the 44 country 
poll say the gap between rich and poor be a big or very big prob- 
lem face their country1. And a new report by Oxfam2 reveal that 
the wealth own by the eight richest people in the world be equiva- 
lent to the wealth own by the poorest 50% of the world, spark 
widespread outrage. 

Academics—from philosophers, economists, and political sci- 
entists to psychologists, archaeologists, and even physicists—are 
also fascinate by the causes, consequences, and extent of eco- 
nomic inequality. This interest be reflect in the extent of attention 
to Thomas Piketty’s book, Capital in the Twenty-First Century3,4, 
and be ground in a grow public and scholarly appreciation of 
the startle extent of economic inequality. Globally, the top 1% of 
the population own 50% of the wealth, and the bottom 70% own 
only 3% of the wealth5. 

Many be particularly concerned about the level of inequality 
in the United States, which have be grow rapidly since the 
1970s6 (see Fig. 1). The Gini coefficient (a measure of inequality 
whereby 0 be perfect equality and 100 be perfect inequality, or one 
person own all the wealth) in the United States be now 85—the 
high of all western nations, and sixth high worldwide among 
country with population over 1 million (refs 6,7). A typical 
American CEO currently make about 354 time a much a a typi- 
cal worker, while just 50 year ago the ratio be 20/18. Although 
the United States have be get richer overall, the vast majority 
of this increase in wealth (over 95%) have go to the top 1% of 
wealthy Americans6. 

The concern that people express about inequality be also found 
in control laboratory studies, which find that a desire for equal 
distribution of good emerges early in human development and 
be apparent in many different cultures9. As such, Frans de Waal 
nicely summarizes a broad consensus across many field when he 
writes: “Robin Hood have it right. Humanity’s deepest wish be to 
spread the wealth.”10 

Why people prefer unequal society 
Christina Starmans*, Mark Sheskin and Paul Bloom 

There be immense concern about economic inequality, both among the scholarly community and in the general public, and 
many insist that equality be an important social goal. However, when people be ask about the ideal distribution of wealth in 
their country, they actually prefer unequal societies. We suggest that these two phenomenon can be reconcile by notice that, 
despite appearance to the contrary, there be no evidence that people be bother by economic inequality itself. Rather, they 
be bother by something that be often confound with inequality: economic unfairness. Drawing upon laboratory studies, 
cross-cultural research, and experiment with baby and young children, we argue that human naturally favour fair distribu- 
tions, not equal ones, and that when fairness and equality clash, people prefer fair inequality over unfair equality. Both psy- 
chological research and decision by policymakers would benefit from more clearly distinguish inequality from unfairness. 

A puzzle arises, however, when we consider a largely separate 
body of research in political psychology and behavioural econom- 
ics: it turn out that when people be ask about the ideal distri- 
bution of wealth in their country, they actually prefer unequal 
societies11. This preference for inequality materializes in a wide 
range of countries12,13, across people on opposite side of the politi- 
cal spectrum11, and even in adolescents14. So, when people be ask 
to distribute resource among a small number of people in a lab 
study, they insist on an exactly equal distribution. But when people 
be ask to distribute resource among a large group of people in 
the actual world, they reject an equal distribution, and prefer a cer- 
tain extent of inequality. How can the strong preference for equality 
found in public policy discussion and laboratory study coincide 
with the preference for societal inequality found in political and 
behavioural economic research? 

We argue here that these two set of finding can be reconcile 
through a surprising empirical claim: when the data be examine 
closely, it turn out that there be no evidence that people be actually 
concerned with economic inequality at all. Rather, they be both- 
ered by something that be often confound with inequality: eco- 
nomic unfairness. 

We should stress that our argument be not that scholar and 
researcher fail to notice the distinction between inequality and

PERSPECTIVE NATURE HUMAN BEHAVIOUR 
unfairness. On the contrary, the scientist we cite below be 
often careful to distinguish equality and fairness in their studies. 
However, researchers, public figures, and the medium often claim 
that people be specifically concerned about inequality of outcome. 
Much political discourse frame the problem in term of grow 
economic inequality, with no reference to fairness concerns. And, 
a we discus immediately below, many experimental study claim 
to have discover ‘inequality aversion’ or ‘egalitarian motives’. 
We leave open the question of whether these researcher intend 
to claim that there be evidence for a specific aversion to inequal- 
ity, above and beyond an aversion to fairness, or whether this be 
just ‘loose talk’. However, to our knowledge, none of these research- 
er have make the specific claim we wish to make here: that there 
be no empirical evidence so far that people have any aversion to 
inequality itself. 

We suggest that the perception that there be a preference for 
equality arises through an undue focus on special circumstances, 
often study in the laboratory, where inequality and unfairness 
coincide. In most situations, however, include those involve 
real-world distribution of wealth, people’s concern about fairness 
lead them to favour unequal distributions. 

An equality bias in the lab 
Anyone look for evidence that people have a natural aversion to 
inequality will find numerous laboratory study that seemingly con- 
firm their view. For example, study have found “a universal desire 
for more equal pay”12, “egalitarian motif in humans”15, “egalitari- 
anism in young children”16, and that “equality trump reciprocity”17. 
A Google Scholar search for “inequality aversion” yield over 10,000 
paper that bear on this topic. 

And, indeed, when subject in laboratory study be ask to 
divide resource among unrelated individuals, they tend to divide 
them equally18,19. If a previous situation have lead to a pre-existing 
inequality, people will divide future resource unequally in order 
to correct or minimize the inequality between others15,17. This bias 
be so powerful that subject sometimes prefer equal outcome in 
which everyone get less overall to unequal outcome where eve- 
ryone get more overall15,20,21. The desire for equality, even at the 
expense of good average consequences, appear in non-monetary 
domain a well. For example, people object to medical interven- 
tions that would save more life overall by reduce cure rate for 
a small group of people and increase cure rate for a large group 
of people22. 

Furthermore, people appear to view the equal distribution of 
resource a a moral good; they express anger toward those who 
benefit from unequal distributions15. This outrage be sufficiently 
strong that subject will pay to punish unequal distributors23. One 
study examine this across 15 diverse culture found that mem- 
bers of all population demonstrate some willingness to adminis- 
ter costly third-party punishment for unequal division of resource 
(costing themselves the equivalent of a half-day’s wage in some 
cases)—although the magnitude of this punishment varied sub- 
stantially across populations24,25. Moreover, people expect others to 
engage in this kind of costly third-party punishment for those that 
make unequal offers23. 

Studies of child between the age of three and eight year find 
a similar equality bias26,16. Three-year-olds divide resource equally 
among third parties27,28, and, although they be typically selfish 
when they themselves be involve in the interaction, even three- 
year-olds report that they should share equally29. 

Six-year-olds show an even strong commitment to equal dis- 
tribution, insist on throw out extra resource rather than 
allow them to be unequally distribute between two absent third 
parties28,30. In one study, six- to eight-year-olds be tasked with 
distribute eraser to two boy who have clean up their room. 
When there be an odd number of erasers, child insist that 

the experimenter should throw the extra eraser in the trash rather 
than establish an unequal division28,31. They respond this way 
even if the recipient would never know that one of them receive 
less, suggest that child weren’t worried about the recipients’ 
feelings, but be oppose to create the inequality even if none of 
the recipient knew about it28. Even more tellingly, child be just 
a likely to reject unequal distribution when they reflect generos- 
ity (the distributor give up all her candy to the receiver) a when 
they reflect selfishness (the distributor kept all the candy for her- 
self). This suggests that the rejection be specifically an aversion to 
inequality, rather than punish selfishness30. 

This bias show up not only in children’s behaviour, but also in 
their evaluation of others. In one study, six- to eight-year-old chil- 
dren be ask who they like better: someone who split four eras- 
er equally between the participant and another child, or someone 
who give all four eraser to the participant. Children report like 
the equal distributor more than someone who give them more than 
the other child32. 

Some suggestive evidence for a similar bias show up in baby 
and toddlers. When twelve-month-old infant saw a puppet distrib- 
ute two item to two other puppets, they look at the scene longer 
when the distributor give both toy to one puppet than when she 
give the puppet one toy each, suggest that they be surprised 
by the unequal distribution33–35. Infants not only expect people to 
equally distribute resources, they also actively prefer those who 
do. After watch two puppet distribute equally or unequally, 
16-month-olds prefer to approach the equal distributor34. 

An inequality bias in the real world 
Given these findings, one might expect that when people be ask 
to distribute resource across a real-world group of people, they 
would choose an equal distribution of resource across all segment 
of society. But they do not. 

A recent study by Norton and Ariely11 receive well-deserved 
medium attention, a it show that people both underestimate the 
amount of inequality in our society and prefer a more egalitar- 
ian society to the one they think they live in. The author describe 
their study a examine “disagreements about the optimal level 
of wealth inequality”, and report the find of “a surprising level 
of consensus: all demographic groups—even those not usually 
associate with wealth redistribution such a Republicans and the 
wealthy—desired a more equal distribution of wealth than the status 
quo”. And an article by Ariely in Atlantic be titled, “Americans want 
to live in a much more equal country (they just don’t realize it)”36. 

These summary be accurate: participant in these study do 
prefer more equality than the current situation. But the result also 
suggest that they be not particularly worried about large inequali- 
ties. Instead, these subject claimed that, in the perfect society, indi- 
viduals in the top 20% should have more than three time a much 
money a individual in the bottom 20% (see Fig. 2). And when they 
be give a force choice between equal and unequal distribution 
of wealth, and told to assume that they would be randomly assign 
to be anyone from the richest to the poorest person (that is, a ‘veil of 
ignorance’37), over half of the subject explicitly reject the option 
of an equal distribution of wealth, prefer inequality11. Thus, 
the data suggest that when it come to real-world distribution of 
wealth, people have a preference for a certain amount of inequality. 

This preference for inequality materializes in 16 other coun- 
tries12,13, across people on both the left and right of the political 
spectrum11, and in teenagers14. As Norton38 put it, “people exhibit a 
desire for unequality—not too equal, but not too unequal”. 

Indeed, these data might underestimate people’s preference for 
unequal distributions. One follow-up study39 contrast Norton 
and Ariely’s question about the percentage of wealth that should 
correspond to each quintile of the American population with a 
question about what the average wealth should be in each quintile.

PERSPECTIVENATURE HUMAN BEHAVIOUR 

The former question result in an ideal ratio of poorest to wealthi- 
est of about 1/4, but for the latter question the ratio jumped to 1/50. 
When the connection between the two question be explain to 
participants, a majority chose the high inequality ratio a reflect- 
ing their actual belief for both measures. 

Fairness in the lab 
How can this preference for inequality in the real world be rec- 
onciled with the strong preference for equality found in labora- 
tory studies? We suggest that this discrepancy arises because the 
laboratory finding review above—which report the discovery of 
egalitarian motives, a desire for more equality, or inequality aver- 
sion—do not in fact provide evidence that an aversion to inequality 
be drive the preference for equal distribution. Instead, these find- 
ings be all consistent with both a preference for equality and with a 
preference for fairness, because the study be design so that the 
equal outcome be also the fair one. This be because the recipient be 
indistinguishable with regard to consideration such a need and 
merit. Hence, whether subject be sensitive to fairness or to equal- 
ity, they will be inclined to distribute the good equally. 

This idea be support by numerous studies, include follow- 
ups of the experiment described above, by the same researchers, in 
which fairness be carefully distinguish from equality. These stud- 
y find that people choose fairness over equality. For example, in 
the study in which child have to award eraser to two boy who 
have clean up their room and chose to throw out the extra eraser, 
both boy be described a have do a good job. But when 
child be told that one boy do more work than the other, they 
award the extra eraser to the hard worker28,40. In fact, when one 
recipient have do more work, six-year-olds believe that he or she 
should receive more resources, even if equal pay be an option26,41–43. 
Likewise, although infant prefer equality in a neutral circumstance, 
they expect an experimenter to distribute reward preferentially to 
individual who have do more work35. 

This preference for inequality be not restrict to situation where 
one person have do more work, but also extends to reward peo- 
ple who previously act helpfully or unhelpfully. When three-year- 
old witness a puppet help another puppet climb a slide or reach 
a toy, they late allocate more resource to the helpful puppet than 
to a puppet that push another down the slide, or hit him on the 
head with the toy44. 

As a final twist, consider a situation with two individuals, identi- 
cal in all relevant regards, where one get 10 dollar and the other 
get nothing. This be plainly unequal, but be it fair? It can be, if the 
allocation be random. Adults consider it fair to use impartial pro- 
cedures such a coin flip and lottery when distribute many 
different kind of resources45. Children have similar views. In the 

erasers-for-room-cleaning study described above, if child be 
give a fair ‘spinner’ to randomly choose who get the extra eraser, 
they be happy to create inequality46. One person get two eras- 
er and another get one (or ten and zero for that matter) can be 
entirely fair and acceptable, although it be clearly not equal. 

Fairness in the real world 
It follows, then, that if one believe that (a) people in the real world 
exhibit variation in effort, ability, moral deservingness, and so on, 
and (b) a fair system take these consideration into account, then 
a preference for fairness will dictate that one should prefer unequal 
outcome in actual societies. The ideal distribution of wealth pro- 
pose by participant in the Norton and Ariely study, then, may 
reflect how fairness preference interact with intuition about the 
extent to which such trait vary in the population. 

Tyler47 us a related argument to explain why there be not a 
strong degree of public outrage in the face of economic inequality. 
He argues that Americans regard the American market system to 
be a fair procedure for wealth allocation, and, accordingly, believe 
strongly in the possibility of social mobility (see Box 1). On this 
view, then, people’s discontent about the current social situation will 
be good predict by their belief about the unfairness of wealth 
allocation than by their belief about inequality. 

We have argue that a preference for fair outcome be early 
emerge and universal. But it be also clear that people differ in their 
intuition a to which resource should be distribute on the basis of 
merit. Most Americans now believe that a fair system be one in which 
every adult get a vote, but this be a relatively modern intuition. In 
our own time, there be controversy over whether fairness dictate that 
everyone should have equal access to health care and high educa- 
tion. Put differently, there be some disagreement over what should be 
a right, held equally and unchanged by any sort of variation in merit. 

There be also political and cultural differences. Norton and 
Ariely11 found that women, Democrats, and the poor desire rela- 
tively more equal distribution than men, Republicans, and the 
wealthy, and be also more accurate in estimate the extent of 
current inequality. Or consider that a recent survey of wealthy tech- 
nology entrepreneur in Silicon Valley found that all predict that 
a strict meritocracy, where everyone’s income be strictly propor- 
tional to their productivity, would result in an extremely unequal 
society, with the top 10% earn more than 50% of the nation’s 
wealth48. This intuition be probably considerably more extreme than 
one would find in a more typical sample. Looking outside of the 
United States and Europe, it be clear that there be wide difference 
in fairness concern across world cultures25,49–52. 

Finally, there be developmental differences. While even the 
young infant test show some sensitivity to fairness over

PERSPECTIVE NATURE HUMAN BEHAVIOUR 

equality35, young child may place a great emphasis on an 
equality ‘heuristic’ than do old children53–55. Indeed, the relative 
weight of various factor that can justify inequality—such a 
luck, effort, and skill—develops even through adolescence56. 

Why fairness be central 
We be hardly the first to posit a universal moral concern with 
fairness. For instance, fairness be claimed to be one of the univer- 
sal foundation of morality by scholar work in moral founda- 
tion theory52,57, and have be argue by many developmental and 
comparative psychologist to be a universal and unlearned human 
capacity10,58. The universality of this concern raise the question of 
it evolutionary history. 

Under one analysis, a desire for fairness—such a fair distribu- 
tion of food to the member of a group—can be see a a prosocial 
motivation, evolve to constrain our natural selfishness. A propen- 
sity to favour fair distribution be sometimes see a arise because 
it benefit the group, a proposal developed in the context of cultural 
group selection59 and, more controversially, genetic group selec- 
tion60,61; see ref 62,63 for critical discussions. But a sensitivity to fair- 
ness might also benefit individuals, consistent with a more standard 
evolutionary approach. For example, fairness may serve a a signal 
of impartiality, avoid the problem of signal favouritism to 
one coalition over another64,65. 

But these analysis don’t provide an explanation for why a pro- 
pensity toward and sensitivity to fairness would emerge, a oppose 
to a presumably simpler equality bias. One proposal be that fairness 
intuition be root in adaptation for differentially respond to 
the prosocial and antisocial action of others. For cooperation and 

prosociality to evolve, there have to be some solution to the problem 
of free-riders, cheaters, and bad actors. The usual explanation for 
this be that we have evolve a propensity to make bad behaviour 
costly and good behaviour beneficial, through punishment and 
reward66,67. That is, we respond differently to individual base on 
what one can see a their ‘deservingness’—responses that be pre- 
sent even in infants68. It’s possible that fairness intuition more gen- 
erally develop from this moral foundation. 

A related proposal focus on shun selfish individuals, rather 
than punish them. When individual can choose the people 
with whom they interact for mutually beneficial tasks, cooperative 
individual gain benefit from be include and selfish individu- 
al lose out on those benefit by be shunned69,70. But individual 
who be too cooperative—too generous—run the risk of be take 
advantage of by others71. So a balance must be struck. To treat every- 
one equally would entail penalization of more productive individu- 
al when they collaborate with less productive individual relative 
to highly productive individuals. In contrast with equality, fairness 
allows individual with different level of productivity to share the 
benefit of their collaboration proportionately72. This focus on fair- 
ness be particularly important for human (compared with even our 
closest evolutionary relatives), due to the critical importance of col- 
laboration in human hunt and foraging73. 

Conclusions and future direction 
Here we have explore the notion that, contrary to appearances, 
people be not troubled by inequality for it own sake; indeed, they 
often prefer unequal distributions, both in laboratory condition 
and in the real world. What really trouble people about the world 

In addition to concern about the unfairness of an equal distribu- 
tion, people might have other motivation for prefer an une- 
qual distribution of wealth in their society. Here we consider two 
such motivation more closely: a selfish desire to have more than 
others, and a belief that inequality be necessary to allow for mobility. 

Selfishness 
One consideration underlie an inequality preference have lit- 
tle to do with an abstract desire for fairness, but instead reflect 
a desire to have more than others. Obviously people have selfish 
motivations, but what be interest here be that these desire be 
not always for increase one’s absolute amount, but be often for 
increase one’s stand relative to others78–80. For example, stud- 
y of income and happiness have reveal that, once a basic level 
of wealth be achieved, relative wealth be more important for overall 
happiness81–83. Similarly, a vast body of research in social psychol- 
ogy find that people engage in constant comparison of themselves 
with others84,85. Knowing that one’s income be much high (or 
lower) than that of a neighbour have a substantial impact on hap- 
piness80. As Gore Vidal put it, “every time a friend succeed I die 
a little”. 

This motivation for relative advantage can motivate a desire for 
unequal distributions. Indeed, to achieve the warm glow associ- 
ated with relative advantage, people be even willing to pay a cost 
themselves to reduce others’ incomes86. Even young child show 
this relative advantage-seeking behaviour. Five-year-olds often 
reject equal payouts of two prize token for themselves and two 
prize token for another child, and choose instead only one token 
for themselves, if that mean that the other child will get none87. 
That is, the inequality associate with relative advantage be so 
appeal that it override both a desire for fairness and a desire 
for absolute gain. 

Motivation and mobility 
A further motivation for inequality may come from the idea that 
inequality be necessary to motivate industriousness and allow for 
social mobility. For example, Norton38 argues that people prefer 
inequality because they see it a a motivate force that lead peo- 
ple to work harder and better, know that do so can improve 
their station in life, and that of their children. 

This belief entail a sort of meritocratic mobility, and, indeed, 
such mobility be a necessary condition for an unequal society to 
be a fair one. After all, a society lack mobility be a society in 
which those born into poverty remain in poverty, regardless of 
their hard work and ingenuity. Hence, unless people view merit 
a be entirely heritable, fairness require mobility. Not surpris- 
ingly, then, a belief in meritocratic mobility be associate with more 
tolerance for inequality, a reflect in less discomfort with exist 
wealth inequality, less support for the redistribution of educational 
resources, and less willingness to support raise tax on the rich88. 

From this perspective, cultural difference in expectation 
about mobility may account for difference in tolerance of ine- 
quality across cultures. For example, Americans might have an 
unreasonable tolerance for inequality in part because they tend to 
overestimate the extent of mobility in the United States77, which be 
in fact low than in place like Canada and most of Europe89–92. 
One reason for this lack of mobility be that the income distribution 
in the United States—the distance between the poorest and richest 
citizens—is much great than in rival countries. Moving from the 
tenth percentile to the ninetieth percentile in Denmark require a 
US$45,000 increase in income, but make the same jump in the 
United States would require an increase of US$93,000 (ref. 93). And 
the situation be not improving—while 92% of American child 
born in 1940 would go on to earn more than their parents, only 
50% of child born in 1980 have do so94.

we live in today be consideration that be related to inequality (see 
Box 2), such a adverse social consequences, a corrosion of demo- 
cratic ideals, poverty, and, of most interest to u here, unfairness. 

Indeed, we believe that there be no evidence so far that child 
or adult posse any general aversion to inequality. A related case 
against a focus on equality have be make recently by Frankfurt74, 
who argues on normative ground that people shouldn’t care about 
reduce inequality. What really matters, he argues, be that every- 
one have a sufficient amount to live a decent life. Frankfurt acknowl- 
edge that a focus on improve the situation of the most needy may 
reduce inequality a a side effect, but argues that this reduction be 
not, in itself, a moral good. 

Our own argument against a focus on inequality be a psychologi- 
cal one. In this paper we have outline a wealth of empirical evi- 
dence suggest that people don’t care about reduce inequality 
per se. Rather, people have an aversion toward unfairness, and under 
certain special circumstance this lead them to reject unequal dis- 
tributions. In other conditions, include those involve real-world 
distribution of wealth, it lead them to favour unequal distribu- 
tions. In the current economic environment in the United States and 
other wealthy nations, concern about fairness happen to lead to 
a preference for reduce the current level of inequality. However, 
in various other society across the world and across history (for 
example, when face with the communist ideal of the former 
USSR), concern about fairness lead to anger about too much equal- 
ity. To understand these opposite drives, one need to focus not on 
whether the system result in a relatively equal or unequal distribu- 
tion of wealth, but whether it be view a fair. 

Of course, it may be that there really be a preference for equal 
outcome that exists above and beyond a preference for fair out- 
comes. But to explore this, researcher need to construct study that 
carefully distinguish equality from other related considerations. For 
example, perhaps if a procedure result in too large an inequality, 
people would be motivate to reduce that inequality, even if they 
believe the procedure to be fair and the inequality to have no other 
consequences. This be an empirical question. 

Furthermore, the idea that people’s discontent with the current 
distribution of wealth have to do with fairness, rather than inequal- 
ity itself, open up a wealth of new question about which factor 
(for example, hard work, skill, need, morality) be psychologically 
relevant for fair distributions. In particular, the developmental tra- 
jectory of concern for these different factor be largely unexplored, 
include question relate to how child determine which fac- 
tor be relevant to resource distribution (for example, effort, need, 

and so on) and which be not (for example, height). Emphasizing 
the role of fairness intuition in population-level distribution prefer- 
ences also raise some interest and under-explored psychological 
question relate to how people perceive the exist distribution 
of factor such a merit, skill, and deservingness in their societies. 

What about practical implications? As with most psychological 
claim of this sort, our proposal has, at best, indirect implication 
for public policy. Even if the average individual desire a somewhat 
unequal society, one might argue that people be mistaken in what 
they want. Perhaps people would actually be good off in a perfectly 
equal society—they just don’t know it. Also, even if it be assume that 
people be correct in their desire for a society with some economic 
diversity (but not a much a we currently have), this doesn’t tell u 
how to achieve such a society. It’s perfectly coherent to be in favour 
of reduce inequality, but against certain plan for redistribution75. 

We do see two implication of this work, however. 
First, it’s clear that many people be misinform about how 

well their society match their ideals. They be wrong about how 
much inequality there is, believe the current situation to be much 
more equal than it actually is11–12,39, but see ref. 76. Furthermore, 
Americans have exaggerated view about the extent of social mobil- 
ity in the United States77, and thus the extent to which the current 
American market system be a fair procedure for wealth allocation. 
We have argue that view about fairness will be most predictive of 
discontent with economic inequality, and thus public education on 
the actual current rate of mobility will help to ensure that people’s

While concern about fairness, along with other considera- 
tions, may motivate a preference for inequality, there are, of 
course, various countervail psychological force that lead to 
an equality preference. One of these force be a worry about the 
consequence of an unequal society. That is, even if people have 
no problem with inequality itself, it might have negative conse- 
quences that people be motivate to avoid. 

For one thing, a inequality increases, self-reported happiness 
diminishes, especially among the bottom 40% of income earn- 
ers95. One reason for this be that relative disadvantage have a large 
negative impact on well-being than relative advantage have a posi- 
tive impact96. When people know where they stand in the overall 
income distribution, those on the low end of the scale report 
less job satisfaction, but those on the high end of the scale do 
not report any great satisfaction97. This have negative effect for 
productivity too: worker who know they be on the low side of 
the distribution decrease their effort, but know that one be on 
the high end do not lead to an increase in effort98. 

Still, a Tyler47 point out, it be not clear whether the corrosive 
effect of inequality on happiness be due to inequality per se, or 
due to the perception of unfair inequality. That is, it be an open 
question whether people who get less than others would suffer 
decrease in happiness and productivity if they believe that 
they be in a fair system, one in which increase effort on their 
part could lead to social mobility. 

Nevertheless, inequality in a society also predicts a great 
degree of violence, obesity, teenage pregnancy, and interpersonal 
distrust99. Areas of the United States with high income inequal- 
ity also tend to have high divorce and bankruptcy rate than 
area with more egalitarian income distributions100 and they suf- 
fer from high homicide rates101. Similar negative effect show 
up in laboratory study with simulated public good game in 
which the extent of inequality be set by the researchers—when 
the inequity be make salient, there be less cooperation and 
inter-connectedness102.

moral assessment of the world that they live in be ground in the 
relevant facts. 

Second, a Frankfurt74 point out, contemporary political dis- 
course often blur together various concern that should be thought 
of a distinct. Worries about inequality be conflate with worry 
about poverty, an erosion of basic rights, and—as we have focus 
on here—unfairness. If it’s true that inequality in itself isn’t really 
what be bother people, then we might be good off by more 
carefully pull apart these concerns, and shift the focus to 
the problem that matter to u more. The recognition that fairness 
and equality be different cannot merely be a footnote on empirical 
study and cannot be a rarely invoked piece of trivia in political 
conversation that wrestle with unfairness but frame the conversa- 
tion in term of equality. Progress in the lab and in the real world 
will be facilitate by centre the discussion on exactly what peo- 
ple do care about—fairness—and not on what people do not care 
about—equality.
