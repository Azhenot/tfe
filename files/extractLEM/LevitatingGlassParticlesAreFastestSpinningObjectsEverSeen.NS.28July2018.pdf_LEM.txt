TINY glass particle spun by a laser be the fast spin object we have ever seen. 

Two team have use circularly polarise light to set charge particle in motion. As this light travels, it spin 
and can impart rotational energy to matter. 

René Reimann at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich and team trap a silicon dioxide 
particle in a polarise laser. Drag from air particle be remove by lower the pressure, let the silicon 
dioxide spin more than 1 billion time a second (arxiv.org/abs/1803.11160). 

Tongcang Li at Purdue University, Indiana, lead another team do similar work. They also use glass 
nanoparticles, but two stuck together for strength. He and his team measure them rotate at 1.3 gigahertz, 
or 1.3 billion time a second (arxiv.org/abs/1804.06570).

These rotate particle may help u detect quantum friction – drag create by photon blinking in and out of 
existence – and tell u more about the origin of the cosmos: spin particle may be the source of gigahertz 
signal in the cosmic microwave background left by the big bang.
