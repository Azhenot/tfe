Empirical Research Paper 

Names matter. At least Demetria Guynes, Steveland Judkins, 
Archibald Leach, and Marion Morrison thought so. Readers 
of this article will probably good know them a Demi 
Moore, Stevie Wonder, Cary Grant, and John Wayne. And 
early in the year 2016, opponent of Donald Trump’s candi- 
dacy for president of the United States, base on their belief 
that it would undermine his popularity, make an effort to 
publicize the original version of his surname (changed centu- 
ries ago by his ancestors): “Drumpf.” Concerns with name 
and whether they should be change be certainly not 
restrict to celebrities. In 2011, approximately 58,000 peo- 
ple in the United Kingdom have their name legally change 
(McClatchey, 2011). 

Evidence for the idea that personal name matter—that is, 
that they have effect on how people be perceive and treat 
by others—is more than anecdotal (for review of the empiri- 
cal literature, see Christopher, 1998; Joubert, 1993; Lawson, 
1984). For example, Harari and McDavid (1973) found that 
identical essay receive significantly different grade from 
teacher depend on whether they be attribute to chil- 
dren with what be at the time popular, evaluatively favor- 
able name (e.g., “Karen,” “Lisa”), or to child with less 
desirable name (e.g., “Bertha,” “Adelle”). In a study by 
Garwood, Sulzer, Levine, Cox, and Kaplan (1983), partici- 
pants’ decision about whether people described in vignette 
should be reward or punish be significantly affected 
by the desirability of those people’s names. Bruning and Husa 
(1972) found that even elementary school student have 

different behavioral expectation for people a a function of 
whether they have name with “active” (e.g., “Otto,” “Bruno”) 
or “passive” (e.g., “Alfred,” “Milton”) connotations. And 
research by Topolinski, Maschmann, Pecher, and Winkielman 
(2014) indicates that subtle difference in the movement of 
the tongue and lip a one articulates a person’s name can 
influence one’s attitude toward that person. 

Names and their connotation thus matter for people in 
their daily interaction (and even long-term outcomes; see 
Anderson & Schmitt, 1990; Zwebner, Sellier, Rosenfeld, 
Goldenberg, & Mayo, 2017). But they be also an issue of 
concern for experimental psychologists. Social psycholo- 
gist (and other behavioral scientists—see Evans et al., 2015; 
Hughes, 1998; O’Dell, Crafter, de Abreu, & Cline, 2012) 
often test their hypothesis by construct vignette (usually, 
but not always, written) depict people possess charac- 
teristics and engage in behavior design to operationalize 
variable of interest to them. Very often the people described

Abstract 
Psychologists often test hypothesis by construct vignette depict people engage in behavior and display 
characteristic design to operationalize specific variables. People described in these vignette be typically give names, but 
name have a variety of connotation that could lead to unwanted variance between condition of an experiment and in other 
way have implication for the result of a study. An up-to-date source of information to help guide the selection of name 
would be useful for researchers. Participants from four different region of the United States rat a large sample of name in 
term of perceive age, warmth, and competence. The full set of name be presented, along with some simple demonstration 
study concretely illustrate the implication of name choice.

in these vignette be give names; if the vignette involves 
more than one character, do so be especially important so 
that research participant can more easily follow the narra- 
tive. These name can be select at random, or for idiosyn- 
cratic reasons. A researcher present a story about a person 
engage in a series of evaluatively ambiguous behavior for 
the purpose of test trait prim effect might name the 
protagonist “Donald” (Higgins, Rholes, & Jones, 1977; Srull 
& Wyer, 1979). Another researcher interested in the biasing 
effect of stereotype on memory might give the central 
character in the vignette present to participant the name 
“Betty” (Snyder & Uranowitz, 1978). The first author of this 
article once create a series of vignette populate entirely 
with the name of his graduate school classmate (Newman, 
Duff, & Baumeister, 1997, Appendices A and B). 

However, the specific name select for character in 
vignette could have implication for the result of one’s 
studies. Researchers, of course, know this intuitively. For 
example, their vignette rarely if ever include highly 
unusual, low frequency names. In addition, unless an inves- 
tigation focus specifically on stereotyping, prejudice, or 
discrimination, name strongly associate with specific 
national, ethnic, or racial group (e.g., “Carlos Ramirez”— 
Bodenhausen & Wyer, 1985) be also avoided. Such intu- 
itions be well-founded. Perhaps the most well-known 
empirical demonstration of the consequence of name selec- 
tion be Kasof’s (1993) analysis of the material use in 
hundred of study of sexism. He found a tendency to select 
“male name that be more attractive, more youthful, and 
more intellectually competent in their connotation than 
be the female name with which researcher contrast 
them” (p. 148). For example, of the 340 study he reviewed, 
there be 204 case in which a “younger” male name be 
pair with an “older” female name; the number of time 
that an old male name be pair with a young female 
name be 15. In addition, these name bias systemati- 
cally covaried with the outcome of such studies. Overall, 
the name confounds Kasof (1993) reveal threaten the 
internal validity of not just individual study but an entire 
program of research. 

Other line of research could be prone to similar threat to 
validity, such a those consist of correspondence audit 
study (e.g., Bertrand & Mullainathan, 2014; Gaddis, 2015, 
2017; Pager, 2007). Such study might involve send 
almost-identical job application to multiple employers, 
vary only in the name of the applicants. Manipulations of 
the names’ gender, ethnicity, and race could also be con- 
found with those names’ other connotations. 

Kasof’s (1993) article include more than a critical analy- 
si of prior research. He also make a contribution to subse- 
quent research by present a set of age-matched name 
along with data on those names’ perceive attractiveness and 
competence (see his Appendix B and Tables 4 and 5). Kasof 
suggest that researcher could consult his list of name 
when design their own studies. By carefully select 

name from among those he provided, one could perhaps 
avoid the confounds that plague sexism research. 

Quite a few researcher have utilized Kasof’s name 
data—and they continue to do so (e.g., Brown & Diekman, 
2013; Gerhardstein & Anderson, 2010; Greitemeyer, 2009; 
Rosette & Tost, 2010; Ruthig & Holfeld, 2016; Schneider, 
2014; Uhlmann & Zhu, 2014; Weine, Kim, & Lincoln, 2016). 
Note, though, that Kasof’s norm be establish close to 
25 year ago; he himself point out that “because of histori- 
cal variation in forename attractiveness and connotation, the 
name pair that survive this statistical selection will surely 
become mismatch at some future time” (p. 153). Hence, 
continued use of Kasof’s name for experimental vignette 
would seem to be in violation of the spirit of his work. In 
fact, close inspection of the specific name and how they 
be classify reveals many of them to be quite outdated. 
The name “Linda,” for example, be say to be a “younger 
adult” name. A search of Syracuse University’s online direc- 
tory (on March 2, 2017) reveal only five undergraduate 
woman with that name, compare with 28 faculty and staff 
members. Similarly, only four undergraduate student have 
the first name “Gary” (also classify a “younger adult” by 
Kasof), compare with 23 faculty and staff members. By 
way of comparison, a search of the directory reveal 28 
undergraduate woman with the name “Kelsey,” compare 
with one solitary staff member. And although the online 
directory reveal that there be just one faculty member at 
the institution with the first name “Dylan,” after listing 50 
Dylans from among the students, it could only display the 
follow message: “The maximum number of result 
allow have be exceeded. Please refine your search.” 

It be the nature of such norm to become outdated. As just 
one more example, although Kasof (1993) identify the 
name “Anne” a be an “older adult” name, 30 year ear- 
lier, most research participant in a study by Sheppard (1963) 
assume that Anne be a young woman. Thus, the primary 
goal of this article be to provide an up to date and extensive 
database of name and their connotations. As already noted, 
Kasof (1993) focus not just on age associate with first 
name but also on how the name be rat in term of 
competence and attractiveness. The current investigation 
also include perception of competence. But give the 
major role that the dimension of competence and warmth 
have played and continue to play in research and theory in 
the area of impression formation (see Fiske, Cuddy, & Glick, 
2007; Judd, James-Hawkins, Yzerbyt, & Kashima, 2005; 
Rosenberg, Nelson, & Vivekananthan, 1968), we measure 
perception of warmth rather than general attractiveness. 

A strength of this study be that participant be recruit 
from four different geographical region of the United States. 
The purpose of this data collection plan be to help ensure 
that our result would not just reflect local idiosyncrasy (cf. 
Buchanan & Bruning, 1971, who publish an early list of 
name connotation base entirely on a sample of participant 
from Ohio). 



Newman et al. 3 

A second goal of the article be to provide evidence for the 
validity of the name norm by provide some simple empir- 
ical demonstration of the consequence of use name that 
vary along the measure dimensions. Study 2 provide that 
evidence. 

Study 1 

Method 

Participants. Participants (n = 497) be recruit in late 
2015 and early 2016 from four different study sites. One 
hundred thirty-four college student be recruit from 
Syracuse University (in the Northeastern United States), 154 
from Mississippi State University (in the South), 71 from 
Dominican University (the Midwest), and 138 from Cerritos 
College (the West Coast). Students volunteer or receive 
course credit for their participation at each respective site. 

Materials. Names be extract from the Social Security 
database for our use (https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/baby- 
names). All the name in the database be from Social Secu- 
rity card application for birth that occur in the United 
States between 1879 and the end of February 2015 (exclud- 
ing people born before 1937 who never apply for a Social 
Security card, and those who apply without indicate the 
place of birth). 

For the purpose of the current research, we assembled, 
from the Social Security database, name of people born in 
the six decade between the 1950s (1950-1959) and the 
aught (2000-2009). This range cover name of people who 
would now be a old a 67 or so year of age and a young a 
8 year old. Using the rank information provide by the 
Social Security website,1 we identify the top 200 most pop- 
ular name for each decade (the Top 200 list). Then, to select 
a manageable number of name in a systematic way (and to 
include both relatively common and relatively uncommon 
names), we identify the top 20 most common male and 
female names, and also name with position number 91 to 
110 and 181 to 200 in the Top 200 list for each decade. As a 
result, we be left with 120 representative name from the 
Top 200 list (60 male name and 60 female names) for each 
of the six decades. 

Because the popularity of some name remain some- 
what consistent across the six decades, a number of name 
overlap across the six lists. For example, “William” be 
ranked 6, 7, 9, 15, 18, 10, respectively, in each of the six 
decades. When combine the six list of 120 popular names, 
we retain only one copy of each name that appear in one 
or more of our lists. This procedure yield a list of 485 
uniquely spell name (233 male name and 252 female 
names). In this list, there be a number of case of alternate 
spelling of name that, in the judgment of the authors, would 
not have be consider by participant to be distinct in any 
meaningful way (e.g., “Isabel” vs. “Isabelle,” “Jeffery” vs. 

“Jeffrey,” “Nichole” vs. “Nicole”). We retain only one 
form of spell for the study in such cases. 

The final list consist of 200 male name and 200 female 
names. To reduce the burden place on our participant 
(while also try to ensure that all name would be rat an 
approximately equal number of times), these name be 
then randomly divide within gender into four list of 50 
names.2 Each participant be randomly assign to receive 
one of the set of 50 male name and one of the set of 50 
female name (100 name total per participant).3 

Procedure. The study be run use Qualtrics software, and 
participant complete the study online. Participants be 
ask to complete three rating task for the 100 name pre- 
sented to them. They provide rating of perceive age (How 
old do you think he or she is?), competence (How competent 
do you think he or she is?), and warmth (How warm do you 
think he or she is?) for those names. Participants always pro- 
vided age rating for all the name first; the order of the com- 
petence and warmth rating be then randomize between 
participants. Names for each rating task be grouped by 
gender, so that participant rat name for one gender first, 
and then for the other gender. Whether a participant receive 
male or female name first be randomized. 

Age rating task. Participants be ask to “Imagine that you 
be about to meet FEMALE (or MALE, for the male names) 
individual with the follow names. How old do you think 
she (or he) be when you see the name? Please rate her (or 
him) in term of age. If you feel uncertain, please use your 
intuition and make your best guess.” For each name, partici- 
pant be ask “How old do you think he or she is?” Par- 
ticipants be ask to provide rating on the follow 
9-point scale: <12, 12 to 17, 18 to 24, 25 to 34, 35 to 44, 45 
to 54, 55 to 64, 65 to 74, >75. For a give participant, the 
order in which the name be present be randomized, so 
that no one participant receive the name in the same order. 

Competence and warmth rating task. After participant com- 
pleted the age rating task, they provide rating of compe- 
tence and warmth for the names. First, the concept of 
“Competence” and “Warmth” be define for them. Partici- 
pant be present with the follow information: 

According to research on person perception (Fiske, Cuddy, & 
Glick, 2006), when people form impression of others, they 
usually evaluate them in term of two fundamental dimensions: 
competence and warmth. The competence dimension include 
trait such a clever, competent, creative, efficient, foresighted, 
ingenious, intelligent and knowledgeable. The warmth 
dimension include trait such a popular, honest, humorous, 
fair, generous, helpful, righteous, sincere, and tolerant. 

Participants then begin either the competence or warmth 
task, depend on the randomize order. For the competence 
rating task, participant be ask to “Imagine that you be

about to meet FEMALE (or MALE, for the male names) indi- 
viduals with the follow names. How competent do you 
think she be when you see the name? Please rate her in term of 
competence. Again, the competence dimension include trait 
such a clever, competent, creative, efficient, foresighted, 
ingenious, intelligent, and knowledgeable. If you feel uncer- 
tain, please use your intuition and make your best guess.” For 
each name, participant be ask “How competent do you 
think she or he is?” Under each question, we remind partici- 
pant of competence’s meaning by restate that “Competence 
= clever, competent, creative, efficient, foresighted, ingenious, 
intelligent, and knowledgeable.” Participants rat compe- 
tence on a 5-point scale range from 1 = not at all to 5 = 
extremely. Like the age rating task, the order in which a give 
participant rat the name be randomized. 

The procedure for the warmth rating task be identical, 
but participant be ask to “Imagine that you be about to 
meet FEMALE (or MALE) individual with the follow 
names. How warm do you think he be when you see the 
name? Please rate him in term of warmth. Again, the warmth 
dimension include trait such a popular, honest, humorous, 
fair, generous, helpful, righteous, sincere, and tolerant. If you 
feel uncertain, please use your intuition and make your best 
guess.” For each of the rating question, participant be 
remind that “Warmth = popular, honest, humorous, fair, 
generous, helpful, righteous, sincere, and tolerant.” 

Results and Discussion 

Participants with 10 or more miss value (n = 39, less than 
8% of participants) be drop from analysis so a to 
exclude participant who might not have be put suffi- 
cient effort into the (admittedly laborious) rating task. In 
addition, for 11 participants, there be no variance on one or 
more of the judgment tasks. They be also drop from 
analyses, leave a final sample of 447 participants. 

Mixed-effects model be apply to the data use the 
PROC MIXED procedure in the SAS software package.4 The 
simultaneous nest of age/warmth/comp (Y 

ijk 
) response 

within both raters and target name result in a cross-classified 
data structure described by the follow Level 1 (response- 
level) equation: 

Y rijk jk ijk= +β0 , 

in which rating i provide by rater j evaluate name k be 
comprise of an intercept term that varies across both raters 
and name targets, in addition to a Level 1 residual rijk . Based 
on the standard “slopes a outcomes” formulation (see 
Raudenbush & Bryk, 2001), we decompose the Level 1 
intercept term into it constituent fix and random compo- 
nents, a described by the follow Level 2 equation: 

β γ γ0 00 01 0 0jk j ku u= + + +×maletarget , 

where γ 
00 

be the fix component of the intercept, which due 
to our use of an effect-coding scheme for gender (1 = female, 
–1 = male) corresponds to the grand mean rating of Y (age, 
warmth, or competence) across all observations. γ 

01 
repre- 

sent the average difference between male and female name 
ratings, average across all raters. Finally, u 

0j 
and u0k repre- 

sent the subject-specific random effect (deviations) for rater 
j and target k. More specifically, the u 

0j 
term be rater specific, 

in the sense that every participant provide his or her own 
rating represent the participant’s deviation from the grand 
mean (in addition to the fixed-effect of target gender). For 
instance, participant with positive deviation rat all of 
their name a older, warmer, and more competent, averag- 
ing across all names. On the contrary, the u 

0k 
term be name 

target specific, in the sense that every name target have it 
own rating score represent it deviation from the grand 
mean. Names with positive deviation suggest that those 
name be rat older, warmer, and more competent, aver- 
age across all raters. These subject-specific deviation be 
typically summarize a variance ( τ00j 

2 
, τ00k 
2 ), along with the 

variance of the aforementioned Level 1 residual (σ2), which 
when combine will equal (within rounding) the observe 
marginal variance of all rating Y 

ijk 
. 

Estimated average rating of each name (E-B estimates) 
be then calculate base on the follow equation: 

EB maletarget= + +×γ γ00 01 0u k . 

These estimate mean rating (see Table 1) take into account 
the disagreement between raters (and do not differ substan- 
tially from the raw mean ratings). 

Reliability. The goal of the initial analysis be to determine 
whether or not participant be able to make the age, 
warmth, and competence judgment with a reasonable degree 
of reliability. Reliability in the current study take the form 
of a consensus or agreement estimate (see Kenny, 1994, for 
a thorough discussion). According to generalizability theory 
(Cronbach, Gleser, Nanda, & Rajaratnam, 1972; see Raykov 
& Marcoulides, 2010, Chapter 9 for a parallel explanation), 
consensus (reliability of target ratings) be compute use 
the follow formula:

, 

which describes the proportion of total variance in rating 
that be attributable to consensus across participant- 
raters regard the attribute of specific name targets. In the 
present data, we found moderate consensus across raters 
regard age, ρ = 0.31, but low consensus across raters 
regard competence, ρ = 0.05, and warmth, ρ = 0.04. 

To provide other evidence for the meaningfulness of the 
ratings, agreement across the four different data collection

site (the Northeast, Midwest, South, and West coast) be 
assess take a different analytical approach. Within 
each of the four set of names, pairwise correlation be 
compute for each of the three different rating (with indi- 
vidual name a the unit of analysis). For age ratings, these 
correlation between site range from r = .80 to r = .92, 
with a mean of .88 (calculated after Fisher’s r to z transfor- 
mations, and convert back to r). For competence ratings, 
the range be r = .44 to r = .75, with a mean of .58, while 
for warmth ratings, it be r = .40 to r = .69, with a mean of 
.54.5 Parallel analysis run separately for male and female 
name reveal correlation similar to those found for both 
gender combined. 

In addition, to provide another estimate of reliability, 
split-half correlation be computed. Within each of the 
four set of names, participant be randomly assign to 
two groups, and mean for the three rating be calculate 
for each group. For the age rating of the names, correlation 
range from r = .96 to r = .98. For competence ratings, the 
range be r = .71 to r = .86, while for warmth ratings, it be 
r = .73 to r = .83. 

Thus, the fact that consensus on warmth and competence 
be quite limited should not undermine the ratings’ utility. 
The mean present in Table 1 can still serve a a guide to 
how different name will, on average, be perceive in term 
of those attributes. 

Gender differences. There be a slight tendency for the female 
name (M = 4.21) to be rat young than male name 



Newman et al. 9 

(M = 4.42), β = −0.10, SE = 0.05, t(623) = −1.93, p = .054. 
More pronounce be a gender difference in perceive 
warmth; the mean rating for male name be 3.00, but for 
female names, the correspond figure be 3.12, β = 0.06, 
SE = 0.01, t(400) = 4.53, p < .001 (for a similar finding, see 
Eagly, Mladinic, & Otto, 1991). There were, however, no 
gender difference in rating of perceive age (p = .014) or 
competence (p = .016) for the names. 

Interdimension correlations. As already noted, the full list of 
name be divide into four sets, only one of which be pre- 
sented to any give participant. For initial analysis assess 
the relationship between age, warmth, and competence rat- 
ings, the Set variable be dummy-coded (Cohen, Cohen, 
West, & Aiken, 2003). In none of the hierarchical regression 
run to examine the relationship between the rating dimen- 
sion (after center the continuous variables) be there 
any interaction between predictor variable and the set of 
code variables. Thus, all name be combine into one list 

for an analysis of the interdimension correlations, with 
name a the unit of analysis. 

Consistent with the halo effect (Dion, Berscheid, & 
Walster, 1972; Kaplan, 1974; Thorndike, 1920), warmth 
and competence rating be positively correlated, r = .42, 
p < .001 (see also Suitner & Maass, 2008; Wojciszke & 
Abele, 2008; cf. Imhoff & Koch, 2017; Judd et al., 2005). 
The correlation for male name only (r = .42) and female 
name only (r = .47) be consistent with that relationship. 
Given the positive correlation between the warmth and 
competence dimensions, a number of name be evalu- 
ated similarly on both of them. But a might be expected, 
give the modest size of that correlation, a number of name 
elicit relatively positive rating on one dimension and 
negative rating on the other. Thus, certain names, for dif- 
ferent reasons, can trigger ambivalent reactions. The name 
associate with relatively extreme estimate mean rating 
on both dimension (identified by mean of quintile split 
of the distributions) can be found in Table 2. Consistent 
with cross-cultural gender stereotype (Fiske, 2017), the 
“high-competence, low warmth” pattern be dominate by 
male names, while the “low-competence, high warmth” 
pattern be dominate by female names.6 

Consistent with past research on ageism among college 
student (Nelson, 2005; North & Fiske, 2012), a markedly 
negative correlation between perceive age and warmth 
be found, r = –.50, p < .001. The correlation for male 
name only (r = –.54) and female name only (r = –.45) 
be quite similar. Interestingly, perceive age and compe- 
tence be positively correlated, r = .28, p < .001, and a 
similar relationship be found when male (r = .30) and 
female (r = .26) name be analyze separately. This find- 
ing be arguably consistent with others in the literature 
reveal ambivalent attitude about aging; old people 
be often perceive a be relatively wise and honest, 
despite be negatively evaluate in a more general, global 
way (e.g., Chonody, 2016; Mueller-Johnson, Toglia, 
Sweeney, & Ceci, 2007).7 

Study 2 

The data collect in Study 1 could potentially be of interest 
in and of themselves, but for experimental psychologists, 
they will be of value primarily to the extent that they help 
them control for unwanted variance in their dependent vari- 
ables. The goal of Study 2 be to provide a few straightfor- 
ward example of how the name select by researcher for 
the target of people’s social judgment could meaningfully 
affect those judgments. 

Method 

Participants. All hypothesis be test with t test (with one 
exception, independent-sample tests); assume a d = .3

a sample size of 352 would be adequate for .80 power with a 
p < .05 criterion for statistical significance. Three hundred 
seventy-one college student from Syracuse University par- 
ticipated in Study 2 in exchange for course credit. 

Materials. An online image search yield headshot photo- 
graph of two people (one man, one woman) whose age 
were—in the opinion of the first two author and their 
research assistants—ambiguous (both people could have 
be anywhere from their late 20 to early 50s). We select 
two male name that be rat in Study 1 to be among those 
associate with the old people (“Earl” and “Herbert”) and 
two that be at the other end of the distribution and associ- 
ated with young people (“Dylan” and “Logan”).8 The same 
procedure be follow for female names, result in the 
selection of two “old” name (“Maureen” and “Delores”) 
and two young one (“Abby” and “Isabella”). The rating for 
these eight name were, on average, 1.9 SDs above or below 
the grand mean for perceive age. The picture be pre- 
sented to participant along with a name prominently appear- 
ing at the bottom of the image. To simplify the design (and to 
reduce the possibility that a participant would become suspi- 
cious if present with two name clearly associate with 
much old people), four version of the age rating material 
be prepared with these combination of picture and name 
(in all cases, one “young” and one “old”): Dylan/Maureen, 
Earl/Isabella, Herbert/Abby, and Logan/Delores. The instruc- 
tions to participant be a follows: “Below be photo- 
graph of two people. Please guess how old (in years) each 
one is.” A space be provide for each guess. 

The data collect in Study 1 be also use to select 
name that represent relatively extreme level (both high 
and low) of competence and warmth. For the competence 
rating task, participant be present with a vignette 
describe the behavior of a female protagonist that be 
write to be ambiguous with respect to the intelligence or 
competence it indicate (see the appendix). They be ask 
to provide intelligence and competence rating for the pro- 
tagonist (in that order), whose name varied. Two female 
name that be rat high on competence in Study 
1—“Elizabeth” and “Olivia”—and two that be rat 
low—“Crystal” and “Mercedes”—were select for the 
name manipulation (ratings for these four name were, on 
average, 2.0 SDs above or below the grand mean for per- 
ceived competence). Ratings be make on 5-point scale (1 
= not at all, 2 = slightly, 3 = somewhat, 4 = very, and 5 = 
extremely). 

For the warmth rating task, participant be present 
with a vignette describe the behavior of a male protagonist 
that be ambiguous with respect to the warmth or hostility it 
indicated; it be a modify version of the well-known 
“Donald” paragraph developed by Srull and Wyer (1979) 
and use by subsequent researcher (see the appendix). They 
be ask to provide warmth and hostility rating for the 
protagonist (in that order), whose name varied. Two male 

name that be rat high in warmth in Study 1—“Charlie” 
and “Thomas”—and two that be rat low—“Dominic” 
and “Brett”—were select for the name manipulation (rat- 
ings for these four name were, on average, 1.2 SDs above or 
below the grand mean for perceive warmth). Warmth and 
hostility rating be again make on 5-point scale range 
from not at all to extremely. 

Procedure. Participants receive a booklet that include all 
three tasks. All participant complete the age rating task 
first; whether the booklet they receive present the compe- 
tence or warmth rating task next be randomized. A give 
participant’s booklet include one of the follow pair of 
name for the competence and warmth rating tasks: Mer- 
cedes/Charlie, Crystal/Thomas, Elizabeth/Dominic, or 
Olivia/Brett. Thus, when a participant’s booklet include a 
name expect to elicit relatively high rating of warmth, it 
also include a name expect to elicit relatively low rating 
of competence. Similarly, “hostile” name be pair with 
“competent” names. 

Results 

Age judgments. Given the study design, each participant be 
present with one picture of a person with an “older” name, 
and one with a “younger” name. A paired-samples t test 
reveal that people label with name associate with 
old people be perceive to be significantly old (39.7 
years) than people label with name associate with 
young people (38.6 years), t(370) = 2.19, p = .029, 95% 
confidence interval (CI) = [0.112, 2.109], d = 0.11.9 

Competence/intelligence judgments. Intelligence and compe- 
tence rating be surprisingly uncorrelated, r = .09, p = .10. 
There be also significantly more variance in competence 
(s2 = 0.71) than intelligence (s2 = 0.49) judgments, F(370, 
370) = 1.45, p < .001. Participants might have be uncer- 
tain how to define “competence.” Thus, perceive intelli- 
gence and perceive competence be analyze a separate 
dependent variables. 

When participant read vignette about someone with a 
questionable level of intelligence, they be significantly 
more likely to see her a be intelligent when her name be 
one associate by Study 1 participant with intelligence (M = 
3.49) than when her name be one associate by Study 1 
participant with low level intelligence (M = 3.31), t(369) = 
2.45, p = .013, d = 0.26, 95% CI = [0.038, 0.322]. Although 
the difference be in the same direction, the comparison for 
competence judgment do not reveal a significant difference 
(M = 2.86 vs. M = 2.79, p = .39). 

Warmth/hostility judgments. Warmth and hostility rating be 
negatively correlated, a expect (r = –.24, p < .001). Hostil- 
ity rating be reverse scored; the mean rating for hostility 
and warmth be then average to yield an overall measure 



Newman et al. 11 

of warmth. When participant read vignette about someone 
whose behavior be ambiguous with respect to warmth/hos- 
tility, they saw him a be warmer when his name be one 
associate by Study 1 participant with warmth (M = 2.57) 
than when his name be one associate by Study 1 partici- 
pant with low level of warmth (M = 2.48). However, in this 
case, the difference do not reach conventional level of sta- 
tistical significance, t(369) = 1.35, p = .18, d = 0.14, 95% CI 
= [–0.045, 0.240]. Post hoc rating of warmth and hostility 
judgment separately also do not yield significant difference 
(p = .16 and p = .44, respectively). 

Discussion 

The goal of Study 2 be to provide some preliminary valida- 
tion of the data collect in Study 1 by demonstrate how 
the name select by researcher for the target of people’s 
social judgment could be associate with variation in those 
judgments. The small sample of name use for the stimulus 
person in Study 2 be select simply because they be 
example of name perceive to be associate with young 
and older, warmer and less warm, and competent and less 
competent people. 

The mean difference be in the predict direction for 
all three judgment type (age, intelligence, and warmth) and 
be statistically significant in the case of the first two. The 
difference found be modest in magnitude, but there be no 
reason to assume that Study 2’s finding be representative 
of the effect size that might be associate with name differ- 
ences. Those effect size will undoubtedly vary a a function 
of a number of factors, include the complexity and ambi- 
guity of the other social information present to research 
participants. For example, past research indicates that when 
a great deal of additional information be present along 
with names, name be more likely to have modest effect 
on judgment (O’Sullivan, Chen, Mohapatra, Sigelman, & 
Lewis, 1988; Young, Kennedy, Newhouse, Browne, & 
Thiessen, 1993).10 This could have played a role in the non- 
significant effect for warmth judgment (over and above 
the fact that the warm/cold exemplar be not a extreme 
a be those for the other two dimensions); the vignette 
present for that purpose be over 20% longer than the 
vignette present for intelligence/competence judgments. 

General Discussion 

Experimental design, at the most abstract level, be an exercise 
in variance control. Researchers seek to minimize unwanted 
variance between condition of an experiment, and maximize 
the potential of their independent variable to account for 
variance in their dependent variables. If they be interested in 
the effect of categorize people a male or females, they 
would like to avoid have the conclusion they reach cloud 
by the consequence of have name a particular target per- 
son “Deborah” and another “Duane.” If they be interested in 
the effect on social judgment and impression formation of 

manipulate the kind of behavioral information provide to 
participants, they would prefer that the size of their effect 
not be constrain a a result of have name a target person 
“Marcia” or “Grace.” Kasof (1993), among others, have alert 
experimenter to the consequence of arbitrarily name 
one’s stimulus persons. Thus, the goal of this investigation 
be to provide researcher an extensive and up to date data- 
base of personal name and their connotations. 

The name of stimulus person could also have implica- 
tions for the replicability of research findings. Van Bavel, 
Mende-Siedlecki, Brady, and Reinero (2016) found that the 
replicability of a study be dependent to an extent on the likeli- 
hood that the study a it be originally run be context- 
dependent—that is, whether the procedure and/or material 
have the potential to be construe differently by different 
group of participant a a function of time and place. One of 
the variable that might lead to change in the construal of 
research material could be the name of stimulus persons. 
For example, conduct an exact replication of Higgins, 
Rholes, and Jones’s (1977) and Srull and Wyer’s (1979) clas- 
sic trait prim study from the 1970s would require one to 
name the person engage in the ambiguous behavior pre- 
sented to participant “Donald.” However, a glance at the 
data present in Study 1 suggests that do so today could 
be a mistake; it could lead one to find a bias toward negativ- 
ity in impression formation that overshadows the prim 
effect. The result of previous research could fail to replicate, 
for reason have nothing to do with the validity and reli- 
ability of the effect in the original studies. 

The data present in this article be collect from par- 
ticipants in the United States. The name in Table 1 could of 
course have different connotation elsewhere, include in 
other English speak countries. Another limitation of this 
research be that although a person’s age, warmth, and compe- 
tence be important piece of information for social perceivers, 
other characteristic have an impact on the impression form 
of others, and name could signal people’s stand on some 
of those characteristic too. For example, name can signal 
socioeconomic status (Gaddis, 2015; Joubert, 1994); indeed, it 
be likely that social class inference played a significant role in 
the competence rating make by our participants. Slepian and 
Galinsky (2016) found that how name be pronounced— 
more specifically, the vocal cord vibration involved—has 
implication for perception of people’s genders. Names 
require more vibration of the vocal chord to pronounce be 
associate with males, but those involve unvoiced pho- 
nemes (which require no vibration of the vocal chords) be 
more likely to be associate with females. Names surely signal 
other social characteristic a well. 

Also unaddressed in this article be the possibility that the 
effect of have specific name could interact with other 
characteristic of the people with those names—for example, 
people’s ethnic or racial identities. There be no reason to 
assume that the consequence of assign a give name to a 
Black, White, Asian, Latino, or any other kind of target per- 
son will be identical.

Finally, the data present here will ultimately meet the 
same fate a Kasof’s; they will become outdated. However, 
for the foreseeable future, we hope they will be of value to 
experimenter seek both to avoid confounds in their 
experiment and to maximize the control of unwanted vari- 
ance in their outcome variables. 

Appendix 

Vignettes, Study 2 (With Representative Names) 

Ambiguously intelligent/competent. Crystal be late to the 
office yesterday because she forgot to set her alarm the night 
before. But she get right to work, and be one of the first of 
her colleague to figure out how to use the new software that 
have be instal on everyone’s computers. Unfortunately, 
she have trouble teach anyone else how to use the soft- 
ware—they kept get confuse by her explanations. 

Crystal and one of her colleague then ate lunch together. 
They have to take an extra long lunch break, because the first 
restaurant they go to be closed; Crystal actually knew that 
the place have go out of business, but she have forgotten. 
Because of that, she have to stay at the office extra hour last 
night to get her work completed. She get it done, though, and 
be able to hand it in to her bos just a few minute past the 
time it be due today. Later, Crystal left work 25 min early, 
because she have an appointment to meet up with an online 
date for the first time and do not want to get stuck in traffic. 

Ambiguously warm/hostile. I ran into my old acquaintance 
Brett the other day, and I decide to go over and visit him, 
since by coincidence we take our vacation at the same time. 
Soon after I arrived, a salesman knock at the door, but 
Brett didn’t want to talk to him. He also told me that he be 
not go to pay his rent until the landlord do some repair 
in his apartment. We talk for a while, have lunch, and then 
go out for a ride. We use my car, a Brett’s car have broken 
down that morning, and he told the garage mechanic that he 
would have to go somewhere else if he couldn’t fix his car 
that same day. We go to the park for about an hour and then 
stop at a hardware store. I couldn’t find what I be look- 
ing for, but Brett suggest we walk a few block to another 
store. The Red Cross have set up a stand by the door and ask 
u to donate blood. Brett hate give blood, and he get out 
of it by claim he have diabetes and therefore could not 
donate. By the time we get to the other store, it be closed. It 
be get kind of late, so I take Brett to pick up his car and 
we agree to meet again a soon a possible.

Notes 

1. See https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/babynames/decades/names1950s. 
html 

2. Some of the names—for example, “Chris,” “Robin”—are 
clearly gender neutral, but the instruction ensure that par- 
ticipants knew whether any give name be be rat a a 
male or female name. 

3. Our procedure for assemble a set of name lead u to come 
up with very few that would be uncommon among European 
Americans. However, seventeen name on the final list— 
Aaliyah, Antonio, Cesar, Fernando, Jaden, Jaime, Jalen, Javier, 
Jermaine, Jesus, Jose, Latasha, Latoya, Miguel, Pedro, Sergio, 
and Yesenia—were strongly associate with Latin- or African 
American individuals. Researchers in the United States (for 
whom the norm present in this article would be most rele- 
vant) would be unlikely to select such name for their vignette 
unless they be explicitly attempt to manipulate perceive 
race or ethnicity. Participant judgment about these name 
also raise very important issue that the current study be not 
design to address; no attempt be make to systematically 
select representative set of name associate with specific eth- 
nic or racial groups. Thus, these data be not present in the 
table or include in the analysis report here (although they 
be available upon request). Note that if our procedure have lead 
to the selection of name such a Mingxuan, Yitzhak, Lyudmila, 
or Ahmed, the same consideration would have arisen. 

4. We be grateful for the extraordinarily generous technical 
assistance provide by Robert Wickham with the analysis 
report in this section and their write-up. 

5. All r be associate with p value of less than .001. 
6. Relaxing the criterion a bit (using tertiary splits) allows for 

the identification of Chase, Jesse, Justin, Logan, Riley, and 
Tyler a male name relatively low in perceive competence 
and high in perceive warmth, and Carol, Deborah, Donna, 
Margaret, Maureen, and Mildred a female name relatively 
high in perceive competence and low in perceive warmth. 
Note, however, that the male name tend to be “younger” and 
the female name “older.” 

7. Follow-up analysis reveal no evidence for a curvilinear 
trend; thus, the linear effect do not obscure any tendency 
for competence rating to drop off for name more likely to be 
associate with the old people. 

8. For the rating associate with these and all other name use 
in Study 2, see Table 1. 

9. Inspection of the mean for individual name reveal that 
within gender, the name associate with old people elicit 
mean age judgment that be high than name associate 
with young people with one exception: Earl be see a 
be young than Dylan and Logan. 

10. But not always—cf. Kasof (1993). It be not clear, though, 
what variable moderate the extent to which the quantity and 
complexity of social information will dampen the effect of 
names.
