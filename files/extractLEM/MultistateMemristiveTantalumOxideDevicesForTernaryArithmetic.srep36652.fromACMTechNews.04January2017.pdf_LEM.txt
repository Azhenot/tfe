Redox-based resistive switch random access memory (ReRAM) offer excellent property to 
implement future non-volatile memory arrays. Recently, the capability of two-state ReRAMs to 
implement Boolean logic functionality gain wide interest. Here, we report on seven-states Tantalum 
Oxide Devices, which enable the realization of an intrinsic modular arithmetic use a ternary number 
system. Modular arithmetic, a fundamental system for operating on number within the limit of a 
modulus, be know to mathematician since the day of Euclid and find application in diverse area 
range from e-commerce to musical notations. We demonstrate that multistate device not only 
reduce the storage area consumption drastically, but also enable novel in-memory operations, such a 
compute use high-radix number systems, which could not be implement use two-state devices. 
The use of high radix number system reduces the computational complexity by reduce the number of 
need digits. Thus the number of calculation operation in an addition and the number of logic device 
can be reduced. 

Redox-based resistive switch random access memory (ReRAMs) be consider a one of the most promis- 
ing emerge non-volatile memory technologies1–3. The device can be scale down to 5 nm4,5, offer endurance 
up to 1012 cycles6, 10 year retention7 and fast read/write speed of below 200 ps8. The device be switch to a 
low resistive state (LRS) for a positive SET voltage and switch to the high resistive state for a negative RESET 
voltage. Up to 8 multi-states have be shown9, allow the storage of up to three binary digit in a single cell. 
Additionally ReRAM device offer highly non-linear switch kinetics, i.e. the SET time depends exponentially 
on the pulse amplitude10. Due to abrupt switch event the common approach be to apply an external current 
compliance (CC) to enable multi-level resistance states11. The drawback of this approach be that the final resistance 
be define by the CC, but not by the actual apply pulse amplitudes. However, a direct correlation between pulse 
height and final resistive state be feasible for a gradual RESET process, where a Vstop voltage defines the resistive 
state in advanced valence change mechanism (VCM) devices12,13. In this work, we use optimize Pt/W/TaOx/Pt 
ReRAM devices, offering highly reliable stop-voltage behavior and use the correspond multi-level property 
to implement modular arithmetic operations, a discuss in the result section. 

Modular arithmetic find usage in everyday applications, e.g., quantify a specific clock-time, which wrap 
around after a fix value be reached. A rigorous mathematical framework of modular arithmetic be developed 
by Carl Friedrich Gauss14 by define a congruence relation between integers. Two integers, a and b be say to 
be congruent modulo n, when their difference (a-b) be divisible by n. In this case, n be know to be the modulus 
of this relation.

The property of integer number for a specific modulus, span addition, subtraction and multiplication 
be write a following. 

Given a1 ≡ b1(mod n) and a2 ≡ b2(mod n), we have

Apart from application in mathematics, modular arithmetic play a fundamental role in modern computer 
arithmetic. Here, a ring of integer modulo 2 be term a a Boolean ring and every Boolean ring give rise to 
Boolean algebra, where the ring multiplication be conjunction operator (∧ ) and the ring addition be exclusive 
disjunction operator (∨ ). Furthermore, the idea of secure and fault-tolerant data communication relies on the 
principle of public-key cryptography and error-correcting codes, respectively. Both of these field require effi- 
cient implementation of modular arithmetic. 

Modular arithmetic be also useful for reduce the complexity of standard arithmetic circuits15,16 and be essen- 
tial for building the residue numeral system (RNS). The RNS representation allows overflow-free addition, sub- 
traction and multiplication, thereby enable high degree of parallelism. 

State-of-the-art modular arithmetic circuit in CMOS technology be implement use two-state Boolean 
arithmetic operations, which follow directly from the two-level switch algebra introduce by Shannon17. 
Memristive device be suggest to replace register file in conventional signed-digit adders18 or to be use in 
conjunction with complex quantization circuits19. The current paper report the first implementation of modu- 
lar arithmetic use multi-state ReRAM devices, which be fully crossbar array compatible in conjunction with a 
selector device. So far, most previous memristive circuit study be base on over simplistic memristor models20, 
we hereby use real memristive device fabricate in word structure to verify the propose functionality. It should 
also be note that we perceive no theoretical limit in scale the number of state for memristive devices, thereby, 
opening a new research direction on multi-state storage and compute devices. 

Results 
Device properties. In this work, 5 μ m × 5 μ m Pt/W/TaOx/Pt cross-point device arrange in word structure 
(Fig. 1a) be use to realize the three Trit (trinary digit) modular addition. The device stack 25 nm Pt/ 13 nm 
W/7 nm TaOx/30 nm Pt be depict in Fig 1b. The typical I-V characteristic of this device be show in Fig. 1c. In 
supplementary S1, the I-V characteristic of an 80 nm × 80 nm cross-point device be also shown, highlight the 
scale potential of these devices. During RESET process, the maximum apply voltage |Vstop| defines the final 
resistive state (1.8 V in Fig. 1c). This feature be also present in pulse mode, thus can be implement in memory 
and logic operation for control the multi-level states. 

Figure 2a show the cumulative probability of low resistance state (LRS) and six multi-level resistive states, 
which be obtain for 200 n pulse in the range of Vstop = − 1.50 V to − 2.25 V. Each state be base on 5 device 
with 10 cycles. The inset explains the statistical information of distribution. The tight distribution highlight the 
excellent switch property of this device. In Fig. 2b, the mean value for each of the resistive state R0 to R5 be 
given. 

For the propose arithmetic operation, the input operand be apply to the top (TE) and bottom (BE) electrode, 
respectively. To enable an equidistant voltage stepping, we use a predefined OFFSET voltage (VOFFSET) for each pulse. 
The operand voltage be Vop = 0.00 V to 0.75 V with increment of 0.15 V. The actual pulse apply at the bottom elec- 
trode be therefore VBE = VOFFSET + Vop1 and VTE = − (VOFFSET+ Vop2) for the top electrode. Thus, the overall potential 
difference be Vstop = VTE–VBE = − (2 VOFFSET + Vop1 + Vop2). Since the overall device voltage be always negative, a logic 
operation corresponds to a RESET pulse whose amplitude depends on the actual operands. To show the multi-level 
pulse operation mode, we set VBE = 0.75 V and vary VTE from − 0.75 V to − 1.50 V (Fig. 3a). The result resistance 
be depict in Fig. 3b. Depending on the overall device voltage (Vstop = − 1.50 V to − 2.25 V) six different resistance 
state (R0, R1, R2, R3, R4 and R5) be easily accessible (Fig. 3b). Note that three resistive state would be sufficient 
to represent a ternary numeral system (Trit). This multi-level device property be use for the modular arithmetic 
operation. To enable highly reproducible RESET operation, we always apply a DC SET operation before each pulse 
RESET operation. Note that also nanosecond pulse SET operation be feasible, but not apply in this work. Details 
on the pulse SET operation can be found in Supplementary S2. 

Developed Modular Arithmetic Working Principle. The new developed algorithm calculates the carry 
and sum directly in the ReRAM devices, which store the result until they be read out. Initially, all the device in 
a wordline be initialized, i.e. write to the LRS. Starting from this state the sum bit of significance 0 (s0) can be 
directly calculate in the device of significance 0 while the other device be calculate the first output carry c1. 
The actual sum or carry calculate device be shift for each significance one device to the left. 

In general, for the carry algorithm (Fig. 4a), first the device state of the actual device be read, to check whether 
the input carry cin be 0 or 1. In case of 1, VOFFSET be set to 0.875 V whereas in case of 0, the OFFSET remains 
VOFFSET = 0.75 V. Next, the logic operation be conduct after a SET operation use the evaluate OFFSET. We 
apply VTE = − (VOFFSET + Vop1) to the top electrode and VBE = VOFFSET + Vop2 to the bottom electrode. Finally, the 
resistive state of the device be read and evaluated. To enable a proper modulus operation the ReRAM device have to 
provide 2n state for an n-ary number system. The background be that in a n-ary number system the operand at 
each specific significance be in the range of 0… n-1, i.e., the sum of two operand be at most 2n-1. Since, an input 
carry of 1 may also occur, the totally require number of state per device be 2n. Thus, for a ternary number system 
six state (R0… R5) be required. If the state be R ≤ R2, the output carry cout be 0 and R0 be write back. For R > R2, 
the device be write to R1, i.e. cout = 1. Note that prior to the write back operation, the SET operation be conduct 
to enable a highly control R1 state. In supplementary S4, the require peripheral circuitry be depicted. Note 
that a certain minimum crossbar array size be require to justify the peripheral circuitry overhead. In this respect, 
a suitable selector device be a key component enable large-scale ultra-dense multi-level ReRAM arrays.

Based on the input carry, the final sum can be calculate (Fig. 4b). As for the carry calculation, the require 
level of the VOFFSET (either 0.75 V or 0.875 V) be first evaluated. Next, the operand voltage VTE = − (VOFFSET + Vop1) 
and VBE = VOFFSET + Vop2 be apply after the SET operation. Based on a final readout, the mapping R3 → R0, 
R4 → R1 and R5 → R2 have to be conduct to complete the modulo sum operation. The correspond write back 
operation be do subsequently after the SET operation. 

Since the signal which be apply to the TE be the same in both algorithm, these can be conduct in paral- 
lel on device of different significance. Thus the cycle count can be kept low.

Proof-of-concept. For the proof-of-concept measurement, a two Trit modular addition be selected, add- 
ing the ternary number p = p1p0 and q = q1q0. Since the sum output z = z2z1z0 need three Trit digits, three 
ReRAM device be require for this operation and initialize to LRS firstly. The addition be perform in a 
word-line structure (cf. Fig. 1a). For the exemplary addition, operand 1 be p = 21 (= 7) and operand 2 be q = 22 
(= 8). Note that input 0 corresponds to Vop = 0.00 V, input 1 corresponds to Vop = 0.15 V and input 2 corresponds 
to Vop = 0.30 V, use the early described incremental step of 0.15 V. In Fig. 5a–c, the sequentially obtain 
resistive state be shown. The arrow mark the order of step without show the in between SET-steps. 
The algorithm described in Fig. 4 realizes the follow mathematical modulo sum operation: 
In device z0, the sum operation be conduct directly: 

• z0 = (1 + 2) rem 3 = 0 (s0). 

Note that the function ‘rem’ return the remainder. Starting from LRS, the device be reset (p0 = 1 = > VTE = − 0.9 V 
and q0 = 2 = > VBE = 1.05 V, i.e. − 1.95 V). According to Fig. 2b, this voltage lead to state R3, a can be also see in 
Fig. 5c directly. According to the sum algorithm (Fig. 4b), R3 be finally mapped to R0, see Fig. 5c. 
In device z1, first the carry operation be conducted: 

• z1 = (1 + 2) div 3 = 1 (c1 = 1). 

The function ‘div’ return the floor quotient. Starting from LRS, the device be toggle to R3 state by apply p0 
and q0 to calculate the carry c1. According to the carry algorithm (Fig. 4a), R3 be then mapped to R1, see Fig. 5b. 

Next, the second cell sum Trit be obtain by the follow operation: 

• z1 = (2 + 2 + c1) rem 3 = 2 (s1). 

Since c1 = 1 hold the VOFFSET = 0.875 V be applied, and the access state be R5. According to the sum algorithm 
(Fig. 4b), R5 be then mapped to R2, see Fig. 5b. 

For cell z2 (Fig. 5a), again the carry operation be conduct first: 

• z2 = (1+ 2) div 3 = 1 (c1 = 1). 

Starting from LRS, R1 state be access via R3. 
Since we consider a two Trit addition, the final sum bit equal the carry c2: 

• z2 = (2 + 2 + c1) div 3 = 1 (c2 = s2 = 1). 

According to the carry algorithm (Fig. 4a), R5 be then mapped to R1, see Fig. 5a. 
The final sum be store directly in memory: 

• Sum z = z2 z1 z0 = 120 (= 15). 

In Fig. 6 the schematic of apply operation voltage and correspond state be depicted. The first line 
show the voltage at the common bottom electrode (BE) act a a wordline (WL). The second, fourth and 
sixth line show the voltage apply to the three separate top electrode (VTE2, VTE1, VTE0) act a bitlines (BL) 
while the third, fifth and seventh line represent the resistance state (RTE2, RTE1, RTE0) at each BL. The three back- 
ground color be used. The gray show the LRS after SET. The yellow depicts the logic implementation and the 
blue show the correspond state after the logic implementation. Overall twelve step be presented. Step 1–2 
show the initialize LRS and logic implementation. Step 3–4 depict the correspond resistance state with the

The logic be implement with adjust OFFSEET in Step 8 and the correspond state be show in Step 9. The 
LRS after SET be show in Step 10. Step 11–12 show the logic implementation and the correspond resistance 
states. The state (RTE2, RTE1, RTE0) show in Step 12 and Step 6 depict the final sum store in memory (Sum z = z2

definition (R0 – R5) be show in the Fig. 7. Each combination of p (TE) and q (BE) set the correspond state

Discussion 
We have demonstrate a ternary number system implementation, use multi-states tantalum oxide device in 
word structures. Depending on the available number of resistive states, high order number system can also 
be implement in the same way. For n-ary systems, we would need 2n resistive states, hence further progress 
in ReRAM memory technology will directly enable arithmetic operation use high radix number systems. 

On the other hand, the choice of radix for a number representation can be motivate from the perspective of 
underlie implementation a well a the analysis of radix economy. A quantifiable measure of radix economy 
propose in ref. 21 be a following: 

= ⋅ +⌊ ⌋E b N b N( , ) log ( ) 1 , (3)b 

where, b be the radix and N be the number to be represented. This metric yield E a the most economical 
real-valued radix. It also turn out that the radix value of 3 (ternary) be more economical compare to binary. We 
argue that the above measure do not take the growth of the implementation medium into account. For several 
device technologies, the area requirement grows linearly with the radix size and make the radix implementation 
very tough. However, it be not true for multistate memristive device such a the Pt/W/TaOx/Pt ReRAM, since the 
implementable radix size depends on the number of resistance states. Considering, a k-state device can be realize 
at the same cost of a two-state device, a more appropriate metric would be 

= ⋅ + .⌊ ⌋E b N b 
k 

N( , ) log ( ) 1 (4)b 

Compared to binary arithmetic, an n-ary number representation reduces the space complexity in a logarith- 
mic ratio. Given comparable performance for the base devices, the gain in arithmetic circuits, such as, integer 
addition be also expect to be in logarithmic scale. However, the actual gain will be somehow small due to need 
for good sense amplifier and more control circuitry. 

The present approach be not limited to a specific multistate ReRAM device, but would work for any mem- 
ristive device offering multiple resistance level induced by different stop voltage Vstop. The propose algorithm 
could further be simplify by avoid in between SET operations, however this require ultra-low variance 
ReRAM devices. For the consider ReRAM device only RESET pulse be allow a logic inputs. Appropriate 
SET pulse enable step-by-step decrease of the resistance could be use to implement also subtraction within 
the same device similar to the here show additional operation. 

The present approach be compatible to the passive crossbar array configuration, by integrate a selector 
device to each TaOx junction. The implementation of the arithmetic functionality within the resistive memory 
device use the available multi-resistance level be a highly attractive option for future functionality enhance 
hybrid CMOS/ReRAM chips. This approach enables a reduction of cycle count compare to Boolean logic base 
ReRAM approaches22–25. For example, a recently propose cipher application could be decisively improve use 
multi-level ReRAMs26, enable efficient in-hardware encryption and decryption for future smart devices. The 
energy per operation depends on the device properties, namely switch voltage, multi-level resistive state and 
inherent switch speed and control circuit property such a the apply pulse width. Since the pulse width (t) 
that will be use in real application be much shorter than 200 n (used in study), the final power consumption will 
be reduce further. In summary, low-variance multi-level ReRAM could play a key role for implementation of 
public-key cryptography and error-correcting code in smart devices. 

Conclusion 
Pt/W/TaOx/Pt device enable highly reliable multi states, which can be access reproducibly by pulse of specific 
height, start from a define LRS. By use word and bit line a input for pulses, the resistive multi-levels can 
be use to store and calculate in-memory logic operations. To avoid an overflow in individual devices, a modulus 
arithmetic be implemented, assure the device to be always in a valid 0, 1, 2 (Trit) state. By use a ternary num- 
ber system, the amount of device and cycle can be reduce significantly. In contrast to two-state devices, multi- 
state device provide good radix economy with the option for further scaling. Therefore, establish multi-state 
ReRAM for non-volatile memory open the door to novel storage and in-memory computer arithmetic options. 

Methods 
Device Fabrication. Devices be fabricate for 1 × 3 array with crossbar structure base on 5 × 5 μ m2 sin- 
gle cell size. Three top electrode share single bottom electrode. For the bottom electrode (BE), 5 nm titanium 
(Ti) and 30 nm platinum (Pt) layer be deposit by sputter on top of thermally grown SiO2 layer (430 nm). 
A photolithography and dry etch process be apply to pattern the bottom electrode. And then 7.0 nm-thick 
TaOx be deposit by reactive sputter under process gas mixture of Ar (23%) and oxygen (7%) with the RF 
power of 116W at the chamber pressure of 2.3 × 10−2 mbar. Without break the vacuum, 13 nm tungsten (W) 
ohmic electrode, and 25 nm platinum (Pt) be deposit consecutively. And then top electrode (TE) be pattern 
with a photolithography and a reactive ion etch. A scan electron microscopy of 1 × 3 crossbar array with 
5 × 5 μ m2 size cell be show in Fig. 1a and it correspond cross-sectional structure with tunnel electron 
microscopy be show in Fig. 1b. 

Measurement Set-up. Initially the resistive switch device remain in high resistance state (HRS) and we 
need to apply irreversible form process in order to activate the device before repetitive switch cycle be 
possible. Detailed information be give in supplementary section. During the form process, the resistance state 
of device change from HRS to LRS. In order to change the resistance state from LRS to HRS, a ‘RESET’ process be 
required. In reverse way, a ‘SET’ process convert the HRS to LRS. The DC operation of a single device also know

a current-voltage (I-V) sweep be show in Fig. 1. The voltage sweep be apply only to the top electrode (TE) while 
the bottom electrode be grounded. In order to achieve good control on the resistance state of device with single 
pulse operation, the ‘SET’ process be base on DC operation. However, the other operation such a ‘RESET’ and 
‘read’ use AC pulse operation. For the RESET operation, 200 n pulse width base on full width half maximum 
(FWHM) be apply for switch operation with 40 n rising/falling times. The read operation at 0.1 V us 
120 μ s long pulse in order to verify the each resistance value more accurately, especially HRS values. By apply 
a 0.15 V stepping, seven resistive level can be distinguish in the consider devices. Depending on the actual 
device even more multi-level state be feasible in ReRAM devices. However, due to variability, e.g., induced by 
random telegraph noise27, the maximum number of properly accessible multi-levels be limited.
