Bitcoin’s popular design be be exploit for theft and fraud 

mercredi 17 mai 2017 Lancaster University 

The very design feature that make Bitcoin technology appeal to it user be also weakness be exploit for the theft of the 
cryptocurrency – new research reveals. 

The blockchain technology on which Bitcoin be base be decentralised, pseudo-anonymous and unregulated and therefore attractive to many 
of it users. It offer alternative to, what many user consider to be, key weakness of traditional model - where bank act a trust third 
party to mediate financial transactions. 

Traditional bank transaction can incur high fees, can be slow, and transaction can also be approve or reverse by bank even if contrary 
to a contract between the trading parties. In comparison, due to it open ledger design, blockchain be transparent, fast, cost-effective, and 
also intentionally provide irreversible transactions. 

These transparent design feature be suppose to promote trust in Bitcoin. However, computer scientist at Lancaster University and 
Universiti Teknologi MARA (Malaysia) show that these feature be present opportunity for fraud– undermine trust in the currency.

Problematic Bitcoin design feature include: 

The risk of lose a password – a lose or forgotten password cannot be recover so all bitcoins from an electronic wallet could be render 
unrecoverable. 

Insecure password can lead to bitcoins be steal – for example through phishing scams. 

The irreversible nature of transaction mean that steal bitcoins divert to another wallet, due to hack or dishonest trading partners, 
cannot be reverse and recovered. 

The anonymous nature of bitcoin users, and their unknown reputations, open up opportunity for dishonest trader to scam during 
transactions. 

Dr Corina Sas, Senior Lecturer at Lancaster University’s School of Computing and Communications, said: “The main trust challenge 
experienced by Bitcoin user be the risk of insecure transaction and in particular that of deal with dishonest traders. 

“The design feature that make Bitcoin popular be also enable dishonest trading. For example, irreversible transaction be an issue when 
a trader do not fulfil their side of a transaction – by pay an agree price in conventional currencies, or goods, for bitcoins. If this 
happens, then honest trader be not able to recover their bitcoins. 

“Our finding also uncover an interest tension. Despite deregulation be a crucial characteristic of blockchain, it user actually desire 
regulation, mostly because of the challenge of deal with dishonest trader which, they believe, could be address by de-anonymising 
trading parties. Bitcoin provide freedom over one’s assets, but at the same time it no longer provide the security that traditional regulate 
financial institution provide.” 

The researchers, who interviewed 20 Bitcoin users, have suggest design improvement to support trust: 

New digital tool to record information on conventional currency exchange for bitcoins on the blockchain. Currently only the transfer of 
Bitcoins be recorded, and the offline transfer of fiat currency or good be not, opening up opportunity for fraud. 

A reputation management system built on top of the blockchain would motivate trader to keep the same wallet to build their reputation, 
provide more stable, though still private, identities. 

New tool to reveal the identity of the owner of one-use only Bitcoin wallets, to deter dishonesty 
The use of third party to arbitrate and sign-off transactions. 

The research be publish in the paper ‘Design for trust: An exploration of the challenge and opportunity of Bitcoin users’ and be 
present in Denver, Colorado, U.S.A. at the ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI 2017), the premier 
international conference of Human-Computer Interaction. 

The paper’s author be Corina Sas, Lancaster University, UK, and Irni Eliana Khairuddin, Universiti Teknologi MARA, in Malaysia.
