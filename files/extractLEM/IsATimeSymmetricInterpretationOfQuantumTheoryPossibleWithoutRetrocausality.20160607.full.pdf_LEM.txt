Huw Price have propose an argument that suggests 
a time symmetric ontology for quantum theory 
must necessarily be retrocausal, i.e. it must involve 
influence that travel backwards in time. One of 
Price’s assumption be that the quantum state be 
a state of reality. However, one of the reason 
for explore retrocausality be that it offer the 
potential for evade the consequence of no-go 
theorems, include recent proof of the reality of the 
quantum state. Here, we show that this assumption 
can be replace by a different assumption, call 
λ-mediation, that plausibly hold independently of 
the status of the quantum state. We also reformulate 
the other assumption behind the argument to place 
them in a more general framework and pin down the 
notion of time symmetry involve more precisely. We 
show that our assumption imply a timelike analogue 
of Bell’s local causality criterion and, in do so, 
give a new interpretation of timelike violation of Bell 
inequalities. Namely, they show the impossibility of a 
(non-retrocausal) time symmetric ontology. 

1. Introduction 
Price [1] give an argument to the effect that any time 
symmetric ontology for quantum theory must involve 
retrocausality (influences that travel backwards in time). 
Price’s argument be base on analyse an experiment 
where a single photon be pass through two polarize 
beamsplitters in sequence.

One of Price’s assumptions, which he call Realism,1 be really an assumption of the reality of 
the quantum state. Briefly, he assumes that the usual forwards-evolving polarization vector of a 
photon emerge from a polarize beam splitter be a real physical property of the photon. This be 
an assumption of the reality of the quantum state because the polarization vector be isomorphic 
to the part of the quantum state that describes the polarization degree of freedom. Price us 
this, together with his other assumptions, to argue that there must also be a backwards evolve 
polarization vector come from the second beam splitter that be orient along it measurement 
direction, and hence there be retrocausality. 

The reality of both forward and backwards evolve state imply by Price’s argument 
occurs in the transactional interpretation of quantum theory [2,3] and be reminiscent of the two 
state vector formalism of Aharonov and collaborator [4,5]. Indeed, if we interpret the two state 
vector in the formalism a a description of reality, rather than just a convenient mathematical 
way of re-expressing the prediction of quantum theory in situation of pre- and post-selection, 
then this theory satisfies Price’s assumptions. 

However, one possible response to Price’s argument be to simply deny the reality of the 
quantum state, in favour of the ψ-epistemic view, which say that the quantum state be not a 
physical property of a system, but rather something more akin to a probability distribution, such 
a a Liouville distribution in statistical mechanics. In other words, it describes our knowledge 
about the quantum system rather than be an intrinsic property of an individual system. 
If we do not believe that the forward evolve state vector be a state of reality, then neither 
Price’s argument nor the two state vector formalism provide evidence that we should view 
the backwards evolve state vector a a state of reality. The ψ-epistemic view provide 
natural explanation for many quantum phenomenon that be otherwise puzzling, such a the 
indistinguishability of quantum state and the no-cloning theorem, which have be discuss in 
detail elsewhere [6,7]. Although several recent result [8–20] (see [7] for a review) cast doubt on 
the viability of the ψ-epistemic view, all of these result assume that there be no retrocausality, 
so allow for retrocausality be a potentially appeal way of save the ψ-epistemic view. 
Because of this, it would be preferable not to rule out ψ-epistemic theory a priori when make 
an argument for retrocausality. 

The first aim of this paper be to construct an alternative to Price’s argument, which do not 
assume the reality of the quantum state. This turn out to be possible use a different assumption 
that we call λ-mediation, which plausibly hold independently of the status of the quantum state. 
Briefly, it say that any correlation between a preparation and a measurement make on a system 
should be mediate by the physical property of the system. There be a close parallel between 
the relationship between Price’s argument and ours and the relationship between the Einstein– 
Podolsky–Rosen (EPR) argument and Bell’s theorem. In fact, our assumption imply a timelike 
analogue of Bell’s local causality condition. It be well know that sequence of measurement 
make on the same system can violate Bell inequalities, the significance of which have long 
be debate [21–33]. Our argument provide a new spin on this—temporal Bell violation 
can be view a proof of the impossibility of a time symmetric ontology (unless we allow 
retrocausality). 

The second aim of this paper be to clarify and extend the scope of the other assumption behind 
Price’s argument. Like Bell’s theorem, we be aim for a result that be independent of the detail 
of quantum theory, so that we can say whether or not a give operational theory allows for a time 
symmetric ontology. In order to do this, we have to replace one of Price’s assumptions, which he 
call Discreteness by a broader principle that can be formulate at this level of generality. Doing 
so clarifies the precise notion of time symmetry that be at stake in the argument. 

In particular, an obvious objection to both Price’s and our argument be that unitary evolution 
accord to the Schrödinger equation be time symmetric, in the conventional sense of time 
symmetry of dynamical laws. Therefore, an interpretation like Everett/many-worlds [34–36], 
in which a unitarily evolve quantum state be the entire ontology, be time symmetric without

require retrocausality. The same be true of interpretation that supplement this picture with 
additional variable that also evolve under time symmetric equation of motion, such a de 
Broglie–Bohm (dBB) theory [37–40]. Hence, a direct inference from the conventional notion of 
time symmetry to retrocausality be out of the question. 

In Price’s version of the argument, these theory be rule out by Discreteness. This say that 
if a photon be detect at one of the output port of a polarize beamsplitter then nothing come 
out of the other port of the beamsplitter. This assumption be need so that a photon exit a 
beamsplitter and then be detect can be treat a the time reverse of insert a photon into 
a beamsplitter through a definite port. Everett and dBB violate this assumption because, when a 
photon exit a beamsplitter, there be branch of the quantum state that exit along each of the 
ports. These represent what will become different world in Everett, and they be empty wave 
that do not contain a particle in dBB. 

We also note that there be some tension between the Discreteness and Realism assumptions. 
Realism require that the quantum state of the system should be real while it be travel between 
the two beamsplitters. If this be true, then it would be natural to require that the quantum state 
exit the second beamsplitter should also be real, even though this be not strictly require by 
Realism. However, this would contradict Discreteness. The tension be remove if we allow for ψ- 
epistemic models, since then the branch of the quantum state that exit the port of the beamsplitter 
on which the photon be not detect need not correspond to anything real.2 

In our view, the symmetry between preparation and measurement in quantum theory be 
the main motivation for Discreteness, so we prefer to base our version of the argument on the 
former, a it make it clearer that the argument involves a different notion of time symmetry than 
the conventional one. Discreteness itself would be difficult to formulate at the level of generality 
we be try to achieve in any case. It be know that sequence of quantum experiment 
can be described by a retrodictive formalism [42–45], in which quantum state be associate 
with measurement outcome and be evolve backwards in time to preparations, which be 
in turn described by what we normally think of a ‘measurement’ operators. The symmetry 
in question be that the retrodictive formalism be mathematically identical to the conventional 
predictive formalism, in which quantum state be evolve forward in time from preparation 
to measurement, so every quantum experiment have a kind of time reverse, in which the role 
of the predictive and retrodictive operator be exchanged. A simple example follow from the 
observation that |〈φ |ψ〉|2 = |〈ψ | φ〉|2. Consider two experiments, the first of which consists of 
prepare one state uniformly at random from a complete orthonormal basis {|ψn〉}, and then 
measure in another orthonormal basis {|φm〉}. In the second experiment, the order be reversed, 
so that a state be prepared uniformly at random from {|φm〉} and then measure in the basis 
{|ψn〉}. Because |〈φm |ψn〉|2 = |〈ψn | φm〉|2, the joint probability of obtain |ψn〉 and |φm〉 be the 
same in both experiments. Hence, the predictive probability of obtain |φm〉 give that |ψn〉 be 
prepared in the first experiment be the same a the retrodictive probability of have prepared |φm〉 
give that the measurement outcome be |ψn〉 in the second experiment. Our Time Symmetry 
assumption say that this symmetry, which be a symmetry of the operational prediction of 
quantum theory, should be take seriously a a fundamental symmetry and, therefore, also 
impose at the ontological level. We formulate this assumption rigorously, independently of the 
detail of quantum theory, and base our argument on it. Note that Time Symmetry be different 
from the usual notion of time symmetry of dynamical laws, and neither Everett nor dBB satisfy 
the former. 

Given this, one might question whether Time Symmetry be really necessary. However, our 
assumption do bear a family resemblance to the assumption behind other no-go theorem 
that be often regard a reasonable. In particular, Spekkens’ notion of non-contextuality say 

2In any case, the relevant time symmetry do not require Discreteness. Briefly, if we allow that the vacuum may be represent 
by a probability distribution over more than one ontic state then there be something non-trivial that enters both port of the 
first beamsplitter when we insert the photon along a definite port. Then, have something exit both port of the second 
beamsplitter need not prevent the necessary time symmetry. See [41] for an explanation of quantum interference along these 
lines.

that experimental procedure that be operationally indistinguishable ought to be represent in 
the same way at the ontological level [46]. Time Symmetry could be motivate by a principle 
that extends this to say that a symmetry of the operational prediction ought to also hold at the 
ontological level. Spekkens’ principle be then just the special case where the symmetry be identity 
of operational predictions. While one might quibble about apply this principle to every 
possible symmetry of the operational predictions, some of which may be accidental, it seem 
reasonable to apply it to fundamental symmetries, and time symmetry be pretty fundamental. 
We therefore think that it be surprising that a conventional realist (non-retrocausal) interpretation 
cannot satisfy Time Symmetry and that the fact that Everett and dBB do not be a genuine 
deficiency of those theories. 

The remainder of this paper be structure a follows. In §2, we outline several notion of time 
symmetry and explain how the notion use in this paper differs from the conventional one. 
Section 3 introduces our operational formalism for prepare-and-measure experiments. Section 4 
formally defines our operational notion of time symmetry and show that quantum theory 
satisfies it. Sections 5 and 6 mirror this structure at the ontological level. Section 5 introduces 
our main assumption about realist model of operational theories, include No Retrocausality 
and λ-mediation, and §6 defines our notion of ontological time symmetry. Section 7 explains our 
Time Symmetry assumption, which be that operational time symmetry should be reflect at 
the ontological level. Section 8 contains our main results. Section 8a prof that model satisfy 
our assumption must obey Bell’s local causality condition for timelike experiments. Section 8b 
give a simple example of how quantum theory violates this, and §8c show that there be an 
isomorphism between spacelike and timelike experiments, which allows u to port all exist 
result about violation of bipartite Bell inequality with entangle state to the timelike context. 
In §9, we compare our assumption with Price’s and reformulate the logic of his argument in 
our framework. Section 10 explains why dBB and Everett do not satisfy Time Symmetry, but 
this do not conflict with their dynamical time symmetry. Section 11 discus the relation of 
our main result with Spekkens’ notion of preparation contextuality and discus the relevance 
of experiment that have recently be conduct to test this. In §12, we conclude by discuss 
which assumption ought to be give up in the light of our results. 

2. Time symmetry 
The usual notion of time symmetry use in physic be a symmetry of the dynamics, wherein there 
be a one-to-one correspondence between solution to the equation of motion and solution to the 
modify equation obtain by replace t with −t. However, this be not the only notion of time 
symmetry worth considering. We start from the more informal idea that time symmetry be the 
inability to tell whether a video of a physical process be run forward or backwards, and note 
that this can be formalize in several different ways. 

First of all, it matter if one really mean an actual video, which can only capture thing that 
be observable, or whether the video be merely a conceptual stand in for a complete record of 
everything that exists. We call the former kind of time symmetry an operational time symmetry and 
the latter an ontological time symmetry. Our argument make use of both kind of time symmetry 
and be base on the assumption that one should take an operational symmetry a evidence for an 
ontological one. We formalize operational time symmetry in §4, after introduce our operational 
formalism in §3, and we formalize ontological time symmetry in §6, after we have introduce the 
ontological framework in §5. 

Second, it make a difference whether one be only interested in whether a give video be possible 
in both time directions, or whether there be a process that make it equally likely in both time 
directions. A smash glass spontaneously reconstitute itself be not impossible accord to the 
law of physics. According to the usual notion of dynamical time symmetry, a spontaneously 
reconstitute glass be a possible solution to the equation of motion whenever an unbroken glass 
smash into piece is. However, a spontaneously reconstitute glass be vastly less likely, give 
the low entropy initial condition of the universe. In the light of this, we can consider a strong

notion of time symmetry in which we also demand that the probability of occurrence should 
be the same in both time directions. This holds, for example, for system that be in thermal 
equilibrium. It be this strong notion of time symmetry that we will be consider here. Of 
course, the universe a a whole do not display such time symmetry, and we will not be assume 
that it does. However, it be possible to construct experiment that have this time-symmetry at the 
operational level. Our main assumption will be that, if this be the case, the same symmetry ought 
to hold at the ontological level a well. 

3. Operational formalism 
We will be discuss experiment consist of three stages, a preparation P, a transformation 
T and a measurement M (figure 1). Each preparation and measurement have an input, which be 
under the control of the experimenter, and an output, which they do not directly control, i.e. 
the output may be correlate with the inputs, but the experimenter do not have any further 
control over the output other than via choose the inputs. As an example, in Price’s argument, 
both the preparation and measurement device be polarize beam splitter and, in both cases, 
the input be the choice of angle at which to orient the beamsplitter. For the measurement, the 
output be which output port of the beamsplitter the photon be detect on. For the preparation, the 
output be the choice of which input port to insert the photon into the beamsplitter from. Note here 
that our distinction between input and output should be thought of a the distinction between 
control and uncontrolled variable and do not necessarily represent the order in which 
thing happen to the photon. The photon be insert into the input port before it encounter 
the beamsplitter orient at a certain angle. Nonetheless, the angle be our ‘input’ and the port 
be our ‘output’ because the former be control by the experimenter and the latter be not. The 
choice of input port be in principle controllable by the experimenter but, in the specific set-up 
use by Price, it be not actually control by them, but rather by a third party, which Price call 
the ‘demon of the left’. For this reason, it be important not to think of the input a consist of 
everything that be in principle controllable by the experimenter and the output a everything 
that be in principle uncontrollable, but rather the input be the variable that they actually control 
and the output be variable that they do not actually control, even if some of them be in 
principle controllable. To make the argument work, it be necessary to place constraint on what 
the experimenter controls. We shall return to the reason and justification for this in §4. 

Although, in Price’s argument, the output of the preparation represent something that 
happens to the photon before the input, it be important to note that the input be always chosen 
before the output. The experimenter decides how to orient the beamsplitter and then the ‘demon 
of the left’ chooses on which port to insert the photon. In general, we should think of preparation 
and measurement a black-box devices, which have a set switch that allows the experimenter 
to choose the input and a pointer or screen that subsequently display the output. Regardless of 
what be happen inside the black box, the operational act of choose the input always happens 
before the output be displayed, so, in a non-retrocausal theory, the input can causally influence the 
output but not vice versa. 

The final piece of the set-up be the transformation, which just represent the dynamic of 
the system between preparation and measurement. In Price’s example, this be trivial a the

polarization degree of freedom do not evolve a it pass between the two beamsplitters, but 
we will consider what happens when dynamics, which may include decoherence and loss to 
the environment, be add to the picture. 

An operational theory specifies a set P of possible preparations, a set M of possible 
measurement and a set T of possible transformations. In general, a theory may include different 
type of systems, e.g. in quantum theory we have photons, atoms, etc., that have different degree 
of freedom and be described by Hilbert space of differ dimensionality. Therefore, not every 
preparation, transformation and measurement need be compatible with one another, e.g. it do 
not make sense to use a device for measure the energy of an atom to measure the polarization 
of a photon. We call a triple (P, M, T) of preparation, measurement and transformation that be 
compatible with each other an experiment. For every experiment (P, M, T), the operational theory 
must also specify a prediction of the probability of the output variable of P and M, give the 
choice of input variables. We write these probability a pPMT(a, b | x, y), where x be the input of P 
and a be it output, and y be the input of M and b be it output. 

For example, in quantum theory, a preparation P be associate with a Hilbert space HA, a set 
of (unnormalized) density operator {ρaA|x} on HA—one for each choice of x and a—such that the 
ensemble average density operator ρA|x = 

∑ 
a ρaA|x be normalize Tr(ρA|x) = 1. The preparation 

procedure start with the experimenter choose x. The preparation device then generates a 
classical variable a with probability distribution p(a | x) = Tr(ρaA|x), output a and prepares the 
system in the correspond (normalized) state ρaA|x/p(a | x), which be subsequently fed into the 
transformation device. 

A measurement M be described by a set {Eb|yB} of positive operator-valued measure (POVMs) 
on a Hilbert space HB—one POVM for each choice of y. This mean that for each (y, b), Eb|yB be a 
positive operator, and for all y, 

∑ 
b Eb|yB = IB, where IB be the identity operator on HB. 

A transformation be described by a completely positive, trace-preserving (CPT) map E from the 
density operator on the input Hilbert space Hin to the density operator on the output Hilbert 
space Hout. We allow Hin and Hout to differ because the transformation may involve discard 
part of the system into the environment or add ancillas. 

A triple (P, M, T) be an experiment only if Hin =HA and Hout =HB, in which case we write the 
CP-map a EB|A. 

For such an experiment, by the Born rule, quantum theory predicts the probability 

pPMT(a, b | x, y) = Tr(Eb|yBEB|A(ρaA|x)). (3.1) 

4. Operational time symmetry 
Definition 4.1. An experiment (P, M, T) have an operational time reverse if there exists another 

experiment (P′, M′, T′), where P′ have the same set of input and output a M, M′ have the same set 
of input and output a P, and 

pP′M′T′ (b, a | y, x) = pPMT(a, b | x, y) (4.1) 
An operational theory have operational time symmetry if every experiment have an operational 

time reverse. 

For each run of an experiment, consider a record of the input and output of the preparation 
and measurement (x, a, y, b). The experiment be repeat an arbitrarily large number of time with 
each choice of input and the record be present to a third party, without tell them what the 
preparation, measurement and transformation actually is. We also give them the same record 
with the order of preparation and measurement variable reverse (y, b, x, a). If, know the 
theory, they cannot tell which be the true record and which be the reverse one, then the theory 
have operational time symmetry. 

One might think that input and output also ought to be swap in the reverse record. 
However, recall that our notion of input and output do not directly relate to time ordering, but 
be rather to do with control versus uncontrolled variables. For a preparation, all variable be

in principle controllable, so the specification of which variable be input and which be output 
be fairly arbitrary at this stage. However, we shall be particularly interested in experiment in 
which the experimenter have the same degree of control over a measurement a they do over a 
preparation, in which case the distinction between control and uncontrolled variable will be 
the same in both the true record and the time reverse one. 

Note that, we be not assume that every experiment ought to have an operational time 
reverse. At this point, it be just a definition. In fact, it would be unnatural to impose this for the 
simple reason that it be possible to send a signal forward in time, but not backwards in time. 
Formally, we expect an operational theory to satisfy∑ 

b 

pPMT(a, b | x, y) = 
∑ 

b 

pPMT(a, b | x, y′), (4.2) 

for all y and y′, so that the output of the preparation cannot be use to infer any information about 
the input of the measurement, but there be no reason why the output of the measurement should 
not contain information about the input of the preparation, so we do not expect∑ 

a 
pPMT(a, b | x, y) =

pPMT(a, b | x′, y), (4.3) 

to hold in general for x �= x′. If it do not hold, then equation (4.2) prevents the experiment from 
have an operational time reverse. 

However, we do not believe that the lack of operational time symmetry be a fundamental 
asymmetry of physics, but be rather a consequence of the thermodynamic arrow of time. 
Specifically, an operational description of an experiment is, by definition, a description of the 
experiment from the point of view of the experimenter. The experimenter have a subjective arrow 
of time. This mean that she can remember the past but not the future, and also that her past seem 
fix but her future seem open and unpredictable. It be usually thought that the subjective arrow 
of time be a consequence of the thermodynamic arrow because both memory and control consume 
a supply of external low entropy systems. For example, turn a knob from an initially unknown 
position to a definite set be an erasure process, which increase entropy by Landauer’s 
principle [47]. 

Because of this, an experimenter typically have more control over the preparation than the 
measurement, but there be reason to believe that this be an emergent, rather than fundamental, 
asymmetry. Hypothetically, if it be possible for the experimenter to have a subjective arrow 
of time point in the opposite direction to the arrow of time use to describe the rest of the 
experiment, then presumably they would be able to control the measurement outcome to the 
same degree that we can control the preparation. 

In order to identify the fundamental operational time symmetries, we want to factor out this 
emergent asymmetry in some way. One way of do this would be to simulate full control over 
the measurement outcome by allow post-selection. Although we could do thing this way, 
post-selection significantly complicates the analysis. For our purposes, it be sufficient to instead 
restrict the experimenter’s control over the preparation procedure, so that she cannot send signal 
forward in time. Doing this play the same role a the ‘demon of the left’ in Price’s argument. 

Definition 4.2. A preparation P be no-signalling if, for all M ∈M and T ∈ T such that (P, M, T) be 
an experiment, ∑ 

a 
pPMT(a, b | x, y) = 

∑ 
a 

pPMT(a, b | x′, y), (4.4) 

for all x and x′. 
PNS denotes the set of all no-signalling preparation in an operational theory. The no-signalling 

sector of an operational theory be the operational theory in which P be restrict to PNS. 
Note that the no-signalling sector of an operational theory need not be operationally time 

symmetric. However, it be in both quantum theory and classical probability theory. This be 
therefore a non-trivial time symmetry that our present physical law obey, which be different from 
the conventional notion of time symmetric dynamical laws.

Theorem 4.3. The no-signalling sector of quantum theory be operationally time symmetric. 

Proof. First, note that a quantum preparation be no-signalling iff the ensemble average state 
be the same for all inputs, otherwise there would be a measurement that predicts different 
probability for different preparation inputs. Therefore, we can define ρA = ρA|x, which be 
independent of x. 

Given an experiment (P, M, T), where P be no-signalling, we have to define an operational 
time reverse (P′, M′, T′) that predicts the same probabilities. To do this, we make use of quantum 
version of Bayes’ rule, a described in [45]. 

Specifically, let ρaA|x be the state associate with P, let Eb|yB be the POVM element associate 
with M and let EB|A be the CPT map associate with T. We first define the POVM element Ea|xA 
associate with M′ via 

Ea|xA = ρ−1/2A ρaA|xρ 
−1/2 
A . (4.5) 

This should be understood a an equation on the subspace supp(ρA) of HA, so that ρA have a well- 
define inverse. It be easy to check that these operator be positive and 

∑ 
a Ea|xA = Isupp(ρA). If we 

want HA to be the Hilbert space associate with M′, then the operator Ea|xA may be extend 
by add an arbitrary POVM on the orthogonal subspace to them. Alternatively, we can just let 
supp(ρA) to be the Hilbert space of M′. 

Next, it be convenient to define the ensemble average state at the output of the transformation 
a ρB = EB|A(ρA). Then, we can define the state associate with P′ a 

ρbB|y = ρ1/2B Eb|yBρ 
1/2 
B . (4.6) 

It be easy to check that these operator be positive and 
∑ 

b ρbB|y = ρB, so the ensemble average be 
a normalize density operator. 

Finally, we define the CPT map associate with T′ a 

EA|B( · ) = ρ1/2A E†B|A(ρ 
−1/2 
B ( · )ρ 

−1/2 
B )ρ 

1/2 
A , (4.7) 

where E†B|A be the adjoint of EB|A, i.e. the unique map that satisfies Tr(MAE 
† 
B|A(NB)) = 

Tr(NBEB|A(MA)) for all operator MA on HA and all operator NB on HB. The map EA|B should 
be understood a a map from density operator on supp(ρB) to density operator on HA, and we 
can extend it to HB arbitrarily if necessary. The Choi–Jamiołkowski isomorphism [48,49] can be 
use to verify that this be a well-defined CPT map, a be do in [45]. 

With these definitions, it be straightforward to verify that 

pP′M′T′ (b, a | y, x) = Tr(Ea|xAEA|B(ρbB|y)) 
= Tr(Eb|yBEB|A(ρaA|x)) = pPMT(a, b | x, y), 

a required. � 

5. Ontological formalism 
So far, we have only be discuss the operational prediction of a theory. We now wish to 
consider the possibility that the system have some real physical property between preparation 
and measurement that be responsible for mediate any correlation between the two. 

There be a standard framework for discuss this, know a the ontological model framework 
[50]. We think that this be a well-motivated framework, but because the ontological model 
framework implicitly assumes that there be no retrocausality, and the necessity of retrocausality be 
precisely the point at issue, we will break thing down into four more primitive assumptions, so 
that the role of the no retrocausality assumption can be see more clearly. This will also facilitate 
a comparison with Price’s assumption in §9. 

We will use influence diagram (a generalization of Bayesian network that allows for decision 
nodes) [51] to illustrate our assumptions, but familiarity with such diagram be not assumed.

Assumption 5.1 (Single-world). Realism: The system have some physical properties, a 
specification of which be call it ontic state, denote λ. Ontic state take value in a (measurable) 
set Λ call the ontic state space.3 

On each run of an experiment, the operational variable (inputs x and y, and output a and 
b) and the ontic state λ each take a definite value. Our uncertainty about these variable can be 
described accord to classical probability theory. 

The idea here be that λ represent property of the system that exist, but may not be 
directly observable. For example, in a classical experiment in statistical mechanics, we may only 
have operational access to variable describe the macrostate; such a pressure, volume and 
temperature; and the ontic state would be the microstate, i.e. a specification of the position 
and momentum of each particle. The idea be that perhaps the way in which we can manipulate 
a quantum system be limited in a similar way. 

The exact ontic state may be unknown to the experimenter, but it be in principle knowable, 
even if we cannot actually construct an experiment that would reveal it. It be for this reason that 
we consider the use of classical probability to be part and parcel of the definition of realism. 
Because λ take a specific value in each run of experiment, you can in principle resolve a bet on 
it value and it have a definite relative frequency in a sequence of runs, so however you prefer to 
interpret probability theory, the standard argument for it use apply. Although it be sometimes 
posit that quantum theory should be understood in term of a non-standard probability theory, 
we have yet to see an interpretation of such a theory that be realist in character. 

Our realism be single world because we assume that the full specification of the ontology 
include definite value for the operational variables, e.g. measurement outcomes. This rule 
out Everett/many-worlds. However, adopt Everett/many-worlds be not actually a way out 
of our no-go theorem because it do not have the kind of time symmetry we be interested in. 
Therefore, it be possible that the argument present here be generalizable to interpretation that 
involve multiple worlds, but we do not know how to do this yet. 

Assumption 5.2. Free Choice: The experiment can be described by a conditional probability 
distribution pPMT(a, b, λ | x, y). We assume that the experimenter be free to choose x and y, however 
they like. 

What we mean by free choice of x and y be that the experimenter can set the probability 
p(x, y) for the input in any way that she likes, so that the joint probability be pPMT(a, b, λ, x, y) = 
pPMT(a, b, λ | x, y)p(x, y). All possible combination of input can be test in a many run a she 
likes.4 In the language of influence diagrams, x and y be decision nodes, represent by square 
in figure 2. In particular, x and y have no direct causes, i.e. no parent in the graph. 

Definition 5.3. Given an experiment (P, M, T), a specification of an ontic state spaceΛ together 
with a conditional probability distribution pPMT(a, b, λ | x, y) be call an ontic extension of the 
experiment. The ontic extension be require to reproduce the prediction of the operational theory 
upon marginalize over λ, i.e. 

∫ 
Λ 

pPMT(a, b, λ | x, y) dλ= pPMT(a, b | x, y). (5.1) 

We denote an ontic extension by (P, M, T,Λ), leave the probability implicit. 
A choice of ontic extension for each experiment in an operational theory be call an ontic 

extension of the theory. 

Realism and Free Choice be assume in the vast majority of work on realist approach to 
quantum theory. We shall, therefore, tend to just assume that experiment have ontic extensions, 
rather than mention these two assumption explicitly. 

3We adopt ‘physicists’ rigour’ and ignore measure-theoretic complication here. They can be handle along the line of the 
treatment in [7]. 
4For this, it be sufficient to choose x and y independently and uniformly at random, a be do in an ideal Bell experiment.

Figure 3. An influence diagram for an ontological model, which be an ontic extension that satisfies No Retrocausality and 
λ-mediation. 

For the remainder of this section, we will concentrate on a single experiment (P, M, T), so we 
will drop the subscript on the probability distributions. 

Assumption 5.4. No Retrocausality: All non-input variable should be conditionally 
independent of input variable in their future, give a specification of all the variable in their 
past. 

The possible causal dependency that be compatible with no retrocausality be illustrate in 
figure 2. Our assumption can be understood a say that p(a, b, λ | x, y) should obey the causal 
Markov condition with respect to this diagram. 

In more detail, a general conditional probability distribution p(a, b, λ | x, y) can be 
decompose a 

p(a, b, λ | x, y) = p(b | a, λ, x, y)p(λ | a, x, y)p(a | x, y). (5.2) 
The No Retrocausality assumption implies that we should have p(a | x, y) = p(a | x) and p(λ | 

a, x, y) = p(λ | a, x). The first of these two condition say that there be no signal from future 
to past, which we expect the operational theory to obey in any case. The second be the more 
substantive assumption, often call measurement independence, and we expect this to be violate 
in a theory with retrocausality. The no retrocausality assumption implies that the probability can 
be decompose a 

p(a, b, λ | x, y) = p(b | a, λ, x, y)p(λ | a, x)p(a | x). (5.3) 
Assumption 5.5. λ-mediation: The ontic state λ mediates any remain correlation between 

the preparation and the measurement, i.e. p(b | a, λ, x, y) = p(b | λ, y).5 

In the language of influence diagrams, the arrow from a and x to b be eliminated, and we be 
left with the causal structure illustrate in figure 3. 

The λ-mediation assumption be really just part of the definition of what we mean by an ontic 
state. The property of the system be suppose to be the cause of the correlation between 
preparation and measurement. If there be other causal link between them, e.g. a telephone 
wire, then we be not really do an experiment on the system alone, but on the system in 

5In fact, our main result can be derive under the weaker assumption that the ontic state λ and the preparation input x 
mediate any remain correlation between the preparation output and the measurement output, i.e. p(b | a, λ, x, y) = p(b | 
λ, x, y). However, we see no good reason to allow a direct causal connection from x to b while disallow a causal connection 
from a to b.

combination with something else. If there be no such links, but we still allow correlation that 
be left unexplained by the ontic state, then we do not really have a realist model. 

Together with No Retrocausality, this assumption implies that the probability can be 
decompose a 

p(a, b, λ | x, y) = p(b | λ, y)p(λ | a, x)p(a | x). (5.4) 

Definition 5.6. An ontic extension of an experiment that satisfies No Retrocausality and 
λ-mediation, i.e. it probability decompose accord to equation (5.4), be call an ontological 
model of the experiment. 

For comparison with other work, note that p(λ | a, x) be usually call the epistemic state of 
the system and p(b | λ, y) be call the response function of the measure device. Normally, when 
prove theorem about realist account of quantum theory, the ontological model framework be 
simply assume at the outset. Here, we see that it be base on several non-trivial assumptions. 

Note that we need to state the No Retrocausality assumption before we could even 
formulate λ-mediation. In a theory with retrocausality, we would want to retain some notion 
that correlation between preparation and measurement be cause by the ontic property of the 
system, but we have no license to infer conditional independency from this if causal loop be 
possible. Therefore, λ-mediation would have to be replace by something else. What this might 
be will be discuss in future work. 

6. Ontological time symmetry 
Our notion of ontological time symmetry can be formulate without assume No Retrocausality 
or λ-mediation. This be fortunate, a it be something we might wish to preserve in a retrocausal 
theory. Nonetheless, it be worth pause to think about the role of λ in an ontological model in 
order to understand how to formulate ontological time reversal. 

For a classical system, λ be often take to be the phase space point occupy by the system, 
but this do not completely pin it down. We could take λ to be the phase space point 
immediately after the preparation, immediately before the measurement, or even let λ(t) be the 
entire trajectory through phase space between preparation and measurement. Given knowledge 
of the transformation T, which in this case be a specification of the Hamiltonian of the system, 
each of these choice be sufficient to screen off the preparation from the measurement. There be 
many other choice besides these, such a specify any part of the phase space trajectory, or 
dispense with phase space entirely and specify the configuration space point at two different 
times. Each of these choice would be equivalent and sufficient for prove our main result, a the 
screen off property be the main requirement. 

Thus, in a general ontological model, we expect there to be multiple equivalent way 
of specify the ontic state. However, they each have different implication for how to 
construct the time reverse of an ontological model. For example, if λ be a specification of the 
property of the system just after the preparation, then it should be thought of a a specification 
just before the measurement when we take the time reverse, and the direction of the momentum 
should be reversed. If it be the entire trajectory, then we also need to reverse the time direction 
of λ(t) when we take the time reverse. In addition, it be conventional to allow other one-to-one 
transformation when we take a time reverse. For example, the usual notion of time reversal in 
quantum theory involves mapping a quantum state |ψ〉 to it complex conjugate |ψ∗〉, so a similar 
transformation of the ontic state should happen in an ontic model in which the quantum state part 
of the ontology. For these reasons, we should not expect that the ontic state λ or even it state space 
Λ be invariant under time reversal. Instead, there should be a one-to-one mapping between the 
λ’s in the two different experiments. 

Although an ontic extension need not be an ontological model, we still want to conceive 
of the ontic state a the same sort of thing in general. Thus, we should allow a one-to-one 
correspondence between λ’s when we take the time reverse of an ontic extension.

Definition 6.1. In an ontic extension of an operational theory, the ontic extension (P, M, T,Λ) of 
an experiment (P, M, T) have an ontological time reverse if there exists another experiment (P′, M′, T′), 
with ontic extension (P′, M′, T′,Λ′), where P′ have the same set of input and output a M, M′ have 
the same set of input and output a P, there exists a one-to-one map f :Λ→Λ′, and 

pP′M′T′ (b, a, f (λ) | y, x) = pPMT(a, b, λ | x, y). (6.1) 
An ontic extension of an operational theory be ontologically time symmetric if every experiment 

have an ontological time reverse. 

Clearly, an ontic extension of an operational theory can only be ontologically time symmetric if 
the operational theory be itself operationally time symmetric, since we can obtain the operational 
prediction just by marginalize over λ. 

Remark 6.2. It be also true, mathematically at least, that if the ontic extension of an experiment 
have an ontological time reverse, then there also exists an extension in which f be the identity. We 
can construct such an extension from an arbitrary one by identify the ontic state space of 
the time reverse pair of experiment and set pP′M′T′ (b, a, λ | x, y) in the new extension to the 
value of pP′M′T′ (b, a, f (λ) | y, x) in the old extension. Physically, these two extension may tell very 
different story about what happens between preparation and measurement, but mathematically 
we can always assume that f be trivial without loss of generality and will do so in what follows. 

7. The time symmetry assumption 
We be now in a position to state our main assumption. 

Assumption 7.1. Time Symmetry: An ontic extension of an operational theory satisfies Time 
Symmetry if, whenever an experiment (P, M, T) have an operational time reverse, the extension 
(P, M, T,Λ) have an ontological time reverse. 

In particular, an ontic extension of an operationally time symmetric theory must be 
ontologically time symmetric. 

The idea of this be that the most natural explanation for an operational time symmetry in a 
theory be that it be a reflection of an ontological time symmetry. Note that an experiment might 
have an operational time reverse for trivial reason if it only record highly coarse-grained 
information about the true ontic state of affairs. For example, suppose that the input of our 
preparation and measurement consist of choose the position of a table in a room and the output 
consist of counting the number of plate on the table. Suppose that all of the transformation we 
can do involve move the table around violently so that some of the plate fall to the ground 
and be smashed. This be a fundamentally time asymmetric theory (at the level of probabilities), 
but the asymmetry might not show up at the operational level if some of the transformation also 
involve bring new plate from the kitchen and place them on the table. We would not expect 
the operational time symmetry of this theory to be reflect in the ontological description, a we 
know that there be plate be smash but none be unsmashed. 

The reason why this example be problematic be that the preparation and measurement that 
we can do be only give u access to highly restrict information about the ontic state. In 
particular, we be not be allow to look at the floor to see if there be any smash plate 
there. The operational time symmetry be an accidental consequence of our restrict access, rather 
than a reflection of a fundamental symmetry. 

However, if the no-signalling sector of an entire physical theory be operationally time 
symmetric then the time symmetry assumption seem much more well founded. Recall that 
restrict to the no-signalling sector be merely design to factor out the subjective arrow of 
time of the experimenter, which we do not believe to be a fundamental asymmetry, but be rather 
a consequence of the thermodynamic arrow. If, after do this, there be absolutely nothing you 
can do to determine the time direction, then this seem like ground for posit a fundamental

time symmetry. It be only in this situation that we want to posit the time symmetry assumption. 
Theorem 4.3 show that this be precisely the situation for quantum theory. 

8. Main result 
In this section, we will be discuss a single experiment and it time reverse, which, due to 
definition 4.1 and 6.1, and remark 6.2, can be take to have the same ontic state space Λ and 
the same probability distribution. For this reason, we can drop the subscript P, M, T on the 
probability distribution. 

(a) Main theorem 
Our main theorem show that an ontological model (i.e. an ontic extension satisfy No 
Retrocausality and λ-mediation) of an experiment that satisfies Time Symmetry must obey a 
temporal analogue of Bell’s local causality condition. 

Theorem 8.1. Let (P, M, T) be an experiment that have an operational time reverse. If it ontic extension 
satisfies No Retrocausality, λ-mediation and Time Symmetry then 

p(a, b, λ | x, y) = p(a | x, λ)p(b | y, λ)p(λ). (8.1) 
To understand the role of λ-mediation, it be helpful to first see what we can prove without it. 

Lemma 8.2. Let (P, M, T) be an experiment that have an operational time reverse. If it ontic extension 
satisfies No Retrocausality and Time Symmetry then 

p(λ | x, y) = p(λ), (8.2) 
p(b | λ, x, y) = p(b | λ, y) (8.3) 

and p(a | λ, x, y) = p(a | λ, x). (8.4) 
Proof. By No Retrocausality, the probability decompose a 

p(a, b, λ | x, y) = p(b | λ, x, a, y)p(λ | a, x)p(a | x). (8.5) 
Using Bayes’ rule, we have 

p(λ | a, x) = p(a | λ, x)p(λ | x) 
p(a | x) . (8.6) 

Substituting this back into equation (8.5) give 

p(a, b, λ | x, y) = p(b | λ, x, a, y)p(a | λ, x)p(λ | x). (8.7) 
Summing over a and b then give p(λ | x, y) = p(λ | x). By Time Symmetry, we also have the 
decomposition 

p(a, b, λ | x, y) = p(a | λ, x, y, b)p(λ | b, y)p(b | y), (8.8) 
and apply the same argument to this give p(λ | x, y) = p(λ | y). We, therefore, have p(λ | x, y) = 
p(λ | x) = p(λ | y), but this mean that it cannot depend on either x or y, so p(λ | x, y) = p(λ). 

Substituting this into equation (8.7) and sum over b give 

p(a, λ | x, y) = p(a | λ, x)p(λ). (8.9) 
Dividing both side by p(λ | x, y), which be equal to p(λ), give 

p(a | λ, x, y) = p(a | λ, x), (8.10) 
a required. Applying the same argument to the time-reversed decomposition will then give 

p(b | λ, x, y) = p(b | λ, y). (8.11)

Proof of theorem 8.1. In the context of a spacelike Bell experiment, equation (8.2) be know a 
measurement independence, and equation (8.3) and (8.4) be know a parameter independence. These 
conditions, together with 

p(b | a, λ, x, y) = p(b | λ, x, y), (8.12) 
which be know a outcome independence, be know to imply Bell’s local causality condition 
[52–54]. However, in the timelike context, equation (8.12) be an instance of λ-mediation. In fact, 
we have the strong condition that p(b | a, λ, x, y) = p(b | λ, y), so this combine with lemma 8.2 
implies equation (8.1). 

For completeness, we repeat the proof that these condition imply local causality here. 
An ontic extension that satisfies No Retrocausality have decomposition 

p(a, b, λ | x, y) = p(b | a, λ, x, y)p(λ | a, x, y)p(a | x). (8.13) 
By the Bayes’ rule argument use in proof of lemma 8.2, we can rewrite this a 

p(a, b, λ | x, y) = p(b | a, λ, x, y)p(a | λ, x, y)p(λ | x). (8.14) 
By measurement independence, we have p(λ | x) = p(λ). By parameter independence, we have 
p(a | λ, x, y) = p(a | λ, x). By outcome independence, we have p(b | a, λ, x, y) = p(b | λ, x, y) and then by 
parameter independence we have p(b | λ, x, y) = p(b | λ, y). Substituting all this into equation (8.14) 
give 

p(a, b, λ | x, y) = p(b | λ, y)p(a | λ, x)p(λ), (8.15) 
a required. � 

(b) Example of a quantum violation 
Equation (8.1) be incompatible with some experiment in the no-signalling sector of quantum 
theory, for the same sort of reason a it be incompatible with Bell inequality violate experiment 
in the spacelike case. In particular, in the case where all the input and output be two-valued 
binary variables, it be well know that (8.1) implies the Clauser–Horne–Shimony–Holt (CHSH) 
inequality [55,56]

(c) General quantum violation 
In general, we would like to determine exactly which experiment in the no-signalling sector 
of quantum theory can have an ontic extension satisfy No Retrocausality, λ-mediation and 
Time Symmetry, and which cannot. Specifically, give an initial ensemble average state ρA, and 
a CPT map EB|A, when can all experiment consist of prepare an ensemble decomposition of 
ρA, apply the transformation EB|A, and measure a POVM on HB, have an ontic extension 
satisfy these assumptions? It turn out that this question be equivalent to ask when a 
bipartite state ρAB on the tensor product HA ⊗ HB admits a local hidden variable theory, which be 
a question that have be study extensively in the literature [57]. 

To see this, we again make use of the formalism described in [45]. Given a channel EB|A, 
we can define a bipartite operator ρB|A on HA ⊗ HB, know a a conditional state, via the 
Choi–Jamiołkowski isomorphism a follows: 

ρB|A = IA ⊗ EB|A′ (|Φ+〉〈Φ+|AA′ ), (8.22) 

where A′ be a system with the same Hilbert space a A, |Φ+〉AA′ = 
∑ 

j |jj〉AA′ and IA be the identity 
superoperator on HA. This be an isomorphism because the action of the CPT map can be recover 
via 

EB|A(MA) = TrA(ρTAB|AMA ⊗ IB), (8.23) 

for any operator MA on HA, and where TA be partial transpose in the |j〉 basis. 
One can then define a bipartite state on HA ⊗ HB via 

ρAB = (ρ1/2A ⊗ IB)ρB|A(ρ 
1/2 
A ⊗ IB). (8.24) 

This state have ρA = TrB(ρAB) a it reduce state, and the action of EB|A on supp(ρA) can be 
recover by invert equation (8.24) and then apply equation (8.23). We can thus consider 
this a an isomorphism between pair (ρA, EB|A) and bipartite state ρAB. Although the action 
of EB|A outside supp(ρA) be not recover by the inverse transformation, it be irrelevant for 
determine the probability for experiment with ensemble average state ρA, so we will get a 
true isomorphism of the experimental probabilities. 

Specifically, for any set of ensemble decomposition of ρA into state ρaA|x and any set of 
POVMs Eb|yB on HB, it be straightforward to check that 

TrB(Eb|yBEB|A(ρaA|x)) = TrB(Ea|xA ⊗ Eb|yBρAB), (8.25) 

where Ea|xA be define in term of ρA and ρaA|x via equation (4.5). We can conversely take any 
POVM on Ea|Ax and invert equation (4.5) to obtain ensemble decompositions. The r.h.s. of this 
equation represent the prediction for local measurement make on the bipartite state ρAB. 
Applied to this experiment, equation (8.1) be just Bell’s local causality in it original context of 
spacelike EPR-type experiments. Thus, a state-CP map pair (ρA, EB|A) admits an ontic extension 
satisfy No Retrocausality, λ-mediation and Time Symmetry exactly when the prediction for 
local measurement on ρAB admit a local hidden variable theory. 

9. Price’s argument 
As give in [1], Price’s argument be base on three assumptions, which he call Realism, Time 
symmetry and Discreteness. There be also unstated background assumptions, which be equivalent 
to our Realism and Free Choice assumptions. Since these be common to both arguments, we will 
leave them implicit in what follows. 

Price summarizes his argument a 

Realism + Time symmetry + Discreteness �⇒ Retrocausality.

................................................... 

To give this a similar logical form to our result, this could be rewrite a 

No Retrocausality + Realism + Time symmetry + Discreteness �⇒ Contradiction 
(with quantum theory) 

As note in §1, Price’s Realism assumption be an assumption of the reality of the quantum state. 
In our terminology, an ontic extension of a quantum experiment be call ψ-ontic if, in the case 
where the state ρaA|x be pure, i.e. ρaA|x = p(a | x)|ψa|x〉〈ψa|x|A, the distribution p(λ | a, x) and p(λ | 
a′x′) have disjoint support whenever |ψa|x〉〈ψa|x| and |ψa′|x′ 〉〈ψa′|x′ | be distinct.6 An extension that 
be not ψ-ontic be call ψ-epistemic. We call the assumption that an extension should be ψ-ontic, 
the ψ-ontology assumption. 

As discuss in §1, Price’s Discreteness assumption be need to argue that a photon exit a 
beamsplitter and then be detect on one of the output port be the time reverse of a photon 
be insert into a beamsplitter along a definite input port. This guarantee that the operational 
time reversal use in Price’s argument can be identify a a true time reverse. His Time symmetry 
assumption be then that this time reverse should be an ontological time reverse a well. In fact, 
Price’s experiment be it own operational time reverse, i.e. P′ = P, M′ = M and T′ = T, so he only 
need to apply the assumption in this case. Note that, if we time reverse the density operator and 
POVMs from the experiment we described in §8b use equation (4.5) and (4.6), we do not obtain 
the same experiment. However, this experiment have more than one operational time reverse 
because we can apply a unitary U to the state and it inverse U† to the POVM element without 
change the operational predictions. By do this, we can rotate the state and measurement 
back to the original ones, and we see that the original experiment be indeed it own operational 
time reverse. Thus, we could restrict the Time Symmetry assumption to experiment that be their 
own time reverse in our argument a well, although we see no good reason for do so. In any 
case, our Time Symmetry assumption play an equivalent role to the conjunction of Discreteness 
and Time symmetry in Price’s argument. 

Replacing Price’s Realism, Discreteness and Time symmetry assumption with our ψ-ontology 
and Time Symmetry assumptions, the logic of Price’s argument becomes 

No Retrocausality + ψ − ontology + Time Symmetry �⇒ Contradiction 
(with quantum theory). 

Note that Price’s argument do not require λ-mediation, but we consider this a more reasonable 
assumption to make than ψ-ontology, since ψ-epistemic retrocausal theory be of interest. In 
fairness to Price, he do point out that retrocausal ψ-epistemic model be possible and give an 
example. However, a explain shortly, withoutψ-ontology, the experiment consider by Price 
also have a non-retrocausal ψ-epistemic model, so his argument be not sufficient to show that such 
model should be retrocausal. 

We can reconstruct the logic of Price’s argument in our framework, with an even simpler 
experiment than he uses. Consider an experiment that have no measurement, i.e. formally the 
input and output variable of the measurement can take only one possible value, so we can drop 
y and b from our probability distribution and represent the ‘measurement’ by the trivial single- 
outcome POVM IB. The preparation have a binary input and output. All that really matter for the 
argument be that the ρaA|x’s be four distinct pure states, but for definiteness we will use a qubit 
and the follow four quantum state 

ρ0A|0 = 12 [0] ρ1A|0 = 12 [π ] (9.1)

ρ0A|1 = 12

By the ψ-ontology assumption, the four probability distribution p(λ | a, x) each have disjoint 
support. This mean that the two distribution p(λ | x) also have disjoint support because 

p(λ | x) = 
∑ 

a 
p(λ | a, x)p(a | x), (9.3) 

so, for a fix x we have a convex combination of two distribution and hence supp(p(λ | x)) = 
∪asupp(p(λ | a, x)), which be disjoint for different value of x. In particular, this mean that λ and 
x be not independent, i.e. p(λ | x) �= p(λ). 

Now consider the operational time reverse of this experiment. By No Retrocausality it ontic 
extension must satisfy p(λ | x) = p(λ) because x be now the measurement input and λ be in it 
causal past. However, by Time Symmetry, these probability must be the same a in the original 
experiment, so we have a contradiction. 

The intuition behind this argument be that if the quantum state be real in the original 
experiment, in the sense of disjoint support for the p(λ | a, x)’s, then the p(λ | a, x)’s must still have 
disjoint support in the ontological time reverse. This implies that the retrodictive states, evolve 
backwards from the measurement to the preparation, must also be real, which contradicts No 
Retrocausality. 

If, follow Price, we only want to apply the Time Symmetry assumption to experiment 
that be their own operational time reverse, then we can add a measurement to the end of the 
experiment, with POVM element 

E0|0B = [0] E1|0B = [π ] (9.4) 

and 

E0|1B = 
[π 

2

E1|1B = 

[ 
−π 

2 

] 
. (9.5) 

Using equation (4.5) and (4.6), it be easily checked that this be it own operational time reverse. 
This be a temporal version of the EPR experiment and be the example that Price actually uses. 
However, the reason for this experiment would be exactly the same a above. One reason for 
prefer this version be that, without the No Retrocausality assumption, Time Symmetry and 
ψ-ontology now imply that both the usual forward evolve quantum state and the backwards 
evolve retrodictive state must be real in the same experiment. However, the contradiction do 
not depend on have this extra feature (see table 1 for a summary of the assumption and 
experiment involve in the two version of Price’s argument, and our argument). 

To conclude this section, we note that, without the ψ-ontology assumption, the experiment 
just described have a very simple ontological model, i.e. an ontic extension satisfy No 
Retrocausality and λ-mediation. This be just the Spekkens’ toy theory [6], regard a an 
ontological model for qubits prepared and measure in the eigenstates of Pauli operators. 

Specifically, suppose that the ontic state space Λ consists of two bits, λ0 and λ1. We set the 
epistemic state p(λ0, λ1 | a, x) = 12 δλx,a, where δ be the Kronecker δ-function, and the response 
function p(b | λ0, λ1, y) = δλy,b. In addition, p(a | x) = 12 for this experiment. This give the joint 
probability 

p(a, b, λ0, λ1 | x, y) = p(b | λ0, λ1, y)p(λ0, λ1 | a, x)p(a | x) = 14 δλy,bδλx,a, (9.6) 

which reproduces the operational prediction upon marginalize over λ0 and λ1. In addition, 
this distribution be invariant under the exchange of (a, x) with (b, y), so the operational time 
reverse, which be the same experiment in this case, be model by the same distribution, so Time 
Symmetry be satisfied. 

This model be ψ-epistemic as, for example, the distribution p(λ0, λ1 | a = 0, x = 0) and p(λ0, λ1 | 
a = 0, x = 1) both assign probability 12 to the ontic state λ0 = 0, λ1 = 0. It does, however, satisfy λ- 
mediation because it be an ontological model. This show that ψ-ontology be essential for Price’s 
argument, but not well justified for the example he uses.

10. Time Symmetry in de Broglie–Bohm and Everett 
In §1, we mention that both dBB theory and the Everett/many-worlds interpretation satisfy the 
conventional notion of time symmetry of dynamical laws, but they be not counter-examples to 
our argument because Time Symmetry be a different notion. 

The case of dBB be the easy to deal with because it satisfies all of our assumption 
other than Time Symmetry. Consider an experiment perform on a spin- 12 particle, where 
the preparation and measurement be of the spin. The preparation prepares pure state |ψx|a〉 
and the measurement be in orthonormal base |φb|y〉 (one basis for each value of y). Suppose 
that the position state |Ψ (r)〉 remains uncorrelated with the spin between the preparation and 
measurement so that |Ψ (r)〉 be the same for all choice of x and a. In dBB, the ontic state of this 
system consists of two pieces: the quantum state |Ψ (r)〉 ⊗ |ψa|x〉 and the position R of the particle, 
i.e. λ= (|Ψ (r)〉 ⊗ |ψa|x〉, R). The quantum state evolves accord to the Schrödinger equation, and 
the position evolves accord to the guidance equation, both of which be symmetric under 
the replacement of t with −t7. Since the position state be the same for all the experiment we be 
considering, and hence the position R be always distribute in the same way, the violation of Time 
Symmetry be entirely due to the spin state. 

Since this theory be ψ-ontic, it be susceptible to the argument give for the example in the 
previous section. Namely, give that p(λ | x) depends on x (i.e. the spin part of the quantum state 
be either |0〉 or |π〉 if x = 0, and either |π/2〉 or | − π/2〉 if x = 1), λ, which include the spin state, be 
necessarily different for each choice of x. Time symmetry then implies that λ should depend on 
the measurement choice a well, but it do not a the quantum state only depends on the choice 
of preparation, and the distribution of position be the same for all experiments. 

As show by Price’s argument, a ψ-ontic theory need to include a backwards evolve 
retrodictive state, in addition to the usual predictive state, in it ontology in order to satisfy Time 
Symmetry. For example, the transactional interpretation [2,3] and the two state vector formalism 
[4,5], interpret realistically, both posit such state and satisfy Time Symmetry. 

The reason why this do not conflict with the dynamical time symmetry of dBB be that 
operational time symmetry and dynamical time symmetry disagree on what be the time reverse 
of an experiment. To see this, it be useful to look at the dynamical time reverse of a prepare 
and measure experiment. In order to exhibit dynamical time reversal, it be necessary to treat 
the preparation and measurement device quantum mechanically, a dynamical time symmetry 
only hold when we do not apply the measurement postulate of quantum theory. In any case, 

7We also have to replace the quantum state with it complex conjugate, but our argument work for state that only have real 
amplitudes.

................................................... 

this be how measurement be suppose to be handle in dBB, a the measurement postulate be 
understood a effective rule that apply when there be sufficient decoherence in the position basis. 

To do this, we introduce four system in addition to the spin- 12 particle S. The preparation 
device have an input, described by a physical device such a a switch, which we label X. X can 
be in one of several orthogonal state |x〉X correspond to the different choice of preparation 
input. The output be described by a device such a a pointer, which we label system A, with 
orthogonal state |a〉A correspond to the output. Importantly, both X and A be macroscopic 
system with the different |x〉X state have almost no overlap in position and similarly for the 
|a〉A states. The measurement device be also described by two macroscopic systems, Y and B, 
describe it input and outputs, with macroscopically distinct orthogonal state |y〉Y and |b〉B. 
Prior to the experiment, the system be in the state |x〉X ⊗ |0〉A ⊗ |y〉Y ⊗ |0〉B ⊗ |0〉S, the important 
point be that the preparation and measurement input be set accord to the choice of the 
experimenter, and the spin- 12 particle and output system be in fix states. 

The preparation can then be described by a unitary operation UXAS, which only act on X, A 
and S a 

UXAS|x〉X ⊗ |0〉A ⊗ |0〉S = |x〉X ⊗ 
∑ 

a 

1√ 
p(a | x) |a〉A ⊗ |ψa|x〉. (10.1) 

Similarly, the measurement can be described by a unitary operation VYBS, which only act on Y, 
B and S a 

VYBS|y〉Y ⊗ |0〉B ⊗ |ψ〉S = |y〉Y ⊗ 
∑ 

b 

|b〉B ⊗ [φb|y]|ψ〉. (10.2) 

UXAS map state in which A and S be uncorrelated to an entangle superposition of different 
S state correlate with the value of A, and similarly VYBS map state in which B and S be 
uncorrelated to an entangle superposition of different S state correlate with the value of B. 
Their dynamical time revers U†XAS and V 

† 
YBS do the opposite, mapping these correlate state to 

unentangled ones. Thus, although preparation and measurement be operational time revers 
of one another, they be not dynamical time revers of one another, but rather both operation 
have the same sort of form. The dynamical time reverse of a measurement would be a kind of 
preparation in which we be allow to initially place the system in a superposition of different 
preparation outputs, rather than one in which a take a definite value. 

The case of Everett/many-worlds be a little more subtle, as, unlike dBB, it do not satisfy 
the ‘single world’ part of our (Single World) Realism assumption, so it do not fit into the 
framework we have use to prove our result. Therefore, to make the argument that many-worlds 
do not satisfy Time Symmetry in rigorous detail, one would first have to reformulate Time 
Symmetry in a framework that allows experiment to have multiple coexistent outcome at the 
ontological level. Nonetheless, even without do this, the intuitive idea of Time Symmetry be 
still clear: experiment that be operational time revers of one another ought to be time revers 
at the ontological level. Because many-worlds posit the unitary evolution of the usual forwards- 
evolve quantum state a it entire ontology, it be ψ-ontic and do not satisfy Time Symmetry 
due to the lack of an ontic backwards evolve state. However, this do not contradict dynamical 
time symmetry, which work the same way a in dBB. 

For most no-go theorems, such a Bell’s theorem and result about contextuality, the move 
to a many-worlds framework completely evades the conclusion of the theorem. It is, therefore, 
intrigue that this move do not help to evade our result. 

Readers who be happy with dynamical time symmetry may be inclined to reject our Time 
Symmetry assumption at this point. However, the conceptual idea of time symmetry—that you 
cannot tell the difference between a video played forward and played in reverse—is more 
fundamental than any particular mathematical formalization of it. In a theory in which the 
operational prediction be probabilistic, and in which there be no universal agreement about 
ontology, there will be several different formalization of time symmetry. Although dynamical 
time symmetry be the traditional notion, it do not have a unique claim to capture the basic 
concept. Even if one do view dynamical time symmetry a more fundamental than operational

time symmetry, the latter be still a symmetry that exists in quantum theory, and it lack an 
explanation in theory that reject our Time Symmetry assumption. 

11. Relation to Spekkens contextuality 
Spekkens’ variant of non-contextuality state that experimental procedure that be operationally 
equivalent, in the sense of predict the same probabilities, should be represent the same way 
in an ontological model [46]. In particular, two preparation procedure that always yield the same 
probability for every measurement should correspond to the same epistemic state, or probability 
distribution, over the ontic states. This be know a preparation non-contextuality. 

In the present context, when we consider the ensemble average over output of a no-signalling 
preparation, the operational probability obey p(b | x, y) = p(b | x′, y) = p(b | y) for all x, x′, which 
be just the no-signalling condition. Therefore in a preparation non-contextual ontological model, 
we must have p(λ | x) = p(λ | x′) = p(λ). In our main theorem, we derive this a a consequence of 
Time Symmetry instead. 

In quantum theory, no-signalling preparation correspond to different ensemble decom- 
position of the same density operator ρA, so preparation non-contextuality say that, in an 
ontological model, ρA should be represent by the same probability distribution over λ, 
regardless of which ensemble decomposition be use to prepare it. 

Spekkens’ show that no ontological model can satisfy this instance of preparation non- 
contextuality for a particular set-up involve decomposition of the maximally mixed state 
of a qubit into six pure state [46]. It have also be show that this instance preparation non- 
contextuality implies temporal Bell inequalities, such a the CHSH inequality we use here [25]. 
These result can therefore be use a alternative proof of the impossibility of an ontological 
model satisfy Time Symmetry. 

These preparation contextuality result have be demonstrate experimentally [25,58], so 
these experiment can also be view a demonstration of our result. However, we would like 
an experimental confirmation to be independent of the detail of quantum theory, which raise 
some important issues. 

First, our time symmetry assumption be only suppose to be apply to experiment in the no- 
signal sector of an operational theory. Without assume a background theory, like quantum 
theory, there be really no way of verify that a preparation be no-signalling. This be because, 
although every measurement we have so far manage to perform might reveal no signal from 
the preparation, there could always be some novel measurement, which we have not figure out 
how to do yet that would yield a signal. Tests of preparation contextuality face a similar issue, 
which be that two preparation procedure cannot be show to be operationally equivalent by 
experiment alone. If we be willing to make additional assumptions, such a the assumption that 
the measurement we can do be tomographically complete, then it be possible to devise robust 
test of preparation contextuality that do not suffer from this problem [59], and these test could, 
in the same way, be use a robust test of our main result. 

However, we also think that the Time Symmetry assumption should only be apply to 
theory that have an operationally time symmetric no-signalling sector, in order to avoid the kind 
of accidental time symmetry discuss in §7. This be truly impossible to verify experimentally, a 
it would involve test every possible no-signalling experiment. Therefore, while experimentally 
robust test of some form of preparation contextuality can also be view a test of our result, 
we think that the main significance of our result be in the context of a specific theory, which may 
or may not be quantum, but be know to be operationally time symmetric on theoretical grounds. 

12. Discussion and conclusion 
We have show that there be no ontic extension of quantum theory that satisfies No 
Retrocausality, λ-mediation and our Time Symmetry assumption, i.e. the requirement that an 
operational time symmetry should imply an ontological one. Requiring an ontic extension can

be broken down into two assumptions: Realism and Free Choice. Our main result show that at 
least one of these five assumption must be give up. 

Realism and Free Choice be part and parcel of what be normally meant by a realist theory 
and be share by many no-go theorems, such a Bell’s theorem. Their status here be no different 
from in these other contexts. Proponents of Copenhagenish interpretation deny that ontic state 
exist at all, so they would give up on Realism. Since our intention be to investigate realist 
interpretations, we need not discus this option further here. However, one can potentially 
also give up Realism by deny that it be actually require for a realist interpretation. For 
example, since our realism be single-world, the Everett/many-worlds interpretation do not 
satisfy it, but Everett/many-worlds be not time symmetric in the sense we be interested in, so 
adopt it do not solve the problem. Still, it be possible that a different interpretation that 
involves multiple world might exist that do have an appropriate time symmetry. Another 
option be to adopt a non-standard logic or probability theory. While this idea be appealing, the 
interpretation of such theory be usually operational, and a compelling realist underpin be 
currently lacking. 

In our view, the idea that ontic state be responsible for correlation between preparation and 
measurement, which be the idea behind λ-mediation, be also a core feature of a realist theory. It 
encodes the idea that ontic state be suppose to explain what we see in experiments. If we be 
contemplate give up No Retrocausality, then it be not entirely clear how to formulate this 
assumption, a conditional independence of past and future variable give λ be not a reasonable 
condition in a theory where λ can be causally affected by thing both in it past and in it future. 
Nonetheless, some semblance of the idea that preparation and measurement be correlate 
because of λ need to be retain in a retrocausal theory, and it be a challenge for proponent 
of retrocausal view to formalize this in a meaningful way. 

This leaf u with Time Symmetry and No Retrocausality a the most reasonable 
assumption to give up. Both of these assumption can be view a special case of the idea 
that an ontic extension should not be fine tuned, which make it difficult to make a clear choice 
between them. 

Loosely speaking, a no fine tune assumption mean that, when the operational prediction 
have a specify property, e.g. a symmetry, we postulate that the underlie realist theory should 
also have the same property. For example, the operational prediction of quantum theory do 
not allow u to send signal into the past, so we posit that there be no causal influence from 
future to past in the underlie theory. This be the No Retrocausality assumption. Similarly, the 
operational prediction of quantum theory obey a certain kind of time symmetry, so we also posit 
this symmetry for the underlie theory. This be our Time Symmetry assumption. 

No fine tune assumption be extremely common in no-go theorem for quantum theory. For 
example, Spekkens’ non-contextuality assumption, i.e. procedure that be operationally identical 
should be identical in the underlie theory, be of this type, a be parameter independence in Bell’s 
theorem, i.e. we cannot send signal superluminally, so our choice of measurement should not 
affect anything at the other wing of the experiment superluminally either.8 

No fine tune assumption seem reasonable because, if a give property hold in the 
underlie theory, then we can accept that property a a fundamental physical principle. For 
example, that there be no causal influence from future to past might be accepted a such a 
principle. Then, the explanation for why the property hold at the operational level be just by 
appeal to that principle. For example, if there be no causal influence from future to past at all, 
then obviously there must be no signal from future to past. 

However, when a property hold operationally, but not ontologically, then it cannot be because 
of a fundamental physical principle. Instead, there be a tension that cry out for explanation. For 

8See [60] for a detailed discussion of this in the case of Bell’s theorem. The assumption in Bell’s theorem can also be motivate 
directly from physical reasoning, e.g. invoke special relativity, without any appeal to the operational prediction of quantum 
theory. One might likewise be able to provide physical motivation for both Time Symmetry and No Retrocausality that do 
not appeal to their operational counterparts. We set aside such motivation in our discussion and focus on the fine tune 
narrative because we believe that narrative enables the clearest comparison of the two assumptions.

example, if there actually be influence from future to past then why be it that we cannot use 
those influence to send a signal? 

This can only happen if the probability describe our ignorance of the true ontic state be 
fine tuned. For example, if there be retrocausal influence in the theory, but no signal into the 
past, then the correlation between the operational variable and the ontic state must be set in 
such a way that the possibility of signal will be exactly wash out upon marginalize over 
the ontic state. 

Note that we expect our operational experiment to only reveal coarse-grained information 
about the ontic state, e.g. consider the classical example in which the ontic state be the microstate, 
but the operational degree of freedom only probe the macrostate. However, we do not expect 
our experiment to be so coarse grain that they completely miss key feature of the underlie 
ontology. For example, in statistical mechanic we can in fact detect many property of the 
ontology by observe the small statistical fluctuation they cause, a in Brownian motion. 
Therefore, if there be retrocausal influences, one would expect to be able to use them in some 
way to signal, even if this be not a straightforward a by directly observe the ontic state. If not, 
there be an explanatory gap that need filling. 

Since both No Retrocausality and Time Symmetry be no fine tune assumptions, the case 
for each of them be equally compelling. However, there be at least three possible way of deal 
with a fine tuning, which be appropriate in different circumstances, and can help to shed light 
on which one of them must go. 

(i) We can accept them a brute facts. 
(ii) We can look for an alternative framework that be not fine-tuned. 

(iii) We can explain them a emergent. 

The first option be to just accept that the fine tune be a prediction of our physical theory, 
and leave it at that. If the ontological description be play any explanatory role at all, then it 
be go to differ from the operational description in at least some respects, some of which will 
be mere accidents. Therefore, this might be an appropriate response if we be look at some 
rather specific and convolute property of the operational prediction that do not seem closely 
connect to fundamental physical principles. However, both time symmetry and the lack of 
signal into the past seem like general feature of our physical world, which deserve a good 
explanation than this. 

The second option be to say that the fine tune do not actually exist in nature, but be rather 
an indication that one of our other assumption be wrong. Once we discard the, perhaps implicit, 
faulty assumption, we will be able to find a theory with no fine tunings. In the present context, 
it be not completely out of the question to discard Realism so that we can retain some version 
of both No Retrocausality and Time Symmetry, but, a we have discussed, it be challenge to 
conceive of a realist framework that do not assume Realism. 

This brings u to the third option, which be emergent fine tunings. As an example of this, 
consider a universe that be in thermal equilibrium everywhere at a fix temperature. This 
universe contains many fine tunings, e.g. it be not possible to send a signal into the future 
in this universe, let alone the past. The underlie statistical mechanical description say that 
there be possible non-equilibrium state in the theory that do not have this property, so the 
probability seem fine tune in order to prevent signal into the future. However, in this 
case, we have a dynamical explanation of the fine tuning. If the universe do start in a non- 
equilibrium state, then the dynamic will, with high probability, eventually evolve the universe 
towards equilibrium. This is, of course, a perfectly legitimate explanation of why we might see an 
apparent fine tuning. 

If we accept this kind of explanation, then we also have to accept that the fine tune be not 
base on a fundamental physical principle and be likely to have be violate somewhere in the 
universe at some point, e.g. in the early universe shortly after the big bang, before the analogue 
of the equilibration process have time to take hold. It be difficult to see how this could happen for

Time Symmetry, which seem like a fundamental physical symmetry, but much easy for No 
Retrocausality. 

Recall that the very definition of the subjective arrow of time be that we can remember the 
past, which seem fixed, but the future seem open and manipulable. If signal into both 
the past and the future be commonplace, then there would be no definite subjective arrow of 
time, and arguably no possibility for subjective experience. There be good reason for believe 
that this arrow be necessarily align with the thermodynamic arrow of time, and we already 
believe that the thermodynamic arrow be emergent, to be explain by the initial condition of 
the universe, rather than a fundamental principle of physics. It be therefore plausible that the 
possibility of signal into the past in a universe with retrocausality would be wash out by 
the same process from which the thermodynamic arrow emerges. 

In other words, give that we already need an asymmetry in the boundary condition of the 
universe in order to account for the thermodynamic arrow of time, it seem plausible that this 
same asymmetry could be use to explain why there be signal into the future, but no signal 
into the past, in a universe with retrocausality. 

We conclude that the most plausible response to our result, other than give up Realism, 
be to posit that there might be retrocausality in nature. At the very least, this be a concrete and 
little explore possibility that hold the promise of evade almost all no-go theorem in the 
foundation of quantum theory, so it should be investigate further.
