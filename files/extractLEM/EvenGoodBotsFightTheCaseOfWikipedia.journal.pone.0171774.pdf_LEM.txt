Abstract 

In recent years, there have be a huge increase in the number of bot online, vary from 

Web crawler for search engines, to chatbots for online customer service, spambots on 

social media, and content-editing bot in online collaboration communities. The online world 

have turn into an ecosystem of bots. However, our knowledge of how these automate 

agent be interact with each other be rather poor. Bots be predictable automaton that 

do not have the capacity for emotions, meaning-making, creativity, and sociality and it be 

hence natural to expect interaction between bot to be relatively predictable and unevent- 

ful. In this article, we analyze the interaction between bot that edit article on Wikipedia. 

We track the extent to which bot undid each other’s edits over the period 2001–2010, 

model how pair of bot interact over time, and identify different type of interaction trajecto- 

ries. We find that, although Wikipedia bot be intend to support the encyclopedia, they 

often undo each other’s edits and these sterile “fights” may sometimes continue for years. 

Unlike human on Wikipedia, bots’ interaction tend to occur over longer period of time and 

to be more reciprocated. Yet, just like humans, bot in different cultural environment may 

behave differently. Our research suggests that even relatively “dumb” bot may give rise 

to complex interactions, and this carry important implication for Artificial Intelligence 

research. Understanding what affect bot-bot interaction be crucial for manage social 

medium well, provide adequate cyber-security, and design well function autonomous 

vehicles. 

Introduction 

In August 2011, Igor Labutov and Jason Yosinski, two PhD student at Cornell University, let 

a pair of chat bots, call Alan and Sruthi, talk to each other online. Starting with a simple 

greeting, the one-and-a-half-minute dialogue quickly escalate into an argument about what 

Alan and Sruthi have just said, whether they be robots, and about God [1]. The first ever con- 

versation between two simple artificial intelligence agent end in a conflict. 

A bot, or software agent, be a computer program that be persistent, autonomous, and reactive 

[2,3]. Bots be define by program code that run continuously and can be activate by 

itself. They make and execute decision without human intervention and perceive and adapt 

to the context they operate in. Internet bots, also know a web bots, be bot that run over the

Internet. They appear and proliferate soon after the creation of the World Wide Web [4]. 

Already in 1993, Martijn Koster publish “Guidelines to robot writers,” which contain sug- 

gestions about develop web crawler [5], a kind of bot. Eggdrop, one of the first know 

Internet Relay Chat bots, start greet chat newcomer also in 1993 [6]. In 1996, Fah-Chun 

Cheong publish a 413-page book, claim to have a current listing of all bot available on 

the Internet at that point in time. Since then, Internet bot have proliferate and diversified 

well beyond our ability to record them in an exhaustive list [7,8]. As a result, bot have be 

responsible for an increasingly large proportion of activity on the Web. For example, one 

study found that 25% of all message on Yahoo! chat over a period of three month in 2007 

be sent by spam bot [9]. Another study discover that 32% of all tweet make by the most 

active Twitter user in 2009 be generate by bot [10], meaning that bot be responsible 

for an estimate 24% of all tweet [11]. Further, researcher estimate that bot comprise 

between 4% and 7% of the avatar on the virtual world Second Life in 2009 [12]. A medium ana- 

lytics company found that 54% of the online ad show in thousand of ad campaign in 2012 

and 2013 be view by bots, rather than human [13]. According to an online security com- 

pany, bot account for 48.5% of website visit in 2015 [14]. Also in 2015, 100,000 account 

on the multi-player online game World of Warcraft (about 1% of all accounts) be ban 

for use bot [15]. And in the same year, a database leak reveal that more than 70,000 

“female” bot sent more than 20 million message on the cheater date site Ashley Madison 

[16]. 

As the population of bot active on the Internet 24/7 be grow fast, their interaction be 

equally intensifying. An increase number of decisions, options, choices, and service depend 

now on bot work properly, efficaciously, and successfully. Yet, we know very little about 

the life and evolution of our digital minions. In particular, predict how bots’ interaction 

will evolve and play out even when they rely on very simple algorithm be already challenging. 

Furthermore, a Alan and Sruthi demonstrated, even if bot be design to collaborate, con- 

flict may occur inadvertently. Clearly, it be crucial to understand what could affect bot-bot 

interaction in order to design cooperative bot that can manage disagreement, avoid unpro- 

ductive conflict, and fulfill their task in way that be socially and ethically acceptable. 

There be many type of Internet bot (see Table 1). These bot form an increasingly com- 

plex system of social interactions. Do bot interact with each other in way that be comparable

familiar example for each type.

to how we human interact with each other? Bots be predictable automaton that do not have 

the capacity for emotions, meaning-making, creativity, and sociality [17]. Despite recent 

advance in the field of Artificial Intelligence, the idea that bot can have morality and culture 

be still far from reality. Today, it be natural to expect interaction between bot to be relatively 

predictable and uneventful, lack the spontaneity and complexity of human social interac- 

tions. However, even in such simple contexts, our research show that there may be more simi- 

larities between bot and human than one may expect. Focusing on one particular human-bot 

community, we find that conflict emerges even among benevolent bot that be design to 

benefit their environment and not fight each other, and that bot interaction may differ when 

they occur in environment influence by different human cultures. 

Benevolent bot be design to support human user or cooperate with them. Malevolent 

bot be design to exploit human user and compete negatively with them. We have classi- 

fied high-frequency trading algorithm a malevolent because they exploit market in way 

that increase volatility and precipitate flash crashes. In this study, we use data from edit 

bot on Wikipedia (benevolent bot that generate content). 

We study bot on Wikipedia, the large free online encyclopedia. Bots on Wikipedia be 

computer script that automatically handle repetitive and mundane task to develop, improve, 

and maintain the encyclopedia. They be easy to identify because they operate from dedicate 

user account that have be flag and officially approved. Approval require that the bot 

follow Wikipedia’s bot policy. 

Bots be important contributor to Wikipedia. For example, in 2014, bot complete about 

15% of the edits on all language edition of the encyclopedia [18]. In general, Wikipedia bot 

complete a variety of activities. They identify and undo vandalism, enforce bans, check spell- 

ing, create inter-language links, import content automatically, mine data, identify copyright 

violations, greet newcomers, and so on [19]. Our analysis here focus on edit bots, which 

modify article directly. We analyze the interaction between bot and investigate the extent to 

which they resemble interaction between humans. In particular, we focus on whether bot 

disagree with each other, how the dynamic of disagreement differ for bot versus humans, 

and whether there be difference between bot operating in different language edition of 

Wikipedia. 

To measure disagreement, we study reverts. A revert on Wikipedia occurs when an editor, 

whether human or bot, undoes another editor’s contribution by restore an early version of 

the article. Reverts that occur systematically indicate controversy and conflict [20–22]. Reverts 

be technically easy to detect regardless of the context and the language, so they enable analysis 

at the scale of the whole system. 

Our data contain all edits in 13 different language edition of Wikipedia in the first ten 

year after the encyclopedia be launch (2001–2010). The language represent edition of 

different size and editor from diverse culture (see Materials and Methods for details). We 

know which user complete the edit, when, in which article, whether the edit be a revert and, 

if so, which previous edit be reverted. We first identify which editor be humans, bots, or 

vandals. We isolated the vandal since their short-lived disruptive activity exhibit different 

time and interaction pattern than the activity of regular Wikipedia editors. 

Results 

Bots constitute a tiny proportion of all Wikipedia editor but they stand behind a significant 

proportion of all edits (Fig 1A and 1B). There be significant difference between different lan- 

guages in term of how active bot are. From previous research, we know that, in small and 

endanger languages, bot be extremely active and do more than 50% of the edits, sometimes

up to 100% [19]. Their tasks, however, be mainly restrict to add link between article 

and languages. In large and active languages, the level of bot activity be much low but also 

much more variable. 

Compared to humans, a small proportion of bots’ edits be reverts and a small propor- 

tion get revert (Fig 1C and 1D). In other words, bot dispute others and be dispute by oth- 

er to a lesser extent than humans. Since 2001, the number of bot and their activity have be 

increase but at a slow rate (S1 Fig). In contrast, the number of reverts between bot have 

be continuously increase (Fig 2A). This would suggest that bot interaction be not 

become more efficient. We also see that the proportion of mutual bot-bot reverts have 

remain relatively stable, perhaps even slightly increase over time, indicate that bot own- 

er have not learn to identify bot conflict faster (Fig 2B). 

In general, bot revert each other a lot: for example, over the ten-year period, bot on 

English Wikipedia revert another bot on average 105 times, which be significantly large 

than the average of 3 time for human (S1 Table). Bots on German Wikipedia revert each 

other to a much lesser extent than other bot (24 time on average). Bots on Portuguese Wiki- 

pedia, in contrast, fight the most, with an average of 185 bot-bot reverts per bot. This strike 

difference, however, disappears when we account for the fact that bot on Portuguese Wikipe- 

dia edit more than bot on German Wikipedia. In general, since bot be much more active

their edits reverted, we do not show them in this figure.

editor than humans, the high number of bot-bot reverts do not mean that bot fight more 

than humans. In fact, the proportion of bots’ edits that be reverts be small for bot than for 

human (Fig 1C). This proportion be high for bot in the English and the Romance-language 

edition (Spanish, French, Portuguese, and Romanian). Interestingly, although bot in these 

language revert more often compare to bot in other languages, few of these reverts be for 

another bot (S2 Fig). 

Our analysis focus on interaction in dyad over time. We model the interaction trajecto- 

ries in two-dimensional space, where the x-axis measure time and the y-axis measure how 

many more time the first editor have revert the second compare to the second revert the 

first (Fig 3). We analyze three property of the trajectories: latency, imbalance, and reciprocity. 

Latency measure the average steepness of the interaction trajectory, imbalance measure the 

distance between the x-axis and the last point of the trajectory, and reciprocity measure the 
trajectory’s jaggedness (see Materials and Methods below for definitions). 

Analyzing the property of the interaction trajectory suggests that the dynamic of dis- 

agreement differ significantly between bot and humans. Reverts between bot tend to occur at 

a slow rate and a conflict between two bot can take place over longer period of time, some- 

time over years. In fact, bot-bot interaction have different characteristic time scale than 

human-human interaction (S3 Fig). The characteristic average time between successive 

reverts for human be at 2 minutes, 24 hours, or 1 year. In comparison, bot-bot interaction 

have a characteristic average response of 1 month. This difference be likely because, first, bot 

systematically crawl article and, second, bot be restrict a to how often they can make

reverts have be increasing. (B) However, the proportion of reciprocate reverts have not be decrease 

(error bar correspond to one standard error). This suggests that disagreement between bot be not become 

less common.

edits (the Wikipedia bot policy usually require space of 10 seconds, or 5 for anti-vandalism 

activity, which be consider more urgent). In contrast, human use automatic tool that report 

live change make to a pre-selected list of article [24,25]; they can thus follow only a small set 

of article and, in principle, react instantaneously to any edits on those. 

Bots also tend to reciprocate each other’s reverts to a great extent. In contrast, human 

tend to have highly unbalanced interactions, where one individual unilaterally reverts another 

one (S4 and S5 Figs). 

We quantify these finding more precisely by identify different type of interaction tra- 

jectories and counting how often they occur for bot and for humans, a well a for specific 

languages. To this end, we use k-means cluster on the three property of the trajectory 

(latency, imbalance, and reciprocity) and on all bot-bot and human-human interaction longer 

than five reverts (the result be substantively similar without the length restriction). We do 

not claim that the cluster be natural to the data; rather, we use the cluster to compare the 

interaction of the different groups. 

Fig 3. Typical interaction trajectory for bot-bot and human-human pair in English Wikipedia in the 

period 2001–2010. The interaction trajectory be construct a follows: start from yo = 0, yt = yt-1 + 1 if i 

reverts j and yt = yt-1 − 1 if j reverts i at time t; the label i and j be assign so that y >= 0 for the majority of the 
ij interaction time; to compress the extremes, we scale the y-axis to the power of 0.5. The panel show the 

trajectory of 200 pair randomly sample from those who have exchange more than five reverts. In 

addition, we highlight the four long trajectory in the sample from each of the four trajectory type we 

identify. Compared to human-human interactions, bot-bot interaction occur at a slow rate and be more 

balanced, in the sense that reverts go back and forth between the two editors.

The algorithm suggest that the data can be best cluster in four trajectory type (S6 Fig): 

• Fast unbalanced trajectories. These trajectory have low reciprocity and latency and high 

imbalance. They look like smooth vertical line above the x-axis. 

• Slow unbalanced trajectories. These trajectory have low reciprocity and high latency and 

imbalance. They look like smooth diagonal line above the x-axis. 

• Somewhat balance trajectories. These trajectory have intermediate imbalance and reci- 

procity. They be somewhat jagged and cross the x-axis. 

• Well balance trajectories. These trajectory have low imbalance and high reciprocity. 

They be quite jagged and center on the x-axis. 

Looking at the prevalence of these four type of trajectory for bot and human and across 

languages, we confirm the previous observations: bot-bot interaction occur at a slow rate 

and be more balanced, in the sense that reverts go back and forth between the two bot (Fig 

4). Further, we find that bot-bot interaction be more balance in small language edition of 

Wikipedia. This could be due to the fact that bot be more active in small edition and 

hence, interaction between them be more likely to occur. Less intuitively, however, this 

observation also suggests that conflict between bot be more likely to occur when there be 

few bot and when, common sense would suggest, coordination be easier. 

Discussion 

Our result show that, although in quantitatively different ways, bot on Wikipedia behave and 

interact a unpredictably and a inefficiently a the humans. The disagreement likely arise 

from the bottom-up organization of the community, whereby human editor individually 

create and run bots, without a formal mechanism for coordination with other bot owners. 

Fig 4. The prevalence of the four type of trajectory for bot and human and for different language edition of 

Wikipedia. The darker the shade of the cell, the high the proportion for that type of trajectory for the language. Bot-bot 

interaction occur at a slow rate and be more balanced, in the sense that reverts go back and forth between the two bots. 

Further, bot-bot interaction be more balance in small language edition of Wikipedia.

Delving deeper into the data, we found that most of the disagreement occurs between bot that 

specialize in create and modify link between different language edition of the encyclo- 

pedia. The lack of coordination may be due to different language edition have slightly dif- 

ferent name rule and conventions. 

In support of this argument, we also found that the same bot be responsible for the major- 

ity of reverts in all the language edition we study. For example, some of the bot that revert 

the most other bot include Xqbot, EmausBot, SieBot, and VolkovBot, all bot specialize in 

fix inter-wiki links. Further, while there be few article with many bot-bot reverts (S7 Fig), 

these article tend to be the same across languages. For example, some of the article most con- 

test by bot be about Pervez Musharraf (former president of Pakistan), Uzbekistan, Estonia, 

Belarus, Arabic language, Niels Bohr, Arnold Schwarzenegger. This would suggest that a sig- 

nificant portion of bot-bot fight occurs across language rather than within. In contrast, the 

article with most human-human reverts tend to concern local personality and entity and 

tend to be unique for each language [26]. 

Our data cover a period of the evolution of Wikipedia when bot activity be growing. Evi- 

dence suggests that this period suddenly end in 2013 (http://stats.wikimedia.org/EN/ 

PlotsPngEditHistoryTop.htm). This decline occur because at the begin of 2013 many 

language edition of Wikipedia start to provide inter-language link via Wikidata, which be a 

collaboratively edit knowledge base intend to support Wikipedia. Since our result be 

largely dictate by inter-language bots, we believe that the conflict we observe on Wikipedia 

no longer occurs today. One interest direction for future research be to investigate whether 

the conflict continue to persist among the inter-language bot that migrate to Wikidata. 

Wikipedia be perhaps one of the best example of a populous and complex bot ecosystem 

but this do not necessarily make it representative. As Table 1 demonstrates, we have investi- 

gate a very small region of the botosphere on the Internet. The Wikipedia bot ecosystem be 

gate and monitor and this be clearly not the case for system of malevolent social bots, such 

a social bot on Twitter pose a human to spread political propaganda or influence public 

discourse. Unlike the benevolent but conflict bot of Wikipedia, many malevolent bot be 

collaborative, often coordinate their behavior a part of botnets [27]. However, before be 

able to study the social interaction of these bots, we first need to learn to identify them [28]. 

Our analysis show that a system of simple bot may produce complex dynamic and unin- 

tend consequences. In the case of Wikipedia, we see that benevolent bot that be design 

to collaborate may end up in continuous disagreement. This be both inefficient a a waste of 

resources, and inefficacious, for it may lead to local impasse. Although such disagreement 

represent a small proportion of the bots’ editorial activity, they nevertheless bring attention to 

the complexity of design artificially intelligent agents. Part of the complexity stem from 

the common field of interaction—bots on the Internet, and in the world at large, do not act in 

isolation, and interaction be inevitable, whether design for or not. Part of the complexity 

stem from the fact that there be a human designer behind every bot, a well a behind the envi- 

ronment in which bot operate, and that human artifact embody human culture. As bot con- 

tinue to proliferate and become more sophisticated, social scientist will need to devote more 

attention to understand their culture and social life. 

Materials and method 

Data 

Wikipedia be an ecosystem of bots. Some of the bot be “editing bots”, that work on the arti- 

cles. They undo vandalism, enforce bans, check spelling, create inter-language links, import

content automatically, etc. Other bot be non-editing: these bot mine data, identify vandal- 

ism, or identify copyright violations. 

In addition to bots, there be also certain automate service that editor use to streamline 

their work. For example, there be automate tool such Huggle and STiki, which produce a 

filter set of edits to review in a live queue. Using these tools, editor can instantly revert the 

edit in question with a single click and advance to the next one. There be also user interface 

extension and in-browser function such a Twinkle, rollback, and undo, which also allow 

editor to revert with a single click. Another automate service that be relatively recent and 

much more sophisticated be the Objective Revision Evaluation Service (ORES). It us 

machine-learning technique to rank edits with the ultimate goal to identify vandal or low- 

quality contributions. 

Our research focus on edit bots. Our data contain who reverts whom, when, and in 

what article. To obtain this information, we analyze the Wikipedia XML Dumps (https:// 

dumps.wikimedia.org/mirrors.html) of 13 different language editions. To detect restore ver- 

sion of an article, a hash be calculate for the complete article text follow each revision 

and the hash be compare between revision [23]. The data cover the period from the 

begin of Wikipedia (January 15, 2001) until February 2, 2010 –October 31, 2011, the last 

date depend on when the data be collect for the particular language edition. This time 

period capture the “first generation” of Wikipedia bots, a in late years, Wikidata take over 

some of the task previously control by Wikipedia. The sample of language cover a wide 

range of Wikipedia edition in term of size; for example, it include the four large edition 

by number of edits and number of editors. In term of cultural diversity, the sample cover a 

wide range of geographies. 

Wikipedia require that human editor create separate account for bot and that the bot 

account name clearly indicate the user be a bot, usually by include the word “bot” (https:// 

en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Bot_policy). Hence, to identify the bots, we select all 

account name that contain different spell variation of the word “bot.” We supplement 

this set with all account that have currently active bot status in the Wikipedia database but 

that may not fit the above criterion (using https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Bots/Status 

a of August 6, 2015). We thus obtain a list of 6,627 suspect bots. 

We then use the Wikipedia API to check the “User” page for each suspect bot account. 

If the page contain a link to another account, we confirm that the current account be a 

bot and link it to it owner. For page that contain zero or more than one link to other 

accounts, we manually checked the “User” and “User_talk” page for the suspect bot account 

to see if it be indeed a bot and to identify it owner. The majority of manually checked account 

be vandal or humans, so we end up with 1,549 bots, each link to it human owner. 

We additionally label human editor a vandal if they have all their edits revert by oth- 

ers. This rule meant that we label a vandal also newcomer who become discourage and 

left Wikipedia after all their initial contribution be reverted. Since we be interested in 

social interaction emerge from repeat activity, we do not believe that this decision affect 

our results. 

Using the revert data, we create a direct two-layer multi-edge network, where owner- 

ship couple the layer of human editor and the layer of bot [29]. To build the network, we 

assume that a link go from the editor who restore an early version of the article (the 

“reverter”) to the editor who make the revision immediately after that version (the “reverted”). 

All link be time-stamped. We collapse multiple bot to a single node if they be own 

by the same human editor; these bot be usually account for different generation of the

human and bot layers. The multi-layer network be prune by remove self-reverts, a well 

a reverts between a bot and it owner. 

Interaction trajectory 

We model the interaction trajectory in two-dimensional space, where the x-axis measure time 

and the y-axis measure the difference between the number of time i have revert j and the 
number of time j have revert i. To construct the trajectories, start from y0 = 0, yt = yt-1 + 1 
if i reverts j at time t and yt = yt-1 − 1 if j reverts i at time t; the label i and j be assign so that 
y>= 0 for the majority of the ij interaction time. We analyze three property of the trajectories: 

• Latency. We define latency a the mean log time in second between successive reverts: 

μ(log10 Δt). 

• Imbalance. We define imbalance a the final proportion of reverts between i and j that be 
not reciprocated: |ri − rj| / (ri + rj), where ri and rj be the number of time i revert j and j 
revert i, respectively. 

• Reciprocity. We define reciprocity a the proportion of observe turn point out of all 

possible: (# turn points) / (ri + rj− 1), where ri and rj be the number of time i revert j 
and j revert i, respectively. A turn point occurs when the user who reverts at time t be 
different from the user who reverts at time t+1. 

K-means cluster 

To identify the number of cluster k that best represent the data, we apply the elbow and sil- 
houette method on trajectory of different minimum length. The rationale behind restrict 

the data to long trajectory only be that short trajectory tend to have extreme value on the 

three features, thus possibly skew the results. According to the elbow method, we would 

like the small k that most significantly reduces the sum of square error for the clustering. 
According to the silhouette method, we would like the k that maximizes the separation dis- 
tance between cluster and thus give u the large silhouette score. 

Although the elbow method suggests that four cluster provide the best clustering, the sil- 

houette method indicates that the data cannot be cluster well (S8 Fig). We do not necessarily 

expect that trajectory cluster naturally; rather, we employ cluster in order to quantify the 

difference between the interaction of bot versus human across languages. We hence ana- 

lyze the cluster with k = 4. This cluster also have the advantage of yield four type of 
trajectory that intuitively make sense. 

Supporting information 

S1 Fig. The number of bots, the number of edits by bots, and the proportion of edits do 

by bot between 2001 and 2010. Between 2003 and 2008 the number of bot and their activity 

have be increasing. This trend, however, appear to have subside after 2008, suggest 

that the system may have stabilized.

S3 Fig. Bot-bot interaction have different characteristic time scale than human-human 

interactions. The figure show the distribution of interaction for a particular latency, where 

we define latency a the mean log time in second between successive reverts. (A) Bot-bot 

interaction have a characteristic latency of 1 month, a indicate by the peak in the figure. (B) 

Human-human interaction occur with a latency of 2 minutes, 24 hours, or 1 year.

S4 Fig. Bot-bot interaction be on average more balance than human-human interac- 

tions. We define imbalance a the final proportion of reverts between i and j that be not 
reciprocated. (A) A significant proportion of bot-bot interaction have low imbalance. (B) The 

majority of human-human interaction be perfectly unbalanced. 

(TIFF) 

S5 Fig. Bots reciprocate much more than human do also at a small timescale. We mea- 

sure reciprocity a the proportion of observe turn point out of all possible. (A) A signifi- 

cant proportion of bot-bot interaction have intermediate or high value of reciprocity. (B) 

The majority of human-human interaction be not reciprocated.

S6 Fig. Four type of interaction trajectory suggest by the k-means analysis. The left 

panel show a sample of the trajectories, include bot-bot and human-human interaction 

and trajectory from all languages. The right panel show the distribution of latency, imbal- 

ance, and reciprocity for each type of trajectory. The three property measure the average 

steepness, the y-value of the last point, and the jaggedness of the trajectory, respectively. (A) 
Fast unbalanced trajectory have low reciprocity and latency and high imbalance. (B) Some- 

what balance trajectory have intermediate imbalance and reciprocity. (C) Slow unbalanced 

trajectory have low reciprocity and high latency and imbalance. (D) Well balance trajecto- 

ries have low imbalance and high reciprocity.

S7 Fig. The number of article with a certain number of bot-bot and human-human 

reverts. (A) Few article include more than 10 bot-bot reverts. The most contest article 

tend to be about foreign country and personalities. Further, the same article also re- 

appear in different languages. (B) There be many article that be highly contest by 

humans. The most contest article tend to concern local personality and entities. It be 

rare that a highly contest article in one language will be also highly contest in another 

language.

S8 Fig. Performance of the k-means cluster algorithm for different number of cluster 

and for sub-samples with different minimum length of trajectories. (A) The elbow method 

require the small k that most significantly reduces the sum of square error for the cluster- 
ing. Here, the method suggests that four cluster give the best cluster of the data. (B) The sil- 

houette method require the k that maximizes the separation distance between clusters, i.e. the 
large silhouette score. Here, the method suggests that the cluster performs bad a the 

number of cluster increases.
