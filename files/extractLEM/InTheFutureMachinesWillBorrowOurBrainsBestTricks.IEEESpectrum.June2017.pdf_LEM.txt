and take in the crisp new daylight 

pour through the bedroom window. He look down 

at his companion, still pretend to sleep. “Okay, 

Kiri, I’m up.” 

Steve sits up 

She stir out of bed and begin dressing. “You receive 

164 message overnight. I answer all but one.” 

In the bathroom, Steve stare at his dishevel self. 

“Fine, give it to me.” 

“Your mother want to know why you won’t get a real 

girlfriend.” 

He burst out laughing. “Anything else?” 

“Your cholesterol be creep up again. And there have 

be 15,712 attempt to hack my mind in the last 

hour.” 

“Good grief! Can you identify the source?” 

“It’s distributed. Mostly inducement to purchase a 

new RF oven. I’m shift cipher and restrict 

network traffic.” 

“Okay. Let me know if you start hearing voices.” Steve 

pauses. “Any good deals?” 

“One with remote control be in our price range. It have 

mostly good reviews.” 

“You can buy it.” 

Kiri smiles. “I’ll stay in bed and cook dinner with a 

thought.” 

Steve go to the car and take his seat. 

Car, a creature of habit, pull out and head to work without any prodding. 

Leaning his head back, Steve watch the world go by. Screw the news. He’ll read it later.

Car deposit Steve in front of his office building 

and then search for a parking spot. 

Steve walk to the lounge, grab a roll and some 

coffee. His coworkers drift in and chat for hours. 

They try to find some inspiration for a new movie 

script. AI-generated art be flawless in execution, 

even in depth of story, but somehow it doesn’t 

resonate well with humans, much a one 

generation’s music do not always appeal to the 

next. AIs simply don’t share the human condition. 

But maybe they could if they experienced the 

world through a body. That’s the whole point of 

the experiment with Kiri.… 

but by midcentury we could be 

living in Steve and Kiri’s world. Computing, after 

about 70 years, be at a momentous juncture. The 

old approaches, base on CMOS technology and 

the von Neumann architecture, be reach their 

fundamental limits. Meanwhile, massive effort 

around the world to understand the working of 

the human brain be yield new insight into one 

of the great scientific mysteries: the biological basis of human cognition. 

It’s sci-fi now, 

The dream of a think machine—one like Kiri that reacts, plans, and reason like a human—is a old a 

the computer age. In 1950, Alan Turing propose to test whether machine can think, by 

. He predict 

computer would pas his test by the year 2000. Computing pioneer such a 

also set out to imitate the brain. They have only the simplest 

notion of neurons, base on the work of neuroscientist 

and others in 

the late 1800s. And the dream prove elusive, full of false start and blind alleys. Even now, we have little 

idea how the tangible brain give rise to the intangible experience of conscious thought.

With systematic data collection and rigorous insight into the brain, a new generation of computer 

pioneer hope to create truly think machines. 

If they succeed, they will transform the human condition, just a the Industrial Revolution do 200 year 

ago. For nearly all of human history, we have to grow our own food and make thing by hand. The 

Industrial Revolution unleashed vast store of energy, allow u to build, farm, travel, and 

communicate on a whole new scale. The AI revolution will take u one enormous leap further, free u

from the need to control every detail of operating the machine that underlie modern civilization. And a 

a consequence of copying the brain, we will come to understand ourselves in a deeper, truer light. 

Perhaps the first benefit will be in mental health, organizational behavior, or even international 

relations. 

Such machine will also improve our health in general. Imagine a device, whether a robot or your 

cellphone, that keep your medical records. Combining this personalize data with a sophisticated model 

of all the pathway that regulate the human body, it could simulate scenario and recommend healthy 

behavior or medical action tailor to you. A human doctor can correlate only a few variable at once, 

but such an app could consider thousands. It would be more effective and more personal than any 

physician. 

Re-creating the process of the brain will let u automate anything human now do. Think about fast 

food. Just combine a neural controller chip that imitates the reasoning, intuitive, and mechanical-control 

power of the brain with a few thousand dollars’ worth of parts, and you have a short-order bot. You’d 

order a burger with your phone, and then drive up to retrieve your food from a building with no human 

in it. Many other commercial facility would be similarly human free. 

That may sound horrifying, give how rigid computer be today. Ever call a customer service or 

technical support line, only to be force through a frustrate series of automate menu by a pleasant 

can voice ask you repeatedly to “press or say 3,” at the end of which you’ve gotten nowhere? The 

charade creates human expectations, yet the machine frequently fail to deliver and can’t even get angry 

when you scream at them. Thinking machine will sense your emotions, understand your goals, and 

actively help you achieve them. Rather than mechanically run through a fix set of instructions, 

they will adjust a circumstance change. 

That’s because they’ll be model on our brains, which be exquisitely adapt to navigate complex 

environment and work with other humans. With little conscious effort, we understand language and 

grasp shade of meaning and mood from the subtle cue of body language, facial expression, and tone of 

voice. And the brain do all that while consume astonishingly little energy.

Thus, with an average basal metabolism of

How do the brain do it? It’s not that neuron be so much more efficient than transistors. In fact, when 

it come to move signal around, neuron have

neuron and their pattern of interaction, or “algorithms.” The brain have relatively shallow but massively 

parallel networks. At every level, from deep inside cell to large brain regions, there be feedback loop 

that keep the system in balance and change it in response to activity from neighbor units. The ultimate 

feedback loop be through the muscle to the outside world and back through the senses.

Traditionally, neuron be view a unit that collect thousand of inputs, transform them 

computationally, and then send signal downstream to other neuron via connection call synapses. 

But it turn out that this model be too simplistic; surprising computational power exists in every part of

(http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/21/science/21brain.html) 

And there be hundred of different type of neurons, each perform a special role in the neural 

circuitry. Most neuron communicate through physical contact, so they grow long skinny branch to 

find the right partner. Signals move along these branch via a chain of amplifiers. Ion pump keep the 

neuron’s cell membrane charged, like a battery. Signals travel a short sharp change of voltage, call 

spikes, which ripple down the membrane. 

The power of the brain go beyond it internal connections, and include it ability to communicate with 

other brains. Some animal form swarm or social groups, but only human form deep hierarchies. This 

penchant, more than any unique cognitive ability, enables u to dominate the planet and construct 

object of exquisite complexity. Collectively, though, we human be capable of achieve truly great 

things. 

Now we be combine machine intelligence along with our own. As our systems—industrial, 

technological, medical—grow in sophistication and complexity, so too must the intelligence that operates 

them. Eventually, our tool will think for themselves, perhaps even become conscious. Some people find 

this a . If our tool think for 

themselves, they could turn against us. What if, instead, we create machine that love us?

Steve arrives home 

“I make a new painting.” She step away to show him. The canvas contains a photo-perfect rendition of 

the yard, in oils. 

“Um, it’s nice.” 

“You’re lying. I can tell from your biosensors.” 

“Listen, Kiri, I have to take you back to the lab. They say you’ve progress a far a you can with me.” 

“I like it here. Please let me stay. I’ll be anything you want.” 

“That’s the problem. You try so hard to please me that you haven’t found yourself.” 

Water trickle down her cheek. She wipe it and study her moist hand. “You think all this be fake.” 

Steve take Kiri in a tight embrace and hold her for a long time. He whispers, “I don’t know.”
