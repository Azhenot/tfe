ABSTRACT 
An unprecedented human mobility have driven the rapid urban- 
ization around the world. In China, the fraction of population 
dwell in city increase from 17.9% to 52.6% between 1978 and 
2012. Such large-scale migration pose both signicant challenge 
for policymakers and important question for researchers. 

To investigate the process of migrant integration, we employ 
a one-month complete dataset of telecommunication metadata in 
Shanghai with 54 million user and 698 million call logs. We nd 
systematic dierences between local and migrant in their mobile 
communication network and geographical locations. For instance, 
migrant have more diverse contact and move around the city with 
a large radius than local aer they sele down. By distinguish 
new migrant (who recently move to Shanghai) from seled mi- 
grant (who have be in Shanghai for a while), we demonstrate 
the integration process of new migrant in their rst three weeks. 
Moreover, we formulate classication problem to predict whether 
a person be a migrant. Our classier be able to achieve an F1-score 
of 0.82 when distinguish seled migrant from locals, but it 
remains challenge to identify new migrant because of class im- 
balance. Yet we show that an increase fraction of new migrant 
be classied a local week by week.

1 INTRODUCTION 
In a big city like L.A. you can spend a lot of time surround by 

hundred of people yet you feel like an alien or a ghost or something. 
— Morley 

Millions of people migrate to city to realize their urban dreams, 
range from pursue potential job opportunity to embrace an 
open dynamic culture [28]. ese migrant contribute to the pros- 
perity of city by constitute a substantial part of the workforce 
in the cities, strengthen the political and economic status of the 
cities, and bring diverse culture to the cities. 

Despite the great benets brought by migration, policymakers 
and scholar have well recognize that the fast rate of migration 

pose great challenge [3, 28]. Segregation and social inequality 
have become signicant issue in the migration process. For in- 
stance, migrant may sele in slum with health hazard [6]; they 
tend to be overwork but underpaid [39]; their child may be 
exclude from school [19]. ese problem might be even more 
salient in China, a develop country with an unprecedented speed 
of urbanization [3]. It be thus an important research question to 
understand how migrant integrate into a city. 

Furthermore, the life of migrant be in constant ux. Some mi- 
grant may eventually sele down in the city, while others may go 
back to their hometown or dri to another city. is process resem- 
bles users’ behavior in online community [2, 12, 13, 27, 33, 45], but 
present more complex dynamic because move oine require 
considerably more eorts. Accurate model and prediction of 
migrant integration can potentially inform urban policymaking. 

In this work, we be interested in two central component of 
migrant integration: the location where a migrant life and move 
around, and the people that a migrant interacts with and befriend. 
First, because city be divide into neighborhood with vary 
characteristics, there may exist systematic dierences between 
local and migrant in where they live. For example, Figure 1 show 
the geographical distribution of local and migrant compare 
to the overall average in Shanghai. Somewhat surprisingly, local 
be more active in the periphery of the city, whereas migrant 
relatively concentrate in the center of Shanghai. is observation 
echo previous ndings that exist resident ee from central 
cities, know a “white ight” [17]. It yet remains an open question 
how migrants’ active area evolve a they integrate into the city. 

Another important aspect of migrant integration be how mi- 
grant build their personal networks. As human be social animals, 
whether a migrant can successfully develop a personal network be 
crucial in her integration process [20]. In particular, Yue et al. [53] 
show that migrant-resident tie be signicantly associate with 
migrant integration. However, it remains unclear how a migrant 
make initial friend and then slowly build a personal network in a 
new city. It be also unknown what characteristic dierentiate the 
social network of migrant from those of locals. 
Organization and highlight of this work. In order to investi- 
gate the above two aspects, we conduct a case study of Shanghai, 
one of the big city in China, and present the rst large-scale 
quantitative exploration of migrant integration. We employ a one- 
month complete dataset of telecommunication metadata from China

Figure 1: Geographical distribution of locals, settle migrant (who have be in a new city for a while), and new migrant 
(who recently move to a new city) in Shanghai. Each person be represent by the center of their active area (formal def- 
initions will be present in Section 3). Figure 1(a) show the log probability of all user in each region and this probabil- 
ity constitutes a comparison point for the other gures. Each of the right three gures show the log odds ratio of each 
group compare to the overall average in Figure 1(a), i.e., log Pgroup − log P , where P be the overall average in Figure 1(a) and 
Pgroup, group ∈ {locals, seled migrants, new migrants} be the probability to fall in a region within that particular group of people. 
Intuitively, a red region in the right three gures suggests that this group of people be disproportionally frequent in that 
region. Settled migrant tend to be in the central part of the city, while local be in the periphery. New migrant be similar 
to settle migrant by and large, but have a few dark area on the periphery. e darkest point in Figure 1(d) correspond to 
Songjiang University Town, a hub of universities. 

Telecom,1 which contains 698 million call log between 54 million 
mobile user in Shanghai. To identify a comparison point of mi- 
grants, we dene local a the person that be born in Shanghai, 
the counterpart of migrants. As migrant may undergo dierent 
stage in their integration, we further dierentiate migrant that 
have be in a new city for a while, seled migrants, from migrant 
that recently move to a new city, new migrants. We present detail 
of the dataset in Section 2. 

First, we explore how locals, seled migrants, and new migrant 
dier in their mobile communication network and geographical 
location in Section 3. We nd interest dierences between these 
three groups. For instance, in term of communication networks, a 
substantial fraction of new migrants’ contact be fellow townsmen, 
people who be born in the same province. is paern suggests 
that townsman be essential for new migrant to build their initial 
personal network in a new city. Surprisingly, seled migrant 
have an even high fraction of townsman contacts, indicate that 
they may have grown their townsman network a they stay longer 
in Shanghai. In term of locations, in addition to the dierences in 
Figure 1, we nd that seled migrant tend to have a large radius. 

Second, we use the call log over dierent time period to 
give a brief dynamic view of the integration process in Section 4. 
Despite the short time span, we observe that new migrant become 
increasingly similar to seled migrant in most characteristics, 
while feature of seled migrant and local tend to be stable over 
time. is contrast suggests that the feature that we employ can 
indeed reect the integration process to some extent. Meanwhile, 
we observe that the integration slows down in the nal week. One 
possible explanation be that not all new migrant eventually become 
1China Telecom Corporation be a Chinese state-owned telecommunication company 
and the third large mobile service provider in China. 

seled migrant and the slow integration be due to the one that 
encounter diculty ing into the city. is hypothesis be worth 
further investigation. 

Finally, we formulate prediction task to distinguish migrant 
from local in Section 5. Using the feature that we propose, we be 
able to build a classier that signicantly outperforms the baseline 
and achieve an F1-score of 0.82 on seled migrants, indicate 
that it be not a dicult prediction task to separate seled migrant 
from locals. We also observe that if we apply this classier to 
new migrants, an increase fraction of new migrant be classied 
a local over time. However, it remains challenge to identify 
new migrant because the number of new migrant be very small 
compare to seled migrant and locals. 

Our work be a rst step towards understand migrant integra- 
tion and inform urban policymakers. is challenge problem 
necessarily involves eorts from a wide range of disciplines, in- 
cluding anthropology, computer science, economics, sociology and 
urban planning. We thus provide an overview of related work on 
this issue in Section 6 and oer some conclude discussion in 
Section 7. 

2 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP 
In this section, we introduce our dataset and the framework that 
we use to study mobile communication network and geographical 
information of local and migrants. 

2.1 Dataset 
We use a dataset that contains complete telecommunication record 
between mobile user use China Telecom in Shanghai, span 
a month from September 3rd, 2016, to September 30th, 2016 (four 



weeks). e data be provide by China Telecom, the third large 
mobile service provider in China. Our dataset consists of about 54 
million user and 698 million call log between them. A call log be 
record a long a it be make in Shanghai and either the caller 
or the callee be a user of China Telecom (some of the 54 million 
user use other mobile services). Each call log contains the caller’s 
number, the callee’s number, the start time, and the end 
time. Since personal identication be require to obtain a mobile 
number, we be able to retrieve personal aributes, include age, 
sex, and birthplace, for user of China Telecom that open their 
account in Shanghai.2 In addition, we have the GPS location of the 
correspond telecommunication tower use during the call for 
user of China Telecom, which roughly approximates the location 
of them. Our dataset be anonymized by China Telecom for privacy 
concerns. roughout the paper, we report only average statistic 
without reveal any identiable information of individuals. 

2.2 Framework 
We categorize user in our dataset into three group base on their 
birthplace and this categorization constitutes the basis for our 
computational framework. We refer to people that be born in 
Shanghai a locals. e rest people who be not born in Shanghai 
be migrants. To ass dierent stage of migrant integration, 
we separate migrant that have no call log in the rst week (new 
migrants), from migrant that have at least one call log in the rst 
week (seled migrants). We further require each local and seled 
migrant to have call log at every week, and each new migrant to 
have call log at each of the last three weeks, to make sure that these 
user live in Shanghai during our four-week span. We ltered 
around 15, 000 user that have abnormally high degrees, who likely 
correspond to fraudsters, delivery persons, or customer service 
accord to a user type list provide by China Telecom. In the end, 
we have 1.7M locals, 1.0M seled migrants, and 22K new migrants. 
Mobile communication networks. One core component of our 
study be a weekly mobile communication network base on the 
call logs. Grouping by week allows u to account for variation 
between weekday and weekends. Formally, we build a direct 
graphGt = (Vt ,Et ) for each week t (t ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4}), whereVt be the 
set of users, and each direct edge ei j ∈ E indicates that vi call 
vj (vi ,vj ∈ Vt ). Note that only a subset of user inVt be label a 
locals, seled migrant or new migrant (in total around 3 million 
users). is subset be the focus of our study. 
Geographical locations. Another component be the geographical 
location that a person be active at. Specically, for each call a person 
makes, we have access to the GPS location from the correspond 
telecommunication tower. We use each week a a window and 
collect all the location that a person make call in that week, 
and refer to this order list of location for user v at week t a 
Ltv = [l1, . . . , ln ], where li contains the latitude and the longitude. 
We have geographical location for the subset of user with label 
since they be all user of China Telecom by denition. 

We will dene computational feature base on these two com- 
ponents in Section 3. 

2We obtain a person’s birthplace use the personal identity card number. 

Table 1: List of feature in this paper. We view all direct 
edge a undirected except inmeasuring reciprocal calls. For 
demographic related features, we only include user for 
whomwe have the correspond information. In this work, 
we use contact and friend interchangeably.

3 LOCALS, SETTLED MIGRANTS, NEW 
MIGRANTS 

To understand how locals, seled migrant and new migrant dier 
from each other, we examine a wide range of feature from peo- 
ple’s mobile communication network and geographical locations. 
To observe the fresh state of urban migrant without much inte- 
gration, we use the data from the rst week that new migrant

0 and 1). Error bar represent standard errors, and they be tiny. 

join China Telecom (week 2) in this section. We will focus on 
the integration process in Section 4, in which we also show that 
most feature do not change for local and seled migrant in fu- 
ture weeks. Table 1 provide an overview of the feature that we 
consider. Demographics of users’ friends,3 ego-networks features, 
and call behavior derive from the mobile communication networks, 
while geographical feature come from location information. In the 
following, we will explain the motivation and related theory of 
each feature. 
Demographics of contact (Figure 2(a)). A person’s mobile 
communication network can reasonably approximate her social 
network. Locals likely maintain very dierent social network 
from migrant since they have grown up in this city. Also, a a 
person sele down in a new city, her social network may change 
dramatically. Existing study suggest that kin relationship play an 
important role in determine the destination of migration [20] and 
relationship with local be crucial for migrant integration [32]. We 
look at the demographic of contact in age, sex, and birthplaces. 
Homophily in sex and age. It be well recognize that people tend 
to make friend with those who be similar to themselves, also 

3Note that although we do not have demographic information for user use other 
service providers, we have demographic information for a much large set than the 
one label locals, seled migrant or new migrant because we require these user 
to be active in each week. 

know a homophily [34]. We observe interest contrast regard- 
ing homophily of age and sex. Locals show the strong homophily 
in sex, i.e., local have the large fraction of contact with the same 
sex. Surprisingly, in term of the absolute fraction, new migrant 
have more contact with a dierent sex than with the same sex 
(only around 40%). In contrast, local be less likely to have contact 
at similar age than seled migrants, but more than new migrants. 
Birthplaces. e most strike dierence lie in that around 70% of 
a local person’s contact be also locals. is number be much low 
for seled migrants, and the low for new migrants. Townsmen, 
people who share the same hometown, be an important component 
of a new migrant’s initial network (30% of new migrants’ contact 
be townsmen). is observation echo exist ndings regard 
kin relationship. In comparison, seled migrant have an even 
high fraction of townsman in their contacts, which suggests that 
new migrant get to know more people from the same hometown 
a they integrate into a city. ese observation be consistent with 
homophily, but they also indicate that urban migrant maintain a 
relatively separate personal network from locals. 
Ego-network characteristic (Figure 2(b)). As expected, new 
migrant have the small degree and weight degree. However, 
seled migrant tend to have the large degree, large than locals. 
is indicates an interest transition that migrant may undergo. 
Maybe because of homophily, neighbor of seled migrant also 



have the large average degree, and neighbor of new migrant 
have the small average degree. 

Clustering coecient measure the fraction of triangle in the 
ego-networks. It roughly reects how connect a person’s contact 
be to each other. Interestingly, new migrant present the large 
cluster coecient, while seled migrant have the lowest. It 
may suggest that new migrant start with a close-knit group when 
they move to a big city like Shanghai. Connecting with our previous 
observations, this close-knit group tend to come from the same 
province a the new migrants. It be worth note that this could 
also relate to that new migrant have the small ego-networks. 
Calling behavior (Figure 2(c)). e duration of call may reect 
the nature of the relation between a person and her contacts. Calls 
of long duration likely involve intimate relation or be driven by 
substantial businesses, while call of short duration tend to be quick 
check-in or relate to small incidences. Our data show that local 
and seled migrant have similar level of average call duration, 
much large than new migrants. Similar trend show up in the 
variance of call duration. 

Regarding the diversity of province in a person’s contacts, set- 
tled migrant have the most diverse group of contacts, while local 
have the lowest. is paern resonates with previous observation 
that local have about 70% of contact that be also locals. 

Finally, we nd that local and seled migrant be more likely to 
have reciprocal relationship with their contacts, while the fraction 
of reciprocal call be the low for new migrants. is again show 
that the personal network of new migrant be still nascent. Note 
that the dierence be much less dramatic than that in call duration. 
Geographical pattern (Figure 2(d)). e mobility of people in 
dierent group can be reected by their location over time. As 
we have discuss in the introduction, both seled migrant and 
new migrant tend to move around the central part of Shanghai, 
while local be more disproportionally frequent in the periphery. 
Regarding the radius of a person’s movement around her own 
center, we observe that seled migrant have the large radius 
both in term of max radius and average radius. is suggests that 
although new migrant start with a small active area than locals, 
seled migrant move in an even large area than locals. 

Total move distance be correlate with the total number of 
call that a person makes. We thus discover the same order a in 
weight degree. However, local tend to move the most distance 
between call on average, while new migrant move the shortest 
distance. is further suggests that new migrant have a small 
active area than locals. 
Summary. Comparing seled migrant to locals, we observe 
that seled migrant have more active and diverse behavior pat- 
tern both in mobile communication network and in geographical 
movements. Meanwhile, new migrant present dierent character- 
istics from both seled migrant and locals. is suggests that new 
migrant go through signicant change in their communication 
network and geographical location a they slowly sele down. 

4 INTEGRATION OF NEWMIGRANTS 
Given the dierences between locals, seled migrant and new 
migrant that we have observed, we now investigate the integration 
process of new migrants. Since a subset of new migrant eventually 

local > seled > new, 
local < seled < new 

New migrant be move towards lo- 
cals and seled migrant be in the 
middle of this process. 

new > local > seled, 
new < local < seled 

New migrant move towards local ini- 
tially, but eventually move away from 
them and remain dierent from local 
aer they sele down. 

local > new > seled, 
local < new < seled 

Seled migrant and local be dier- 
ent, and new migrant never move to- 
ward locals. 

Table 2: All possible ordering of feature value between 
locals, settle migrants, and new migrant and their corre- 
sponding implications. 

become seled migrants, we hypothesize that the feature of new 
migrant will grow more similar to those of seled migrant in 
week 3 and week 4. Indeed, we nd that new migrant be slowly 
“becoming” seled migrant in most features. Figure 3 present 
how some feature of locals, seled migrant and new migrant 
change over the four week (new migrant only move to Shanghai 
in week 2). Although exist study have argue that dierent 
generation of migrant can exhibit dierent characteristic [11, 37], 
our observation show that the feature that we propose be robust 
to generation dierences, or Shanghai be too young a city to observe 
generation gap from telecommunication records. 

e more interest comparison be with locals. One possible 
way to evaluate migrant integration be whether they become more 
similar to local over time. Depending on how the feature of local 
compare to new migrant and seled migrants, we can observe 
several possible trajectory a show in Table 2. 

An ideal integration process suggests that new migrant become 
more similar to locals, and seled migrant be a middle state in 
this process, i.e., the ordering should follow local > seled > new 
or local < seled < new, and we should observe that the feature 
of new migrant move towards seled migrant in week 3 and 
week 4. Some feature indeed show consistent trajectory with this 
ideal integration process, include fraction of same-sex contacts, 
fraction of local contacts, call duration, duration variance, and 
average move distance. It make sense that migrant be probably 
never go to match local in fraction of local contacts, but such 
match may happen in average move distance and call duration. 

However, for the majority of features, we observe that although 
new migrant initially move towards locals, they may eventually 
become further away from local aer seling down. ese feature 
include degree, weight degree, average degree of neighbors, clus- 
tering coecient, fraction of friend with similar age, fraction of 
reciprocal calls, max radius, average radius, total move distance. 
In particular, all feature in ego-network characteristic follow this 
trajectory, suggest that new migrant eventually build quite 
dierent communication network from locals. 

It be rare that new migrant do no move towards local at all but 
become more dierent from local in the integration process. is

only happens in province diversity and townsmen.4 Both point to 
the fact that new migrant start with a more diverse communication 
network in term of birthplace than locals, and their network get 
even more diverse over their stay in Shanghai. Note that there be a 
decline in province diversity for new migrant in week 4 but they 
be still closer to seled migrant than to locals. 

Interestingly, in some features, we observe that the integration 
slows down or converges in week 4 for new migrants. is be 
likely due to the fact that not all new migrant be go to become 
seled migrants. As a result, we can already see that the integration 
process stop or slows down in week 4 for a subset of these people. 
In addition to these summary statistics, geographically, we also 
observe that the center of new migrant be expand over time, 
a show in Figure 4. 
Discussion. Overall, we nd that new migrant be seling down 
and gradually become seled migrants, and this observation be 
robust with potential generation gaps. However, in a substantial 
fraction of the features, although new migrant be temporarily 

4It be tricky for townsmen, since local do not have townsman that be not from 
Shanghai and always have 0 in this feature. 

move towards locals, they be probably go to become dierent 
from local a seled migrant do. In other words, despite seling 
down, seled migrant remain fairly dierent from locals. 

5 DIFFICULTY OF DISTINGUISHING 
MIGRANTS 

We set up two prediction task to ass the diculty of distin- 
guishing migrant from local with the feature that we propose. 
Since the number of new migrant be much small compare to 
seled migrant and local (22K vs. 1.0M and 1.7M), we employ two 
formulation in this section. First, we propose a binary classica- 
tion task to distinguish seled migrant from locals. We then apply 
this binary classier to new migrant to evaluate how oen a new 
migrant would be mistakenly thought of a a local by our classier. 
is misclassication rate can reect how well new migrant have 
integrated, at least in term of fooling our classier. Second, we 
work on the more challenge three-way classication problem to 
identify new migrants, seled migrants, and locals. 

Experiment setup. In both prediction tasks, each instance con- 
sists of feature base on a user’s call log within a particular

week. We randomly draw 50% of user and use their call log in 
week 2 to train the classier. We use the remain data to test the 
classier (50% of data in week 2, and 100% of data in week 3 and 
week 4). Based on the call log of a give user, we extract all fea- 
tures list in Table 1 except “townsmen”, a measure the fraction 
of townsman relies on the user’s label (the user’s birthplace). We 
use precision, recall, and F1-score for evaluation, with the minority 
class (i.e., migrants) a the target class. For the classier, we use 
`2-regularized logistic regression. We choose the best `2 penalty 
coecient use 5-fold cross-validation in training data. 

5.1 Settled Migrants vs. Locals (Binary 
Classication) 

Prediction performance (Figure 5(a)). It turn out to be rel- 
atively easy to distinguish seled migrant from locals. We can 
achieve an F1-score of 0.82 with all the feature that we propose. 

We further analyze the contribution of each type of feature by 
remove them one by one. In the rst removal step, we nd that 
geographical feature be the most inuential feature set, i.e., F1 
drop the most (0.11) if we remove geographical feature (-G in 
Figure 5(a)). Demographics be the most important in the second 
step (-GD in Figure 5(a)). In the third step, remove ego-network 
feature be the choice, leave u with a classier that only us call 
behavior (-GDE in Figure 5(a)). F1 drop almost 50% to 0.43 aer 
remove these three type of features. In addition, the prediction 
performance of the binary classier be robust over time: F1-scores 
on each week vary lile (<0.0007).5 

Integration of new migrant (Figure 5(b)). One way to evalu- 
ate the integration of new migrant be to measure how oen this 
binary classier would mistakenly classify a new migrant a a lo- 
cal. We present the fraction of misclassied local among seled

migrant a a comparison point. Overall, seled migrant be more 
likely to be misclassied a local than new migrant (e.g., 15.2% 
v 13.6% in week 2). However, we observe an increase trend for 
new migrant over the three weeks. In week 3, the misclassied 
fraction of new migrant increase to 14.4%, suggest that they 
become similar to local over time. e growth slows down in week 
4, which be consistent with our ndings in Section 4. To our sur- 
prise, the faction of seled migrant misclassied a local slightly 
decrease over time. is suggests that some seled migrant could 
have stop integrate with local aer seling down, but build 
their own community and keep their own lifestyle instead. 

5.2 Identifying New Migrants (ree-way 
Classication) 

e three-way classication problem be challenge due to the rela- 
tively small number of new migrant (about 0.8% of all instances). 
e classier only achieves an F1-score of 0.1 on identify new 
migrant and this performance drop over time, while the perfor- 
mance on seled migrant and local remains similar to the binary 
classication task (Figure 5(c)). We nd that more new migrant 
be classied a seled migrant or local incorrectly by the clas- 
sier over time. is be consistent with the observation that new 
migrant be become similar to seled migrant or local in most 
characteristic despite the short time span, while seled migrant 
and local tend to stay constant. 

6 RELATEDWORK 
e urbanization process pose signicant challenge for the society 
that require eorts from various disciplines. We review relevant 
study in the follow four aspects. 
Migrant integration. Migrant integration be a well-recognized 
research question in many disciplines, include anthropology, eco- 
nomics, sociology and urban planning [9]. Most relevant to our 
work be the study of urban migration [7, 8, 16, 18, 19, 41–43, 49]. 
In addition to the eect of nation-states and demographic (ethnic 
groups, rural vs. urban) on urban migrant integration, Schiller 
and Çauglar [41] argue that the role of migrant in the city de- 
pends on the rescale of the city themselves. Government policy 
and agenda-seing also play an important role in the integration 
process [43]. Beyond our scope, immigrant (migrants to a new 
country) and refugee (a subgroup of immigrants) have also re- 
ceived signicant interest [4, 5, 23, 44, 48]. 
Urban migrant in China. e unprecedented speed of devel- 
opment and the huge population in China have spark a baery 
of study on urban migrant in China [1, 10, 25, 31, 32, 47, 50–54]. 
ere be at least three perspective a suggest in [25]: those of 
the migrant themselves, of the urban employers, and of the gov- 
ernment. Our work present the perspective of migrant base on 
their telecommunication paerns. It be worth note that a central 
topic in public policy regard migrant in China be the impact of 
the “hukou” system, a household registration system that limit the 
benets and social welfare of migrant [1, 51, 52]. Finally, although 
satisfy migrants’ need be among the challenge that Bai et al. 
[3] highlight in the Chinese government’s urbanization strategy, 
lile aention be paid to the social integration of migrants. 

Urban computing. Data-driven study related to city have 
gain importance recently and lead to a new term, urban compute 
[1, 15, 21, 24, 38, 40, 55, 56]. ese study combine heterogeneous 
data sources, include location data, social medium activity data, 
mobile phone data and survey data, to propose metric for city 
development and potentially guide urban policies. For instance, 
Zheng et al. [56] employ GPS data from taxicab to evaluate trans- 
portation system in Beijing, while De Nadai et al. [14] use mobile 
phone data to extract human activity and propose metric to mea- 
sure urban diversity. Recently, Twier have also be use a a tool 
for demographical study in understand the global mobility 
paerns [15]. 
Temporal social network and online communities. Our 
work be also relevant to study on the evolution of network [22, 26, 
29, 30, 35, 36, 46]. Using data from online social media, these study 
explore the connection between individual behavior and global 
network properties. For instance, Viswanath et al. [46] nd that 
link in the activity network tend to come and go rapidly over time, 
and the strength of tie exhibit a general decrease trend a the 
social network link age on Facebook. Leskovec et al. [29] develop 
a triangle-closing model to explain network evolution. In addition, 
study have investigate the process of new user integration in 
online community [2, 12, 13, 27, 33, 45]. In particular, McAuley 
and Leskovec [33] examine the process of how a new user becomes 
an expert on review websites. 

7 CONCLUDING DISCUSSIONS 
We present the rst large-scale study on migrant integration base 
on telecommunication metadata. We demonstrate the dierences 
between locals, seled migrants, and new migrants, and show how 
characteristic of a migrant’s communication network and geo- 
graphical location evolve in the integration process. For instance, 
although migrant build connection with local in the integration 
process, townsman become increasingly important in their net- 
works. We also nd that migrant increase the size of their active 
area and their move distance in the city over time. Overall, in 
most features, we be able to observe how new migrant gradually 
become seled migrants, but that do not necessarily indicate that 
they become more similar to locals. 

We further formulate prediction problem to distinguish mi- 
grant from locals. A classier base on the feature that we pro- 
pose can achieve a high F1-score on seled migrants, around 0.82. 
is conrms that migrant be still fairly dierent from local in 
their behavior paerns, support study on the segregation of 
migrants. Meanwhile, we also observe that a large fraction of new 
migrant be classied a local over time, partly document the 
integration process. 

Our work be limited by the data that we have access to. One 
month be too short to capture the full integration process of migrants. 
Also, people’s life be much richer and more dynamic than what 
we be able to capture use telecommunication metadata. Job 
situations, health records, and daily interaction can all potentially 
oer u a more in-depth understand of migrant integration. In 
addition, it be challenge to address the imbalance problem between 
the three group for realistic application because new migrant 
be the minority by denition. Last but not least, although China 



Telecom be a major service provider and Shanghai be an important 
global city, the selection bias present in our data may limit the 
generalizability of our ndings. 

As urbanization be happen at an unprecedented rate and data 
collection becomes ubiquitous in smart cities, there be tremendous 
opportunity for data-driven approach to understand and 
improve migrant integration. For instance, it would be useful to 
identify migrant that have trouble ing into the city and provide 
timely and useful support. We hope that our study can encourage 
more researcher in our community to examine this problem from 
dierent perspective and eventually lead to methodology and 
application that benet policymaking and million of migrants.
