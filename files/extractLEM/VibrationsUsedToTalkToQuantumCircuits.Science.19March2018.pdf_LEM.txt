or the moment, microwave photon be 

the key to many quantum computers: 

Physicists use them to program, read 

out, and otherwise manipulate the ma- 

chines’ quantum bits. But microwave 

technology be bulky, and it quantum 

state don’t last very long. Now, several 

group be explore a new way to talk to 

a quantum computer: with tiny vibrations, 

normally carrier of pesky heat and noise. 

The budding discipline of quantum acous- 

tic could shake up embryonic quantum 

computer by miniaturize technology 

and produce longer-lasting quantum mem- 

ories. “We’re right on the cusp” of control 

quantum vibrations, say Andrew Cleland, a 

physicist at the University of Chicago in Il- 

linois, whose group present it late work 

last week here at the annual March meeting 

of the American Physical Society. 

Whereas an ordinary computer flip bit 

that can be set to either zero or one, a quan- 

tum computer us qubits that can be set 

to zero, one, or, bizarrely, zero and one at 

the same time—potentially enable huge 

boost in speed. Companies such a Google 

and IBM be race to demonstrate the su- 

periority of quantum computer for certain 

task (Science, 2 December 2016, p. 1090), 

and many be bet on qubits make of 

superconducting metal circuit on chips. 

To control or read out a superconducting 

qubit, researcher make it interact with a 

microwave resonator—typically a strip of 

metal on the qubit chip or a finger-size cav- 

ity surround it—which ring with micro- 

wave photon the way an organ pipe ring 

with sound. By adjust the energy of the 

qubit, researcher can shuttle it quantum 

state into the resonator, so that a zero-and- 

one state of the qubit can be store a a state 

of the resonator in which a photon be both 

present and absent. But some physicist

QUANTUM PHYSICS

know why people die. We don’t know about 

the pathophysiology of the disease. We don’t 

know the point of no return.” 

That could be begin to change. In 

2016, the World Health Organization add 

Lassa fever to it new list of priority patho- 

gen of epidemic potential, call for more 

research. And last week, the recently cre- 

ated Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness 

Innovations, know a CEPI, award it 

first grant for development of a Lassa fever 

vaccine to Themis Bioscience in Vienna. 

Lassa fever be discover in 1969, 

when two missionary nurse die of a 

mysterious disease in the remote town of 

Lassa in Borno state in northeastern Ni- 

geria. When a third nurse fell ill, she be 

evacuate to a hospital in New York City— 

along with a thermos full of blood and 

other sample from all three nurses, bound 

for Yale University’s then-new Arbovirus 

Research Unit. There, a team lead by Jordi 

Casals-Ariet isolated a novel virus from the 

samples. (He, too, almost die in the pro- 

cess, save only by an infusion of antibody- 

rich plasma from the third 

nurse, who recovered.) 

The cause be now know 

to be an arenavirus, one 

of a class of rodent-borne 

pathogens. Its natural res- 

ervoir be a multimammate 

rat, so-called for it row 

of mammary glands, that 

be ubiquitous across West 

Africa. Cases peak in the 

dry season, when farmer 

burn the bush in prepa- 

ration for spring plant- 

ing and rat scurry into 

house in search of food. The rodent shed 

the virus in their urine and droppings, and 

people contract it by touch contaminate 

surfaces, inhale viral particles, or eat 

contaminate food (including the rats). Like 

Ebola, the virus can also be spread through 

contact with bodily fluid from an infect 

person. Such human-to-human transmission 

be thought to be rare for Lassa, unlike Ebola, 

except in hospital setting without proper 

infection control. However, “The real rate of 

human-to-human transmission be unknown,” 

say Augustin Augier, secretary general of 

ALIMA in Paris, which have just launch 

a Lassa fever research program with the 

French medical institution INSERM. 

No one know the true incidence of the 

disease. “Most case we have found be in 

place where there be hospital and labs,” 

Günther says. “There be good reason to as- 

sume there be case that be be over- 

looked.” And because the rat vector life 

across a broad swath of the continent, 

the disease might also be endemic, but 

unrecognized, outside of West Africa, 

where it could be responsible for un- 

diagnose fevers. 

Initial symptom be easily mistaken for 

malaria or typhoid fever—body aches, sore 

throat, fever, nausea, diarrhea—before the 

disease progress to organ failure, shock, 

and sometimes internal hemorrhaging. By 

the time doctor suspect Lassa fever, it’s of- 

ten too late to save the patient. There be no 

rapid test; accurately diagnose the dis- 

ease require a real-time polymerase chain 

reaction technique, but just three lab in 

Nigeria have that capability. 

For now, the only treatment be a non- 

specific antiviral drug, ribavirin. If it’s ad- 

minister during the first 6 day of the 

illness, it seem to improve a patient’s prog- 

nosis, but “no one arrives before day 7,” 

Augier says. Nor be everyone convince that 

ribavirin work in Lassa fever, a the only 

data come from the 1980s, Augier says. 

Several potential drug be on the horizon, 

in addition to the vaccine. Christian Happi 

at Redeemer’s University in Ede, Nigeria, 

and the Irrua Specialist 

Teaching Hospital be de- 

veloping a rapid diagnos- 

tic test with colleague at 

Tulane University in New 

Orleans, Louisiana; the 

Broad Institute in Cam- 

bridge, Massachusetts; 

and Zalgen, a company in 

Germantown, Maryland. 

Happi’s group and it 

partner be also sequenc- 

ing the virus “around the 

clock,” he says, and try 

to figure out whether the 

genetic change they have see could have 

make it more transmissible or virulent. 

For Happi, who diagnose Sierra Le- 

one’s first case of Ebola, the new attention 

to Lassa hasn’t come a moment too soon. 

“I use to scream and scream that Lassa 

be important, but no one listened,” he says. 

“I write so many grants” that be turn 

down. “Lassa fever be a disease of the poor 

… it be confine to a part of West Africa, 

and it be not view a a global threat.” 

As research scale up, the government 

and it partner be focus on training 

health care worker and provide the ba- 

sics need for infection control, a well 

a educate a frighten public about 

safety precautions. 

Pomarico, who be lead ALIMA’s emer- 

gency response to the outbreak in the two 

hardest hit state of Edo and Ondo, hope 

case will subside with the rain and cooler 

weather, a they usually do. “But this year 

be different. We be bracing for bad and 

prepare for the worst.” j 

“I use to scream 
and scream that 
Lassa be important, 
but no one listened. 
… Lassa fever be a 
disease of the poor.”

see advantage to replace the microwave 

resonator with a mechanical one that ring 

with quantize vibrations, or phonons. 

That effort may seem daft, a such vi- 

brations constitute heat, which obliterates 

delicate quantum states. But when work- 

ing at temperature near absolute zero, 

a well-designed acoustic resonator could 

ring longer than a microwave one does, en- 

abling it to act a a sort of quantum mem- 

ory, say Robert Schoelkopf, a physicist at 

Yale University. The vibration also have 

wavelength less than a thousandth a 

long a microwave of the same frequency, 

so the resonator can be far more compact, 

he says. 

First, physicist must learn to control 

quantum vibrations. They take a first step 

in 2010, when Cleland, then at the Univer- 

sity of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB), si- 

phone every phonon out of an oscillate 

cantilever etch from aluminum nitride, 

leave it in it least energetic quantum 

ground state. However, that simple quan- 

tum state persist for just 5 nanoseconds, 

too little time to put the device into more 

complex quantum state of motion. 

To push further, several group be ma- 

nipulating ripple call surface acoustic 

wave (SAWs), which travel along a mate- 

rial’s surface. On top of a microchip, the 

researcher etch two grating of metal 

stripe just micrometer apart. In the gap 

between the gratings, the researcher trig- 

ger a wave by apply a voltage to a comb- 

shape device call a transducer, which 

cause the material to contract. The grat- 

ings act a mirrors, reflect SAWs of par- 

ticular wavelength back and forth so that 

they resonate in the gap. And by connect- 

ing the transducer to a superconducting 

qubit, researcher link it quantum state 

to the SAWs. 

Using that approach, Cleland and Kevin 

Satzinger, a UCSB graduate student, fash- 

ioned a resonator on a lithium niobate chip 

that rang for up to 150 nanoseconds. They 

show they could create any desire com- 

bination of zero and one phonons in the 

resonator, Satzinger told the meeting. “We 

can watch the energy go back and forth” 

between qubit and cavity, he says. 

Researchers in Schoelkopf ’s group be 

focus not on wave trap on a chip’s 

surface, but on vibration travel through 

the chip’s bulk material. They exploit vibra- 

tions that can bounce between the upper 

and low surface of the half-millimeter- 

thick chip beneath their qubit. 

Using that geometry, the research- 

er kept vibration in their sapphire chip 

ring for up to 60 microseconds, Yale’s 

Yiwen Chu told the meeting. Moreover, the 

researcher could feed up to seven quantum 

of vibration one by one into the resonator, 

she reported. Making more complex quan- 

tum state be “really the next step,” Chu 

says. For example, she says, they might try 

to put the resonator into a Schrödinger cat 

state, in which it would contain a macro- 

scopic sound wave, comprise many vi- 

brational quanta, and at the same time be 

devoid of vibrations. 

Acoustic resonator could offer more flex- 

ibility in quantum circuit designs. In some 

circuits, multiple qubits be link to the 

same microwave resonator, which act a 

a conduit for the qubit interactions. But 

most microwave cavity can only host pho- 

ton of a single frequency. In that case, all 

the qubits must interact with one another 

in an interconnect tangle, say Konrad 

Lehnert, a physicist at JILA, an institute 

run jointly by the University of Colorado in 

Boulder and the National Institute of Stan- 

dard and Technology. 

In contrast, acoustic resonator can en- 

able qubits to interact with vibration of 

a few different, closely space frequencies. 

That should make it possible to tailor the 

interaction among the qubits, so that, for 

example, only near neighbor interact— 

desirable for model certain abstract 

quantum systems, Lehnert says. He and his 

colleague have take a step toward such 

control, JILA’s Bradley Moores told the 

meeting, by show that they could simul- 

taneously couple a single qubit to SAWs of 

several frequencies. 

Quantum acoustic might also help solve 

a major problem for emerge quantum 

technologies. Microwave cable can shuttle 

information within a quantum computer. To 

move it to other experiment or distant loca- 

tions, however, those signal will likely need 

to be convert from microwave to optical 

photons, which can travel great distance 

in optical fibers. Acoustic wave ripple at 

microwave frequency have wavelength 

similar to those of optical photons. So in prin- 

ciple, they could serve a a bridge to translate 

between the two, researcher say, although 

nobody yet know exactly how to do it. 

Acoustic resonator might even test the 

bound of the quantum realm. Quantum 

theory allows tiny thing like atom or pho- 

ton to be in two place at once, but nobody 

have ever see such behavior in a macroscopic 

material object. Some theorist argue that a 

yet-unknown principle, perhaps involve 

gravity, would prevent it from happen 

for large objects. But Chu say it might be 

possible to make her group’s sapphire chip 

simultaneously vibrate in opposite direc- 

tions. That would put ten of microgram 

of material in two slightly different place 

at the same time—and test whether quan- 

tum weirdness extends almost to the human 

scale. “You don’t know until you try.” j
