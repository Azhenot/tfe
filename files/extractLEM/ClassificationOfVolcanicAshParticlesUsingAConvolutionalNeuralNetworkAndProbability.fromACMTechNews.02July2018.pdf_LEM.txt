Classification of volcanic ash 
particle use a convolutional 
neural network and probability 
Daigo Shoji1, Rina Noguchi2,5, Shizuka Otsuki3 & Hideitsu Hino4 

Analyses of volcanic ash be typically perform either by qualitatively classify ash particle by eye or 
by quantitatively parameterizing it shape and texture. While complex shape can be classify through 
qualitative analyses, the result be subjective due to the difficulty of categorize complex shape into 
a single class. Although quantitative analysis be objective, selection of shape parameter be required. 
Here, we apply a convolutional neural network (CNN) for the classification of volcanic ash. First, 
we define four basal particle shape (blocky, vesicular, elongated, rounded) generate by different 
eruption mechanism (e.g., brittle fragmentation), and then train the CNN use particle compose 
of only one basal shape. The CNN could recognize the basal shape with over 90% accuracy. Using the 
train network, we classify ash particle compose of multiple basal shape base on the output of 
the network, which can be interpret a a mix ratio of the four basal shapes. Clustering of sample 
by the average probability and the intensity be consistent with the eruption type. The mix ratio 
output by the CNN can be use to quantitatively classify complex shape in nature without categorize 
forcibly and without the need for shape parameters, which may lead to a new taxonomy. 

The shape of volcanic ash particle depends on the eruption type. Therefore, by analyze ash shape, we can 
good understand the physical mechanism of volcanic eruptions, which can help to mitigate volcanic hazards. 
Classification of volcanic ash particle have traditionally be perform visually1–3. Although human can recog- 
nize and categorize complex shape qualitatively without carry out calculations, due to bias and difference 
in level of experience, the result of such classification be often subjective. When we classify objects, they be typi- 
cally categorize into a single class that be independent from other classes. However, the shape of natural object 
such a volcanic ash be often too complex to categorize into a single class, even for experienced people. 

In order to solve this problem, objective method use shape parameter have be used4–14. Shape param- 
eters be define to quantitatively represent ash shape by combine geometric value such a perimeter and 
area8–14. Once the parameter be defined, the shape of an ash particle can be classify by calculate the parame- 
ters in an objective way that be free from human bias. Coupled with improvement in instrument for image ash 
particle and calculate shape parameters, quantitative analysis have become regard a effective for classify 
volcanic ash shape. For example, the Morphologi G3STM (Malvern InstrumentsTM) can rapidly measure the shape 
parameter and intensity of more than one thousand particles15, which be very useful for volcanic ash analysis9. 

However, one problem with quantitative analysis by parameterization be the selection of the parameter use 
to represent the ash shape correctly8, because the shape of volcanic ash be usually so complex that it cannot be 
described use only a single parameter. Although instrument such a the Morphologi can calculate parameter 
automatically, we still have to choose the shape parameter to be used. Thus far, many shape parameters, includ- 
ing fractal dimension, have be use for good understand and classify ash shapes8–14. While quantitative 
analysis be objective once the parameter be decided, define and select effective parameter be difficult. In 
order to ass the effective parameters, statistical analysis (multivariate and discriminant analyses) have be 
performed8,13, which can reduce the number of parameters. However, prior to the statistical analyses, we have to

select a limited number of shape parameters. In addition, it be uncertain whether the quality of the particles, such 
a complicate surface texture, be parameterized in sufficient detail. 

Recently, in the field of machine learning, convolutional neural network (CNNs) have be utilized for shape 
recognition with great success16–18. A CNN contains layer that convolve the pixel intensity and send the convo- 
luted signal to the next layer. Finally, the last (fully-connected) layer of the CNN output the probability that the 
object be evaluate fall into each class. Each layer contains weight that be update during training by min- 
imizing a loss function. If training be perform effectively, a CNN can often recognize object with an accuracy 
comparable to that of humans. One advantage of CNNs be that we do not have to define complicate parameter 
to represent shape because the network automatically learns to categorize object during training. Moreover, 
once the CNN be trained, we can share the network and use it to categorize new objects. Thus, CNNs have a large 
potential to improve volcanic ash analysis by eliminate the individual bias associate with visual analysis and 
the difficulty in choose shape parameter that can effectively discriminate ash particle shapes. Here, we demon- 
strate this idea by classify volcanic ash particle generate by different type of eruption use a CNN. 

Preparation of Particle Images 
Locations of samples. In this work, we consider volcanic ash generate by three eruption types: mag- 
matic, phreatomagmatic, and rootless (Table 1). Magmatic eruption be cause by the vaporization of volatile con- 
tained in ascend magma by pressure release. If ascend magma make contact with external water such a 
ground water, this type of eruption be call a phreatomagmatic eruption. While magmatic and phreatomagmatic 
eruption be induced by magma ascend through the conduit, rootless eruption be cause by the interaction 
between lava and wet ground at the surface19. When lava flow on the wet ground, water in the substrate vaporizes 
and the pressure rise dramatically between the lava flow and the substrate, which induces an explosion. Due to 
the repeat overlap of active lava flow on water-saturated substrate, further explosion occur. 

The location where the ash particle be collect be show in Fig. 1. Every volcano in this study be a 
monogenetic basaltic volcano that have a similar bulk composition and phenocryst mode (Table 2). Funabara, 
Hachikuboyama, Hachinoyama, Inatori, and Sukumoyama (Sample IDs begin with FN, HK, HN, IT and SK in 
Table 1, respectively) be scoria cone in Izu Peninsula, which be form in the late Quaternary20. Whole sam- 
ples from Miyakejima (IDs begin with MJ and NP) be generate by the eruption in 1983. The eruption begin 
from the flank of the mountain (Oyama) and then propagate to the summit and the coastal area through a fis- 
sure vent system21. Samples with IDs begin with MJ and NP be fire fountain deposit and phreatomagmatic 
surge deposit (at an outcrop of Nippana tuff ring), respectively. Samples from Myvatn (IDs begin with MY) be 
product of explosive lava-water interaction i.e., rootless eruption, which occur in 2170 ± 38 cal yr BP22. This 
explosive interaction create a conical edifice (known a a rootless cone) through the ejection of fragment lava 
and water-saturated sediments.

FN and NP sample be collect from several layer at the outcrop (Fig. 1). Except for MJ16102402 and 
MJ16102403, every particle be sample from constituent material of pyroclastic cones. Examples of microscope 
image of the volcanic ash particle be show in Fig. 1. Each sample be sieve use screen after dry in an 
oven. Additional sample information, include particle size distribution and microscopic observations, be pro- 
vided in the Supplementary Information. 

Particle imaging. Because a large number of particle image be require to train a CNN, we use the 
Morphologi G3STM (Malvern Instruments) to image volcanic ash particles15. Morphologi be an automate particle 
analyzer that can detect the position and measure the size and shape parameter of thousand of particle in ten 
of minutes15. The image take by Morphologi be two-dimensional projection of particle disperse on a glass 
plate. In this study, we use particle with grain size of 2φ to 3φ (125 μm to 250 μm in diameter) because they 
exist in sufficient quantity for training a CNN and statistical analysis. To place the volcanic ash particle on the 
glass plate, we use a sample dispersion unit (SDU) with an injection pressure of 1.5 bar and an injection time of 
20 ms. We measure particle a 5 × magnification because this be the most suitable magnification to obtain the 
high-resolution shape of the particles9. During the measurement, the illumination be set to diascopic (bottom 
lighting) under automatic light calibration (calibration intensity of 80.00 and intensity tolerance of 0.20). The 
threshold for background separation (0 to 255) be set at 80 in order to obtain a sharp focus. The measurement 
last approximately 40 min for each sample. Among the measure particle images, some be unsuitable for use 
and be exclude by visual inspection: image contain dust and image of overexposed, non-isolated, or 
cut-off particles. To train the CNN, we resize every image to 50 × 50 pixel use Th-MakerX (http://www5. 
wind.ne.jp/miko/index-en.html).

Characteristic shape of particles. In this study, since we aim to analyze the volcanic ash characteristic 
for each sample, it be necessary to classify ash into some category of shape. Previous study have try to clas- 
sify volcanic ash particle into several categories: blocky11,12,23, vesicular8,12,23, mossy11,23, shard8, fluidal11, and

rounded23,24. Considering these studies, we apply four typical basal shape for volcanic ash particles: blocky, 
vesicular, elongated, and round (examples be show in Fig. 2). Blocky particle be close to rectangular, with 
relatively straight and nearly right-angle edges. Vesicular particle have a concave and irregular shape. Elongated 
particle be relatively long and thin. Rounded particle have a relatively smooth and round shape cause by 
surface tension within a fluid droplet before they cool. 

The origin of each particle shape depends on the eruption mechanism8,12,25. Blocky and vesicular particle 
reflect fragmentation and quench of magma, while elongate and round shape be related to ductile defor- 
mation24. In magmatic eruption, blocky particle be generally form due to brittle fragmentation of magma in 
the volcanic conduit and on the ground surface. Vesicular particle be form by rupture of vesiculate magma 
in the conduit during explosive eruption. On the other hand, fragment magma that have a low enough viscosity 
to deform form either elongate particle due to stretch or round particle due to the effect of surface ten- 
sion. Phreatomagmatic and rootless explosion occur due to rapid heat transfer from magma to water, which pro- 
duce explosive vaporization and result in brittle fragmentation1,23. Blocky and vesicular particle be generate 
by the quench of such magma fractures. On the other hand, ductile deformation of magma be cause by the 
fluid instability at the interface between magma and water11,23. Elongated and round particle with a smooth 
surface be form by the effect of surface tension during the time when the viscosity of magma be low. Rounded 
particle with a rough and cauliflower-like surface be form when the surface of magma clast cool faster than 
the effect of surface tension26. Our sample consist of juvenile volcanic ash and phenocrysts, which do not receive 
weather or hydrothermal alteration that could be count a blocky or rounded. Most of the phenocrysts have 
a blocky shape (plagioclase, pyroxene, magnetite, and olivine). 

Training of CNN 
Mixing ratio determine by CNN. Although the four class define above be the characteristic shape 
of the particle in our samples, a single particle be often a mixture of more than two basal shapes. This be because 
volcanic ash particle be generate by multiple process during fragmentation of magma and transport of pyro- 
clasts, which have several component such a melt and crystals. Thus, there be many particle with a complex 
shape that should not be force into a single class because not only do the classification become subjective but 
the property of the neglect class be discarded. 

One of the property of a CNN be that it can output probability that a single particle fall into each class. 
For example, if a particle have primarily one basal shape, the correspond class probability will be high and the 
probability of the other class will be very low. On the other hand, in the case of particle compose of multiple 
basal shapes, two or more class will have a relatively high probability. Thus, these probability can be use to 
quantitatively express the mix ratio of basal shape present in a single particle, which be an impossible task for 
humans. Therefore, we first train the CNN use particle compose of only one of the four basal shape be 
consider (i.e., pure shapes). Then, use the train CNN, the probability for all four shape be calculate 
for every particle in the samples. 

Selection of basal image for training. We visually select image of particle that have only one basal 
shape, a show in Fig. 2, without any qualitative thresholds. Of the approximately 15,000 ash image acquired, 
the number of image correspond to particle compose of only blocky, vesicular, elongate and round 
shape be 245, 239, 248 and 245, respectively (every particle image we select be give at https://www.research- 
gate.net/publication/324495337_Training_particle_images_for_Classification_of _volcanic_ash_particles_ 
using_a_convolutional_neural_network_and_probability). These basal image be use to train the CNN. 

Although the purpose of this work be to classify particle shape without have to select shape parameters, 
in order to verify the shape of the particle in the basal images, we measure the average characteristic shape 
parameter (aspect ratio, convexity, high sensitivity (HS) circularity, and solidity) of the basal images, a show 
in Table 3 (definition and method be show in the Supplementary Information). Elongated particle have a low 
aspect ratio, and round one have high circularity, which be consistent with the definition of these classes. 
Vesicular particle be less circular compare with other class because we select particle that have large-scale 
concavity a the vesicular class. Particles of the blocky class have a large aspect ratio and small circularity 
compare with those belonging to the elongate and round classes, respectively. Thus, the basal image we 
select visually be distinguish relatively well. 

Of these images, we use 200 image for each class a the training images, and the rest of the image be 
place in the test set for evaluation of the network accuracy. The test image be not use for tune of CNN. 
After the training of each epoch, the accuracy of the network be evaluate base on how many test image be 
categorize into the correct classes. Although we also calculate the accuracy use the training images, the accu- 
racy by the test image be more important to evaluate the robustness of the CNN.

Structure and training of CNN. Training and test be perform use the Keras package (https:// 
keras.io), which be free and write in Python27. The structure of the CNN use in this study be show in Fig. 3. 
The image of the volcanic ash particle use be 50 × 50 pixels, and the pixel intensity be normalize to 
between 0 and 1 and use a the input signal of the CNN. First, the pixel intensity value be convolute use 
5 × 5 kernels. The number of kernel be set to 30, and thus 30 convolution map compose of 46 × 46 block 
be generated. Although we try training several models, and specifically investigate the effect of image pad- 
ding (including extra space around the images), the accuracy change little because our network have only one 
convolutional layer and the detailed feature around the image boundary be not so important for the four basal 
shapes. Thus, image padding, which be important for deeper network with many convolutional layers, be not 
consider in this work. The convolute map be pool use a 2 × 2 max pool layer, which result in 23 × 23 
block maps. The pool layer, which remove the effect of trivial movement of object in image and increase 
the robustness of the network to displacement of objects, have a stride equal to the length of the filter and selects 
the maximum value in each area (2 × 2 block). After the pooling, the signal be sent to an affine layer, and then 
the probability for each of the four class be calculated. 

One of the most serious problem for neural network be overfitting, which happens when a network be tune 
only for the training data and do not generalize well to unseen data (accuracy be high only on the training set). 
In the present study, the number of training image be small, which be a common cause of overfitting. Thus, in 
order to avoid overfitting, we add 50% dropout layer before the affine layers. A dropout layer randomly severs 
a specify percentage of interlayer connection of the network during each training iteration, which reduces 
the complexity of the network and thus prevents overfitting28. In the test phase, although every connection be 
used, signal be scale by the ratio of the cut of the connection28. The mini-batch size be set to 200 (in one 
epoch, 200 image be select randomly from the 800 training images) and the number of iteration in one epoch 
to update the weight of each layer be 20 (updating of weight use 200 mini-batch image be conduct 20 
time per epoch)27. The initial value of the weight be set use a Glorot uniform initializer, in which number 
be distribute uniformly within the range depend on the layer number29. Gradient descent with an Adam 
optimizer30 be use to update the weights. The probability and loss function be calculate use the softmax 
and cross-entropy functions, respectively, in the Keras library. 

Because the number of image be small, in order to avoid overfitting, 200 image in one mini-batch select 
in one epoch be rotated, flip horizontally and shift in one of four direction randomly at the start of each 
epoch. This procedure can increase the number of the training image virtually, even though the exact number 
do not change from 800. The range of the rotation angle be -180 degree to 180 degrees, and the maximum 
amount of shift be 10%. One image be augment by the combination of these operation in Keras27. The angle 
and width of rotation and shift be determine randomly within the maximum range, and flip occur 
randomly. Thus, one epoch corresponds to selection of one mini-batch, data augmentation, and then 20 iteration 
of weight updates. After one epoch, a new mini-batch be select and the same process be conducted. We 
train the CNN until the loss function and the accuracy become stable. 

Results 
Accuracy of CNN. The loss function and network accuracy a a function of epoch be show in Fig. 4. As 
the epoch number increases, the loss function use mini-batch decrease and the training and test accuracy 
increase. From the 80th epoch, the loss function becomes stable, so we decide to run 100 epochs. During train- 
ing, the training loss be high than the test loss (Fig. 4). This be because the regularization mechanism of the 
dropout layer be turn off at test time27. We confirm that the training loss and the test loss (and the accu- 
racies) become the same if the two dropout layer be removed. The accuracy of the CNN after 100 epoch be 
evaluate from test image to be approximately 92% (Fig. 4b). Because initial value of layer and the mini-batch 
be determine randomly, we train the CNN several times, and confirm that the correspond change in 
accuracy be negligible. 

We also conduct training with a small number of the training image (the number of the test image do not 
change). In the case of 100 image per class (400 image total), the accuracy of the network be approximately 
90%. Approximately 90% accuracy could often be achieve even with 50 image per class, and it decrease to

~86% at 20 training image per class. Thus, the minimum number require for classification of our data set be 
50 per class (200 total) in order to achieve ~90% accuracy. Because the image take by Morphologi have a rela- 
tively simple shape (only four class and the complicate surface texture be not shown), a sufficient number of 
training image be generate by augmentation (rotating, shifting, and flipping) even though the number of the 
original image be small. When the training data be not augmented, the accuracy be only ~80%, even with 
200 image per class, and overfitting occurred. Thus, in the case of data without augmentation, many more image 
(perhaps more than one thousand per one class) be needed. We note that the require number of image strongly 
depends on the structure of the network and the image themselves. If we be to consider the complicate 
pattern in, for example, scan electron microscopy (SEM) images, many image would be required, which be 
beyond the scope of this work. 

Mixing ratio of particles. Using the train network, we calculate the probability for each of the four 
class for every particle in the data set. Examples of probability calculate by the train CNN be show in 
Fig. 5. If these particle be primarily compose of two basal shapes, the probability for two class be rela- 
tively high, while only one probability be high for the particle compose of only one basal shape (e.g., Fig. 5g). In 
the case of Fig. 5h, three shape be mixed, so the probability of the vesicular class be relatively low compare 
with the particle in Fig. 5a and b. However, we note that not every combination of class be observe in our 
analyses. The round class be found to mainly mix with the blocky class. In addition, the number of particle 
compose of three basal shape (e.g., Fig. 5h) be small. The round particle select a training image have 
a high aspect ratio and circularity, which be in contrast to the elongate and vesicular shape (Table 3), i.e., the 

Figure 4. (a) Loss function and (b) training and test accuracy a a function of epoch number. 

Figure 5. Examples of ash particle with complex shape and correspond class probability for each of the

a the mix ratio of the four basal shapes.

round shape be exclusive from vesicular and elongate shape by definition of the classes. Thus, the probability 
of the round shape be not often found in combination with the vesicular and elongate shape with high 
probability. 

In this work, the training image be select from the large-scale structure of the particle, and thus some 
basal image contain small-scale structure such a concavity. Thus, uncertainty due to the effect of the small-scale 
structure could not be remove completely in evaluate the mix ratio. For example, even though some par- 
ticles have shallow or small concavity (e.g., Fig. 5e,d and j), the vesicular class probability for these particle be 
low. This be because we define the vesicular shape to be an irregular outline and concavity that can be recognize 
a a whole structure rather than part of it (Fig. 2). Thus, the probability by our CNN show the mix ratio of 
large-scale structure in one particle. If we limit the training image to more ideal shape (only particle without 
small-scale structures), accurate evaluation of small vesicular shape may be possible. However, because volcanic 
ash be not an artificial object, many more sample be require to collect good training images. Moreover, in the 
case of Fig. 5d, the CNN might recognize that the small concavity be the connection between blocky and elon- 
gate shape rather than vesicular structure, which also reduce the vesicular probability. Another caveat be that 
we use relatively low-resolution (50 × 50 pixel) image to reduce the computational time. Thus, the CNN might 
not recognize the small-scale structure of the particles. If high-resolution image be used, although the computa- 
tional time will increase, the effect of detailed morphology may be evaluate more accurately. These task require 
more image and can be consider in future studies. 

Averaged mix ratio and cluster of samples. As a next step, we select 18 sample from three 
areas, Funabara, Nippana, and Myvatn (formed by magmatic, phreatomagmatic, and rootless eruptions, respec- 
tively), and perform cluster of the sample base on the mean probability of the four basal shape average 
over every particle in each sample. Moreover, the probability ratio of basal shape over the three area pi be also 
calculate a = ∑ ∑p m n n/i j ij j j j, where mij and nj be the mean probability of basal shape i (one of four classes) in 
sample j and the number of particle in the sample, respectively. The summation be carry out for each area 
(Funabara, Nippana, and Myvatn). 

One caveat be that, with Morphologi images, detail of the surface texture cannot be observed. However, 
Morphologi can automatically calculate the pixel intensity for each particle15, which can provide rough infor- 
mation about the particle composition in term of the transparency under bottom lighting. Transparency can be 
an effective mean of extract glass fragment and transparent crystal from volcanic ash, which can play an 
important role in a discussion of the degree of quench and fragmentation of magma/lava3,31,32. To calculate 
ash transparency, complex parameterization be not required. Thus, we consider the transparency in addition to 
the class probabilities. 

Using Morphologi, we evaluate the mean (Im) and standard deviation (ISD) of the intensity of one particle (see 
the Supplementary Information for details), and thus there be 2 parameter per particle image. We average Im 
and ISD over one sample, and consider the average value, the standard deviation, and the median a the trans- 
parency of each sample. Thus, each sample have 4 parameter (averaged probabilities) for shape and 6 parameter 
for transparency. Cluster analysis be conduct use these 10 parameters. We perform hierarchical cluster- 
ing (Ward’s method33) in R34 base on the Euclidean distance between each pair of samples. 

Table 4 show the mean probability of basal shape and transparency value for each sample. The average 
probability over each area (three different eruption types) pi be show in Fig. 6. In every sample, the most domi- 
nant shape be blocky. In particular, particle of Funabara (FN) consist of more than 50% blocky shape on average 
(Fig. 6). The probability of the vesicular and elongate shape be high (more than 30% and 10%, respectively) 
for the low layer of Nippana (NP15113001–NP15113003). The MY13091305 particle also have a high proba- 
bility for the elongate shape. On the other hand, the probability for the round shape be small for the Nippana 
sample (Fig. 6). In addition to vesicularity and elongation of particles, transparency be also high for the Nippana 
sample (there be many transparent particle in the Nippana samples) compare with the sample of Funabara 
(FN) and Myvatn (MY) (Table 4) because most of the particle in the Nippana sample be glass fragment (see 
the Supplementary Information). 

The reason why the blocky shape be dominant be that blocky particle be common in shape. As show above, 
blocky particle be general product in brittle fragmentation of magma, which be typical for magmatic eruption. 
The probability of more than 50% for the blocky shape for the Funabara sample can be explain in this way. 
Furthermore, the dominance of the blocky shape in the Nippana and Myvatn sample can be explain a follows: 
blocky, equant shape be the most frequently found in hydrovolcanic (magma-water interactions) ash23. The 
high probability of the vesicular shape in the low layer of Nippana (NP15113001–NP15113003) be consistent 
with general understand for basaltic phreatomagmatic products: fragmentation due to thermal shock and 
expansion of gas by the contact of vesiculate basaltic magma and external water produce vesicular glassy ash 
particles23. The high ratio for the elongate shape in the low layer of Nippana (NP15113001–NP15113003) and 
MY13091305 indicates the existence of fluidal shape particle (e.g., Supplementary Fig. S6), which be cause by 
the elongation of low-viscosity magma during eruption. The effect of elongate crystal can be exclude because 
the sample in this work be form in a short duration, in which case it be difficult to vary the phenocryst 
component and proportions. The dominance of round particle in the Myvatn sample may correspond to the 
existence of “mossy grain”, which be described for Icelandic rootless tephra11. Mossy morphology be form by 
hydrodynamic fragmentation of deformable lava if the effect of viscosity be more dominant than the effect of 
surface tension11. In the case of MY13091402, the high ratio of the round shape be consistent with the existence 
of hollow spherule (see Supplementary Fig. S8 and the Supplementary Information for details). For FN15101206, 
FN15101208, and NP16102407, the reason for the high round shape probability may be surface tension11,26. 

The cluster of sample be show in Fig. 7. The cluster be consistent with the difference between the three 
region (differences in eruption type). In the dendrogram, first, most Nippana sample be distinguish from 



www.nature.com/scientificreports/

the others, then the Funabara and Myvatn sample be separated. The cluster be also consistent with the stra- 
tigraphy: NP15113001–NP15113003 (lower part of Nippana tuff ring), and NP15113004–NP15113006 (upper 
part of Nippana tuff ring). This be also the case for the Funabara samples, although FN15113007 do not follow. 

NP16102407, MY13091305, and MY13091402 be not classify consistently with their eruption type. 
However, this can be explain by the difference in the stratigraphic position and geospatial distribution of the 
sampling. MY13091305 be collect from the low part of a rootless cone (Fig. 1), and contains information 
about the early stage of lava-water interaction, which be consider to possibly be a energetic a a phreatomag- 
matic explosion35. MY13091402 be collect in Hagi, where the lava flow down approximately 45 km from 
the fissure vent (Fig. 1). Therefore, this sample may be different from other sample of rootless eruption due to 
different conditions, such a lava temperature and availability of water during the explosions. NP16102407 be 
separate from other phreatomagmatic sample (Fig. 1). It be know that, at the time of the formation, a magmatic 
eruption take place concurrently at an extremely close range (less than 300 m)21. Thus, NP16102407 might be a 
mixture of ash particle generate by phreatomagmatic and magmatic eruptions, and be therefore consider to 
be distinct from other phreatomagmatic samples. 

Discussion 
Future works. In this work, because Morphologi be use to quickly acquire many images, the detailed 
surface texture of the particles, other than the transparency, could not be imaged. Surface texture also contains 
information about eruption type, a both qualitative and quantitative analysis have indicated1,4,5,36. Thus, we be

planning to apply this method to other type of images, such a SEM images, which provide such detail3,5,36, with 
the goal of training our CNN to recognize particle texture. 

In order to increase the robustness of the particle classification by CNN, much more image should be pre- 
par and test with several condition (e.g., different location, resolution and class). As we mentioned, our basal 
image be select from large structure. More accurate mix ratio may be obtain if the training image 
be limited to more ideal shapes, which do not have small-scale structure. However, the number of particle with 
ideal shape be very small. To solve the problem of the amount of images, a database of volcanic ash images9 will be 
useful for further studies. The structure of CNN also should be discuss especially when the complicate texture 
of particle be take into account. 

Suggestion of new taxonomy approach. Other than volcanic ash, our approach use probability 
(mixing ratio) be applicable to classification of other object in nature, such a organism and fossil that be 
difficult to categorize into unique species37. Although an important principle of classification be that one object 
be categorize into one class and that every class be independent, in the case of natural objects, characteristic of 
several class be often present in a single object. Thus, classification by the naked eye becomes subjective if we 
forcibly assign such natural object into a single class. On the other hand, visual classification have the advantage 
that qualitative characteristic can be take into account and that unlimited parameterization of complex shape 
be not required. As quantitative analysis of volcanic ash have shown8, the number of parameter increase a one 
seek a good representation of complex objects. A CNN can provide probability for each class (i.e., quantifi- 
cation of human recognition), which can be interpret a a mix ratio of basal shapes. Thus, in addition to 
the fact that a train CNN can be shared, even obscure object can be classify without forcibly assign them 
into a single class and without define numerous complex parameters, which may become a new direction of 
taxonomy. Further study and discussion with researcher in different field (e.g., geology, computer science, 
and biology) be important.
