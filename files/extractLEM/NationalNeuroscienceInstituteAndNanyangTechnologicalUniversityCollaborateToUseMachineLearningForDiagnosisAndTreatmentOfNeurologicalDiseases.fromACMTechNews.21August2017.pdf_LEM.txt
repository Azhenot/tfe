At first sight, good example of intelligent use of AI in medical domain, I mean, AI use a an enhancer of physician ability and NOT to replace physician expertise.

NNI and NTU collaborate to use machine learn for 
diagnosis and treatment of neurological disease 

Projects include the development of artificial intelligence system to accurately identify type of traumatic brain injury 
from CT scan and to precisely identify tissue during bran surgeries.

The National Neuroscience Institute (NNI[1]) and Nanyang Technological University, Singapore (NTU Singapore) announce a 
collaboration to develop innovative technology to good diagnose and treat patient with neurological condition such a 
Parkinson’s disease and brain injuries.

The project for the first year of fellowship include the development of artificial intelligence system to accurately identify type of 
traumatic brain injury from compute tomography (CT) scan and to precisely identify tissue during bran surgeries. 

Using machine learn to diagnose intracranial haemorrhage 

Traumatic brain injury, commonly know a head injury, be a lead cause of disability and death in adult below 40 year old in 
Singapore. Head injury can occur after traffic accidents, falls, fights, sport and recreational injuries. Every week, the National 
Neuroscience Institute see 20-30 patient with traumatic brain injury be admitted. 

CT brain scan be use to check for any intracranial haemorrhage or bleeding that occurs inside the skull, which could require 
surgery. The scan need to be interpret quickly and accurately by train doctor to ensure patient have the best outcomes, a 
delay of a few minute can mean the difference between a good and a poor outcome. 

The success of artificial intelligence computational algorithm in the field of decision-making in complex games, and in image 
classification task can potentially be translate into classify radiological images, such a those from CT brain scans. 

In this propose study, a machine learn algorithm will be train and apply to differentiate between CT image of different 
pattern of intracranial haemorrhage. The aim be to develop a rapid, accurate and automate process for reading CT brain scan to 
reduce the time need to initiate treatment. 

A machine learn approach to deep brain stimulation surgery 

Parkinson’s disease be a chronic and progressive neurological disorder that primarily affect a patient’s movement and ability to 
walk. It be also associate with mental health condition such a depression and dementia. Three out of every 1,000 people age 50 
year and old have this disease. 

Deep brain stimulation be a surgical procedure to implant a medical device in the brain. The device sends electrical impulse to 
specific target in the brain, change brain activity in a control manner and block abnormal nerve signal that cause 
symptom such a tremor and movement difficulties. Deep brain stimulation have be perform routinely for suitable patient 
from the NNI. 

For such procedures, a neurophysiologist us electrode to determine a target area in the brain. The neurosurgeon then implant the 
device in that location. This project aim to help doctor identify the location for the implant more precisely through machine 
learning. 

From analyse large amount of data transmit by the electrodes, machine learn can discover pattern that be previously not 
apparent and determine more precisely, section of the brain control critical function such a movement.

Fostering collaboration between medical practitioner and engineer 

This collaboration aim to groom multidisciplinary scientists, by provide student with first-hand exposure to various aspect of 
clinical medicine by interact with neurosurgeon in the course of their work. 

Over the next three years, the collaboration will foster closer work relation between medical practitioner and engineer through 
annual fellowship and student attachment programmes. 

Managed by NTU’s Institute for Health Technologies (HealthTech NTU), the one-year fellowship programme will see up to two 
neurosurgical resident at NNI work full-time with NTU professor on campus. Each resident will receive S$100,000 to complete 
and commercialise their projects. 

A student attachment programme that span a few week will also be introduced, allow NTU engineering student to work 
alongside neurosurgeon at NNI. 

Associate Professor Ng Wai Hoe, Medical Director of the National Neuroscience Institute, said, “Innovation occurs at intersection 
of disciplines, knowledge and expertise. Doctors have a deep understand of clinical need from their everyday interaction with 
patients. Our unique collaboration brings these medical need to engineering laboratory – an environment where imagination be 
encourage in the form of technological advance and capabilities.” 

Professor Lam Khin Yong, NTU’s Chief of Staff and Vice President for Research, said, “This collaboration creates a unique 
multidisciplinary research environment by integrate healthcare with both medical and engineering expertise from NTU’s Lee 
Kong Chian School of Medicine and College of Engineering. This will not only nurture next-generation doctor arm with a 
multidisciplinary skillset to meet Singapore’s healthcare needs, but also enhance medical technology to diagnose and treat 
neurological condition more effectively.” 

[1] NNI be the national specialist centre and regional centre for clinical referral for the management and treatment of the neurosciences, a well a for education and research conduct in 

the field.
