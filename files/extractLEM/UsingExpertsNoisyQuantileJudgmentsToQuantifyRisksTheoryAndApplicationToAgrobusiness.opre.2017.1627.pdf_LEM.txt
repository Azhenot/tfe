Abstract. Motivated by a unique agribusiness setting, this paper develops an optim- 
ization-based approach to estimate the mean and standard deviation of probability distri- 
butions from noisy quantile judgment provide by experts. The approach estimate the 
mean and standard deviation a weight linear combination of quantile judgments, 
where the weight be explicit function of the expert’s judgmental errors. The approach be 
analytically tractable, and provide flexibility to elicit any set of quantiles from an expert. 
The approach also establishes that use an expert’s quantile judgment to deduce the 
distribution parameter be equivalent to collect data with a specific sample size and 
enables combine the expert’s judgment with those of other experts. It also show ana- 
lytically that the weight for the mean add up to one and the weight for the standard 
deviation add up to zero—these property have be observe numerically in the liter- 
ature in the last 30 years, but without a systematic explanation. The theory have be in 
use at Dow AgroSciences for two year for make an annual decision worth $800 million. 
The use of the approach have result in the follow monetary benefits: (i) firm’s annual 
production investment have reduce by 6%–7% and (ii) profit have increase by 2%–3%. We 
discus the implementation at the firm, and provide practical guideline for use expert 
judgment for operational uncertainty in industrial settings.

1. Introduction and Industry Motivation 
1.1. Problem Context 
Understanding and quantify production-related 
uncertainty be critical for decision make in busi- 
nesses. The probability distribution for these uncer- 
tainties be usually estimate use historical data 
obtain during repetitive manufacturing. But these 
data may not be available when firm frequently 
launch new product in the market, e.g., at firm in the 
semiconductor and in the agribusiness industry. In the 
absence of historical data, these firm turn to domain 
expert for obtain subjective probability distribu- 
tions (e.g., Baker and Solak 2014). 
Prior literature (e.g., O’Hagan and Oakley 2004) ad- 

vise that in these situations, one should avoid ob- 
taining direct estimate of the standard deviation from 
domain expert a this quantity be not intuitive to esti- 
mate. This literature recommends obtain experts’ 
input in the form of judgment for specific discrete 
point ondistributions, for example, judgment for spe- 
cific quantiles, but also caution that these judgment 
be subject to judgmental error (Ravinder et al. 1988). 
However, a systematic approach that us these judg- 
ments to deduce the mean and standard deviation of 

probability distributions, while explicitly model and 
accounting for experts’ judgmental errors, be not yet estab- 
lished. In this paper, we accomplish this task. Specifi- 
cally, we develop an approach to deduce the mean and 
standard deviation use judgment provide by one 
or multiple expert for distribution quantiles (or frac- 
tiles). This approach be analytically tractable, provide 
theflexibility ofusing judgment for any set of quantiles 
that an expert be willing to provide, and be amenable to 
combine an expert’s quantile judgment with those 
of other experts. The approach also establishes a novel 
equivalence between the quality of an expert’s judg- 
ments and the size of an experimental sample that be 
equally informative about the distribution. 

This approach be developed to manage a dynamic 
new product development situation at Dow Agro- 
Sciences (DAS) for an annual decision worth $800 mil- 
lion. Analysis on the firm’s historical decision show 
that the use of the approach have result in the fol- 
low monetary benefits: (i) firm’s annual production 
investment have reduce by 6%–7% and (ii) profit have 
increase by 2%–3%. We also discus the implementa- 
tion of the approach developed at the firm, and prac-

tical guideline for seek expert judgment for opera- 
tional uncertainty in industrial situations. 
The rest of this paper be organize a follows. Sec- 

tion 2 provide an overview of our approach and 
the contribution to the exist literature. Sections 3 
and 4 discus amodel for deducingmean and standard 
deviation from quantile judgments, derive the solu- 
tion and it structural properties. Section 5 discus 
an equivalence of expertise with randomly collect 
data and result for combine judgment from mul- 
tiple experts. Section 6 describes implementation of 
the approach at DAS and quantification of benefit of 
use the approach. Section 7 concludes with insight 
for practice. 

2. Overview of Approach and Our 
Contributions to the Existing Literature 

2.1. Overview 
We develop an optimization-based approach to esti- 
mate the mean and standard deviation from quan- 
tile judgment provide by an expert; specifically, 
we obtain the minimum variance estimate of the 
mean and standard deviation of yield distribution a 
weight average of the quantile judgment provide 
by the expert, subject to the constraint that the esti- 
mate be unbiased. The model have two inputs. The 
first input be an identification of the quantiles for which 
the expert will provide judgments. For example, at 
DAS, the expert chose to provide judgment for the 
10th, 50th, and 75th quantiles because his software be 
set to show these quantiles during data analysis, and he 
be accustom to think about these quantiles. The 
second input be a quantification of the noise present 
in the expert’s judgment for the quantiles. This quan- 
tification be do separately by compare the expert’s 
judgment for the quantiles with the true value for 
a number of distribution construct use historical 
data. We discus this empirical estimation at DAS in 
Section 6. 

The solution to the optimization model assigns two 
set of weight to the quantile judgment (e.g., for 
the 10th, 50th, and 75th quantiles). The first set of 
weight be for estimate the mean a a weight aver- 
age of quantile judgments. The second set of weight 
be use similarly to estimate the standard deviation. 
The weight be specific to the noise quantify in the 
second input discuss above for the expert’s quantile 
judgments. 

2.2. Contributions to Literature 
A large body of literature considers situation in which 
expert provide their assessment for event with 
binary outcome (e.g., Ayvaci et al. 2017). In contrast, 
we focus on situation where continuous distribution 
need to be specify over the outcomes, and expert 
judgment be sought to estimate these probability distri- 

butions. Two stream of literature be relevant to our 
focus: (i) model of judgmental error and (ii) practice- 
driven literature on the use of expert judgments. 

2.2.1. Models on Model-Driven Theory on Judgments. 
The first stream of related literature be on model-driven 
theory of judgmental errors. The exist literature on 
expert judgment acknowledges the potential severity 
of judgmental error and focus on develop elici- 
tation guideline for reduce judgmental error (e.g., 
Koehler et al. 2002). In contrast, article on moment 
estimation from quantile judgment have explore the 
problem of deduce moment from the median and 
two additional symmetric quantiles (typically, the 5th 
and 95th) or four additional symmetric quantiles (typ- 
ically, the 5th, 25th, 75th, and 95th), numerically with a 
key assumption: no judgmental error be present. Pear- 
son and Tukey (1965) and Keefer and Bodily (1983) 
follow this paradigm. But no prior article consider 
the problemwhere subjective quantile judgment from 
multiple expert need to be combine to deduce the 
mean and standard deviation or the case where an 
expert provide judgment for an arbitrary set of quan- 
tile that be different from the standard one men- 
tioned above. We contribute to this literature by devel- 
oping a tractable solution approach to this problem. 
A salient feature of this approach be that one can use 
any set of quantile judgment that an expert can pro- 
vide (over the 5th, 25th, 75th, and 95th a discuss 
in the prior literature) to estimate the mean and stan- 
dard deviation. This feature be useful for practice since 
an expert may not be willing to provide quantile judg- 
ments for specific symmetric quantiles. For example, 
the expert at DAS be habituate to see the 10th, 
50th, and 75th quantiles for historical data on his soft- 
ware and be willing to estimate only these quantiles. 

The approach also provide the follow struc- 
tural insights. First, regardless of the magnitude of an 
expert’s judgmental error and the quantiles elicited, 
the variance-minimizing weight for the estimation 
of the mean and standard deviation add up to 1 
and 0, respectively. This structural property explains 
the numerical finding in Pearson and Tukey (1965), 
Lau et al. (1999), among others, who all assume that 
judgmental error do not exist. Second, our approach 
establishes a new quantification of expertise: it speci- 
fies the size of a random sample that would provide 
estimate of mean and standard deviation with the 
same precision a that of the estimate obtain use 
the expert’s judgment for quantiles. This equivalence 
enables an objective comparison of experts. Finally, in 
our approach, the optimal weight provide point esti- 
mate and variability in the estimate for the moments. 
This quantification of variability of moment estimate 
enables u to combine quantile judgment from multi- 
ple expert in a rational and consistent manner.

Prior literature, e.g., O’Hagan (1998), Stevens and 
O’Hagan (2002), discus the role of expert judgment 
in the absence of data for construct prior distri- 
butions; when data become available, posterior dis- 
tributions for parameter be obtain use Bayesian 
updating. The literature discus two cases. When 
conjugate prior be used, the posterior distribution 
be obtain in close form. When conjugate prior 
cannot be used, numerical approach must be use 
to obtain posterior distributions. We make two con- 
tributions to this literature. First, we develop a novel 
approach to obtain the prior distribution on the 
parameter for the mean and standard deviation of 
distribution use expert judgment for quantiles. 
Second, we show that the joint prior distribution 
be correlate and be not conjugate priors, and we 
develop a Copula-based approach to obtain the poste- 
rior distributions. 
2.2.2. Practice-Driven Tools and Insights. Our contri- 
butions to practice be a follows.We provide a step-by- 
step approach to quantify an expert’s judgmental 
error and then discus some practical issue observe 
during this quantification at DAS. Specifically, we dis- 
cuss a bootstrapping approach to separate judgmental 
error from sample error during the error quantifi- 
cation process. Then, we show that the information 
provide by the expert be equivalent to five to six year 
of data collection at DAS use our approach. Such 
quantification have not be report in practice litera- 
ture before. We also report that the expert at DAS be 
reluctant to provide judgment for extreme quantiles 
because of his inability to distinguish between random 
variation and systematic reason a cause of extreme 
outcomes. This observation suggests that contextual 
reason and experts’ preference can lead to elicitation 
of quantiles that be different from the standard val- 
ues (median and two or four symmetric quantiles); our 
approach be especially useful in such situations. 

3. Analytical Model 
We consider a real-valued continuous random vari- 
able X, whose distribution be to be estimated. The pro- 
bability density function (PDF) of X be denote a 
φ(x;θ), where θ � [θ1 , θ2]t be the parameter of the 
PDF, and µ1, µ2 denote the mean and standard devi- 
ation, respectively. Similar to Lindley (1987), O’Hagan 
(2006), we assume that the distribution family be know 
from the application context, but the parameter be 
not known. This framework be especially relevant to a 
number of operation context in which the parametric 
family of probability distribution be know from the 
historical data available or from formal models. The 
cumulative distribution function (CDF) of X be denote 
a Φ. A source of information such a an expert pro- 
vides quantile judgment x̂i correspond to probabil- 
ity CDF value pi for i � 1, 2, . . . ,m. In vector notation, 

we denote the quantile judgment a x̂ � [x̂1 , . . . , x̂m]t 
and probability value a p� [p1 , . . . , pm]t. 
We seek to develop an approach to deduce µ1 , µ2 

from the quantile judgment x̂. From theoretical and 
application perspective, it be desirable that the ap- 
proach’s formulation provide a unique solution to the 
problem, preferably in close form, and be amenable 
to sensitivity analysis. Prior literature in this domain 
(e.g., Keefer and Bodily 1983, Johnson 1998) also sug- 
gests that for an ease of implementation, the approach 
should be consistent with moment match and 
with other probability discretization practice in use, 
e.g., program evaluation and review technique (PERT) 
for project management. Our approach accomplishes 
these objective and additionally provide a quantifica- 
tion of the quality of expert’s judgment into an equiv- 
alent sample size. 

3.1. Preliminaries for Expert Judgments 
We assume that the quantile judgment be obtain 
use an underlie process or mental model (we dis- 
cuss the mental model use by the expert at DAS, 
in Figure 1, Section 6.1), which be error prone but be 
use consistently for generate quantile judgments. 
This assumption mean that the expert’s judgmental 
error be stable during elicitation. We further assume 
an additive error structure that be use frequently in the 
literature (e.g., Ravinder et al. 1988): the quantile judg- 
ment x̂i be compose of a true value xi and an additive 
error ei : 

x̂i � xi + ei . (1) 

In vector notation, the error model be x̂ � x + e. Con- 
sistent with this literature, we assume that the error ei 
have two parts: a systematic component or bias δi and 
a random component or noise �i , such that ei � δi + �i 
and E[�i] � 0. The bias δi capture the average devi- 
ation of the judgment for quantile i from the true 
value. The noise �i capture the spread in the error 
due to random variations. In vector notation, the bias 
and residual variation be denote a δ and �, respec- 
tively. The noise � be quantify in variance-covariance 
matrix Ω. The diagonal element of this matrix ωii � 
Var(�i) denote the variance in the unbiased judgment 
of quantile i. The off-diagonal element be covariance 
of unbiased judgment ωi j �Cov(�i , � j). We discus the 
empirical estimation of δ andΩ separately in Section 6, 
and assume for now that these quantity be available. 

From the bias judgment x̂, the unbiased judg- 
ments q̂ be obtain by remove bias a q̂ � x̂ − δ. 
Substituting this relationship into x̂ � x + e � x + δ+ �, 
we obtain 

q̂� x+ �. (2) 

The matrix Ω for � be use a an input in the optimiza- 
tion model discuss next.

3.2. Optimization Problem 
We seek to obtain the estimate of the mean µ̂1 and 
standard deviation µ̂2 a pool or weight linear 
function of the debiased quantile judgment a µ̂k � 
wtkq̂; k � 1, 2 with the weight w1 ≡ [w11 ,w12 , . . . ,w1m] 

t 

and w2 ≡ [w21 ,w22 , . . . ,w2m]t. Since the unbiased judg- 
ments q̂ be subject to noise �, the estimate µ̂k ; k � 1, 2 
have variance Var[wtkq̂]. Smaller value of the vari- 
ances of these estimate be desirable a it would imply 
that the estimate be more precise. To this end, it be 
desirable to select weight wk ; k � 1, 2 that lead to a 
small variance in the estimate µ̂k . We first restate the 
variance of estimate µ̂k in term of the weight a 

Var[µ̂k]�Var[wtkq̂] � E[(wtkq̂−E[wtkq̂])2] (3) 
� E[(wtk(x+ �) −E[wtk(x+ �)])2] 
� E[(wtk(x+ �) −wtkx)2] 
� E[wtk��twk]�wtkΩwk . (4) 

Prior literature (e.g., Bates and Granger 1969, Granger 
1980) show that only minimize this variance be not 
informative a it be minimize by set wk � 0 and 
the resultant weight linear estimate be always equal 
to µ̂k � 0 for all judgment q̂. This literature suggests 
add constraint tomake statistical estimate respon- 
sive to forecast or judgments. Our focus will be on 
a specific class of such constraints. We seek variance- 
minimize weight such that the obtain estimate 
wtkq̂ be unbiased, i.e., E[wtkq̂] � µk , lead to the fol- 
low optimization formulation for k � 1, 2: 

min 
wk 

Var[µ̂k]�wtkΩwk 
s.t. E[wtkq̂]� µk 

(5) 

Problem (5) consists of find the weight wk that 
lead to the minimum variance unbiased estimate 
of µk . In the next section, we determine these weight 
for location-scale distribution use structural proper- 
tie of these distributions. The focus on location-scale 
distribution be motivate by their widespread applica- 
tion in numerous operationsmanagement context (see 
Kelton and Law 2006, for a list of these applications) 
a well a their specific application at DAS, where the 
in-house statistic team have show use exist data 
that yield be normally distributed. This analysis be in 
Section 6.2. 

4. Solution: Weights for 
Quantile Judgments 

In Section 4.1 we specialize the problem (5) for distri- 
butions of a location-scale family, and obtain the opti- 
mal weight for quantile judgment and the weights’ 
structural property in Section 4.2. 

4.1. Reformulation and Solution for Distributions 
of a Location-Scale Family 

We now assume that X be a location-scale random vari- 
able with location and scale parameter θ1 ∈ � and 

θ2 ∈ �++, respectively, and transform the constraint 
E[wtkq̂] � µk in formulation (5) use two property of 
location-scale distributions. The first property enables 
u to rewrite the left-hand side (LHS) of this constraint 
a a function of θ1, θ2. If X be a location-scale ran- 
dom variable with PDF φ(·;θ), then a specific value x 
that corresponds to probability p can be express a 
x � θ1 + θ2z, where z denotes the value of standardize 
random variable with the standardize PDF φ(·; [0, 1]t) 
for probability p (Casella and Berger 2002, p. 116). We 
write this expression in vector form a 

x�Zθ, (6) 

where Z be the m×2 matrix form a Z� [1, z], z be the 
column vector of standardize quantiles correspond- 
ing to the probability p, and 1 be a column vector of 
ones. Substituting (6) into the LHS of the error model 
in (2), q̂� x+ �, it follow that 

E[wtkq̂]� E[wtk(x+ �)]�wtkE[x+ �]�wtkZθ. (7) 

The second property, formalize in Lemma 1 below, 
enables u to rewrite the right-hand side (RHS) of 
the unbiasedness constraint E[wtkq̂] � µk a a function 
of θ1 , θ2. 

Lemma 1 (Characterization of Location-Scale Moments). 
If X be a location-scale random variable with parameter θ� 
[θ1 , θ2]t with finite jth moment for j � 1, 2, . . ., then, 

(a) the raw moment E[X j] be give by E[X j] �∑ j 
i�0 

( j 
i 

) 
θ 

j 
1θ 

j−i 
2 κ j−i and 

(b) the central moment be give by E[(X − µ1) j] � 
θ 

j 
2 
∑ j 

i�0(−κ1)iκ j−i , 
where the constant κi be κ0 � 1 and κ j � E[Z j] for j � 
1, 2, . . . . 

The proof be in Appendix A1. The value of κ j be 
document in the literature for location-scale distri- 
butions (see, e.g., Johnson et al. 1994). For example, 
for a normal distribution, we have (κ0 , κ1 , κ2)� (1, 0, 1). 
It follow from part (a) of Lemma 1 that µ1 � E[X] � 
[1, κ1]θ. It follow from part (b) of the lemma that 
variance of X be equal to E[(X − µ1)2] � θ22(κ2 − κ21), 
and therefore the standard deviation be equal to µ2 �√ 

E[(X − µ1)2]� 
√ 
θ22(κ2 − κ21)� [0, 

√ 
κ2 − κ21]θ. We write 

both relationship in vector notation a 

µk � atkθ (8) 

with at1 � [1, κ1] and at2 � [0, 
√ 
κ2 − κ21]. 

Substituting (7) and (8) into the LHS and RHS of 
the constraint E[wtkq̂] � µk , respectively, we obtain the 
follow condition on the weight wk for the estimate 
wtkq̂ to be unbiased. This condition will help u solve 
the problem in a tractable form.

Proposition 1. If X be a random variable with a location- 
scale distribution, the weight linear estimator wtkq̂ be un- 
bias for µk , if and only if the weight wk satisfy 

Ztwk � ak ; k � 1, 2. (9) 

Proof. By definition, the estimate wtkq̂ be unbiased if 
and only if E[wtkq̂] � µk . Substituting (7) and (8) into 
the LHS and RHS of the constraint, it follow that the 
estimate be unbiased if and only if wtkZθ � a 

t 
kθ for all 

value of θ1 and θ2. It follow that the estimator be 
unbiased if and only if wtkZ � a 

t 
k , i.e., Z 

twk � ak ; k � 
1, 2. � 

The implication of the iff in Proposition 1 be that we 
can replace the constraint E[wtkq̂] � µk in formulation 
(5) with the condition on weight Ztwk � ak ; k � 1, 2. 
After this substitution, we obtain the formulation for 
k � 1, 2 a 

min 
wk 

wtkΩwk 

s.t. Ztwk � ak . 
(10) 

The matrix Ω be a covariance matrix, and therefore it 
must be positive semidefinite. It follow that the prob- 
lem (10) be a quadratic convex problem, and it solu- 
tion be obtain by solve a Lagrange formulation of 
the problem. The next result establishes this unique 
solution. 

Theorem 1. The weight that solve problem (10) be give 
by w∗k �Ω 

−1Z(ZtΩ−1Z)−1ak . 
The proof be in Appendix A2. The conspicuous fea- 

ture of the optimal weight w∗k be that they be explicit 
function of the expert’s precision encode inΩ. There- 
fore, a change in an expert’s precision in provide 
quantile judgment will modify Ω, which, in turn, 
will change the optimal weight w∗k for the quan- 
tile judgments. Finally, we note that the variance of 
the estimate Var[µ̂k] at the optimal weight be equal 
to Var[µ̂k] � w∗k 

tΩw∗k , which simplifies to Var[µ̂k] � 
atk(Z 

tΩ−1Z)−1ak , establish a direct link between the 
variance in the estimate µ̂k to the expert-specific Ω. 

4.2. Structural Properties and Generalization of 
Results Available in Literature 

The development thus far provide new generaliza- 
tions and insight to the exist literature. First, in our 
approach, the expert can provide judgment for any set 
of quantiles that he be comfortable estimating, i.e., he 
be no longer restrict to provide his judgment for 
the 5th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 95th quantiles a speci- 
fied in extant literature such a Lau et al. (1996). This 
flexibility be useful since we no longer need to convince 
an expert to provide judgment for these specific quan- 
tile and instead can focus on understand why the 
expert believe that he can provide good judgment 
for his chosen quantiles. We discus one such exam- 

ple in Section 6.2. The second generalization of our 
approach be that it provide an analytical foundation 
to a numerical property observe consistently in the 
exist literature that the weight add up to a constant 
a follows. 

Proposition 2. The optimal weight for quantiles add up to 
constants. Specifically, ∑mi�1 w∗1i � 1 and ∑mi�1 w∗2i � 0. 
The proof be in Appendix A3. This result be true 

regardless of the numerical value of Ω; therefore, it 
hold true even when the judgmental error be arbi- 
trarily small, e.g., when Ω � limλ→0 λI. A number of 
prior article (Pearson and Tukey 1965, Perry and Greig 
1975, Keefer and Bodily 1983, Johnson 1998) numer- 
ically discus the limit case when the error be 
absent. They select specific numerical test case of 
mean and standard deviation of a distribution and 
obtain the 5th, 50th, and 95th quantiles or other spe- 
cific symmetric quantiles for these cases. Then, they 
consider various set of candidate weights. For each set 
of weights, they estimate the mean of all test case a 
weight linear combination of the quantile values. 
Finally, they identify the set of weight that result in 
the small square deviation between the true and 
the estimate mean over all cases. A similar analy- 
si provide the weight to obtain the standard devia- 
tion. The weight recommend in this literature add 
up to 1 and 0 for the mean and standard deviation, 
respectively. Proposition 2 establishes that the additiv- 
ity property observe numerically in these article be 
structural property of probability distributions, and 
hold true for any magnitude of judgmental errors. 

Third, these additivity property be also share by 
the weight assign in the project management tech- 
nique PERT to the estimate for the optimistic, pes- 
simistic, and most likely scenarios. The weight for the 
mean be (1/6, 4/6, 1/6), respectively, for the estima- 
tion of the mean add up to one, and (−1/6, 0, 1/6) 
for the estimation of the standard deviation add 
up to zero. Fourth, one can show use straightfor- 
ward algebra that our approach automatically assigns 
low weight to a quantile judgment that have large 
noise. In situation where an expert provide a num- 
ber of quantile judgments, this feature be useful in 
identify which quantile judgment have large noise 
and be therefore not useful for the estimation of the 
moments; the weight for these quantile judgment 
will be negligible. 

5. Data Equivalence, Multiple Experts, and 
Other Relationships 

In Section 5.1, we determine the size of a randomly 
drawn sample that be equivalent in term of precision to 
the expert’s judgments. In Section 5.2 we discus com- 
bining judgment of one expert with the judgment 
from other experts. In Section 5.3, we discus the con-

sistency of the approach developed with least square 
and moment matching. 

5.1. Equivalence between Expertise and 
Size of a Random Sample 

Expert input be sought for estimate probability dis- 
tributions when collect data be costly. The expert’s 
quantile judgments, after use our approach, provide 
point-estimates µ̂k and the variance in these estimate 
Var[µ̂k]. We can compare this variance with the vari- 
ance of the mean and standard deviation obtain 
from a sample of random observation for X if data 
collection be possible. Specifically, it be well know that 
a sample mean have a variance of σ2/N1, where N1 be 
the sample size. In our approach, the variance in the 
estimate of the mean be equal to Var[µ̂1]�w∗1tΩw∗1 (see 
Appendix A4 for proof), which can be simplify to 
[1, κ1](ZtΩ−1Z)−1[1, κ1]t. By equate these two vari- 
ances, we can determine the size of a randomly col- 
lected sample that would provide the same precision 
of the estimate of the mean a the expert does. We call 
this size an equivalent sample size for the mean. A simi- 
lar analysis provide the equivalent sample size for the 
standard deviation. The next result provide expres- 
sion of these equivalent sample sizes. 
Proposition 3. The precision of the estimate µ̂k obtain 
use an expert’s quantile judgment with judgmental error 
matrixΩ be comparable to the precision of estimate obtain 
from an iid sample of size Nk , where 

N1 �

The proof be in Appendix A5. This result have two 
profound implications. First, use this result, multi- 
ple expert can be compare objectively base on their 
judgmental error quantify in Ω. More specifically, 
for two expert A and B with matrix ΩA and ΩB , the 
ratio of equivalent sample size be give a NA1 /NB1 
� ([1, κ1](ZtΩ−1B Z)−1[1, κ1]

), and they be 

independent of the true value of µ1 , µ2. For exam- 
ple, if NAk /NBk � 2, then the estimate of µk obtain 
from expert A be two time a reliable a the esti- 
mate obtain from expert B. This benefit from use 
expert A over expert B be equal to the benefit from 
double the sample size of experimental or field 
data for the purpose of estimate µk . Second, some 
recent literature (e.g., Akcay et al. 2011) quantifies the 
marginal benefit of improve estimate of probabil- 
ity distribution by collect more data before make 
decision under uncertainty. Proposition 3 provide 

a natural connection to these result by quantify 
the economic benefit of improve the precision in 
judgments. 

5.2. Combining Estimates from Multiple Experts 
The technical development extends to multiple expert 
j � 1, 2, . . . , n a follows. We first construct the com- 
bin matrix 

Ω� 

 
Ω11 Ω12 · · · Ω1n 
Ω12 Ω22 · · · Ω2n 
... 
Ω1n Ω2n · · · Ωnn 

 
where Ω11 be the m × m matrix for residual error of 
expert 1, the matrixΩ12 be the m ×m covariance matrix 
for the error of expert 1 and 2, and so on. Then, the 
matrix Ω be use in Theorem 1 along with matrix Zt of 
size 2×mn, Zt � [Zt1 Zt2 , . . . ,Ztn], where each Z j � [1, z j], 
z j be the column vector of standardize quantiles corre- 
sponding to the probability p j that expert j have cho- 
sen to provide judgment for, and 1 be a column vector 
of ones. The use of Theorem 1 provide mn weights; the 
first m weight for the first expert, the next m weight 
for the second expert, and so on. 

We discus a special case of interest here. Suppose n 
expert j � 1, 2, . . . , n provide judgment for the same 
set of quantiles, i.e., Zt � [Zt0 Zt0 , . . . ,Zt0], and the covari- 
ance matrix of each expert j be give by Ω j j � r jΩ0 ∀ j 
(i.e., the judgmental error structure of one expert be a 
scale version of another expert) and further assume 
that the error of any two expert be mutually inde- 
pendent, i.e., all element of Ωi j , i , j be equal to 0. 
The weight for the mn quantile judgment obtain 
use Theorem 1 be denote a w∗k with element w 

∗ 
kt 

for t � 1, 2, . . . ,mn and k � 1, 2. The first m weight be 
for expert 1, the next m weight be for expert 2, and 
so on. We can write these weight a w∗k � [w1k , . . . ,wnk ], 
where w jk be the vector of weight of expert j. We can 
also decompose the weight w∗k a the product of con- 
stant α j for expert j and a common weight vector of m 
weight wck that would be obtain if each expert be 
the only one available, i.e., w∗k � [α1wck , . . . , αnwck]. The 
value of α j and the relationship between w 

j 
k and w 

c 
k 

be a follows. 
Proposition 4. Consider expert j � 1, 2, . . . , n, whose co- 
variance matrix be r jΩ0; ∀ j, and further assume that the 
judgmental error across expert be mutually independent. 
Then, 

(i) If any expert j be the only expert available, the opti- 
mal weight for his unbiased judgment would be wck 

t 
� 

atk(Z0 
tΩ−10 Z0)−1Z0 

tΩ−10 independent of the value of r j . 
(ii) When the quantile judgment of the n expert be 

consider simultaneously, the weight for each expert j be 
obtain a w jk � α jw 

c 
k with α j � (1/r j)/R, where R �∑n 

j�1(1/r j). 
The proof be in Appendix A6. As an illustration, sup- 

pose that we have two expert with r1 �1 and r2 �2, i.e.,

expert 2 be half a precise a expert 1. Further, consider 
the case when 

Ω0 �

 
for the estimation of the 10th, 50th, and the 75th quan- 
tiles. If the quantile judgment of only expert j be con- 
sidered separately, the estimation weight be obtain 
a wcT1 � [−0.167 1.484 − 0.317] and wcT2 � [−0.576 
0.190 0.386] for either expert j by use

and Ω0 in Theorem 1, a state in part (i) of Proposi- 
tion 4. 

When both expert be available, the optimal weight 
for their quantile judgment be obtain by multi- 
ply the independent weight wck with the expert- 
specific marginal weight α j a w 

j 
k � α jw 

c 
k . It follow 

from part (ii) of the proposition that the expert-specific 
constant be α1 � (1/r1)/(3/2) � 2/3 and α2 � (1/r2)/ 
(3/2) � 1/3. The weight for the mean, for example, 
be obtain a w11 � (2/3) × (−0.167, 1.484,−0.317) � 
(−0.111, 0.989,−0.211) and w21 � (1/3) × (−0.167, 1.484, 
−0.317) � (−0.055, 0.495,−0.105) for expert 1 and 2, 
respectively. The same weight be also obtain di- 
rectly by first construct the combine matrix

and use it in Theorem 1 with matrix

which give w∗1 � [−0.111, 0.989,−0.211,−0.055, 0.495, 
−0.105]. 

5.3. Relationship with Classical Least Squares 
Regression and Moment Matching 

We now discus how our model and it solution be con- 
sistent with (i) the classical least square minimization- 
base regression framework and (ii) with moment 
matching. In the classical regression framework, the 
variance-covariance matrix be Ω � KΩ′, where K > 0 
be a scalar, the diagonal element of Ω′ be equal 
to 1, and the off-diagonal element be equal to 0, i.e., 
Ω′ � I. In our context, this would be the noninforma- 
tive case when the expert be equally good at estimate 
all quantiles and his judgmental error be mutually 
independent. We show in Theorem 1 that the opti- 
mal weight be equal to w∗k � Ω 

−1Z(ZtΩ−1Z)−1ak . 
Now, substitute Ω � KI, we obtain the weight a 

w∗k �Z(Z 
tZ)−1ak , or alternately, a the familiar kernel 

of the ordinary least square in the big parentheses: 
w∗k 

t 
� akt((ZZt)−1Zt). 

In the moment match framework, we would seek 
to minimize the square deviation of the debiased 
quantile judgment q̂i obtain from the expert for 
probability pi from the unobserved value of mean 
and standard deviation, i.e., we would seek to solve: 
minµ1 , µ2{ 

∑m 
i�1(Φ−1(pi ;µ1 , µ2) − q̂i)2}. This approach be 

codify in many commercial software (e.g., @RISK) 
and have be use in prior academic literature (e.g., 
Wallsten et al. 2013). For location-scale distributions, 
Φ−1(pi ;µ1 , µ2)�θ1+ziθ2. Using the property that θ1 � 
µ1 − (κ1/ 

√ 
κ2 − κ21)µ2 and θ2 � (1/ 

√ 
κ2 − κ21)µ2, we can 

rewrite this problem a 

min 
µ1 , µ2 

m∑ 
i�1 

( 
µ1 − 

κ1√ 
κ2 − κ21 

µ2 + zi 
µ2√ 
κ2 − κ21 

− q̂i 
)2 
. 

The next result establishes the classical least square 
and moment match a a special case of our 
approach. 

Proposition 5. Consider the original optimization prob- 
lem: minw wtkΩwk subject to E[wtkq̂]� µk . 

(1) This problem reduces to ordinary least square solu- 
tion when Ω� KΩ′, where Ω′ � I. 
(2) Consider the moment match problem in the form 

minµ1 , µ2{ 
∑m 

i�1(Φ−1(pi ;µ1 , µ2) − q̂i)2}. It’s solution be â � 
wTa q̂ for a ∈ {µ1 , µ2} and it be identical to the solution 
obtain from the original problem for Ω � KΩ′, where 
Ω′ � I. 

The proof be in Appendix A7. The second part of 
the proposition implies that give quantile judgment 
and no information for the noise in the judgments, 
the best estimate of the mean and standard deviation 
(under quadratic penalty) for location-scale distribu- 
tions be linear function of the quantile judgments. 
And these estimate coincide with solution obtain 
in our approach for the noninformative case of Ω � I. 
Our approach extends the moment match model to 
account for expert’s judgmental error a capture in 
Ω a minw wtkΩwk subject to E[wtkq̂] � µk for the case 
when information for the expert’s judgmental error 
be available, i.e., when Ω , KI. Finally, we note that 
our approach be amenable to Bayesian update use 
Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, and we omit 
detail for sake of brevity. We next discus the imple- 
mentation of the approach developed at DAS.

on the production of hybrid seed corn. DAS decides 
annually how many acre of land to use to produce 
hybrid seed corn. The yield, or amount of hybrid seed 
corn obtain per acre of land by DAS, be uncertain. 
Under this yield uncertainty, produce hybrid seed 
corn on a large plot of land may result in a surplus 
with a large up-front production cost if the realize 
yield be high; use a small plot of land may result 
in costly shortage if the realize yield be low. Math- 
ematical model that incorporate the yield distribu- 
tion can determine the optimal area of land that DAS 
should use, but the historical yield data be not avail- 
able for obtain a statistical distribution. The unique 
industry-specific reason for this lack of historical data 
be discuss next, but before discuss these reasons, 
we note an important characteristic of our focus. Our 
focus be on the production yield realize by DAS when 
it produce hybrid seeds, and this be the context in 
which the term yield will be use in the remainder of 
the paper. 
6.1.1. Biological Context for Expert Judgments. DAS 
have a pool of approximately 125 type of parent or 
purebred seed corn; each type have a unique genetic 
structure, and these purebred variety be use to pro- 
duce hybrid variety of seed corn. To replenish the 
stock of a specific parent seed, DAS plant this seed 
in a field. Self-pollination among the plant produce 
seed of the same type, this be why the parent seed 
be purebred seeds. This inbreeding be carry out reg- 
ularly to maintain inventory of parent seeds, and 
statistical distribution of the yield obtain during 
this inbreeding process be available from historical 
data. But these seed be not sell to farmers; rather, 
the seed sell to farmer be hybrid seed that be 
obtain by cross-mating pair of parent seeds. This 
cross-mating occurs when two different parent seed 
be plant in the field. Corn plant have male and 
female reproductive parts. Plants grow from the

parent seed of one type; say, X, be treat chemi- 
cally and physically (in a process call detasseling, 
e.g., see http://ntrdetassel.com/detasseling/) to make 
them act a female, and the plant grow from the 
parent seed of the other type; say, Y, be make to act 
a male. The cross-pollination between these parent 
produce the hybrid seeds. DAS offer more than 200 
variety of hybrid seed corn every year in the market 
target to diverse soil and climate zone of the con- 
tinental United States. Each variety be obtain from a 
different set of parents. 

Due to the rapid pace of innovation in this indus- 
try, the average life of hybrid variety be short. DAS 
produce and sell most hybrid variety only three or 
four time before replace them with new hybrids. 
Therefore, sufficient historical yield data necessary to 
obtain statistical distribution be not available formost 
hybrid seeds. In the absence of these data, DAS relies 
on a yield expert to estimate the yield distribution 
for produce the seeds. Before describe the process 
the expert uses, we note that a set of hybrid seed have 
also be produce and sell repetitively. The historical 
yield data of these hybrid serve an important purpose 
in our estimation approach. 
6.1.2. Expert’s Mental Model. The yield expert at DAS 
us a mental model for estimate the yield distribu- 
tion for the production of a hybrid seed without his- 
torical data. This model be illustrate in Figure 1 for 
the hybrid seed obtain by cross variety X and 
Y. Female parent plant (type X) provide the body on 
which the hybrid seed grows; the male parent plant 
(type Y) provide the pollen to fertilize the female plant. 
Since the female plant nurture the seed, the available 
statistical distribution for the inbreeding for type X 
provide a statistical benchmark (left part of Figure 1) 
for the hybrid seed. The male parent affect this distri- 
bution during cross-pollination through it pollinate 
power and other genetic characteristics, lead to var-

ious likely distribution a show in dot line in the 
right part of the figure. This may include a shift in the 
median and/or change in the spread of the distribu- 
tion. The expert’s contextual knowledge for the biology 
of both parent provide him with insight into how 
the distributionmight change during cross-pollination. 
6.1.3. Practice at DAS Before New Approach. In the 
past, the yield expert have adjust the median of the 
inbreeding female distribution high or low to pro- 
vide an estimate of themedian yield for the production 
of hybrid seed. Thus the estimate of the median seed 
production yield have be base on indirect data and 
be judgmental in nature. This median yield be use 
for production planning decision a follows. Man- 
agers would first calculate the area need a area � 
demand/median yield judgment and then increase it 
by 20% or 30% to account for high profit margins. In 
our interactions, manager articulate the need for a 
rigorous approach to estimate the spread in the uncer- 
tain yields, which could then be use to determine 
the number of acre for each hybrid use optimiza- 
tion models. Furthermore, since the yield expert be 
require to provide judgment for almost 200 hybrid 
seed within a span of two week every seed produc- 
tion season, it be necessary to develop an approach 
that could be implement within this time window. 
Our analytical approach accomplishes these tasks. 
In Section 6.2, we discus how our approach con- 

tinues to use the expert’s judgment for the median 
(that he have estimate in the past) to exploit the mental 
model that he have developed and use over year a 
well a two additional quantiles select by him. DAS 
make the production planning decision once a year, 
typically during January–February. Our approach be 
first use in 2014, and have be in use since then. In 
the first step of our implementation, we determine 
the bias vector δ, the matrix Ω of judgmental errors, 
and the matrix Z correspond to the quantiles for 
which the expert will provide judgments. This be 
do use historical yield data for a set of hybrid 
seed that have be produce repetitively in the past. 
Details of this step be in Section 6.2. From these quan- 
tities, we obtain the optimal weight w∗k ; k � 1, 2. 
Details of this determination be in Section 6.3. Finally, 
we quantify the benefit from use our approach 
use the data from the 2014 production planning deci- 
sions. This analysis be present in Section 6.4. In Sec- 
tion 6.5, we discus the integration of our approach 
into DAS’s operational decision making. 

6.2. Implementation: Data Collection at DAS and 
Calibration of Judgmental Errors 

The first task during the implementation be to col- 
lect data from the firm to determine the appropriate 
distribution to use to model yield uncertainty, and to 
calibrate the expert. We first describe this data and the 

Table 1. Tests to Accept/Reject Normality of Historical Yield 
Data for a Subset of Seeds 

Test: p value p value p value 
H0: Data be normal for seed 1 for seed 2 for seed 3

Lilliefors-van Soest test >0.20 >0.20 >0.20 
Cramer-von Mises test 0.92 0.56 0.59 
Ryan-Joiner test >0.10 >0.10 >0.10 

statistical test perform to determine the paramet- 
ric family of yield distributions. Then, we describe the 
process use for calibrate the expert at DAS. 

We ask DAS to identify a set of hybrid seed 
that have be produce repetitively in the last few 
years. Overall, DAS found L � 22 such hybrid seed 
indexed by l � 1, 2, . . . , 22 and provide u with the 
historical yield data for these seeds. Using this data 
and other sources, we sought to determine the appro- 
priate parametric family to model yield distribution. 
First, we analyze the available yield data and ran 
a battery of tests, include the Kolmogorov-Smirnov 
test, Anderson-Darling test, and Lilliefors-van Soest 
test and found that they all fail to reject the hypoth- 
esis that the data be normally distributed. Table 1 
show the result for three such seeds. These test only 
confirm that normality cannot be rule out. We then 
ran a second test to see if normality provide the best 
fit with the data. In this test, we determine the para- 
metric family with the best fit with the data use the 
chi-square test and Anderson-Darling test. The can- 
didate distribution be the normal distribution, the 
gamma distribution, the uniform distribution, the log- 
normal distribution, the beta distribution, the Gumbel 
distribution, the exponential distribution, the Weibull 
distribution, the logistic distribution, and the inverse 
normal distribution. The normal distribution be the 
best fit on the Anderson-Darling test for all hybrid 
seeds. On the chi-square test, the normal distribution 
provide the best fit for a majority of the seeds. 

In addition to this statistical proof for the hybrid 
seeds,DAShas extensive data for inbred seed that sup- 
port normality. Since the biological factor at play dur- 
ingplantgrowthare the same inhybrid seeds, theyields 
of the hybrid seed corn also would be normal. Recently, 
Comhaire and Papier (2015) also provide statistical 
evidence for normality of yield during seed corn pro- 
duction. After identify the normal distribution to be 
appropriate, we determine the quantiles that the yield 
expert at DAS be comfortable estimate (to obtain Z 
for the normal distribution), a well a determine his 
error structure (δ andΩ), a described next. 

6.2.1. Step 1: Selection of Quantiles for Elicitation and 
Determination of Z. For each of the hybrid seed l � 
1, 2, . . . , L, we ask the expert to select three quantiles

to estimate, without look at the historical yield data 
of these hybrids. The selection of three quantiles (rather 
than more than three) be motivate by exist liter- 
ature that suggests that three quantiles perform almost 
a well a five quantiles (Wallsten et al. 2013), a well 
a the time constraint face by the expert. The expert 
be an agricultural-scientist; he be well train in statis- 
tic and have work extensively with yield data. His 
quantitative background and experience be helpful 
a he clearly understood the probabilistic meaning and 
implication of quantiles. The first quantile he select 
be the 50th quantile since he have estimate this quan- 
tile regularly in the last few years. The extant literature 
alsohas establish that estimate this quantile have the 
intuitive 50–50 high-low interpretation that manager 
understandwell (O’Hagan 2006). 
We then ask the expert to provide u with his 

quantile judgment for two other quantiles, one in each 
tail of the yield distribution, that he be comfortable 
estimating. The yield expert chose to provide his judg- 
ments for the 10th and 75th quantiles for several rea- 
sons. First, he have developed familiarity with these 
quantiles in the last few years: his statistical software 
(JMP) typically provide a limited number of quantile 
values, include these two quantiles during data anal- 
ysis, and he be accustom to think about them. Sec- 
ond, the expert suggest the use of these asymmetric 
quantiles because if ask for symmetric quantiles, he 
would intuitively “estimate one-tail quantile and calcu- 
late the other symmetric quantile use the property 
of the normal distribution.” This will be equivalent to 
estimate only one quantile instead of two. 

Finally, the expert be not comfortable in provid- 
ing judgment for quantiles that be further out in 
the tails, such a the 1st and the 95th quantiles. This 
reluctancewas interest and highlight some subtle 
disconnect between theory and practice. Some arti- 
cles (e.g., Lau et al. 1998, Lau and Lau 1998) have sug- 
gested weight for extreme quantiles such a 1 per- 
centile, assume no judgmental errors. However, the 
expert found it difficult to estimate extreme quantiles. 
Specifically, he be concerned that he might not be 
able to differentiate between random variation (that 
we seek to capture) and act of nature such a torna- 
do and flood (that we seek to exclude since the yield 
expert cannot predict these events) that lead to extreme 
outcomes. 

We then determine the matrix Z for the 10th, 50th, 
and 75th quantiles. For the normal distribution, this 
matrix be calculate a 

Z� 
 
1 −1.28

1 0.67 

 , 
where the value of −1.28 be equal to the inverse of the 
standard normal distribution at the probability 0.1 and 
so on. 

6.2.2. Step 2: Elicitation Sequence and Consistency 
Check. For each distribution l, we obtain the three 
quantile judgment x̂il(pi); i � 1, 2, 3; l � 1, 2, . . . , 22; pi � 
0.1, 0.5, 0.75 from the expert; the expert do not have 
access to the historical yield data for these hybrid 
during this estimation. We obtain the expert’s judg- 
ments in two rounds. In Round 1, for each hybrid l, 
the expert follow his usual procedure for study 
the yield distribution for the female parent, look 
at the property of the male parent and provide 
his judgment for the median (see Figure 1). We then 
ask the expert to provide his quantile judgment for 
the 10th and 75th quantiles, in that order. This cus- 
tomized sequence be consistent with the extant liter- 
ature that suggests first obtain an assessment for 
50–50 odds (Garthwaite and Dickey 1985), and then 
focus further on quantiles in the tails. In Round 2 of 
estimation, to encourage a careful reconfirmation of the 
judgment provide in Round 1, we use a feedback 
mechanism. We use the information from two quan- 
tile judgment to make deduction about the third one, 
and then ask the expert to validate these deductions. 
If the expert do not concur with the deductions, we 
provide him an opportunity to fine tune the quantile 
judgments. 

As an example, consider a specific seed for which the 
expert provide value of 15, 70, and 100 for the 10th, 
50th, and 75th quantiles, respectively. The state val- 
ues of the 10th and 50th quantiles imply a mean yield 
of 70 and standard deviation of 42.92 for normally dis- 
tributed yields. These two value imply that there be 
a 50% chance that the yield will be between 41 and 
99 (the imply 25th and 75th quantile). We ask the 
yield expert the follow question: “Your estimate of 
the 10th quantile implies that there be a 50% chance that 
the yield will be between 41 and 99. If you think that 
this range should be narrower, please consider increas- 
ing the estimate of the 10th quantile. If you think the 
range should be wider, please consider decrease the 
estimate of the 10th quantile.” We implement this 
feedback in an automate fashion so that the value 
in the feedback question be generate automatically 
use his quantile estimates. The expert could revisit 
his input and the accompany feedback question any 
number of time before move to the next feedback 
question for the judgment for the 75th quantile (using 
the deduce 35th and 85th quantile value obtain 
from his judgment for the 50th and 75th quantiles). 
After finish this feedback, he move to the next 
seed. Throughout this process, we emphasize that the 
objective of this fine tune be to help him reflect on 
his estimate carefully without lead him to any spe- 
cific set of numbers. Analysis show that after this 
feedback, the standard deviation reduce by 33% for 
the tail quantiles in round 2, confirm that the feed- 
back be indeed helpful to the expert in improve the 
quality of his estimates.

6.2.3. Step 3: Separation of Sampling Errors Using 
Bootstrapping. After elicitation be complete, we 
quantify the judgmental error by compare the 
expert’s state value for the quantiles with the val- 
ues obtain from the historical data. For our analysis 
in Section 2, we assume that the true value of the 
quantiles xi be available. However, since the num- 
ber of data point for each seed at DAS be limited 
(the large sample size be 53), the quantile value 
obtain from the data be subject to sample varia- 
tions that need to be explicitly account for. Specif- 
ically, let x̃i denote the value of quantile i for the empir- 
ical distribution. Then, for the true value xi and the 
expert’s estimate x̂i , we have the follow decomposi- 
tion of errors: 

x̂i − x̃i � (x̂i − xi)+ (xi − x̃i) (11) 
Total Error� Judgmental Error+Sampling Error. (12) 

The comparison of the expert’s assessment x̂i with 
the empirical value x̃i have two source of errors: the 
expert’s judgmental error and the sample error. The 
judgmental error be the difference between the quan- 
tile judgment and the true quantile (x̂i − xi). The sam- 
pling error (xi − x̃i) capture the data variability that be 
present because the empirical distribution be base on 
a random sample of limited size from the population. 
The expert do not see the historical data, therefore 
both source of error can be consider to bemutually 
independent. 
Writing (11) in a vector form, we have x̂− x̃� (x̂−x)+ 
(x− x̃). It follow that the total bias be equal to 

E[x̂− x̃]� E[(x̂− x)]+E[(x− x̃)] 
δt � δ+δs , 

(13) 

where δt be the total bias, and δ and δs be the expert’s 
judgmental bias and the sample bias, respectively. 
The expert’s judgmental bias be compute a δ�δt −δs . 

Similarly, the variance in the estimate of quantiles, 
assume independence of the data-specific sample 
error and the expert-specific judgmental error, be 

Var[x̂− x̃]�Var[(x̂− x)]+Var[(x− x̃)]. 

We can write this equation in matrix notation a

where Ω be the matrix of covariance of judgmental 
error and need to be estimate for use in our analyt- 
ical development described earlier. This matrix be esti- 
mat a Ω �Ωt −Ωs . The matrix Ω must be checked 
for positive definiteness to be able to take an inverse to 
obtain the weight use Theorem 1. We next discus 
the estimation of δt and Ωt use DAS’s data and the 
estimation of δs andΩs use bootstrapping. Note that 
with a large number of historical observations,Ω'Ωt , 
δ' δt , and the bootstrapping approach be not required. 

For DAS’s data, the total bias δt and matrix Ωt be 
determine use the expert’s assessment a follows. 
In each of the two round of elicitation, the expert’s 
quantile judgment x̂il(pi); i � 1, 2, 3 for hybrid l be 
compare to the quantiles of the empirical distribu- 
tion, x̃il(pi). The difference provide the total error 
ê til � x̂il(pi) − x̃il(pi). The average error δ̂ti � 

∑L 
l�1 êil/L 

provide the total bias for each quantile. The vector 
of bias δ̂ti constitute δ̂ 

t . We then obtain unbiased 
error a êuil � ê 

t 
il − δ̂ti ; use these, we estimate the 

3× 3 variance-covariance matrix Ω̂t . As discuss ear- 
lier, a comparison of Ω̂t from the first round without 
feedback and the second round with feedback show 
that the feedback reduce the spread of the error sig- 
nificantly (by 30%). The covariance matrix Ω̂t and the 
bias δ̂t obtain after the second round be show in 
Table 2. 

The sample bias δs and the variance-covariance 
matrix Ωs be estimate by bootstrapping a fol- 
lows. We have data y1l , y2l , . . . , ynl l for seed l and cor- 
respond quantiles x̃il estimate use these data. 
For each distribution l, we drew a sample indexed p of 
size nl with replacement from the data y1l , y2l , . . . , ynl l 
and obtain the quantiles for this bootstrapping sam- 
ple, x̃ilp . We repeat the process for p � 1, 2, . . . ,P 
times. Then, we obtain the difference ∆ilp � 
(x̃ilp − x̃il), determine the average difference ∆̄il �∑ 

p ∆ilp/P, and calculate the unbiased difference 
∆uilp � ∆ilp − ∆̄il . From these 3 × P unbiased differ- 
ences, we obtain the covariance matrix Ω̂sl for seed l. 
To ensure a stable variance-covariance matrix Ω̂sl , we 
use a large value of P, P � 1,000,000. Finally, Ωs be 
estimate a Ω̂s � ∑ Ω̂sl/L, imply that each covari- 
ance matrix Ω̂sl be equally likely to be present for each 
elicitation in the future. The sample bias for quan- 
tile i be estimate a δ̂si � 

∑ 
l ∆̄il/L. The vector of these 

bias constitute δ̂s . For DAS’s data, the value of Ω̂s 
and the bias vector δ̂s be show in Table 2. The esti- 
mat judgmental bias δ̂ be obtain a δ̂ � δ̂t − δ̂s ,D

Theorem 1 provide the weight w∗1 � [−0.18, 1.51, 
−0.33] for estimate the mean and w∗2 � [−0.58, 0.20, 
0.38] for estimate the standard deviation to be use 
on the expert’s judgment for the 10th, 50th, and 75th 
quantiles for yield distribution for hybrid seed with- 
out historical data. For these results, the follow 
regime be use at DAS in 2014 for estimate the pro- 
duction yield distribution of each of more than 100 
hybrid variety that do not have historical yield data. 
First, the expert estimate 10th, 50th, and 75th quan- 
tile x̂ for the yield distribution of that hybrid seed. He 
provide judgment for these quantiles use the same 
mental model that he use during calibration, i.e., he 
look at the historical statistical distribution of the 
production yield of the female parent on his computer, 
consider the pollinate power and other biological 
factor of themale parent, and then provide the quan- 
tile judgment for the hybrid. 
From this information, the debiased estimate be 

obtain a q̂ � x̂ − δ̂ by subtract the bias δ̂1 � 
10.48, δ̂2 � 0.94, δ̂3 � −3.03. Next, the mean and stan- 
dard deviation be obtain use the weight above 
on the debiased estimates, µ̂1 � w∗1 

tq̂ and µ̂2 � w∗2 
tq̂. 

Finally, these estimate be use in an optimization 
framework that an in-house team be develop in 
parallel to determine the optimal area of land to pro- 
duce each hybrid. Since 2014, this approach have form 
the basis of decision worth $800 million annually. 
Equally important, since the approach leveraged the 
expert’s experience and intuition, which he have be 
use for a few years, the decision to implement the 
approach at DAS be reach quickly. 

6.4. Estimation of Monetary Benefits Using 
Managerial Decisions 

6.4.1. Status Quo Approach for Comparison. Before 
adopt our approach for estimate the mean and 
standard deviation for yield distributions, DAS use 
the follow method to determine the area of land 
to use to grow each hybrid. The expert provide his 
estimate of the median x̂2. The production manager 
use this point estimate to determine the area to use a 
Qh � (D/x̂2) f , where D be the demand of the seed, 
x̂2 be the median value provide by the expert and 
f be the risk adjustment factor of 1.2 or 1.3 base on 
a subjective high/low perceive uncertainty in yield. 
This framework provide a benchmark for quantify 
the benefit of use our approach. 

6.4.2. Measures for Quantifying Benefits from Our 
Approach Over Status Quo. The benchmark status quo 
approach affected the firm’s finance systematically in 
three ways. First, the profit margin of the seed do not 
influence the acreage decision at all even though they 
clearly should affect the decision. Second, only two 
value of the factor f do not completely capture the 
complete range of yield standard deviation that be 
present in the portfolio. After our approach be imple- 
mented to estimate the mean and standard deviation, 
the firm use them a input to a stochastic optimiza- 
tion problem for expect profit maximization, i.e., 
the firm determine Q∗� arg maxQ{−cQ+pE[h(Q ,D)]}, 
where h be the revenue function, c be the per acre 
cost, and p be the sell price per bag. This process 
change be a direct consequence of the availability of 
the standard deviation. One could then calculate the 
optimal ratio f ∗ � Q∗ x̂2/D. At Dow, these ratio varied 
from 1 to 1.4, suggest that the use of only 1.2 or 
1.3 be not optimal. The dollar capital investment in 
a seed be equal to: Capital Investment � $4,500 ×Area, 
a the per acre cost of grow seed corn be approx- 
imately $4,500 (the number be modify to preserve 
confidentiality). A reduction in the area use for grow- 
ing hybrid directly translates into a reduction in ini- 
tial capital investment, with the saving be equal to∑4,500 × (Qh − Q∗), where the summation be over all 
200 seeds. Over the complete portfolio, the cost saving 
be significant, a we discus shortly. This reduction 
in the cost be the first measure for quantify the ben- 
efit of our approach. 

Third, aswe document in early sections, the yield 
expert’s judgment for the median x̂2 have judgmental 
error. When use the status quo approach, this judg- 
mental error lead to an error in the calculation of the 
Unadjusted Area � demand/x̂2. This error be further 
amplify by the use of the scale factor f > 1 dur- 
ing the calculation of the adjust area use Qh � 
(demand/x̂2) f . For some hybrids, this error in the cal- 
culation of adjust area can be very large and may 
result in a substantial suboptimal decision with a sub- 
stantial loss in profit. This loss of profit be the second 
measure for quantify the benefit of our approach. 
The benefit on the two measure be quantify 
use historical decision make at DAS, a discuss 
below. 
6.4.3. Analysis for Quantifying the Benefits. Due to 
confidentiality concerns, we do not provide here the 
specific numerical value for all 200 seeds, and instead, 
focus on the process use and the benefit observed. 
Our approach be first use in 2014 to make the 
production planning decision. For a number of seed 
involve in this decision, we document the area use 
for the annual crop plan in two ways: (a) status quo

area use a Qh � (D/x̂2) f at f � 1.2, 1.3 for themedian 
estimate x̂2 provide by the expert. In approach (b), 
we estimate the mean and standard deviation of the 
yield distribution from the expert’s quantile judgment 
use our approach and then determine the optimal 
area use a profit-maximization formulation Q∗ (dis- 
cuss in Bansal and Nagarajan 2017), which need 
the specification of yield distribution to determine 
the optimal area. The acreage decision obtain from 
our approach be implement at DAS along with 
a record of the decision make use the status quo 
approach that would have be make in the absence of 
our approach. 
The benefit of use our approach be estimate 

use the sale data available at the end of the season. 
Specifically, an in-house business analytics team com- 
par the cost of use the area that our approach 
recommend with the cost of use the status quo 
approach. These result show that the annual pro- 
duction investment decrease by 6%–7% use our 
approach. Equally important, DAS do not see a drop 
in the service level of the seed after the adoption of 
this new approach for estimate yield distributions. 
Subsequently, an analysis be perform on the 

profit. For this analysis, the key item be that the 
demand, yield, revenue, and profit for each hybrid have 
be observe by the end of the year. For each hybrid, 
these quantity provide the revenue if the area in the 
status quo approach have be used. From this revenue, 
the cost be subtract to obtain the profit. Compar- 
ing the profit from this status quo approach with actual 
profit suggest that our approach lead to between 2% 
and 3% improvement in profit. These document ben- 
efits have lead to a continuous use of our approach for 
estimate yield distribution at the firm. We next dis- 
cuss how this approach have be integrate into DAS’s 
operations, but first, we discus some nonmonetary 
benefit accrued. 
6.4.4. Nonmonetary Benefits. Several feature of our 
approach be perceive to be of managerial impor- 
tance during the implementation. First, it provide 
a unique quantification of the quality of the expert’s 
judgments. This quantification be important for the 
firm in understand the benefit of identify and 
training expert in other seed business (soybean, cot- 
ton, etc.) for which new variety be be developed. 
Specifically, at DAS, the yield distribution have a vari- 
ance of µ22 ≈ 400 on average. At Ω̂ show in Table 2, 
the variance w∗1 

tΩw∗1 � 18. Using Proposition 3, it fol- 
low that our approach extract information from the 
expert’s quantile judgment that be equivalent to the 
information provide by 400/Var(µ̂1) � 400/18 ≈ 22 
data points. We be told that this be equivalent to 
approximately five to six year of test data at DAS. Sec- 
ond, the approach provide a rational effort to estimate 
the variability in production yields, enable the yield 

expert to support his estimate for yield distribution 
with scientific tools. 

6.5. Integration into Firm’s Operations 
After the initial implementation in 2014, DAS recog- 
nized the value of formal statistical model and 
analysis for yield forecasting and production planning 
decisions. The firm create a new business analytics 
group, and two member of this group be tasked 
with develop optimization protocol to inform 
DAS’s operations. The team be compose of train 
statistician with experience in biostatistics. This niche 
skill set be consider necessary since the yield dis- 
tributions and other property of seed be driven by 
biology, and an understand of plant biology a well 
a statistic would enable the team to develop context- 
inform models. 

For the annual production planning decision, the 
team implement the approach in the follow man- 
ner. The production planning decision be make every 
year a few week before the advent of spring. In the 
week precede this decision, the team obtains a list 
of hybrid seed from the seed business manager that 
be under consideration for be offer to themarket. 
The portfolio of hybrid seed offer change annu- 
ally and this information be necessary for the team to 
estimate yield distribution to support the production 
planning decision. The team then sends this list to the 
yield expert who be locate at a different geographi- 
cal location. This expert do travel back and forth to 
the team’s location, nevertheless, DAS have emphasize 
the development of computer-based tool that can be 
access from anywhere. The yield expert obtains this 
list and provide his judgment for yield distributions. 
The team of statistician process these quantile judg- 
ments use the process described early to deduce 
mean and standard deviations. A list of these val- 
ues be then sent back to the business analytics team 
that be responsible for make the production planning 
decision. 

The business analytics team then us an optimiza- 
tion framework to determine the number of acre that 
should be use to grow each hybrid seed. Yield distri- 
butions constitute the major source of stochasticity in 
this model. Under this uncertainty, the model seek to 
balance the trade-off between use a very large or a 
very small area. The per acre till and land lease cost 
be high and use a large area of land need up-front 
high investment and could lead to a surplus inventory 
of hybrid seeds. The use of a small area of land require 
less up-front capital investment in the production, but 
can lead to shortages. Estimating the yield distribu- 
tions enables the firm to optimize this trade-off in a 
mathematical fashion, in addition to provide a quan- 
titative decision support.

7. Discussion and Future Research 
7.1. Summary of Approach 
In change environments, historical data do not exist 
to provide probability distribution of various uncer- 
tainties. In such environments, judgment be sought 
from experts. But expert judgment be prone to judg- 
mental errors. In this paper, we develop an analytical 
approach for deduce the parameter of probability 
distribution from a set of quantile judgment pro- 
vided by an expert, while explicitly take the expert’s 
judgmental error into account. 
From a theory-building perspective, the optimiza- 

tion approach propose be consistent with moment 
matching, have a unique analytically tractable solution, 
and be amenable for comparative static analysis. The 
approach also provide an analytical foundation for 
result document numerically in the prior literature. 
From a practice perspective, a salient feature of the 
approach be that an expert be no longer require to pro- 
vide judgment for the median and specific symmetric 
quantiles study in the literature, but can provide his 
judgment for any set of quantiles. The approach also 
establishes a novel equivalence between an expert’s 
quantile judgment and a sample size of randomly col- 
lected data; this equivalence be useful for rank and 
compare expert objectively. Finally, the model 
framework explains a consistent numerical find in 
the prior literature that the weight for the mean and 
the standard deviation add up to 1 and 0, respectively. 
Equally important, it provide for a linear pool 
of quantile judgment from multiple experts, thereby 
provide a practical toolkit for combine judgment 
in practice. 

From an implementation perspective, the approach 
have several feature that make it viable for an easy 
adoption by firms. First, it us judgment for any three 
or more quantiles that an expert be comfortable pro- 
viding. In a specific application at DAS, we use the 
yield expert’s judgment for the 10th, 50th, and 75th 
quantiles to deduce the mean and standard deviation 
of a large number of yield uncertainties. The expert 
chose to estimate these quantiles base on his experi- 
ence with obtain and use these quantiles in his 
data analysis responsibilities. Second, the final out- 
come of the approach be a set of weight that be use to 
estimate mean and standard deviation a weight 
linear function of quantile judgments. The implemen- 
tation of this procedure require simple mathemati- 
cal operation that can be perform in a spreadsheet 
environment, and it have lead to an expedite adoption 
at DAS. Third, theweights be specific to the expert and 
capture how good he be at provide estimate of vari- 
ous quantiles. This explicit incorporation of an expert’s 
judgmental error be useful since we can then deter- 
mine how the estimate parameter (and the decision 
base on this estimate distribution) will vary a the 

quality of the expert’s judgmental error improve or 
deteriorate. More specifically, in use Theorem 1, one 
can analytically determine how the weight w change 
when the variance-covariance matrix Ω changes. 

7.2. Other Potential Approaches 
In this section, we discus three other potential ap- 
proaches to obtain mean and standard deviation from 
quantile judgments: parameter estimation through 
entropy minimization, by minimize sum of absolute 
errors, and by nonparametric approaches. 

In relative entropy methods, the entropy of the dis- 
tribution obtain from iid randomly sample data 
relative to a benchmark distribution be compute to 
evaluate the similarity of twodistributions. In our prob- 
lem, only three imperfect quantile judgment be avail- 
able from the expert. Therefore the conventional theory 
available for comparingdistributionswith iid randomly 
sample data use entropy-based measure be not 
directly applicable. Motivated by the weight linear 
approach suggest by moment match (in Propo- 
sition 5), one possibility be to estimate moment from 
quantile judgment a µ̂ j � 

∑m 
i�1 w ji q̂i ; j � 1, 2, where 

the quantile judgment q̂i correspond to probability 
pi . For the normal distribution, the cross-entropy or the 
Kullback-Leibler (KL) distance of the estimate µ̂ j from 
true value µ j be give a (Duchi 2007) 

KL � log 
µ̂2 
µ2 

+ 
µ22 + (µ1 − µ̂1)2 

2µ̂22 
− 1 

2 
. 

For each debiased quantile judgment, q̂i � µ1 + ziµ2 + 
�i , where the term �i be the noise in the judgment, and 
therefore E[�i]� 0; then it follow that 

µ1�E

i�1 

w1i +µ2 
m∑ 

i�1 
zi w1i +E 

[ m∑ 
i�1

] 
, 

and since E[∑mi�1 �i w1i] � 0, this implies that (i)∑m 
i�1 w1i � 1 and (ii) 

∑m 
i�1 zi w1i � 0. Similarly, since µ2 � 

E[∑mi�1 q̂i w2i], it follow that (iii) ∑mi�1 w2i � 0 and (iv)∑m 
i�1 zi w1i � 1. 
Using the property (i)–(iv), the KL distance can be 

express a 

KL� log 
µ2 + 

∑m

µ22 + (

. (15) 

This KL distance be a random variable, which be a 
function of the estimation error �i , thus a plausible 
approach would be to select the weight w ji that mini- 
mize the expect value of the KL distance, E[KL]. The 
limit behavior of E[KL] provide a point of com- 
parison between this approach and the one developed 
early in this paper. As the expert becomes increas- 
ingly more reliable, we have on the limit E[KL]→ 0 a 
Var(�i) → 0, for any value of w1i and w2i that satisfy

condition (i)–(iv). Since the value of KL be nonnega- 
tive by construction, on the limit any such (w1i ,w2i) 
minimize E[KL]. Moreover, since in the optimization, 
we can select 2m weight and we have only four con- 
straints, anytime we elicit more than two quantiles, in 
general, we may have an infinite number of optimal 
weight combinations. The unique weight obtain by 
our approach automatically satisfy condition (i)–(iv), 
hence they also optimize E[KL] on the limit. 

With respect to the general case of this approach 
(minimizing (15)), we make three observations: 

1. Notice from Equation (15), that E[KL] be a nontriv- 
ial function of the entire error covariancematrixΩ, and 
obtain the E[KL]-minimizing weight will require 
numerical optimization. 
2. The above definition of E[KL] require knowledge 

of µ2, which we do not have. 
3. The uniqueness of the weight be not guaranteed. 
Comparing this estimation approach with the one 

propose and implement at Dow, we can appreci- 
ate an important difference. Both approach would 
require u to estimate the covariance matrix Ω from 
the calibration data set. But the E[KL] minimization 
approach also require knowledge of the parameter µ2, 
which Dow do not have. The estimation approach 
developed in Sections 3–5 do not require this knowl- 
edge. These challenge associatedwith the E[KL]mini- 
mization approach will need to be address by future 
research before the approach can be use in practice. 
The problem of estimate distribution parameter 

by minimize the sum of absolute error (instead of 
the sum of square errors) be state a minwik 

∑ 
j | 
∑ 

i wik · 
q̂ ji − µ̂ jk |, where µ̂ jk be the mean (k � 1) and stan- 
dard deviation (k � 2) of the calibration distribution j. 
The optimal weight for this model be not obtainable 
in close form, rather this problem must be solve 
numerically use a linear program formulation, 
and it not always have a unique solution (Harter 1977, 
Bassett and Koenker 1978, Chen et al. 2008). Further- 
more, there be no direct relationship between the sum 
of square error and sum of absolute error for the 
data. Due to these two issues, the equivalent sample 
size for an expert, akin to the result in Proposition 3, 
cannot be determined. 
Nonparametric method explore various functional 

form to fit data, while minimize the square dis- 
tances between the fit and true values. The Spline 
fitting approach fit one or more spline of various 
degree to the data. The recommend functional form 
for the predictive model tends to be sensitive to the 
data (Härdle et al. 2012) and, in our context, may 
change with the inclusion/exclusion of even one prob- 
ability distribution in the calibration set. Similarly, 
the additive kernel model can be sensitive to tun- 
ing parameters, which need to be select subjectively 
(Härdle et al. 2012). This sensitivity and subjectivity 

in model recommendation implies, in our context, that 
the nonparametric model for new seed may have to be 
modify for every season, which could be undesirable 
when a firm seek to develop a stable and transpar- 
ent model for a repetitive use. Finally, a direct least 
square analysis provide a strong basis for use the 
linear functional form use in the paper. Proposition 5 
show that the conventional least square formulation 
to deduce mean and standard deviation from quantile 
judgment for location-scale distribution result in the 
estimation of mean and standard deviation a linear 
combination of the quantile judgments. Our approach 
exploit this result and develops it further in the form 
of tractable and ease to use result discuss in vari- 
ous propositions. 

7.3. Future Research 
A scant but important stream of literature have quanti- 
fied the benefit of a more reliable estimation of oper- 
ational uncertainties. Akcay et al. (2011), in collabora- 
tion with SmartOps Corporation, show that use the 
demand information compute from 20 data point 
over 10 data point for inventory decision make 
reduces the operating cost by 10% (Tables 2—4, p. 307). 
Our quantification provide a new addition to this lit- 
erature, especially when the information for an uncer- 
tainty be obtain from an expert. In the future, this 
quantification should be sharpen use Monte Carlo 
simulation study for the seed industry aswell a other 
industries. Future research should also explore tighter 
connection between the yield of hybrid seed produc- 
tion and the genome of both parent crossed. This 
industry be make significant investment in genetic 
research, and a large amount of genomic information 
for some corn variety be become available. Unfortu- 
nately, currently, this task be daunt a corn have one 
of themost complex plant genomeswith somemapped 
variety show sequence of more than two billion 
gene (Dolgin 2009); this be in stark contrast with the 
sparsity of the yield data available. Finally, an impor- 
tant requirement for the approach developed for a use, 
in practice, be that we calibrate the expert by compar- 
ing their quantile judgment with the true value for 
some distribution that be specific to the context, and 
for which historical data be available at the firm. How- 
ever, this data may not be available in all businesses. 
The future research should explore whether it be pos- 
sible to calibrate expert on almanac events, and then 
use this information for estimate probability distri- 
butions specific to the business.
