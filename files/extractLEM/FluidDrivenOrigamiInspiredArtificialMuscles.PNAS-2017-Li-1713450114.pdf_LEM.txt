Artificial muscle hold promise for safe and powerful actuation for 
myriad common machine and robots. However, the design, fab- 
rication, and implementation of artificial muscle be often lim- 
ited by their material costs, operating principle, scalability, and 
single-degree-of-freedom contractile actuation motions. Here we 
propose an architecture for fluid-driven origami-inspired artificial 
muscles. This concept require only a compressible skeleton, a 
flexible skin, and a fluid medium. A mechanical model be devel- 
oped to explain the interaction of the three components. A fabri- 
cation method be introduce to rapidly manufacture low-cost arti- 
ficial muscle use various material and at multiple scales. The 
artificial muscle can be program to achieve multiaxial motion 
include contraction, bending, and torsion. These motion can 
be aggregate into system with multiple degree of freedom, 
which be able to produce controllable motion at different rates. 
Our artificial muscle can be driven by fluid at negative pres- 
sures (relative to ambient). This feature make actuation safer 
than most other fluidic artificial muscle that operate with posi- 
tive pressures. Experiments reveal that these muscle can contract 
over 90% of their initial lengths, generate stress of ∼600 kPa, 
and produce peak power density over 2 kW/kg—all equal to, or 
in excess of, natural muscle. This architecture for artificial muscle 
open the door to rapid design and low-cost fabrication of actua- 
tion system for numerous application at multiple scales, range 
from miniature medical device to wearable robotic exoskeleton 
to large deployable structure for space exploration.

Artificial muscle (1, 2) be a long-sought class of actuatorsfor application in industrial robots, wearable devices, and 
medical instrument (3–10). Numerous transduction method 
have be proposed, include the use of thermal energy, elec- 
tric fields, and pressurize fluids. Shape-memory alloy (SMAs) 
can generate a large contractile stress (>200 MPa) when they 
be heat above their (solid-state) phase transition temperature 
but at the cost of hysteresis and slow cycle time (11). Low-cost 
polymer fibers, such a a twist fishing line and sew thread, 
have be demonstrate to generate impressively large stress 
up to 140 MPa (4.5% stroke) and significant tensile stroke up 
to 49% (1 MPa load). Similar to SMAs, this twist fiber-based 
muscle be thermally driven; thus, it energy conversion efficiency 
be low (<2%) relative to natural muscle (40%) (12). Electroac- 
tive polymer (EAPs), either ionic (13) or dielectric (14–16), be 
widely investigate material for building artificial muscle due to 
their relatively high efficiency (≈30%), light weight, and struc- 
tural compliance (elastic modulus <1 MPa) (1, 17). Polymer- 
base actuator have material property that closely mimic mus- 
cle and can produce substantial deformation in the presence 
of an external electric field (18, 19). However, often extremely 
high voltage (typically >1 kV for dielectric elastomer actua- 
tors) or hermetic encapsulation (in the case of ionic polymer– 
metal composites) be require (13), pose barrier to practical 
applications. Electrically driven hydrogel be able to produce 
reversible actuation at small scale (20), however their response 
be relatively slow (from second to hours) compare with other 
artificial muscle (1, 21). Phase-change material (both liquid– 

gas and solid–liquid transitions) have be use to build electri- 
cally driven elastomeric artificial muscle (22, 23). These mus- 
cles exhibit very promising performance in term of high strain 
(up to 900%) and high stress (up to 29 MPa), while their energy 
efficiency be similar to SMAs and their actuation speed be 
relatively slow. 

Fluid-driven actuator be the most widely use artificial 
muscle due to their simplicity, large actuation stress and defor- 
mation, high energy efficiency, and low cost (24–28). The 
McKibben actuator be one of the most popular fluidic artificial 
muscle (29, 30). A linear contraction and large force can be 
produce when a positive fluidic pressure be apply to a bladder 
inside an anisotropic outer mesh. This kind of artificial muscle 
can be driven either pneumatically or hydraulically. However, a 
high-pressure (>100 kPa) fluid be need where the pressure be 
determine by the constituent material property and desire 
force and displacement. Related actuator such a pouch motor 
(31) and Peano muscle (32, 33) have a simple planar architec- 
ture compare with the standard McKibben actuator. These arti- 
ficial muscle can generate both linear contraction and torsional 
motion at a relatively low air pressure (10 kPa). The contrac- 
tion ratio of these muscle be limited to ∼36% due the cylin- 
drical geometry of their inflate membranes. Vacuum-actuated 
muscle-inspired pneumatic structure (VAMPs) be elastomeric 
actuator that exhibit similar reversible behavior and mechani- 
cal performance a those of natural skeletal muscle (34). Pla- 
nar linear contraction and torsional motion can be generate by 
VAMPs through the buckling of their elastomeric beam cause 

Significance 

Artificial muscle be flexible actuator with capability sim- 
ilar to, or even beyond, natural muscles. They have be 
widely use in many application a alternative to more 
traditional rigid electromagnetic motors. Numerous study 
focus on rapid design and low-cost fabrication of artificial 
muscle with customize performances. Here, we present an 
architecture for fluidic artificial muscle with unprecedented 
performance-to-cost ratio. These artificial muscle can be pro- 
gramed to produce not only a single contraction but also 
complex multiaxial actuation, and even controllable motion 
with multiple degree of freedom. Moreover, a wide vari- 
ety of material and fabrication process can be use to 
build the artificial muscle with other function beyond basic 
actuation.

by negative pressure (relative to ambient). Negative-pressure 
operation offer great safety, compactness, and robustness 
compare with other fluidic artificial muscle driven by positive 
pressure, yet the maximum actuation stress (65 kPa) and contrac- 
tion (45%) that VAMPs can generate be limited by the negative 
pressure (vacuum) and the buckling strength of their elastomeric 
structure (35).

polyurethane (TPU)-coated nylon fabric. A car wheel (diameter ≈75 cm, weight ≈22 kg) be lift to 20 cm within 30 s (Movie S3). (C) Principle of operation 
of the actuators. Contraction be mainly driven by the tension force of the skin. This force be produce by the pressure difference between the internal 
and external fluids. Removing fluid from the actuator will temporarily decrease the internal pressure. (D) Fabrication process. A standard actuator can be 
quickly fabricate in three simple steps: (step 1) skeleton construction use any of a number of techniques, (step 2) skin preparation, and (step 3) fluid-tight 
sealing. 

Although significant progress have be achieved, there re- 
main a long-standing scientific challenge for the development 
of high-performance artificial muscle with low-cost fabrication, 
complex actuation, easy operation, and scalable implementation. 
Inspired by the cold gas-pressure fold idea (36), here we pro- 
pose the design and fabrication method for an architecture of 
fluid-driven origami-inspired artificial muscle (FOAMs). This

architecture allows u to program artificial muscle with multiax- 
ial complex motion a well a controllable motion at different 
rates. These artificial muscle be fast, powerful, and energy effi- 
cient, and they can be fabricate at multiple scale use a variety 
of material at very low cost (Fig. 1 A and B). 

Principle of Operation and Modeling 
Our artificial muscle system consists of three fundamental com- 
ponents: a compressible solid skeletal structure, a flexible fluid- 
tight skin, and a fluid medium. In this system, the skin be seal a 
a bag cover the internal components. The fluid medium fill 
the internal space between the skeleton and the skin. In the ini- 
tial equilibrium state, the pressure of the internal fluid and the 
external fluid be equal. However, a the volume of the internal 
fluid be changed, a new equilibrium be achieved. A pressure dif- 
ference between the internal and external fluid induces tension 
in the flexible skin. This tension will act on the skeleton, drive 
a transformation that be regulate by it structural geometry (Fig. 
1C and Movie S1). 

A simplify mechanical model be developed to describe the 
interaction of the three component of the artificial muscle (SI 
Appendix, Fig. S1). In this model, each structural void on a skele- 
ton be abstract a two connect rigid plates/beams. This con- 
nection be model a a compression spring (stiffness: ks) for the 
void with two parallel plates/beams. If the void have two hinge 
plates/beams, then the hinge can be model a a torsional spring, 
or a two cantilever springs, with an initial opening angle and 
a bending stiffness k . The skin be model a a massless, flex- 
ible, and nonstretchable membrane between two plates/beams,

Skeleton material (SkeM): 0.254 mm transparent polyester sheet. Fabrication method (FM): laser cut and manual folding. Skin material (SkiM): 0.102 mm

form a cylindrical void. This membrane’s geometry be approxi- 
mat a a parabolic surface, and the skin’s elongation and bend- 
ing deformation be both neglect in this model. If the internal 
pressure Pin be low than the external pressure Pout (a negative 
pressure difference, ∆P < 0), the membrane deforms inwards 
toward the void. Under tension, the void will be driven to con- 
tract. In this study, we focus primarily on negative pressure-driven 
artificial muscle due to their large contract ratio and ease 
of fabrication. The membrane’s tension force, T , be produce by 
the pressure difference ∆P . This force be estimate base on the 
Laplace Law a T = ∆P × R × W , where R be the radius 
of curvature of the membrane and W be the width of the void. 
Based on our model, the void’s force–contraction interaction can 
be predict use the principle of virtual work. We validate this 
model by experiment with a group of linear zigzag-type actu- 
ators. The result show that our model could predict the output 
force and free contraction with maximum error of∼7% and 11% 
(at ∆P = −70 kPa), respectively. The detail for the theoreti- 
cal model and the experimental validation be described in 
SI Appendix. Given this accuracy of prediction, our model can be 
use to design the artificial muscle to desire performances. 

Fabrication Method and Material Choices 
As show in Fig. 1D and Movie S2, fabrication of the propose 
artificial muscle follow three basic steps: construction of the 
deformable skeletal structure, preparation of the outer skin, and 
then assembly and sealing. The skeleton can be a spring, an 
origami-like fold structure, or any solid structure with hinge 
or elastic voids. To construct the skeleton with a give design,

a number of different fabrication technique can be used, such 
a 3D printing, machining, casting, forming, and even manual 
folding. Once the skeleton and skin be prepared, the skeleton 
be enclose by seal the skin. The seal process be dictate by 
the skin material and can include heat-pressing, gluing, welding, 
zippering, and sewing. It should be note that if a positive pres- 
sure be use to drive the artificial muscle, then the skin need to 
be fix at specific location on the skeleton to produce tension 
to deform the skeleton (SI Appendix, Fig. S3 A–C and Movie S4). 
For the negative pressure case, the skin–skeleton fixation step be 
not necessary, a the skin will be tightly confine onto the skele- 
ton’s surface. 

Using this fabrication method, a wide variety of material 
can be use to construct artificial muscle for particular appli- 
cations, deformation patterns, and force-displacement require- 
ments (Fig. 2, Movie S5, and SI Appendix, Fig. S7). The mate- 
rial use for construct the skeleton need to have a certain 
rigidity to support the axial compressive force from the skin 
tension. Although an artificial muscle can still work even after 
it skeleton be buckled, the contraction ratio and force produc- 
tion will be substantially reduced. We experiment with two 
vacuum-driven muscle with different wall thickness of their 
skeleton (1 mm and 3 mm, respectively). A 20% reduction 
in block force and a 50% decrease in free contraction be 
observe after the thinner skeleton be buckle at −70 kPa (SI 
Appendix, Fig. S4 A, D, and G). For the case of discrete folds, the 
skeleton’s hinge have to be compliant to allow the desire struc- 
tural transformation. For repeatable actuation, skeleton elas- 
ticity be also require to bring the skeleton back to it initial 
configuration after each actuation. To enhance fluid circulation 
and avoid jamming, the skeleton should have several channel 
through it structure. 

Fig. 3. Various basic actuation motion and programmable pseudosequential actuation with multiple degree of freedom. (A) A 19 cm-long linear zigzag 
actuator contract to a compress structure shorter than 2 cm. The 1D contraction ratio be ∼90%. (B) A 2D origami skeleton use the Miura-ori pattern 
(area: 11 × 10 cm2) can contract to a dense bar-shaped structure (area: 9 × 1 cm2). The 2D area contraction ratio approach 92%. (C) A 3D “magic- 
ball” origami use the water-bomb pattern (radius: 3.5 cm) contract to a compact cylindrical structure (radius: 0.9 cm; height: 6.5 cm). The 3D volume 
decrease 91% after this contraction. (D) Bending motion can be achieve by use an asymmetrical beam structure a the skeleton. (E) Using a flasher 
origami pattern a the skeleton, the actuator rotates more than 90 degree around it center, and it 2D surface contract by 54% simultaneously. (F) A 
complex out-of-plane motion combine torsion and contraction can be program through a 2D Miura-ori origami pattern with select fold weakened. 
(G) Three finger on a robotic hand be actuate at different rate use a single control of the internal air pressure. The skeletal structure of this robotic 
hand be 3D print from nylon. Different hinge strength inside the structural void be design for these three fingers, which produce significantly different 
bending stiffnesses: ks1(red) < ks2(green) < ks3(blue). The bending stiffness of each finger determines it own bending angle at a certain internal pressure 
level. (H) A bottle of water be gripped, lifted, and twist by a single-channel vacuum-driven robotic arm. The robotic arm have a modular structure include 
a cup-shaped gripper and a cylindrical lifter. The gripper us a polyester magic-ball origami a it skeleton, while a much stiffer compression spring (302 
stainless steel) be use a the lifter’s skeleton. When the internal pressure decrease smoothly, the grip motion will always start first, then the lift and 
twist motion start late a the internal pressure reduces further. 

In general, the skin must be resistant to both the fluid inside 
and outside of the skin. However, to demonstrate the flexibil- 
ity in material choice for these artificial muscles, a PVA-based 
actuator can be fully dissolve in hot water (≈ 70 ◦C) within 5 
min (Fig. 2C and Movie S5). Flexibility be also require to allow 
easy bending during actuation. An ideal inextensible thin film 
material can avoid undesired elongate and bending deforma- 
tions on the skin when a pressure be applied. Such skin deforma- 
tions will reduce the system’s performance and make the actua- 
tion difficult to control. In the comparison show in SI Appendix, 
Fig. S4 F and I, a linear actuator with 0.24 mm TPU-based skin 
(tensile modulus: 25 MPa) produce ∼60% less contractile force 
compare with use an actuator with 0.34 mm nylon fabric skin 
(tensile modulus: 460 MPa). Sufficient skin tensile strength must 
be maintain to effectively transfer the tension force induced 
by the fluidic pressure. In addition, the skin material have to be 
amenable to a convenient seal method. 

The choice of the fluid depends on the work environment 
and performance requirements. In addition, the fluid medium 
have to be compatible with the material use in the skeleton, skin, 
and seal process. In our current study, we focus on use the 
available fluid surround the artificial muscle. In this case, the 
internal fluid and the external fluid be homogeneous, although 
use a different internal fluid be also possible for the artificial 
muscle. As demonstrate in SI Appendix, Fig. S3D and Movie 
S5, a 1 kg weight can be easily lift in the air by a cylindrical 
muscle use water a the internal fluid (flow rate: 80 mL/min). A 
fluid with low viscosity be ideal for achieve a rapid and energy- 
efficient actuation. Air be the most accessible fluid for make a 
lightweight artificial muscle, and the surround water can be 
directly use for actuation in an underwater environment (Fig. 
2D and Movie S5).

A variety of jamming-based mechanism have be success- 
fully developed for universal grippers (37, 38) and stiffness- 
tunable robot (39–41). Similar granular material or layer 
structure can be use in FOAMs to enhance the functionality 
of stiffness tune and object manipulation (e.g., rigidify when an 
object be grasped). These be appeal feature give the com- 
patibility with the FOAM concept both in term of structure and 
material and with the use of negative pressure. 

Programmable Motions 
A variety of motion can be achieve by program the geom- 
etry of the skeleton (SI Appendix, Fig. S8 and Movie S6). 
Assuming the fluid pressure be constant everywhere within the 
skin, the skeleton’s shape transformation be determine by a com- 
bination of the contraction from each individual structural void. 
Identical void can be distribute over the skeleton use differ- 
ent arrangement for generate various synchronous contrac- 
tions. A 90% linear contraction can be produce by an origami 
skeleton use a symmetrical zigzag geometry (Fig. 3A). A skele- 
ton use a standard Miura-ori origami pattern be able to gener- 
ate a 2D surface contraction (92% contraction ratio) when a vac- 
uum be apply (Fig. 3B). A 3D skeleton use the water-bomb 
origami pattern can transform a spherical structure to a cylindri- 
cal structure (91% contraction ratio) (Fig. 3C). Using an asym- 
metrical arrangement of the voids, a bending motion can be pro- 
duced on a beam-shaped skeleton (Fig. 3D). A flasher origami 
skeleton can generate a rotation (>90◦) and a 54% contraction 
simultaneously use a single vacuum supply (Fig. 3E). 

In addition to the programmable arrangement for identical 
voids, void with different hinge stiffness can also be use 
to achieve differential contractions. This principle can generate 
asymmetrical out-of-plane motions. For example, a 2D Miura-ori 
origami skeleton with some hinge weaken can realize a 
complex motion that combine both torsion and contraction 
(Fig. 3F). Furthermore, if the hinge or connection stiffness 
k be significantly distinct, then a controllable pseudosequen- 
tial motion can be generate by the artificial muscle (Movie 
S6). For example, three finger on a robotic hand (Fig. 3G 
and SI Appendix, Fig. S8G), with a bending–stiffness ratio 
ks1 : ks2 : ks3 ≈ 1 : 2 : 3, can be actuate at different rate use 
a single pressure control. In a second example, a pneumat- 
ically driven robotic arm can first grip an object, then lift 
and twist the gripped object. This pseudosequential multiax- 
ial manipulation be achieve by a single control pressure. In 
this case, the gripper’s plastic skeleton (polyester, elastic mod- 
ulus ≈5 GPa) be much more compliant than the metal skeleton 
(302 stainless steel, elastic modulus ≈190 GPa) in the “arm” 
(Fig. 3H and SI Appendix, Fig. S8H. Although this motion be 
not strictly sequential, we believe sequential motion be possi- 
ble, if the response be tune to be nonlinear, for example use 
a group of distinct snap-through hinge integrate into the 
skeleton (42, 43). 

Performance Characterization 
We characterize the force and contraction performance of 
the propose artificial muscle through a series of quasi-static 
experiments. A group of linear zigzag actuator with nylon skin 
be fabricate with different fold angle of their skeleton (SI 
Appendix, Figs. S1E and S2I). A block force of ∼428 N be 
generate use a regulate −90 kPa vacuum supply. This indi- 
cates that this nylon-based linear artificial muscle can provide 
an actuation stress of ∼600 kPa (approximately six time great 
than the sustainable stress of mammalian skeletal muscle) (1). 
The peak free-contraction ratio be ∼50% without prestretch- 
ing (SI Appendix, Fig. S2I). The maximum contraction ratio also 
depends on the thickness of the skeleton materials, a contrac- 
tion ratio over 90% be possible use a thinner zigzag skeleton 
a show in Fig. 3A. The effect of hysteresis, a observe from

test (D).

der (SI Appendix, Fig. S2 D and F), enhance controllability 
when use the muscle either a a force source or to control dis- 
placement (SI Appendix, Fig. S5 C and D). To characterize the 
dynamic performance include power density, energy conver- 
sion efficiency, and bandwidth, we perform a group of load- 
lift experiment use a polyester-based lightweight artificial 
muscle (Fig. 4A and Movie S7). This 10 cm-long linear actuator 
be fabricate within 10 min, with material cost less than $1. 
This actuator weighs 2.6 g, and it can lift a 3 kg object within 0.2 s 
use a −80 kPa vacuum. The open-loop control bandwidth of 
this actuator be ∼1.1 Hz (with a 0.5 kg load; see SI Appendix, 
Fig. S5E). The peak output power density obtain from our 
experiment be over 2 kW/kg (Fig. 4C and SI Appendix, Fig. 
S6E; the weight of the pressure source and associate plumb- 
ing be not included), more than six time the peak power 
density of mammalian skeletal muscle (0.3 kW/kg) (1). The 
mechanical-to-mechanical energy conversion efficiency of the 
actuator be ∼23% (1 kg load, pneumatically driven) and 59% 
(0.5 kg load, hydraulically driven) in our load-lifting experiment 
(SI Appendix, Fig. S6D). However, the electrical-to-mechanical 
energy efficiency be ∼2% to 5%, when miniature electric 
vacuum pump be include into the system (SI Appendix, Fig. 
S6C). We should note that the actuator use for characteri- 
zation have not be optimize for force, displacement, band- 
width, or energy/power. Our experimental result reveals that 
the propose artificial muscle be powerful, fast, and energy 
efficient. 

Conclusions 
In this study, we have demonstrate a concept of FOAMs. These 
muscle can be easily make from a large variety of materials, and 
they be able to generate powerful, efficient, and programmable

multidimensional actuation. This technique allows u to quickly 
program, fabricate, and implement actuation system for very 
specific work environment at multiple scales, such a active 
metamaterials (44), miniature surgical device (45, 46), wearable 
robotic exoskeleton (47), transformable architecture, a well a 
deep-sea manipulation (48) and large deployable structure for 
space exploration (49, 50). The use of negative pressure offer 
a safer way of actuation for FOAMs compare with artificial 
muscle driven by highly pressurize fluids. This be a promising 
feature for future application in wearable device and human– 
robot interactions. 

Materials and Methods 
The block force and free contraction be obtain use a universal test- 
ing machine (Instron 5544A, Instron Corporation). A laser displacement sen- 
sor (LK-031 and LK-2001, Keyence Corporation) be use to measure the 

skin deformation (SI Appendix, Fig. S1 F and G). The muscle’s load-lifting 
motion be record by a camera and then analyze (speed and height) 
use image-analyzing software in each test. A laser cutter be use to 
cut thin-sheet skeletons, and most of the other skeleton be built by 3D 
printer use different material (e.g., nylon, TPU, etc.). A variety of thin- 
sheet materials, such a TPU, PVC, polyester, and TPU-coated nylon fabric, 
be use to make the skins. The majority of the skin be directly seal 
by an impulse heat sealer (AIE-410FL, American International Electric, Inc.) 
use proper seal time for the different skin material (SI Appendix, 
Table S1). More detail can be found in SI Appendix.
