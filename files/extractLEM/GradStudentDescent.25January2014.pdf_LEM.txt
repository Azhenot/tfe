Grad student descent

(h ps://sciencedryad.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/picdatastorm.png)On January 24, I a end a 1-day data science symposium at Harvard 
University with the fun title ‘Weathering the Data Storm (h p://computefest.seas.harvard.edu/data-storm)‘. I imagine be in a tiny boat 
on the endless beautiful sea of data, and then a big data storm come up! Numbers and piece of text fly through the air… they hit me hard 
in the face like hail, pile up in my boat… and I’m in dire need of some clever algorithm to take care of all that data, so that I won’t get 
hurt, my boat won’t sink! 

In line with the fun title, there be lot of fun talks. The funniest quote of the day clearly go to Ryan Adams 
(h p://www.seas.harvard.edu/directory/rpa) from Harvard University, when he introduce a new name for a common machine learn 
‘method’: grad student descent. He talk about a ‘meta-problem’ of machine learning: Most machine learn algorithm be sufficiently 
complex to give great result – if they be run with parameter that be adapt to the problem at hand. For example, to work with a neural

network you have to choose the number of layers, the weight regularization, the layer size, which non-linearity, the batch size, the learn 
rate schedule, the stop conditions… How do people choose these parameters? Mostly with ad hoc, black magic methods. One method, 
common in academia, be ‘grad student descent’ (a pun on gradient descent), in which a graduate student fiddle around with the 
parameter until it works. It’s kind of sad, but it’s so true! Of course, Ryan Adams then go on to discus be er solution (‘meta- 
algorithms’ that automatically find the parameters), but it be the ‘grad student descent’ that stuck to everyone’s mind. 

Rachel Schu (h p://idse.columbia.edu/rachel-schu -0) form News Corps muse on the perennial question ‘What be a data scientist?’ She 
cite the well-known definition by Josh Wills from Cloudera, which I really like: 

Data scientist = “Person who be be er at statistic than any software engineer and be er at software engineering than any statistician.” 

But I hadn’t yet heard the clever rephrase by Will Cukierski of Kaggle: 

Data scientist = “Person who be bad at statistic than any statistician and bad at software engineering than any software engineer.” 

Both quote nail down the interdisciplinary nature of the field of data science (and be really funny). This interdisciplinarity be something 
that I really like. Whenever I go to data science meetings, I meet people from so many different background – it be very enriching, and the 
melt pot of so many different idea and way of think be enticing. It also match my own diverse background, with lot of math, 
physics, statistics, biology, program thrown together… 

It be also great to see some data science tool celebrities. Fernando Perez, who start iPython in 2001, talk about the great feature of 
iPython – for example, I didn’t know that it also support other language like R, Julia, or SQL. And Jeff Heer, creator of D3, show some 
awesome D3 visualizations, include the most funny alternative-visualizations sequence I have ever see (the first 15 second of this video 
(h p://vimeo.com/29862153) by Mike Bostock).
