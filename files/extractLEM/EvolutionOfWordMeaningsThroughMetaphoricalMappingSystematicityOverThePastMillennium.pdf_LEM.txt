One way that language be able to communicate a potentially infinite set of idea through 
a finite lexicon be by compress emerge meaning into words, such that over time, indi- 
vidual word come to express multiple, related sens of meaning. We propose that over- 
arch communicative and cognitive pressure have create systematic directionality in 
how new metaphorical sens have developed from exist word sens over the history 
of English. Given a large set of pair of semantic domains, we use computational model 
to test which domain have be more commonly the start point (source domains) and 
which the end point (target domains) of metaphorical mapping over the past millen- 
nium. We found that a compact set of variables, include externality, embodiment, and 
valence, explain directionality in the majority of about 5000 metaphorical mapping 
record over the past 1100 years. These result provide the first large-scale historical evi- 
dence that metaphorical mapping be systematic, and driven by measurable communicative 
and cognitive principles.

1. Introduction 

Every natural language face the challenge of have to express a potentially infinite range of idea through a finite set of 
word (cf. von Humboldt, 1836; Chomsky, 1957; Pustejovsky, 1995). One way in which language meet the challenge of 
maintain a compact lexicon be by compress emerging, yet to be lexicalize ideas, into exist word forms. The most 
common form of compression in the lexicon, both in English and in other languages, be polysemy: Cases where a single word 
have multiple, related sens (e.g., Breal, 1897; Brugman, 1988; Geeraerts, 1997; Lakoff & Johnson, 1980; Pustejovsky, 1995; 
Srinivasan & Rabagliati, 2015; Sweetser, 1991). One prominent mechanism that generates polysemy over the course of his- 
tory be metaphorical mapping (e.g., Lakoff & Johnson, 1980), whereby new word meaning be create by mapping an exist 
sense of a word from it own source domain to another target domain, base on structural similarity between the domains. 
For example, the English word grasp originally conveyed a physical action (source), a in ‘‘grasp a fruit,” and be late 
extend to express an abstract sense of understand (target), a in ‘‘grasping an idea,” thus construe idea a object 
that can be held and controlled. In the present study, we test whether there be systematic directionality in how newmetaphor- 
ical sens have developed over the history of English. That is, give a pair of semantic domains, can we predict which 
s.

domain serve historically a the source and which a the target of metaphorical mapping, base on consideration of 
broader communicative and cognitive pressures? 

Consistent with the idea that metaphorical sense extension be systematic, prior research (e.g., Lakoff & Johnson, 1980; 
Sweetser, 1991) have suggest that mapping between semantic domain tend to be asymmetric: They occur in one direction 
but not the other (e.g., for grasp, it be ‘‘action”?‘‘knowledge” but not ‘‘knowledge”?‘‘action”). However, directionality in his- 
torical metaphorical mapping have not be evaluate at scale against record of historical semantic change, leave open 
whether metaphorical mapping truly reflect predictable patterns. Using an historical corpus of the English lexicon, we seek 
to investigate – at a large scale – the historical direction of metaphorical mapping by test whether some domain have 
more commonly serve a the start point of historical extension (the source domains) while others have more com- 
monly serve a the end point (target domains). For example, in the case of grasp, the ‘‘physical action” sense first 
appear in English around 1300 CE, precede the abstract sense of ‘‘understanding” that emerge around 1600 CE (Kay, 
Roberts, Samuels, Wotherspoon, & Alexander, 2015a). Our analysis examines systematicity in the directionality of historical 
metaphorical sense mapping in the English lexicon. 

Directions of metaphorical mapping need not be systematic: Instead, the evolutionary path of meaning change could be 
varied and unpredictable across words. Although some words, like grasp, may have begin with a relatively concrete sense 
that be subsequently extend to a more abstract sense, other word may have be extend in the opposite direction, 
from abstract to concrete senses. For instance, irritable initially conveyed an abstract sense of ‘‘anger,” a in an ‘‘irritable per- 
son” (1662 CE; Kay et al., 2015a), but it be subsequently use to convey a more concrete, physical meaning, a in ‘‘irritable 
skin” (1791 CE; Kay et al., 2015a). A particular word’s path could be shape by the ever-changing cultural condition and 
resultant communicative need that have cause word to develop new meaning across history (cf. Aitchison, 2001). The 
contribute factor may be variable across word and across era of history, result in little systematicity on a large scale. 

However, an alternative possibility be that the direction of metaphorical sense extension be systematic, because it be 
shape by endure functional pressure on language evolution. Recent work in computational cognitive science have sug- 
gested that many aspect of language and cross-linguistic variation can be understood in term of general design principles, 
such a the need for linguistic structure to minimize cognitive effort and support informative communication and language 
learn (Zipf, 1949; see also Kemp & Regier, 2012; Kirby, Tamariz, Cornish, & Smith, 2015; Piantadosi, Tily, & Gibson, 2011; 
Regier, Kemp, & Kay, 2015). Applying this perspective to polysemy, systematic directionality in mapping may result from 
language user minimize the cost associate with communicate novel idea and learn a lexicon: Mappings will tend 
to be driven by their ease of construction, their effectiveness a communication devices, and/or their learnability by children. 
The mapping should thus provide a cognitively economic and hence efficient device for compress new idea into an exist- 
ing lexicon. If there be a consistent set of cognitive principle and process underlie ease of construction, effectiveness for 
communication, and/or learnability, recur pattern of mapping should arise across domain and time. 

But this perspective say little about what the underlie constraint on the directionality of metaphorical mapping 
might be. An independent line of research, from cognitive psychology and linguistics, provide suggestion about the speci- 
fics: Namely, that the process that give rise to metaphorical polysemy may reflect conceptual structure (Lakoff, 1987; 
Sweetser, 1991). One prominent proposal in this vein be Conceptual Metaphor Theory (CMT; Lakoff & Johnson, 1980; 
Reddy, 1979), which posit that people reason about abstract concept – such a ‘‘understanding” – via metaphorical map- 
ping from knowledge domain that be more concrete and tie to bodily experience – such a ‘‘physical action.” Although 
CMT be controversial a a theory of cognition, other theory also predict that concrete and embody word sens will be 
extend to more abstract sens because this type of extension may be the most useful for communication and learn 
(Murphy, 1997; Srinivasan & Carey, 2010; Thibodeau & Durgin, 2008). For example, it could be easy to communicate about 
something abstract – for which achieve share reference be difficult – by analogically refer to a more concrete meaning, 
for which share reference be easier, and this advantage may apply in word learn a well a discourse processing. Further, 
because concrete and embody meaning tend to be frequent (Hanley, Hunt, Steed, & Jackman, 2013; cf. Winter, Thompson, 
& Urban, 2014), they may be more readily retrieve a source for meaning extension by speaker who need to communicate 
a new idea. 

Prior research have not explicitly link the perspective of efficient language design with the study of the cognitive foun- 
dations of polysemy or metaphorical mapping. We bridge this gap by analyze directionality in a large set of metaphorical 
mapping between source and target domain span 1100 years, date from Old English to the present. To our knowl- 
edge, this be the first large-scale study to evaluate the systematicity of the directionality in polysemous metaphorical map- 
ping against the record of historical change in a lexicon. We expect that if metaphorical mapping provide an efficient 
cognitive device for compress idea into a communicative and learnable lexicon, the historical direction of change 
through which new sens be create for word should be highly systematic, and they should be explain by a compact 
set of variable relevant to the cognitive process involve in generating, learning, and use word meanings. 

2. Methods 

We identify six candidate variable from the literature that could explain direction of metaphorical mapping base on 
communicative and cognitive considerations. We use human participants’ rating of these variable to try to predict direc- 
tions in metaphorical domain mapping record in the history of English. In the following, we describe: (1) each of the 



Y. Xu et al. / Cognitive Psychology 96 (2017) 41–53 43 
candidate variables, (2) the historical dataset of metaphorical domain mapping we used, and (3) a survey through which we 
elicit rating of the domain on each of the candidate variable dimensions. 

2.1. Candidate variable 

Three of the variable we consider a predictor be suggest by Conceptual Metaphor Theory (Lakoff & Johnson, 1980; 
Reddy, 1979; Sweetser, 1991) and support by other perspective suggest that certain type of meaning should more 
commonly serve a source of metaphorical extension (e.g., Srinivasan & Carey, 2010, and Thibodeau & Durgin, 2008, a dis- 
cuss above; see also Traugott, 1990). 

1. Concrete ? Abstract. Word sens that refer to thing perceive through the sensory system should serve a a source of 
metaphorical mappings, relative to one label less perceptible referents. 

2. Embodied ? Disembodied. Word sens that refer to thing that be more directly experienced through our body should 
serve a a source of metaphorical mappings, relative to one that label referent that be less directly experienced. 

3. External? Internal.Word sens that refer to entity in the external world should serve a a source of metaphorical map- 
pings, relative to one that label internal, mental entities, such a emotion or feelings. 

An additional three variable be identified, base on the idea that metaphorical extension tend to be communicatively 
expressive: 

4. Animate? Inanimate. Word sens that refer to animate entity may carry more expressive power than one refer to 
less animate entities, and may thus serve a a source of metaphorical mapping to convey salient feature of target inan- 
imate entity (Silverstein, 1976; Traugott, 2003). 

5. Less valenced ? More valenced. If metaphorically-derived sens arise in part because of their expressive power, derive 
sens should be more emotionally valenced than originate senses. This predicts that when word sens from source 
domain be extended, the result sens in the target domain will have strong valence (whether positive or negative; 
Osgood, Suci, & Tannenbaum, 1964; Ullmann, 1957; cf. Hollis & Westbury, 2016). 

6. More Intersubjective ? Less intersubjective. Intersubjectivity refers to the degree to which people experience something 
the same way (Traugott, 1989, 2003). Word meaning that be more intersubjective (e.g. ‘‘wooden”) could be easy to 
understand and establish share label for than one that be less so (e.g., ‘‘beautiful”). They might thus serve a a source 
of metaphorical mappings, relative to less intersubjective meanings. 

Some of these variable be likely to be correlated, e.g., many of the same word meaning could be external, concrete, 
intersubjective, and embodied. However, they be not identical. For example, ‘‘arm” and ‘‘table” be both highly concrete, 
but arm be more directly and viscerally experienced than tables. Our analysis tease apart the relationship among these 
variable in accounting for metaphorical mapping in the history of English. 

2.2. Historical dataset of metaphorical mapping 

We obtain data from the Metaphor Map of English (MME) database (Kay, Roberts, Samuels, Wotherspoon, & Alexander, 
2015b), which identifies metaphorical mapping of sens classify by semantic domain over more than a millennium. The 
MME database be derive from the Historical Thesaurus of English (HTE; Kay et al., 2015a), which record 793,742 word 
form-sense entry a attest in the history of English. The HTE is, in turn, base on the second edition of the Oxford English 
Dictionary (Simpson & Weiner, 1989). 

All word sens in the MME database be classify into 415 distinct semantic domain (e.g. ‘‘textiles,” ‘‘digestive organs,” 
‘‘anger,” ‘‘pride”) in rough accordance with the standard of semantic classification adopt by the HTE and Oxford English 
Dictionary. All semantic domain from the database be sub-fields from three broader ontological domains: I. The external 
world; II. The mental world; III. The social world. Section 1 include semantic domain that concern readily observable phe- 
nomena of the universe, such a the earth and sea. Section 2 include domain that concern cognitive process such a per- 
ception and emotion. Section 3 include domain that concern social system such a the law and morality. Each specific 
semantic domain defines a category of meaning that word sens can evolve from (source domain) or towards (target 
domain), and a single domain can include multiple but distinct word senses. The construction of these domain have be 
derive carefully from lexicographical data and gradually refine over a period of 40 years. For detail of domain classifica- 
tion, see work by the lexicographer of the HTE (p xviii-xx, Kay, Roberts, Samuels, & Wotherspoon, 2009). 

The MME database record metaphorical mapping that have occur between domain and provide a sample of word 
that exemplify these domain mappings. Our analysis examine historical metaphorical mapping at the level of these 
semantic domain – specifically between pair of domain (and not at the level of individual words), evaluate whether 
there have be systematicity in the directionality of domain-to-domain mappings. Each attest domain-to-domain map- 
ping reflect the historical extension of word sens between two domains. Together, these mapping span an 1100 year per- 
iod, from the Old English period around AD 800 through to the present era, around 1950 CE. Within the MME database, 
metaphorical mapping be summarize separately for the Old English period (i.e., before 1100 CE), and in 50-year step 



44 Y. Xu et al. / Cognitive Psychology 96 (2017) 41–53 
for the subsequent 800 years, provide 18 unique historical time point for our analysis. For further detail regard the 
MME database, we refer the reader to the ‘‘About the project” page provide at http://mappingmetaphor.arts.gla.ac.uk/ 
about-the-project/. 

Researchers of the MME database have found evidence for over 10,000 metaphorical domain mappings: Cases where 
word in one domain be consistently use to describe another domain. Some of the record of domain mapping do 
not contain full information about when the mapping occur and what word be involved, and so they be eliminate 
for purpose of our analyses. The final data set we use include all of the approximately 5,500 record metaphorical map- 
ping (downloaded a of October 21st, 2015, at http://mappingmetaphor.arts.gla.ac.uk/about-the-project/categories-com- 
pleted/), among 400 semantic domains, that have complete information. See Supplemental Material for these domains. 
Each entry in our data set record an attest metaphorical mapping between a pair of semantic domain that includes: 
(1) source domain, (2) target domain, (3) early of period of extension between these domains, and (4) some sample word 
that participate in this metaphorical extension. 

The database indicates the historical direction of sense extension among each pair of semantic domains. Three type of 
direction be recorded: (1) A? B, i.e. A be source domain and B be target domain; (2) A B, i.e. A be target and B be source; (3) 
A M B, i.e. a bidirectional mapping. The bidirectional mapping constitutes only a small portion of the dataset (�7.5%), so we 
focus on the directional case (4960 unique pair of domain-to-domain mappings) for our analyses. We examine whether 
the mapping direction among semantic domain could be predict from empirical rating of the domain along the six can- 
didate variable dimensions, base on an on-line survey that we describe next. 

2.3. Survey for rating elicitation 

We elicit rating of the 400 semantic domain along the six candidate variable through an on-line survey (see Supple- 
mental Material for experimental instructions). For each variable, participant rat each of the 400 domain on a seven- 
point scale. Participants first read a definition of each domain (e.g., ‘‘Plant - A living thing that grows in the ground, usually 
have leaf or flowers, and need sun and water to survive”), assemble by consult the Merriam-Webster Dictionary. Par- 
ticipants then rat the domain on one of the six variables. For example, for concreteness, participant select a number 
between 1 and 7, where 1 represent ‘‘highly abstract,” 7 ‘‘highly concrete,” and 4 ‘‘intermediate.” Because of the large num- 
ber of rating we need to elicit (400 domain x 6 variables), each participant only rat a random sample of 40 domain 
along a single variable dimension. 

Our research protocol be approve by the Institutional Review Board at the University of California, Berkeley. Data be 
collect from 1439 participant who self-reported a native English speakers, use the online Qualtrics experimental plat- 
form (http://www.qualtrics.com/), disseminate via Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (https://www.mturk.com/mturk/). Follow- 
ing standard protocol (Oppenheimer, Meyvis, & Davidenko, 2009), response be exclude from participant who do 
not respond correctly to three ‘‘catch” trial assess attention to the task (n = 94). On average, we obtain 18 rating 
(SD = 2) for each of the domain-variable questions. Across all variable and domains, the mean standard deviation of rating 
be 1.6 (SD = 0.32), indicate a high level of inter-rater agreement. No substantial discrepancy in inter-rater agreement 
be observe across the variables. For Animacy, the mean standard deviation across the different domain rating be 
1.8 (SD = 0.4); for Concreteness: mean = 1.6 (SD = 0.4); for Embodiment: mean = 1.9 (SD = 0.4); for Externality: mean = 1.3 
(SD = 0.5); for Intersubjectivity: mean = 1.8 (SD = 0.3); for Valence: mean = 1.1 (SD = 0.3). See Supplemental Material for 
the mean variable rating for all 400 domains. 

3. Computational analysis and result 

To evaluate the hypothesis that the directionality of metaphorical mapping in history be systematic, we perform three 
analyses: (1) We test the extent to which direction of metaphorical extension record in the historical data set be pre- 
dicted by rating along the six dimension described above, either in isolation or in combination; (2) We then examine 
whether the same rating can be use to identify the semantic domain that have serve a source vs. target of metaphor- 
ical extensions, by collapse data across time; (3) Finally, we examine the most dominant variable in explain metaphor- 
ical mapping across time, to ass whether it explanatory power have be consistent over the course of history. Next, we 
describe the computational method and result for each of these analyses. 

3.1. Analysis I: Predicting direction of metaphorical mapping over history 

In the first analysis, we examine whether rating difference along the six candidate variable might account for the 
directionality of metaphorical mapping in history. That is, give a pair of domain for which metaphorical mapping have 
be recorded, do know how each domain be rat on some variable dimension predict which domain will be the 
source, and which the target? We perform this analysis by first treat each variable in isolation. We then combine 
the variable to see if their combination could further account for the historical data. 

To examine the explanatory power of the six candidate variable individually, we create a parameter-free model for each 
of the variable that predicts the direction of metaphorical mapping between a give pair of semantic domain record in

HTE. This simple model calculates the difference in average rating of a pair of domain along the variable dimension of 
interest. It then make a correspond prediction about the direction in which meaning extension should take place in his- 
tory (according to that psychological dimension), without require any adjustable parameter. 

Apart from the valence model, the five other model predict that the domain with the high mean rating along a certain 
variable will be the source of metaphorical mapping, and the domain with the low mean rating will be the target. For 
instance, for the animacy variable, we predict the direction of mapping to be Animate? Inanimate, such that between 
any pair of domain (A,B) record in the historical data set, the domain that be rat a more animate on average (from 
the survey described before) would more commonly serve a the source, and the domain that be rat a less animate on 
average would serve a the target: 
A ¼ source; B ¼ target; iff E½AnimacyðAÞ� > E½AnimacyðBÞ� ð1Þ 

Similar model be construct for the concreteness, embodiment, externality, and intersubjectivity variables. We con- 

structed the valence model slightly differently because the underlie variable be polarize (i.e. a domain can be either pos- 
itive or negative). Thus we instead calculate the absolute value of valence ratings. Concretely, a domain rat 7 (highly 
positive) on the 7-point scale would be treat a equally-valenced a a domain rat 1 (highly negative). For this model, 
we predict the direction of mapping to be: Less valenced?More valenced, such that between any pair of domain in 
the data set, the domain that be rat a more valenced on average would serve a the target, and the domain that be 
rat a less valenced on average would serve a the source: 
A ¼ target; B ¼ source; iff E½ValenceðAÞ� > E½ValenceðBÞ� ð2Þ 

Table 1 specifies the predict direction of each model along with example mapping from the historical database that 

the model successfully account for. 
We use 50% a the baseline represent the possibility that source and target be random with respect to our six vari- 

ables. The result appear in Fig. 1a. Overall, all model predict direction in historical mapping above chance. In partic- 
ular, externality (accuracy = 73.9%) and concreteness (73.5%) be most accurate and roughly equivalent to one another. 
These be follow by intersubjectivity (60.7%), valence (59.6%), embodiment (56.7%), and animacy (52.6%). These result 
indicate that historical metaphorical mapping follow systematic and predictable directions, such that between a pair of 
domains, the domain that be rat high (or low for the valence dimension) on these variable be more likely to be the 
source, and the remain domain be more likely to be the target. 

We next examine the degree of correlation among the six variables, seek to understand which of these variable 
might be redundant with each other, and which variable might be less correlate and hence might offer complementary 
explanatory power to each other. Fig. 1b show the Pearson correlation between all pair of variables. As can be seen, exter- 
nality and concreteness be most strongly inter-correlated (r(400) = 0.84, p < 0.001). For this reason, we expect these 
variable to make similar prediction about mapping direction and for one to make little independent contribution to 
explain the directionality of metaphorical mapping over the other. Intersubjectivity be most strongly correlate with 
both externality (r(400) = 0.44, p < 0.001) and concreteness (r(400) = 0.47, p < 0.001) among the remain pairwise correla- 
tions. Animacy, embodiment, and valence be generally less correlate with other variables. 

To take into account these pattern of inter-correlation, we investigate how well the six variable in combination predict 
the historical direction of metaphorical mappings, and the extent to which each variable contributes towards these predic- 
tions. We first formulate the problem use standard logistic regression. For each instance of the 4960 domain-to-domain 
mapping (indexed by i) record in the database, we cod the direction of mapping – the observation to be predict 
(denoted by y) – between a pair of domain (A,B) a ‘0’ if the mapping be A? B (i.e. domain A serf a source) and ‘1’ 
if the mapping be A B (i.e. domain A serf a target). We then create a 6-dimensional predictor x from the six candi- 
date variable by take the difference in mean rating along these variable dimension for all correspond instance 
recorded: 
x ¼ ½E½AnimacyðAÞ� � E½AnimacyðBÞ�; . . . ; E½ValenceðAÞ� � E½ValenceðBÞ�� ð3Þ 

If our prediction about these variable be correct, we should expect some subset of them to account well for the histor- 

ical direction of metaphorical mappings, and in way consistent with our proposal about prefer directionality. To test 
this, we regress y against x by minimize the standard logistic loss function: 
LðbÞ ¼ 
X 

i 

logð1þ expð�bTxiyiÞÞ ð4Þ 
Here b (or beta) be a vector of weight to be determine from the data. Each weight represent the relative contribution of 
each of the variable dimension in accounting for the historical data, a an assessment of the theoretical proposal formalize 
in Eqs. (1) and (2). For example, if a high mean rating along a variable dimension predicts a domain to be the source of 
metaphorical mapping (e.g. in the case of externality), we would expect the correspond weight to be positively value 
and significantly above zero if the contribution of the variable in question be substantial. In contrast, if a low mean rating 
along a variable dimension predicts a domain to be the source (e.g. valence), we would expect the correspond weight to 
be negatively value and significantly below zero.

To ass the degree to which the variable in combination predict the data, we apply 10-fold cross validation, which be 
a common technique for evaluate predictive accuracy (e.g., Kohavi, 1995). At each round, we held out 10% of the data for 
the model to make prediction about, while fitting the model use the remain 90% of the data. We repeat this proce- 
dure 10 times, hold out a different set of data during each round, and compute the predictive accuracy on the held-out 
sets. The mean cross-validated accuracy of the logistic model be 77.1%, indicate that there be a small advantage of pre- 
dicting the historical data by allow the variable to contribute simultaneously to explain each mapping, a compare 
to fitting the data by treat the variable in isolation (recall that in the latter single-variable method, the most accurate 
model be externality, at 73.9%). 

To understand the contribution of the variable in accounting for the data, we visualize the distribution of their weight 
from the logistic regression analysis by fitting the data (Fig. 1c). To evaluate the significance of these weights, we perform 
statistical bootstrapping by resampling the data 10,000 time and re-estimating the weight from these bootstrapped trials. 
The result indicate that externality be the dominant factor underlie historical metaphorical mappings, a it receive the 
large weight among the six variable (p < 0.0001, beta = 0.436, 95% CI [0.380, 0.492]). The result also reveal that 
although embodiment (p < 0.0001, beta = 0.127, 95% CI [0.078, 0.176]), valence (p < 0.01, beta = �0.093, 95% CI [�0.164, 
�0.023]) and concreteness (p < 0.002, beta = 0.119, 95% CI [0.047, 0.191]) receive small weight than externality, their 
contribution be nevertheless significant. Finally, animacy (p = 0.24, beta = 0.025, 95% CI [�0.016, 0.065]) and intersubjec- 
tivity (p = 0.121, beta = �0.065, 95% CI [�0.147, 0.017]) do not have significant weights.

Because the standard logistic model do not incorporate variable selection, it be possible that the set of significant vari- 
ables we described might contain redundancy. For example, the correlation analysis we described show that externality 
be highly correlate with concreteness. To address this issue, we perform an additional analysis by incorporate variable 
selection within logistic regression, via an L1-penalized sparsity constraint. In particular, instead of minimize the loss func- 
tion in Eq. (4), we impose a penalty term in the minimization procedure: 
Fig. 2. 
variable 
dimens 
LL1ðbÞ ¼ LðbÞ þ k 
X 

j 

jbjj ð5Þ 
Here j index the weight on the six variable dimensions, and by sum |bj| over these dimension this formulation intro- 
duce a sparse penalty on the L1 norm of the weight (hence this penalty will shrink variable weight towards zero if the 
correspond variable contribute trivially or redundantly towards explain the data, effectively incorporate variable 
selection in the minimization procedure). k determines the relative weight between the original loss function L(b) and 
the L1 norm and be typically a tune parameter. To probe the key variable in a comprehensive way, we examine the full 
regularization path by vary the k value systematically from 1 to 1000 in 50 equal step in the log space. 

Fig. 2 show how the distribution of weight varied in the regularization path we probed. The result indicate the emer- 
gence of three key variable – externality, embodiment, and valence – which retain their weight a the k value increased. 
At the same time, other variable be either minimal (e.g., animacy contribute trivially towards explain the data and 
hence it weight be minimal) or shrunken towards zero a a result of the sparsity constraint (e.g., concreteness correlate 
highly with externality and it weight tend towards zero a the k value increased). The sign of weight on the key vari- 
ables be also informative and consistent with our theoretical predictions, indicate that domain receive high rating 
along externality and embodiment dimension have commonly serve a source of metaphorical mapping, whereas 
domain receive low rating along valence (i.e. neutral domains) commonly serve a target of metaphorical mapping. 

Taken together, these analysis indicate that externality (or concreteness, with which it be highly correlated) play a dom- 
inant role in predict the directionality of historical metaphorical extension. Also, these analysis suggest that externality, 
embodiment, and valence together define a relatively orthogonal space that help explain the directionality of the majority 
of record metaphorical mappings. These finding provide the first large-scale evidence for the idea that metaphorical 
sens have developed across history in systematic and predictable ways, constrain by a relatively compact set of psycho- 
logical dimensions. 

Fig. 3 visualizes trend in the historical metaphorical mapping among the 400 semantic domain in a binary matrix. Each 
non-zero entry (i.e., white dot) in the matrix record the presence of a record mapping between a pair of domains. To ver- 
ify that variable such a externality best explain the data, we take a bottom-up, data-driven approach, and apply a prin- 
cipal component analysis to this matrix and correlate the first eigenvector – the dimension that account for the most 
variability in the data – against the domain rating of the six variables. Our independent measure of externality (r(400) 
= 0.349; p < 0.0001, Bonferroni-corrected) and concreteness (r(400) = 0.342; p < 0.0001, Bonferroni-corrected) – but not

the dominant role of these psychological dimension in explain the directionality of metaphorical mapping in history. 
3.2. Analysis II: Identifying the source and target domain of metaphorical mapping 

Our analysis so far have focus on metaphorical mapping arise at different time point in history, but the outcome of 
these diachronic change should also be reflect in more global, time-independent asymmetry a to which domain tend 
to be the source of metaphorical extension, and which the targets. We next examine the extent to which the candidate 
variable dimension explain the source-target asymmetry of specific semantic domains, by collapse data across time 
points. 

To quantify the degree of source-target asymmetry in the metaphorically mapped domains, we formally define the 
asymmetry index (AI) a the difference between two probabilities: 
AI ¼ pðsourceÞ � pðtargetÞ ð6Þ 
Here, p(source) be the probability of a domain (D) serve a a source of metaphorical mapping across all time point 
(indexed by t) in history (i.e., a synchronic summary of ‘‘source” strength), and p(target) be the probability of a domain be 
a target of metaphorical mapping across time point (a synchronic summary of ‘‘target” strength).

Y. Xu et al. / Cognitive Psychology 96 (2017) 41–53 49 
We compute these probability on a per domain basis by sum all case of metaphorical mapping where a domain 
serve a a source or target respectively a record in the historical data set and normalize them by the total number of 
mappings: 
Fig. 4. 
domain 
pðsourceÞ ¼ 
X 

IðD ¼ sourceÞ= Number of mappings; ð7Þ 

pðtargetÞ ¼ 
X 

IðD ¼ targetÞ= Number of mapping ð8Þ 

It follow from this measure of source-target asymmetry that a high positive value of AI should indicate a strong source 

domain, whereas a low negative value of AI should indicate a weak source (or strong target) domain. Table 2 list the stron- 
gest source and target domain in the dataset base on the asymmetry index measure we described. 

We then compute Pearson correlation between each domain’s asymmetry index and it mean empirical rating for each 
of the variable dimensions. Fig. 4a summarizes the results. Ratings for all variable dimension except for those of animacy (r 
(400) = 0.09, p > 0.250) correlate significantly with the asymmetry index (p < 0.01 for the five candidate variables). Specif- 
ically, externality (r(400) = 0.46, p < 0.001) and concreteness (r(400) = 0.42, p < 0.001) show the high strength of cor- 
relation, consistent with their lead role in predict direction of metaphorical mapping (see Section 3.1). 
Intersubjectivity (r(400) = 0.22, p < 0.001) and embodiment (r(400) = 0.13, p < 0.009) be also moderately correlate with 
the asymmetry indices. These result suggest that domain that be external, concrete, embodied, and share a conceptual- 
ization across people tend to serve a source of metaphorical mapping across history. Finally, valence negatively correlate 
(r(400) = �0.19, p < 0.001) with asymmetry, suggest that more valenced domain tend to be target of metaphorical map- 
pings, also consistent with the analysis report in Section 3.1. 

Again take into account the inter-correlated nature of the variables, we perform a multiple linear regression to esti- 
mate the relative contribution of the six variables. We expect the most important (and orthogonal) predictor rating to be 
weight the high when regress against the asymmetry indices. Fig. 4b show the relative contribution of these vari- 
ables a reflect by their weights. The regression fit have a Pearson r(393) = 0.42, p < 0.001. The candidate variable with the 
large absolute weight be externality (p < 0.001, beta = 0.007, 95% CI [0.0037, 0.0093]), follow by embodiment (p < 0.09,

beta = 0.0019, 95% CI [�0.0002, 0.0040]) and valence (p > 0.250, beta = �0.001, 95% CI [�0.0026, 0.0007]), although neither of 
the latter two variable contribute significantly beyond externality. This result provide a synchronic confirmation to the 
result from the analysis present in Section 3.1, which found that the same set of variable account for most of the vari- 
ance in explain metaphorical mapping direction during different historical epochs. 

Fig. 5 provide two concrete example illustrate the power of the externality variable in explain the direction of 
metaphorical mappings. ‘‘Water” be rat a a highly external domain (mean externality rating = 6.2 out of 7), and a 
shown, almost all metaphorical mapping involve this domain in our dataset consist of projection from this domain 
to other domains, exemplify the principle that external domain tend to act a source of metaphorical mapping across 
history. In contrast, ‘‘Mind” be rat a a highly internal domain (mean externality rating = 1.4), and a shown, almost all 
mapping involve this domain be projection from other domain to this domain, exemplify the principle that inter- 
nal domain tend to be the target of metaphorical mappings. 

Taken together, our diachronic (Section 3.1) and synchronic (Section 3.2) analysis suggest that metaphorical sense exten- 
sion be highly systematic and constrain by a compact set of variables.

3.3. Analysis III: Assessing externality through time 

The analysis present in Sections 3.1 and 3.2 have indicate that externality be the strong factor in explain the 
direction of historical metaphorical mappings. As discuss before, external domain could commonly provide a source of 
metaphorical mapping if they be the most cognitively available and accessible to extend further. To further understand 
if the External? Internal mapping be a privileged direction of semantic change, we test whether external domain have 
remain a strong source of metaphorical mapping throughout history. An alternative possibility be that externality be a 
strong predictor only at the very early point in history (e.g., because external idea tend to be lexicalize earlier), such 
that external domain have only serve a source of metaphorical mapping during these periods. 

To distinguish between these two possibilities, we perform a time-course analysis that examine the strength of exter- 
nal domain a source over times. Specifically, we categorize the available domain in our data set a ‘‘external” or ‘‘inter- 
nal” depend on whether the rating of externality for each domain be high or low than ‘‘4” (the middle scale value 
between highly external ‘‘7” and highly internal ‘‘1”; Our result obtain regardless of the exact threshold use to separate 
external and internal domains). Then, we compute the source probability (described in Section 3.2) for each of the two 
group of domain at each of the available historical time point provide in the corpus. If externality serf a a strong pre- 
dictor for metaphorical mapping mainly due to the lexicalization of external concept at the early point in history, the 
source probability for external domain should on average be high than for internal domains, but this difference should 
decrease over time. On the other hand, if External? Internal be a privileged direction of semantic change, external domain 
should have great source probability than the internal domain across time. 

Our analysis support the second possibility (see Fig. 6). Specifically, external domain have significantly high source 
probability than internal domain throughout the 1300-year period (joint p < 0.001, n = 18 time point with Fisher’s 
method; time point with minimal p < 7.71e�011, t(396) = 6.57; time point with maximal p < 0.035, t(396) = 1.81). Also, 
source probability for the external domain do not differ significantly between the initial and end period (p > 0.250, t 
(476) = �0.29). 

Fig. 6 show a comparison of external domain against embody (vs. less-embodied) and valenced (vs. less-valenced) 
domains, with result obtain via parallel analysis to those use for externality.1 In contrast with externality, embody 
and valenced domain do not serve a sustain source for metaphorical mapping across time. Specifically, embody 
domain tend to be source of metaphorical mapping only early in history (possibly because concept in these domain 
be lexicalize early in time), whereas valenced domain act a weak source of metaphorical mappings, but only late 
in historical time. Together, these observation be consistent with the idea that External? Internal be a privileged basis for 
metaphorical mapping, with concept from more external domain provide a mean for communicate about concept from 
more internal domains. 

4. Discussion 

The present study focus on one of the key mechanism through which word gain new meanings: metaphorical map- 
ping. By draw on an historical record of semantic change in English, we evaluate – on a large scale – whether new 
metaphorical word sens have developed in systematic directions. We discover that a compact set of variable include 
externality and embodiment account for directionality in the majority of record metaphorical mapping between 
domains, date back 1100 years. Specifically, we found that, give a pair of domains, the domain with the high mean 
1 We found concreteness to be highly similar to externality, and we found no statistical significance for animacy and intersubjectivity. For conciseness, we 
omit present these results. 



52 Y. Xu et al. / Cognitive Psychology 96 (2017) 41–53 
rating along these variable will more commonly be the source of metaphorical mapping, and the domain with the low 
mean rating will more commonly be the target. Furthermore, we found that externality – the strong predictor – explain 
the direction of metaphorical mapping throughout the history of English, and not just for an initial period early in English 
vocabulary development. 

Our finding lend strong support to the idea that the evolution of metaphorical polysemy proceeds in systematic ways. 
The six variable that we explore be motivate by communicative and cognitive considerations, draw upon theory 
of cognition and language. Our analysis provide evidence that the large majority of direction of metaphorical extension 
over history can be explain by a compact set of variables, which suggests that metaphor provide an efficient way of com- 
press emerge meaning into an exist lexicon, without require the construction of word form de novo. Our work 
thus extends previous study about communicative and cognitive constraint on synchronic feature of language such a 
word length (Piantadosi et al., 2011; Zipf, 1949) and semantic structure (Kemp & Regier, 2012; Regier et al., 2015) to explain 
the evolution of metaphorical polysemy in the lexicon (cf. Blank and Koch, 1999; Geeraerts, 1997). The current work also 
contributes to a comprehensive assessment of metaphorical thought by connect previous theory of metaphor such a 
the Conceptual Metaphor Theory (Lakoff & Johnson, 1980; Reddy, 1979) with historical data of language change at scale. 

In many respects, our find – that the directionality of historical metaphorical sense extension be highly systematic – be 
surprising. Due to the ever-changing cultural condition and resultant communicative need that have pressure word to 
develop new sens (cf. Aitchison, 2001), metaphorical sense extension could have in principle be varied and unpre- 
dictable across words. It be clear that cultural condition and communicative need have shape metaphorical extension 
in many cases. For instance, mouse would never have be extend to a computer accessory if the invention of the com- 
puter have not come about, nor would file or folder have be extend from object held in the hand to virtual one without 
specific cultural developments. Our data demonstrate that, in spite of the effect of complex and dynamic cultural condi- 
tions, there be an underlie regularity to the direction of metaphorical sense extension driven by measurable communica- 
tive and cognitive principles. 

Our result leave open exactly why variable such a externality be reliable predictor of directionality in metaphorical 
mapping across history. On the one hand, these result could be take to support theory emphasize the role of metaphor 
in thought include Conceptual Metaphor Theory. By these accounts, idea tie to human experience and sensation provide 
anchor for think about more abstract ideas. As such, more external (and embodied) word meaning be predict to be 
well understood and richly structured, and to provide a source of mapping for idea that be more difficult to understand. 
Alternatively, our result may not reveal that abstract concept be understood in term of external and embody concepts, 
per se, but rather, that external and embody word meaning be easy to achieve share reference for and to learn 
(Srinivasan & Carey, 2010; Thibodeau & Durgin, 2008) because of their salience and physical availability in experience. It 
be also possible that external meaning tend to be more frequent, and may thus be easy to retrieve for speaker who wish 
to communicate new idea (Hanley et al., 2013; cf. Winter et al., 2014). Relatedly, more external concept may tend to prime 
more internal concept than vice versa, contribute to directionality in language change (e.g., Jaeger & Rosenbach, 2008). 
Regardless of how these issue be resolved, our finding support the idea that metaphorical polysemy have be shape 
by cognitive and communicative pressure in way that facilitate the efficient creation, learning, and use of newword senses. 

Our work raise question for future research in computational approach to semantic change and polysemy. First, our 
analysis examine metaphorical sense extension at the level of semantic domains. In the future, it would be valuable to 
ass the systematicity of sense extension at the level of individual words, which would require a different source of data. 
Second, although the database we examine be large, it be not an exhaustive set of metaphorical mapping in English lan- 
guage history. Ultimately, it would be desirable to have a full record of mapping to assess. Third, we also note that the vari- 
able rating of the semantic domain that we use in our analysis be base on intuition from subject living in the 
present era, a oppose to in the past. Although we see no reason for why this would be the case, in principle these semantic 
domain could have be perceive differently in the era in which metaphorical extension be create (e.g., in term of 
their externality, embodiment, etc.). Future analysis could confirm the validity of the rating we obtain by seek other 
converge form of historical evidence. 

More broadly, our analysis focus only on the directionality of metaphorical mappings, and whether some domain 
more commonly serve a sources, and others more commonly a targets. However, our finding leave open how speaker 
decide which concept from source domain to employ when they wish to communicate about a new idea in a target domain 
(e.g., Zhang, Geeraerts, & Speelman, 2015): For example, what lead speaker to the choose the physical action meaning of 
grasp – a oppose to some other external and embody word meaning – to communicate about the comprehension of 
ideas? Addressing this problem would presumably require in-depth knowledge about structural similarity between con- 
cepts in different domain and their retrieval probabilities, to help explain which mapping be possible. Additional work 
be also require to explore whether the principle that underlie metaphorical sense extension can be apply to explain other 
mechanism of word sense extension, such a metonymy and semantic chain (e.g., Lakoff, 1987; Ramiro, Malt, & 
Srinivasan, & Xu, 2017; Xu, Regier, & Malt, 2016), and whether model that be successful in predict English data fare 
a well in predict semantic evolution in other languages. The latter be particularly important for support the claim 
of general cognitive and communicative principle a driver of systematic sense extension. Finally, it will also be important 
to understand the socio-cultural factor that explain the rise or fall in communicative need for different semantic domains. 
The current work provide an empirical approach for further exploration into the evolution and nature of word meaning.
