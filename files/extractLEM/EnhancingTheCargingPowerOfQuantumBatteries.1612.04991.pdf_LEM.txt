Can collective quantum effect make a difference in a meaningful thermodynamic operation? Focusing on 
energy storage and batteries, we demonstrate that quantum mechanic can lead to an enhancement in the amount 
of work deposit per unit time, i.e., the charge power, when N battery be charge collectively. We first 
derive analytic upper bound for the collective quantum advantage in charge power for two choice of con- 
straints on the charge Hamiltonian. We then demonstrate that even in the absence of quantum entanglement 
this advantage can be extensive. For our main result, we provide an upper bound to the achievable quantum 
advantage when the interaction order be restricted, i.e., at most k battery be interacting. This constitutes a 
fundamental limit on the advantage offer by quantum technology over their classical counterparts.

Introduction – Technology be currently be miniaturise 
at such a rate that we must give serious thought to the funda- 
mental law and blueprint of the machine of the future. In 
the microscopic domain, where these machine be expect 
to function, fluctuation of both thermal and quantum nature 
begin to proliferate, and quantum effect must be include 
in any reasonable physical description. When we deal with 
technology work in this quantum regime, familiar ther- 
modynamic concept like work, heat, and entropy need to be 
apply with great care and consideration. It come a no sur- 
prise that there have be a recent intense effort to understand 
how the law of thermodynamics generalise to arbitrary quan- 
tum system away from equilibrium. This effort be know a 
quantum thermodynamics and, give current interest in the 
development of quantum technologies, it be receive a great 
deal of attention across a wide range of scientific communi- 
tie [1–3]. 

Despite current momentum in the field of quantum ther- 
modynamics, the explicit role of genuinely quantum feature 
in the operation of thermal machine be not fully understood. 
A common issue raise be that the universal applicability of 
thermodynamics be root in the theory’s complete lack of re- 
spect for microscopic details. So why then should thermody- 
namics really care about quantum mechanics? For example, 
the strike feature of Carnot’s bound for the efficiency of a 
heat engine lie in the fact that it be insensitive to microscopic 
detail [4]. Nevertheless, if one relaxes the assumption of 
large system size and quasi-static conditions, it be absolutely 
reasonable to get correction base on the fine detail of the 
work medium [5–8]. An important question be then: can 
such quantum feature be harness to improve other thermo- 
dynamically meaningful figure of merit, such a power?

Collective quantum phenomenon be know to offer advan- 
tages in area such a computation, secure communication, 
and metrology. Very recently, these possible advantage have 
receive some attention in the context of battery [9–17]. The 
issue be subtle, in particular when one deal with mixed states. 
In particular, Alicki and Fannes suggest that entangle op- 
erations lead to increase work extraction from an energy 
storage device which they coin a “quantum battery” [9]. 
Nonetheless, while entangle operation be necessary for 
optimal work extraction, it have be show that protocol ex- 
ist for which no entanglement be actually create during op- 
timal work extraction [10, 11]. Furthermore, consider a 
regime where entangle operation do not increase the ex- 
tractable energy, some of the author of the present work re- 
cently show that entangle operation can, nonetheless, en- 
hance the charge power of collection of two level quantum 
battery [15], also see [18]. However, the demonstration be 
reliant on a highly nonlocal Hamiltonian, which may be diffi- 
cult to implement in practice. 

In this Letter, we first formally define the collective quan- 
tum advantage for thermodynamic power, before derive it 
ultimate upper bound. Next, we show that attain a quan- 
tum advantage require entangle operations, but not entan- 
glement itself. We then go on to analytically prove that, for 
charge field with finite interaction order, i.e., involve at 
most k-body interaction terms, the quantum advantage be up- 
per bound by a quadratic function of k and cannot scale with 
the total number of batteries. Our result be a fundamental limit 
on how large power can be for physically realisable charge 
schemes, where the achievable interaction order be typically 
constrained. 

Quantum Batteries – We begin by define what we mean 
by a quantum battery: Consider a quantum system with an 
internal Hamiltonian I . Such a system can be use to store 
work by manipulate an external control field V (t) over some 
time interval t ∈ (0, T ). This generates the unitary dynamic

U = ~T exp{−i 
∫ T 

0 
dtH(t)}, where H(t) = I + V (t) and ~T 

be the time order operator (we set ~ = 1). Note that V (t) 
vanishes outside the time interval (0, T ). During the charge 
process, the system be take from an initial state ρ to a high 
energy final state σ = UρU† in a time T . Since the evolu- 
tion be unitary, there be no heat generate [19], and the work 
deposit onto the system be give by W = tr[I(σ − ρ)] with 
an average charge power give by P = W/T . 

Now, consider N such batteries, whose joint initial state be 
ρ⊗N . As before, we can deposit work on all of them by trans- 
form ρ⊗N into σ⊗N . One way to implement this transfor- 
mation be to perform the charge in parallel, follow ex- 
actly the procedure described above for each battery indepen- 
dently. In this case, the unitary transformation be simplyU⊗N , 
and the time take to charge N battery be equal to the single 
battery charge time: T‖ = T . Since the deposit work 
scale extensively, W‖ = NW , lead to a charge power 
P‖ = NP that grows linearly with the number of batteries. 

Alternatively, to deposit work onto an array of N batter- 
y we could apply a more general unitary transformation 
U , generate by the time-dependent N -battery Hamiltonian 
H(t) = 

∑N 
j=1 I 

(j) + V (t). Here, I(j) be the internal Hamil- 
tonian for the j-th battery, and we require that V (t) vanishes 
outside the time interval (0, T]). A bold font here denotes 
many-body operators. Henceforth, time-dependence will be 
left implicit where it be unambiguous. The crucial difference 
betweenU⊗N andU be thatV may contain term correspond- 
ing to interaction between battery – i.e., the battery be 
charge collectively. In this case the collective state of N - 
battery ρ may become entangled. As before, we require that 
the system be transform from state ρ⊗N to state σ⊗N via a 
cyclical operation; this ensures that the deposit work be the 
same a in the parallel case, i.e.,W] = NW = W‖. However, 
the joint time-evolved state ρ in this case may be entangled, 
and the time take to implement U and U could in principle 
be different, with T] ≤ T‖ in the optimal case. This in turn 
lead to different charge powers: P] ≥ P‖. 

Quantum advantage – We be now in a position to define 
the quantum advantage for collective charge a 

Γ := 
P] 
P‖ 

= 
T‖ 

T] 
, (1) 

where the second equality be a consequence of our requirement 
that the work do be independent of the charge method. 
Here, “quantum” refers specifically to an enhancement over 
charge with the best local (i.e., non-entangling) operations. 
That is, to compute the quantum advantage we must take the 
optimal value for P‖ (P]) for give ρ (ρ⊗N ) and σ (σ⊗N ). 

In order for this advantage to be meaningful, we must en- 
sure that the parallel and collective charge strategy be 
fairly compared. In particular, we would like to isolate the 
advantage due to collective quantum effect without worry 
about other consequence of introduce interaction between 
batteries, such a the increase energy available to drive tran- 
sitions. In order to take this extra energy into account, we 
must constrain the collective Hamiltonian H to be similar to∑ 
j H 

(j), the total Hamiltonian in the parallel charge case. 

Without constraints, we could freely increase the total energy 
of the collective charge Hamiltonian to achieve faster driv- 
ing, make the advantage arbitrarily large. Noting that the 
variance and mean energy be extensive quantity for non- 
interact systems, we consider two possible constraint on 
H , namely: 

(C1) The time-averaged standard deviation in energy during 
the collective evolution for time T] should not exceed 

√ 
N 

time that of a single battery, i.e., ∆E] ≤ 
√ 
N∆E with 

∆E] := 

∫ T] 
0 

dt 
∆Hρ 
T] 

, ∆E := 

∫ T‖ 
0 

dt 
∆Hρ 
T‖ 

, (2) 

where (∆Xy)2 := 〈(X − 〈X〉y)2〉y and 〈X〉y = tr[Xy]. 

(C2) The time-averaged energy during the collective evolution 
for time T] should not exceed N time that of a single battery, 
i.e., E] ≤ NE with 

E] := 

∫ T] 
0 

dt 
〈H − hg〉ρ 

T] 
, E := 

∫ T‖ 
0 

dt 
〈H − hg〉ρ 

T‖ 
, (3) 

where hg (hg) be the instantaneous ground state energy of H 
(H), that can also depend on time. 

We be free to choose either of these rescalings a a con- 
straint on H . They represent alternative way of accounting 
for the differ energetic structure of the parallel and collec- 
tive charge Hamiltonians. The choice of C1 and C2 be 
additionally motivate by the form of the quantum speed limit 
(see below). While C1 lead to a stricter upper bound on the 
quantum advantage, there be no reason a priori to choose one 
over the other. We be now ready to derive our first main re- 
sult. 

Upper bound – Since the quantum advantage define 
in Eq. (1) amount to a ratio of transition times, we can 
use the quantum speed limit (QSL) to upper bound it for 
a give constraint. The QSL state that the time re- 
quired to transform ρ⊗N into σ⊗N be low bound a 
T] ≥ T (N)QSL := LN max (1/E], 1/∆E]), where Lm := 
arccos( 

√ 
F [ρ⊗m, σ⊗m]) be the Bures angle and F (ρ, σ) := 

tr[ 
√√ 

ρ σ 
√ 
ρ]2 be the Uhlmann fidelity [20]. The two con- 

straints, C1 and C2, be clearly related to the QSL, a ∆E] 
andE] can be compute use Eqs. (2) and (3) respectively. If 
we could change the Hamiltonian at will to include arbitrary 
interaction terms, and only concern ourselves with the state 
transformation, we could replace H with a time-independent 
Hamiltonian such that the initial state traverse the great circle 
connect ρ⊗N and σ⊗N in the N -partite state space [21– 
23]. In the absence of further constraints, the evolution with 
such time-independent Hamiltonians be in fact optimal. In 
this case, the QSL reduces to the usual inequality due to 
Mandelstam-Tamm [24] and Margolus-Levitin [25], whereE] 
be replace by the average initial energy and ∆E] be replace 
by the average initial standard deviation. 

To derive the upper bound, we first confine ourselves to 
constraint C1. We proceed by note that the quantum speed 
limit for collectively charge N quantum battery be give 
by T] ≥ LN/∆E]. This mean that Γ ≤ T‖∆E]/LN . 



3 

Now, use constraint C1, i.e., ∆E] ≤ 
√ 
N∆E, we get 

Γ ≤ T‖ 
√ 
N∆E/LN . A similar argument can be make with 

constraint (C2). Taking into account that the speed limit for 
parallel charge be not always attainable, we arrive at the fol- 
low upper bound for the quantum advantage: 

ΓC1 ≤ β 
√ 
N 
L1 
LN 

and ΓC2 ≤ βN 
L1 
LN 

, (4) 

for constraint (C1) and (C2) respectively, where β := 
T‖/T 

(1) 
QSL quantifies the inability to saturate the QSL in the 

parallel case. 
Two remark be in order: Firstly, for orthogonal pure ini- 

tial and final states, the QSL can be saturate and β = 1. 
Though the quantum advantage for power could be large in 
other cases, include where the battery state be mixed [26], 
the improvement cannot grow with the number of batteries; 
i.e., β be a constant function ofN . Secondly, we have exclude 
case where ρ and σ do not lie on the same unitary orbit, a 
there be no way of transform the former into the latter us- 
ing the scheme outline above; the two state will therefore 
necessarily have the same spectrum [27]. 

The two bound in Eq. (4) be independent from each other, 
and constraint C1 be strong than C2, a it lead to a stricter 
bound on the quantum advantage. Many other bound can be 
derive by consider other extensive constraints. The quan- 
tum advantage be tight for orthogonal initial and final states, 
due to the example give in Ref. [15]. 

The significance of entanglement for quantum enhance- 
ment have previously be study in the context of quantum 
speed limit for pure states: it be show that, for non- 
interact systems, initial entanglement be require for an 
enhancement in the speed of evolution [28, 29], while for 
interact system a speedup may be achieve for initially 
separable states, since intermediate entangle state be ac- 
cessible [30–32]. In the more general case of mixed states, 
the necessity of entanglement for an enhancement may not be 
directly inferred, though it have be argue that, in general, 
large quantum Fisher information of the state with respect to 
the generator of evolution lead to enhance speed [33, 34]. 
In fact, a we now show, entanglement do not appear to be 
necessary for a nontrivial quantum advantage. 

Proposition 1 An extensive quantum advantage can be at- 
tained even for highly mixed states, include those confine 
to the separable ball throughout the charge procedure. 

We prove this with an explicit example: Consider N two- 
level battery with internal Hamiltonian I with eigenstates 
|E1〉 and |E0〉, and correspond energy E1 = 1 and 
E0 = 0. Let the initial state be thermal: ρ = exp(−�I)/Z 
at inverse temperature � with Z = tr[exp(−�I)], and the fi- 
nal state be σ = exp(�I)/Z . The optimal local charge 
scheme be achieve in time T‖ = π/2 by apply Hamil- 
tonian H = |E0〉〈E1|+ |E1〉〈E0| to each battery. In contrast, 
the joint charge of N battery be achieve in T] = T‖/α] 
use the global HamiltonianH] = α]H⊗N , where the posi- 
tive constant α] be introduce to satisfy the chosen constraint. 

In both case (local and global) the deposit work be iden- 
tical; thus, the quantum advantage be simply the ratio of T‖ to 
T]: Γ = α], which can be evaluate for the choice of con- 
straint. We find ΓC1 = 

√ 
N and ΓC2 = N (also ΓC0 = N for 

C0 give in Eq. (5)). 
ForN quantum system of d-dimensions, there exists a ball 

of radiusR(N, d), centre on the maximally mixed state, con- 
taining only separable state [35]. Since the distance from the 
maximally mixed state cannot change under unitary evolution, 
for a small enough choice of �, the joint state of N batter- 
y will lie within this ball throughout the evolution; yet, the 
quantum advantage remains extensive. � 

Remarkably, neither T‖ nor T] depend on �, while the to- 
tal work do does. In other words, no matter how mixed the 
battery be a quantum advantage that scale with the number of 
battery involve be always achievable. The trade-off of use 
highly mixed state be that the charge power suffers a � be- 
come small and smaller. Proposition 1 implies that, while 
a quantum advantage require entangle operations, the joint 
state of N -batteries do not have to be entangle during the 
charge process. 

The Hamiltonian use in the example above, and in 
Ref. [15], to saturate the bound for quantum advantage in- 
volvesN -body interactions. Such interaction be notoriously 
difficult to engineer. In the next section, we consider physi- 
cally realisable interactions, and study the dependence of the 
enhancement on the order of the charge interaction, i.e., the 
number of battery that take part in a single interaction term. 
k-local charge – We now investigate the achievability 

of a significant quantum advantage in a regime where arbi- 
trary multipartite entanglement generation be possible during 
the charge process. In particular, we demonstrate that, al- 
though a nontrivial quantum advantage be achievable in physi- 
cal system characterise by at most k-body interactions, this 
advantage – upper bound by a quantity that depends at most 
quadratically on k – cannot scale with the number N of bat- 
teries that compose the system. 

First, we consider the situation where work be deposit 
onto the battery by mean of a piecewise unitary circuit, an 
example of which be depict in Fig. 1 in the supplementary 
material (SM). This model be reminiscent of the circuit model 
of universal quantum computation, which be know to out- 
perform it classical counterpart. In this case, the collective 
state of N-batteries will, in general, be highly entangled. This 
scheme allows u to study how the quantum advantage be re- 
lated to the number of battery that be simultaneously inter- 
acting. 

We consider battery compose ofN d-level systems, with 
internal Hamiltonian I = 

∑ 
j I 

(j), a before. More explicitly, 
and without loss of generality, we assume that each term be 
give by I(j) = 

∑d 
l=1 λl|l〉j〈l|j with λd − λ1 = 2λd > 0, 

and with eigenvalue arrange in increase order. The time 
interval [0, T]] be divide up into L steps: at each step the 
Hamiltonian be the sum of s = dN/ke terms, each act on 
a different set of k batteries. In order to allow the formation 
of highly entangle states, these partition could be different 
at each step. At any time t, the k-local Hamiltonian can be 
write a H = 

∑s 
µ=1 hµ where each term hµ act on a dif- 



4 

ferent k-partition of the Hilbert space, identify by the set 
µ = (µ1, . . . , µk) of k indices. 

In order to make a meaningful statement in this scenario, 
we need to introduce a third constraint: 

(C0) The time-averaged operator norm of the drive Hamil- 
tonian H during the collective evolution for time T] should 
not exceed N time that of a single battery drive Hamilto- 
nian, i.e., E] ≤ NE with 

E] := 
1 

T] 

∫ T] 
0 

dt ‖H‖op and E := 
1 

T‖ 

∫ T‖ 
0 

dt ‖H‖op, (5) 

where the operator norm ‖A‖op be define a the large sin- 
gular value of A. 

Constraint C0 guarantee that both the time-averaged stan- 
dard deviation and the time-averaged energy be bound 
from above, a show in Sec. A of SM. There, we show that 
E] upper bound both E]/2 and ∆E]. In this sense, it be a 
stricter constraint than C1 or C2. 

We now show that, with this constraint, the upper bound on 
the quantum advantage depends on the interaction order k: 

Theorem 2 For a circuit base charge procedure with in- 
teraction order of at most k, the achievable quantum advan- 
tage be upper bound a ΓC0 < γk, where γ be a constant 
that do not scale with the number N of batteries. 

Proof in Sec. B of SM. In the important case where ρ and σ 
be the ground and maximally excite state respectively, γ = 
π/2. By construction, the bound on the quantum advantage be 
not tight. For comparison, it have be show elsewhere that 
ΓC1 = 

√ 
k and ΓC2 = k be achievable if the total number 

of battery N can be divide by k, i.e., if N/k = s ∈ N [15, 
36]. In this particular case, such a speed-up can be obtain 
for pure state use the time-independent Hamiltonian H =√ 
s 
∑s 
µ=1 hµ, with hµ = |1〉⊗k〈d|⊗k + h.c., assume that 

each hµ act on a completely different set of k batteries, i.e., 
[hµ, hµ′ ] = 0 ∀µ, µ′. In the same situation, use constraint 
C0 we obtain ΓC0 = k, suggest that the strict inequality 
in Theorem 2 be only different by a constant factor from an 
achievable bound. 

Theorem 2 can be extend to more general cases, where 
k-body time-dependent interaction can occur between over- 
lap set of batteries, with the restriction that each battery 
be simultaneously interact with at most m others. This re- 
striction be motivate by the idea that the reach of the interac- 
tion should be limited. 

Theorem 3 For a generic time-dependent charge proce- 
dure, the achievable quantum advantage be upper bound a 
ΓC0 < γ 

( 
k2(m − 1) + k 

) 
, where k be the interaction order 

and m be the maximum participation number. 

The proof be give in Sec. C of SM. For many physical 
systems, both k and m be limited: 2 or 3-body interaction 
be the norm for fundamental processes, and high interac- 
tion order be generally hard to engineer here [37–39]. The 
effective participation number, or reach, m tends to be con- 
strain by the spatial arrangement of system and the fact 

that interaction strength often drop off with distance. Excep- 
tions to this include the Dicke model [40] where collective 
coherence lead to superradiance, the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick 
model [41], where all particle interact with each other, and 
the Mølmer-Sørensen interaction [42], in which an ensemble 
of ion be effectively couple by a spatially uniform electro- 
magnetic field. 

Note that these bound be not tight; while a scale of the 
power P] with the number of batteriesN be surely not feasible 
in the context of k-body interactions, it be more likely that 
the quantum advantage be tightly limited by k. In fact, we 
conjecture that, for any choice ofH , a conservative bound for 
the quantum advantage be give by ΓC0 < γk: 

Conjecture 4 Theorem 2 hold for any time-dependent k- 
body interaction Hamiltonian. 

We examine this particular statement in SM Sec. D, an- 
ticipating that the result hold if a particular mathematical 
conjecture do too. While we cannot exclude measure zero 
cases, a large sample of charge Hamiltonians (generated 
from Haar-random unitary operations), with (N, k) = (3, 2), 
(4, 2), (4, 3) and (6, 2), have fail to produce any counterex- 
amples. We believe that similar conjecture should also hold 
for constraint C1 and C2. 

Conclusions – In this Letter, we have introduce the notion 
of collective quantum advantage for thermodynamic power. 
Our result directly complement a previous strain of research 
into quantum speed limits, by derive a concrete upper bound 
on the ratio between the maximum speed of interact and 
non-interacting drive between separable states. We have 
proven two fundamental upper bound for the quantum ad- 
vantage, each correspond to a different constraint on the 
charge Hamiltonian. We have also show analytically that 
a quantum advantage that grows with the number of battery 
be not achievable with any physically reasonable Hamiltonian 
(i.e., one with at most k-body interactions). Nevertheless, a 
quantum advantage that grows with the interaction order k can 
be achieved. 

The quantum advantage have be interpret a the re- 
sult of rapid evolution through the space of high-dimensional 
quantum states, typically obtain by mean of global oper- 
ations [15]. While, in the case of pure states, entanglement 
be a necessary consequence of these global operations, a fully 
separable evolution be still accessible for those state that live 
in the separable ball. 

A strike consequence of our results, which hold in gen- 
eral for mixed states, be that an enhance charge power be 
available even for arbitrarily mixed states, in remarkable anal- 
ogy to the case of quantum metrology. There, an enhancement 
in sense be still available for highly mixed state lie inside 
the separable ball [43]. 

While collective behaviour have be demonstrate to pro- 
vide an advantage in perform many information theoretic 
tasks, such distinction from classical behaviour be few and 
far between in thermodynamics. This Letter demonstrates that 
thermodynamic process can indeed benefit from collective 
effect when time enters the picture, though physical limita- 
tions on the interaction order prevent u from utilise them.

of how quantum theory and thermodynamics be related.

SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL: ENHANCING THE 
CHARGING POWER OF QUANTUM BATTERIES 

Appendix A: Relation between constraint 

Here we show that ∆E] ≤ E] and E] ≤ 2E] by direct compu- 
tation. In the first case we have 

∆E] =

dt ‖H‖op = E], (A1) 

where we have use tr[H2ρ(t)] ≤ ‖H2‖op = ‖H‖2op to get 
to the final line. 

Similarly, the time-averaged energy 

E] =

dt ‖H‖op = 2E]. (A2) 

Thus, if the time-averaged operator norm of the Hamiltonian 
be bounded, ∆E] and E] be also bounded. 

Appendix B: Proof of Theorem 2 

Proof. Consider W (t) = tr[Iρ(t)] − tr[Iρ⊗N ], the average 
work do on the system up to time t during the charge pro- 
cess. The instantaneous power be give by P (t) = dtW (t) = 
itr{[H, I]ρ(t)}. The strict inequality 

P] = 
1 

T] 

∫ T]

dtP (t) < max 
H 
{‖[H, I]‖op} =: P ↑ (B1) 

follow from the fact that any unitary charge have to have 
vanish instantaneous power for time t = 0 and t = T]. 
We now evaluate the commutator [H, I] in order to find an 
upper bound P ↑ for the average power P], remember that 
we have I = 

∑ 
j I 

(j) and H = 
∑s 
µ=1 hµ. We will use the 

subscript µ̄ to indicate the set of battery index that be not 
include in partition define by µ. Using the commutation 
relation between hµ and I(j) we obtain 

[H, I] = 

s∑ 
µ=1 

[ 
hµ ⊗ 1µ̄ , 

∑k 
j=1I 

(µj) ⊗ 1µ̄j 
] 

= 
∑ 
µ 

[ 
hµ , 

∑k 
j=1I 

(µj) ⊗ 1i 6=µj∈µ 
] 
⊗ 1µ̄. (B2) 

Using the definition for I , it follow from direct calculation 
that ‖ 

∑k 
i=1I 

(µi)‖op = λdk. Let u define αµ := ‖hµ‖op and 
introduce two normalize operator Xµ and ιµ, a follows: 

Xµ = 
hµ 
αµ 
, ιµ = 

1 

λdk 

k∑ 
i=1 

I(µi). (B3) 

Using these, we can rewrite the commutator a 

[H, I] = 2 · λdk 
∑ 
µ 

αµ 
1 

2 
[Xµ, ιµ]⊗ 1µ̄ 

= 2λdk 
∑ 
µ 

αµYµ ⊗ 1µ̄, (B4) 

where Yµ = 12 [Xµ, ιµ], such that ‖Yµ‖op ≤ 1. 
At any time t, the operator norm of the Hamiltonian H be 

give by 

‖H‖op = 
∥∥∥∥ s∑ 
µ=1 

hµ 

∥∥∥∥ 
op 

= 
s∑ 

µ=1 

‖hµ‖op = 
s∑ 

µ=1 

|αµ|, (B5) 

where the equality hold due to the fact that, at each step 
in time, every term hµ act on a different k-partition of the 
Hilbert space. Accordingly, we obtain that

0 

dt‖H‖op =

∫ T]

s∑

|αµ| ≤ NE . (B6) 

Now we consider the expression give in Eq. (B4), to cal- 
culate the upper bound P ↑. Once again, we use the fact that 
at each step in time there be s term act on different k- 
partition of the Hilbert space, such that the operator norm of 
[H, I] can be calculate exactly, 

‖[H, I]‖op = 2λdk

s∑ 
µ=1 

‖αµYµ ⊗ 1µ̄‖op 

≤ 2λdk 
s∑ 

µ=1 

|αµ|, (B7) 

where the inequality in line Eq. (B7) hold due to the fact that 
‖Yµ‖op ≤ 1 by definition, and where the sum can be carry 
out of the operator norm thanks to the fact that, at any give 
time, the s subgroup of k battery be not overlapping. Using 
Eq. (B6), we obtain

FIG. 1. (Color online) Unitary circuit with k=2. At each time 
step t, the drive Hamiltonian consists of a set of s = N/2 terms, 
each of which involve a different pair of battery i, j. The result 
be s independent unitary operation u(t)ii+1 act on pair i, i + 1. 
Note that at each step, there be no overlap between different pair of 
batteries; at every successive step the pair be change in order to 
allow the formation of highly entangle states. A circuit of this type 
can be use to approximate any time-dependent unitary evolution 
U(t) [47], with precision that increase with the number of step 
L. The implementation of U require an extra amount of time that 
depends on the number of non-commuting term in the Hamiltonian. 

We calculate the quantum advantage a in Eq. (1), where P‖ be 
give by the ratio between W‖ and T‖ = βL1/min{E,∆E}. 
Work W‖ = NW be extensive, and in general W = q2λd,

Appendix C: Proof of Theorem 3 

Proof. Here our goal be to relate a generic unitary evolution 
to a circuit base charge procedure. We first note that the 
charge Hamiltonian can always be decompose into a num- 
ber M of non-commuting terms: 

H(t) = 

M∑ 
j=1 

H(j)(t) with H(j)(t) = 
s∑ 

µ=1 

h(j)µ (t), (C1) 

where [h(j)µ (t), h 
(j) 
µ′ (t)] = 0; this decomposition be in general 

different for different value of t. The unitary evolution U 
generate by this time-dependent Hamiltonian can always be 
approximated, use the Trotter-Suzuki decomposition [47], 
by the follow product of unitary tranformations: 

UTrot = 

L∏ 
l=1 

M∏ 
j=1 

exp 

[ 
−iH(j) 

( 
lT] 
L 

) 
T] 
L 

] 
. (C2) 

In the limit L → ∞, UTrot = U ; however, they do not cor- 
respond to the same implementation: The Hamiltonian gen- 
erating UTrot be piecewise time-independent and in the cir- 
cuit form discuss in Sec. B. Since each of the M term at 

each time step must be implement sequentially,UTrot take 
M time longer to run than U , with a correspond drop in 
power P] = MPTrot. 

Since we have an upper bound, from Theorem 2, on the 
quantum advantage for circuit model Hamiltonians, and the 
power for a more general Hamiltonian be at most M time 
greater, it must be that ΓC0 < Mγk in this case. In order to 
complete the proof, we now need to consider how the mini- 
mum necessary value of M scale with k and m. 

The quantity m denotes the maximum number of other bat- 
teries any one can interact with. In order for the number of 
term M in Eq. (C1) to be sufficient for the require decom- 
position, it must at least equal the large possible number of 
different k-partitions µ that have a non-trivial amount of in- 
dice in common, while contain the same index µi at most 
m times. Let u provide a few simple example to clarify the 
meaning of M , where we will assume that N can be arbitrar- 
ily large. 

(k = 2,m = 1) In this case M be trivially equal to 1. 
A possible choice be give by the first 2-partition (1, 2), after 
which any other partition (i, j) can contain neither 1 nor 2. 
This have to be true for any choice of other partitions, therefore 
M = 1. In other words, in this case, the trotterization be not 
necessary and the unitary can be perfectly simulated with a 
piecewise unitary circuit. 

(k = 2,m = 2) Let u start with the first 2-partition 
(1, 2), follow by (2, 3) and (1, 3). Any other choice of two 
index would form a partition that do not contain any ele- 
ment of at least one of the previous three, thus M = 3. In this 
case the simulate circuit be at most 3 time slow than the 
actual unitary. 

(k = 3,m = 2) Now the first 3-partition (1, 2, 3) be fol- 
low by (1, 4, 5), (2, 4, 6) and (3, 5, 6). Any other choice of 
three index would form a partition that do not contain any 
element of at least one of the previous four, thus M = 4. 

In general, for a give k and a give m, we could start – 
without loss of generality – from the first order partition 
(1, . . . , k). Remembering that each of those index can ap- 
pear at most m times, we can construct m set contain 1, 
follow by m − 1 set contain 2, 3, 4 and so on until 
m − 1 set contain k, for a total of k(m − 1) + 1 terms. 
In the bad case scenario, all of these partition have at least 
one element in common. However, any subsequent partition 
cannot contain any of the index include in the first order 
partition (1, . . . , k), thus M ≤ k(m− 1) + 1. 

Taking this most general, bad case scenario, we have a 
bound on the quantum advantage give by 

ΓC0 < (k(m− 1) + 1)γk = γ 
( 
k2(m− 1) + k 

) 
, (C3) 

where γ := βL1Eqmin{E,∆E} . � 

Appendix D: On Conjecture 4. 

Let u consider a general time-dependent Hamiltonian that 
contains all the possible k-body interaction term between the 



8 

N battery that constitute the system, i.e., H = 
∑ 
µ hµ con- 

tains N !/k!(N − k)! term in the sum. With the aim of ob- 
taining an upper bound for the quantum advantage under the 
constraint C0, we follow the proof provide for Theorem 2, 
until Eq. (B4). We then find an explicit relation between the 
element of Xµ and those of Yµ. Let u consider the product 
basis Bµ := {|a〉µ} for the subset of battery define by µ. 
Each element |a〉µ = ⊗ki=1|ai〉µi be a product state of the par- 
tition of the Hilbert space associate with µ. In this basis we 
can write 

ιµ = 
∑ 
a 

ηa|a〉µ〈a|, (D1) 

Xµ = 
∑ 
a<b 

( 
xµab|a〉µ〈b|+ h.c. 

) 
+ 
∑ 
a 

xµaa|a〉µ〈a|. (D2) 

By explicit calculation use this basis we obtain 

Yµ = 
∑ 
a<b 

( 
ηb − ηa 

2 

)( 
xµa,b|a〉µ〈b| − h.c. 

) 
, (D3) 

where |ηa| < 1 and 0 < (ηb − ηa)/2 ≤ 1 for a < b, due to 
the structure of ιµ. Our conjecture reduces to the following: 

‖ 
∑ 
µαµYµ ⊗ 1µ̄‖op ≤ ‖ 

∑ 
µαµXµ ⊗ 1µ̄‖op, (D4) 

which be itself upper bound by NE . If Eq. (D4) holds, then 
for any choice of time-dependent k-body interaction Hamil- 
tonian H , subject to constraint C0, the average power P] be 
upper bound by 2λdkNE , thus, ΓC0 < βL1k. 

An extensive numerical search fail to find any counterex- 
amples to our conjecture. We have calculate the quantity 
P = ‖ 

∑ 
µ αµYµ⊗1µ̄‖op/‖ 

∑ 
µ αµXµ⊗1µ̄‖op for a large set 

of charge Hamiltonians, and found it to always be small 
than the unit, a conjectured. In order to generate these Hamil- 
tonians, we sample unitaries uµ accord to the Haar mea- 
sure, and obtain hµ = i log[uµ], where log[A] be the natural 
matrix logarithm of A; P be calculate explicitly for every 
sample Hamiltonian. With a sample size ν = 105 we ran the 
simulation for (N, k) equal to (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3) and (6, 2). 
Not a single instance of P > 1 be recorded. This numerical 
evidence do not represent a proof of our conjecture since 
there could be a measure zero set of Hamiltonians for which 
P > 1.
