Boffins beware: random sample be therefore 

useless for research 

Given that code share be a big part of the GitHub mission, it should 

come at no surprise that the platform store a lot of duplicate code: 70 

per cent, a study have found. 

An international team of eight researcher didn't set out to measure 

GitHub duplication. Their original aim be to try and define the 

“granularity” of copying – that is, how much file change between 

different clone – but along the way, they turn up a “staggering rate 

of file-level duplication” that make them change direction. 

Presented at this year's OOPSLA (part of the late-October Association of 

Computing Machinery) SPLASH conference in Vancouver, the 

University of California at Irvine-led research found that out of 428 

million file on GitHub, only 85 million be unique. 

Before reader say “so what?”, the reason for this study be to improve 

other researchers' work. Anybody study software use GitHub 

probably seek random samples, and the author of this study argue 

duplication need to be take into account. 

As open source watcher Adrian Colyer blogged, “simple random 

selection be likely to lead to sample include high duplication, which 

may bias the result of research”, so the paper's result public index of 

code duplication, which they've dubbed “DéjàVu”, help “understand 

the similarity relation in sample of projects, or to curate sample to 

reduce duplicates”. 

For example, the study said, if a researcher be study how many C and 

C++ program use assertions, duplication clearly skews their output; 

similarly, a software quality study need to take duplication into

account. 

X = files, Y = commits, Color = dupes. Source: DéjàVu: A Map of Code 

Duplicates on GitHub, Lopes et al at ACM 

DéjàVu map file clone in Java, C++, JavaScript and Python. 

The researcher assess code duplication use a variety of hash 

techniques. Identical code be easy, since they produce identical 

hashes, but it be also necessary to take into account software with 

small change (spaces or tabs), or even large changes. 

To draw these other duplicate into their sample, the researcher 

apply a “token hash” that capture minor change in spaces, 

comments, and ordering; and a package call 

SourcererCC 

to capture clone with edits too large for the token hash. 

JavaScript be the most clone environment of all: a mere six per cent 

of file spawn the other 94 per cent of JavaScript file on GitHub. Of

the C++ ecosystem, 73 per cent of file be duplicates; 71 per cent of 

Python program be dupes. 

Java developer be the most individualistic of the four environment 

researched, “but even for Java, 40% of the file be duplicates”. 

The other thing that probably won't surprise reader be that duplication 

be primarily dependency-driven. JavaScript provide a good example: 

people create a project would commit NPM library into their new 

repository a if they be part of the application code. 

As Colyer wryly noted: “If ever you have felt like you be download 

the universe when run npm install, here’s the data to prove it: 

include nest dependency (nesting up to 47 level deep be 

discovered, with median five) the number of unique include project 

have median 63, and maximum 1261.” 

Similarly, nearly all JavaScript programmer suck JQuery into their 

projects. 

There's also programmers' habit a Git users: “there be a lot more 

duplication of code that happens in GitHub that do not go through 

the fork mechanism, and instead, go in via copy and paste of file and 

even entire libraries”, the study noted. ®
