A central characteristic of living being be the ability to learn from and respond to their 

environment lead to habit formation and decision making. This behavior, know a 

habituation, be universal among all form of life with a central nervous system, and be also 

observe in single-cell organism that do not posse a brain. Here, we report the discovery 

of habituation-based plasticity utilize a perovskite quantum system by dynamical 

modulation of electron localization. Microscopic mechanism and pathway that enable this 

organismic collective charge-lattice interaction be elucidate by first-principles theory, 

synchrotron investigations, ab initio molecular dynamic simulations, and in situ environ- 

mental breathing studies. We implement a learn algorithm inspire by the conductance 

relaxation behavior of perovskites that naturally incorporates habituation, and demonstrate 

learn to forget: a key feature of animal and human brains. Incorporating this elementary 

skill in learn boost the capability of neural compute in a sequential, dynamic 

environment.

Habituation, one of the primary universal learningmechanisms, can be simply define a the decrement inresponse to repeat stimuli. Habituation be see a the 
simplest learn form exhibit by organisms, like sea slugs1 and 
fruit flies2, to more complex living forms, such a rat and 
humans3, 4, and be fundamental to how an organism responds and 
adapts to it environment thereby increase it chance of 
survival. Habituation can help animals, for instance, to focus on 
important stimulus for novelty detection and thus can be view a 
an integral part of attention and learning5, 6, and have recently 
be demonstrate in the single-celled non-neural organism 
Physarum polycephalum, commonly know a the slime mold7. 
In non-neural organisms, habituation be manifest by a change 
in global shape of the system (Fig. 1a). In more complex organ- 
ism that posse a nervous system, habituation have be show 
to result from the decrease release of chemical transmitter at 
synaptic terminals1, 8. This change the weight of certain neural 
connections, a mechanism know a synaptic plasticity. 

The perovskite oxide compound SmNiO3 (SNO) be a frame- 
work of tilt NiO6 octahedron where Sm3+ ion occupy 12-fold 
oxygen coordinate site and balance the charge9. Hydrogen 
dope from the environment into lattice use catalytic 
electrode occurs in a reversible manner lead to massive 
nonlinear change in electronic properties10, 11. Accompanied by 
incorporation of a proton, an electron can be inject into an 
unoccupied Ni eg orbital. Strong Coulomb interaction exist in 

eg orbitals generates a large transport gap via strong correlation 
effects12, 13. As show in Fig. 1b, after first exposure to H2 
(environmental stimulus 1), a significant fraction of Ni be reduce 
to Ni2+, manifest by electron localization. On change 
the environment (in this case by air exposure) for a short period 
of time follow by re-exposure to H2, additional proton 
be incorporate into SNO, but with slow kinetics, and 
keep diminishing. While the perovskite mimic habituation, the 
vary conductance due to the correlate interaction show 
inherent plasticity that can emulate biological synapsis of neural 
organism that be capable of more complex functionalities. Based 
on this discovery, we design a learn mechanism we term 
adaptive synaptic plasticity (ASP) that augments traditional 
neural system with the key ability of learn to forget for robust 
and continuous learn in a dynamically evolve environment 
(Supplementary Fig. 1). 

Figure 1c show the underlie plasticity mechanism for 
memory formation and learn in the brain14, commonly 
model with Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs)15. SNNs be 
equip with self-learning mechanism such a spike-timing 
dependent plasticity (STDP) for real-time interaction with the 
environment16–18. However, in it naive form STDP implies that 
any pre/post spike pair can modify the synapse, potentially 
erase past memory abruptly, commonly refer to a cata- 
strophic forgetting19. This phenomenon often result in severe 
loss of previous knowledge in a neuromorphic system that be

Illustration of learn to forget with habituation base 
plasticity 

Fig. 1 Quantum material show habituation behavior observe in neural and non-neural organisms. a Nonassociative habituation learn observe in 
Physarum polycephalum. When expose to stimulus, a diminish response be observe indicative of habituation. b Schematic show the habituation 
process in a perovskite SmNiO3 (SNO). Between repeat stimulus (H2), the dynamic of carrier localization subsides, show both non-neural habituation 
and neural synaptic plasticity. c Associative spike-timing base learn observe in a biological neural system (brain) responsible for memory formation. 
In the brain, synaptic plasticity be modulate by chemical transmitters, and be a function of the relative timing difference between the post and pre-neuronal 
spikes. The biological neural system be implement a a Spiking Neural Network (SNN) that consists of a fully connect array of pre-neurons and 
post-neurons. The pre-neuronal voltage spike (Vpre) be modulate by the synaptic weight (w) to generate the result post-synaptic current (Ipost). The 
post-neuron integrates the current that result in an increase in it membrane potential (Vmem) and spike when the potential exceeds a certain threshold 
(θ). d In environment 1, the SNN be present with different image of digit 2 and learnt several pattern correspond to the give image. In 
environment 2, the SNN be present with image of digit 0 and 1. Incorporating habituation-based nonassociative learn with standard associative 
spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) enables the SNN to learn new pattern without catastrophic forget in a resource-constrained dynamic input 
environment. The color intensity of the pattern be representative of the value of synaptic weight with low intensity (white) correspond to a weight 
value of −0.5 and high intensity (black) correspond to 0.5

continuously expose to new information (see Discussion section 
and Supplementary Note 1). Recent work suggests that the brain 
actively era memory while learn to continuously process 
new environmental stimuli20. Due to limited storage space 
available, the brain forgets already learnt connection gradually to 
associate them with new data. 

Here, we present the discovery of environmental habituation- 
base plasticity in SNO, which be rigorously explain by a 
comprehensive discussion of X-ray scattering, first-principles 
calculations, and ab initio dynamical simulations. Our ASP, 
inspire by the perovskite organismoid’s variable conductance, 
offer a solution to the problem of catastrophic forgetting. 
Incorporating habituation, a nonassociative process of adaptation 
see in living organisms, into ASP learn facilitates the gradual 
degradation or forget of already learnt weight to realize new 
and recent information while preserve some memory about 
old significant data. Figure 1d show learn to forget with 
ASP-based weight modulation by maintain a balance between 
forget and immediate learn to construct a stable plastic21 

self-adaptive SNN for dynamic environments. 

Results 
Demonstration of habituation in nickelate thin film devices. 
The initial state of the system be perturbed by exposure to a new 

environment (namely H2). Electron dope via splitting of H2 
into proton and electron result in the reduction of several Ni 
site to Ni2+, which be verify by X-ray spectroscopy, cause a 
large decrease in conductance, which can be reverse due to the 
weak binding of the dopant with the lattice. The temporal 
conductivity relaxation stem from the dynamic of surface 
exchange and diffusion of protons, and can be model a an 
exponential relaxation that be common to thin film devices22. 
Partial reversal of dope by withholding the H2 exposure for a 
short period of time follow by re-exposure to H2 and so forth 
lead to habituation manifest by a gradual reduction in 
response (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3). Figure 2b show 
the exponential change in conductance of the perovskite in 
different environment that motivates ASP learning. While the 
electron localization be the origin of the conductance change, 
the lattice breathes hydrogen a see in the in situ synchrotron 
study on identical device (Fig. 2c). 

Theoretical calculation of electronic structure change. To 
provide a microscopic understand of doping-driven electronic 
structure modification, we have carry out first-principles 
calculation on SNO (see Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6, and 
Supplementary Table 1 in Supplementary Note 2 for result on 
various magnetic orderings), a show in Fig. 2d, primarily

focus on the addition of charge and the subsequent opening of 
the gap. We consider the dope of a pristine SNO state with 
all Ni3+, base on observation of Pbnm symmetry (where all 
Ni site be equivalent) at room temperature23. With addition of 
electron one-by-one to the

× 2 supercell of SNO, we 
investigate the change in the structure and electronic energy 
levels. Each add electron localizes on a Ni3+ ion and the 
surround oxygen octahedron, shift the low unoccupied 
orbital over 3 eV by onsite correlation to form high-spin Ni2+ 

(see Supplementary Table 2), which be consistent with variable- 
angle ellipsometry measurements10. This charge transfer into the 
Ni eg orbitals be expect from the observe change in electron 
fill manifest a a shift in spectral weight in the X-ray 
absorption data (Supplementary Fig. 7b); however, a detailed 
comparison require include strong core-hole effects, which be 
beyond the scope of density functional theory (DFT). Thus, the 
fully doped case (1e−/Ni) show a significantly increase band gap 
on the order of 3 eV. The resonant magnetic coherent soft X-ray 
scatter measurement (RMXS, Supplementary Figs. 7c and 8) 
further reflect the breakdown of long-range spin order in SNO 
after electron doping. 

Molecular dynamic simulation of proton migration. We use 
ab initio molecular dynamic (AIMD) to study the mechanism of 
proton migration. We found that even at room temperature, the 
dopant hop from an oxygen atom to a neighbor one within 
NiO6 octahedron (Fig. 2e). The proton be initially bound to atom 
O1 (Fig. 2e, i) at a distance of approximately 2.83 Å away from 
the O2 atom. The proton first rotates about the O1 atom (Fig. 2e, 
i–iii), while be bound to O1 until the O2-H distance be lower 

to approximately 1.72 Å (Fig. 2e, iii). This rotation process be 
associate with an energy barrier of 0.27 eV, which be low than 
the typical activation barrier for H+ migration encounter in 
proton conduct perovskites (e.g., in the canonical Y-doped 
BaZrO3, ΔE ~0.46 eV24). Once the proton come into the vicinity 
of O2 atom (Fig. 2e, iii), it hop over, and bind to O2 atom with 
a negligible energy penalty of 0.046 eV (Fig. 2e, iii–v). The proton 
migration between neighbor O atom be visualize in a video 
in Supplementary Movie 1. 

Learning to forget with ASP. The conductance relaxation 
observe from Fig. 2b due to collective effect allows u to use the 
organismoid’s behavior to modulate synaptic plasticity for 
memorization and forgetting. ASP blend nonassociative 
habituation behavior with time-based correlation learn that 
help in retention and gradual adaptation to new inputs, a well 
as, evokes competition across neuron to learn distinct patterns. 
We seamlessly integrate weight decay with traditional synaptic 
plasticity and modulate the leak rate use the temporal dynamic 
of pre- and post-synaptic neuron to realize habituation. 
While the temporal correlation help in learn new input 
patterns, the retention of old data and gradual forget be 
attain with habituation. The ASP model for weight modulation 
with different window for potentiation and depression base 
on the fire event of the post-/pre-neurons be show in 
Supplementary Figs. 9 and 10 (see Supplementary Note 3 for 
detail on implementation). 

To demonstrate the effectiveness of the organismoid-inspired 
learn paradigm, against standard STDP, a fixed-size SNN 
(with nine excitatory neurons) be train in a dynamic digit-

Fig. 3 Learning by forgetting. a, b Digit representation learnt with digit 0 through 2 show sequentially to an Spiking Neural Network (SNN) (with nine 
excitatory neurons) train with standard spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) (a) and adaptive synaptic plasticity (ASP) that integrates habituation 
(b). Presenting the digit one-by-one sequentially i.e., first all the image for digit 0 follow digit 1, and so on can be treat a a dynamic learn 
environment. No particular digit instance or class be re-shown to the network. SNN train with STDP try to learn the new digit representation 
(for instance, digit 1) while retain a portion of the old data (for instance, digit 0). However, fix network size and absence of data reinforcement (i.e., no 
old data or digit show with the new data) result in accumulation cause new weight update to coalesce with already learnt pattern render the 
network incapable of categorize the digits. In sharp contrast, ASP-learnt SNN, with identical resource constraint in place, gracefully forgets old pattern 
and adapts to learn new input effectively without catastrophically erase old data. Supplementary Fig. 10 show the representation learnt for a large 
network when all digit 0 through 9 be presented. The color intensity of the pattern be representative of the value of synaptic weight with low 
intensity (white) correspond to a weight value of −0.5 and high intensity (black) correspond to 0.5

recognition environment, wherein digit 0 through 2 be 
present sequentially with no digit re-shown to the network. 
Figure 3a, b show the representation learnt with traditional 
exponential STDP learning25 against the adaptive plasticity-based 
learning. We see that a the network be show digit 1, ASP-learnt 
SNN forgets the already learnt connection for 0 and learns the 
new input. Learning be more stable a neuronal connection 
correspond to the old pattern 0 be retain while learn 1. 
ASP adopts a significant- and late data driven forget 
mechanism (incorporated via the leak/decay phase show in 
Supplementary Fig. 10), wherein old digit be forgotten to 
learn new digits. Hence, when the last digit 2 be present to the 
ASP-learnt SNN, the connection to the excitatory neuron that 
have learnt digit 0 be forgotten in order to learn the late digit 2 
while the connection (or neurons) correspond to recently 
learnt digit 1 remain intact. 

Discussion 
Habituation be refer to a diminish of response to a fre- 
quently repeat stimulus in the organismic biology literature26. 
We explain the principle further in this section to enable a 
general platform for material design, and illustrate the experi- 
mental envelope and dynamics. To achieve plasticity in the per- 
ovskite, we vary the environment dynamically without allow 
the system to achieve equilibrium. For instance, if we simply 
expose the perovskite at 50°C to hydrogen indefinitely, the 
resistance will increase to a self-limiting value and saturate over 
a period of several hours. Instead, we perturb the system well 
before saturation and then re-expose to the environment before 
complete reversal to the original state. In this manner, the 
environment be dynamically modulate over appropriate time 
scale quite similar to study conduct on organisms. The 
perovskite retains memory of the previous exposure since not all 
of the dopant have left the lattice and be therefore continuously 
modified, lead to diminish response. The perovskite 
nickelates show large nonlinear change in conductance upon 
electron dope due to strong correlation in the partially fill eg 
Ni orbitals, enable the mimicry of environmental plasticity. 
Other material that show nonlinear change of functional 
property in response to external stimulus may be consider to 
further investigate similar organismic behavior. Similarly, for 
reversibility, weak binding of the dopant to the lattice and escape 
back into the environment be important. The time scale in our 
experiment be chosen, in part, to be in the range of experimental 
study in biology, and be also close to what be note for decision 
make in ant colonies, bees, and related specie where envir- 
onmental chemical trace (i.e., diffusion of gas or scent over 
sensory distances27, 28) be use for forage food or collective 
locomotion to illustrate proof-of-principle. As a comparison, the 
response of neural connection in the brain be of the order 
of millisecond and electronic memory be of the order of 
sub-microseconds. To mimic such faster time scales, instead of 
vary the gas-phase specie in an environmental chamber 
(like we have do at a synchrotron beamline), one can use thin 
film solid or liquid electrolyte interfaced with the perovskite or 
other material system and rapidly move protons, oxygen, 
lithium, or other ion into and out of the habituate material. 
Since ion be charge and electron can be reversibly anchor 
to the partially fill d-orbitals, electric field can be use to 
operate these device that can be integrate onto circuits29–31. 
The vary conductance of the perovskite organismoid indicates 
an inherent plasticity that can be use for create artificial neural 
systems. This motivate u to design ASP that incorporates 
habituation with traditional spike-timing correlation-based 
learning. It be implement by modulate the exponential leak 

rate of the weight base on the significance of the incoming 
inputs, and be critical for learn to forget in a dynamic 
environment. As explain in Supplementary Note 4, this model 
be also compatible with other class of oxide-ionic device that 
incorporate filamentary switch or spin-based devices. 

The ability to learn task in a sequential fashion be crucial to the 
development of neural systems. In sequential learning, during the 
training process no information be re-presented to the network. 
Such continual/sequential learn pose particular challenge for 
neural network due to the tendency for knowledge of previously 
learnt task(s) (e.g., task A) to be abruptly lose a information 
relevant to the current task (e.g., task B) be incorporated. 
This phenomenon, term catastrophic forgetting19, 32, 33, occurs 
specifically when the network be train sequentially on multiple 
task because the weight in the network that be important for 
task A be change to meet the objective of task B. 

Typically, SNNs use STDP to modify the synaptic weight for 
unsupervised learn of inputs. However, memory persistence be 
a prominent problem that have be well-documented with STDP 
a it implies that any pre/post spike pair can modify the synapse, 
potentially erase past memory abruptly lead to catastrophic 
forgetting19, 32, 33. Here, we note specifically that catastrophic 
forget will occur only when consider sequential learn of 
tasks. 

In our experiment with MNIST digit recognition, we show 
each class/digit sequentially thereby create a dynamic learn 
environment (refer to Methods for details). Presenting the digit 
one-by-one sequentially, i.e., first all the image for digit 0 fol- 
low by digit 1, and so on, can be treat a a dynamic learn 
environment. No particular digit instance or class be re-shown to 
the network. Thus, even with proper STDP tune and slow 
learn rate, we cannot still unlearn the already learnt digits, 
when new pattern be show to the network. This result in 
overlap of representation a see in Fig. 3 and Supplementary 
Fig. 10. The decay mechanism incorporate with ASP (utilizing 
habituation) in turn help in unlearn or forget the pre- 
viously learnt data to learn new pattern without any overlap. 

Furthermore, in order to prevent catastrophic forget in 
STDP-learnt SNNs, the network be generally re-trained with both 
the new and the old information (already learnt) when the 
network have to learn a new class. Old information re-presented 
with new data during training ensures that the latter or new 
input data do not replace previous patterns. However, in online 
real-time learning, it be often impractical and even expensive to 
store all old data sample for re-training, each time a new input 
pattern be encountered. ASP owe to it forget while learn 
capability offer a promising solution for real-time dynamic 
learn without the expensive re-training procedure. 

Methods 
Growth of epitaxial perovskite oxide thin films. LaAlO3 (001) single crystal 
be use a substrate for epitaxial growth of SNO thin film by magnetron 
co-sputtering of metallic nickel in direct-current mode (at power of 75W) and 
samarium target under radio-frequency mode (at power of 150W) in 5 mTorr of 
argon and oxygen mixture flow at rate of 40/10 standard cubic centimeter per 
minute (sccm). The as-sputtered sample be then transfer into a custom-built 
high-pressure vessel and anneal under 100 bar of pure oxygen at 500 °C for 24 h 
in a tube furnace. 

Electrical characterization. In situ temporal resistance measurement be do 
in a seal custom-designed chamber equip with a gas flow control system, 
from which we could switch the chamber inner atmosphere between various 
environments. In this experiment, we use 5% H2 balance by 95% argon a the 
stimulus environment, and use air to remove the hydrogen stimulus. The 
habituation only require one stimulus (hydrogen), similar to what be see in real 
organisms. Four 100 nm Pt strip (0.5 mm × 5mm) be deposit on the top of 
epitaxial SNO thin film by electron beam evaporation. The strip function a 
catalyst to split H2 into proton and electron for the electron dope of SNO, and 
electrical contact for the resistance measurement a well. The distance between

each Pt strip be 1 mm. The experiment be conduct at 50 °C to maintain 
a steady temperature throughout the studies. Resistance be calculate from 
current-voltage curve swept between −0.1 to 0.1 V use Keithley 2635A 
instrument. The initial chamber atmosphere be air, and Pt/SNO sample be 
place onto the sample stage for 30 min to reach stable temperature. Real-time 
resistance testing, be conduct use a custom LabVIEW code. To avoid tem- 
perature fluctuation during gas switching, the 5% H2/95% Ar be make to flow to 
the chamber at a moderate flow rate of 30 sccm. After a 30 min reaction, the gas 
be switch back to air by make dry air flow at the same flow rate (30 sccm). 
After 10 min, gas be change to 5% H2/95% Ar again, and this H2-Air cycle 
be repeated. The relaxation of conductivity after exposure to environment be 
fit with the formalism to study conductivity relaxation in thin film devices34, 35, 
(σ0 − σt)/σ0=C −A1exp(−k1t) − A2exp(−k2t), where σ0, and σt represent initial and 
dynamical conductivity, respectively, k1 and k2 depict the relaxation kinetics. 

In situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction measure- 
ments of the SNO device be conduct at an insertion device beamline, 12ID-D 
at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory, on a six-circle 
Huber goniometer with an X-ray energy of 20 keV use a pixel array area detector 
(Dectris Pilatus 100 K). The X-ray beam have a flux of 1012 photon per second. 
The qz-scan (L-scan) be obtain by remove the background scatter 
contribution use the two-dimensional images. For in situ X-ray diffraction 
testing, Pt/SNO sample be place in a test compartment seal by Kapton 
tape. The test condition follow the atmosphere progression mode 
show in Fig. 2a. 

Resonant magnetic coherent soft X-ray scattering. RMXS study be perform 
at the beamline 23-ID-1 of the National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II), at 
Brookhaven National Laboratory. All data be collect use horizontally 
polarize light and a vertical scatter geometry, with photon energy tune near 
the Ni-L3 absorption edge. The probe geometry be illustrate in Supplementary 
Fig. 7a. The pristine SNO thin film be pattern with Pt stripe and hydrogen be 
intercalate to yield electron-doped region H-SmNiO3 (H-SNO) of width 0.1 mm. 
The magnetic scatter signal be measure by a two-dimensional charge-coupled 
device (CCD) position 33 cm from the sample, while the X-ray absorption be 
collect in total fluorescence yield, also use the CCD (away from structural or 
magnetic reflections). In order to reach the magnetic reflection, at Q= (1/4,1/4,1/ 
4), the sample be orient so that the scatter plane be span by crystal vector 
[111] and [1-10]. The film be illuminate by a coherent X-ray beam whose 
coherent fraction be select by a 10 μm diameter pinhole in close proximity to the 
sample. The measurement be perform at ~20 K which be well below the Neel 
temperature of SNO (~200 K). 

First-principles calculation for SNO electronic structure. First-principle 
calculation be carry out within the DFT+U approximation with the Vienna 
ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) code36, 37 use the projector augment 
plane-wave (PAW) method of DFT38 and the supply pseudopotentials: Sm_3 
(valence: 5s25p26s24f1), Ni_pv (valence: 3p64s23d8) and O (valence 2s22p4). To treat 
the exchange and correlation, the PBE functional be use within the generalize 
gradient approximation (GGA)39, 40 and the rotationally invariant form of DFT+U 
of Liechtenstein et al.41 with U= 4.6 eV and J= 0.6 eV. For structural determina- 
tion of pristine SNO, we start with the Materials Project structure42 add a 
small monoclinic distortion (β≈ 90.75°) and allow the cell and ionic position to 
relax until the force be less than 0.005 eV/Å on each ion. All calculation be 
carry out with the tetrahedral method with Blöchl corrections43, a 6 × 6 × 4 
Monkhorst-Pack k-point mesh for the

a G-type magnetic ordering, result in an electron-doping concentration of 1/4, 
1/2, 3/4, 1 e−/Ni, respectively. In each case, we allow the internal ionic position 
to relax, use the same force tolerance a before, while keep the volume 
and cell shape unchanged. When study effect of magnetic order on the 
fully doped case (Supplementary Fig. 5), both the ionic position and the lattice 
parameter be relaxed. 

Ab initio molecular dynamic simulations. We perform AIMD simulation 
within GGA with Hubbard correction use the PAW formalism a implement 
in VASP36, 37. The computational supercell consists of four unit cell of 
monoclinic SNO (2 × 2 × 1 repetition of unit cell; 80 atoms). Periodic boundary 
condition be employ along all directions. The exchange correlation be described 
by the PBE functional39, 40, with the same pseudopotentials a use in the 
electronic structure calculations. The plane-wave energy cutoff be set at 520 eV. The 
Brillouin zone be sample at the Γ-point only. Using AIMD simulation in the 
isobaric-isothermal (NPT) ensemble, we first thermalize the SNO computational 
supercell at various temperature range from 300–800 K and zero external 
pressure for 10 p use a timestep of 0.5 fs. During these simulations, the cell 
volume, cell shape, a well a the atomic position be allow to vary via the 
Parrinello-Rahman scheme41; the temperature condition be maintain by use 

a Langevin thermostat44. Next, we insert a proton within the thermalized SNO 
(at a give temperature), such that it be at a distance of 0.98 Å away from an 
arbitrarily chosen O atom. Note that we ensure supercell neutrality upon addition 
of the proton via a background negative charge. To monitor the diffusion of the 
insert proton (Supplementary Movie 1, Supplementary Note 5), we perform 
AIMD simulation at constant volume (and shape) and temperature (i.e., NVT 
ensemble) for an additional 10 ps. For these AIMD simulation of doped SNO, 
constant temperature condition be maintain via Nose Hoover thermostat44 

a implement in VASP. 

Simulation methodology for SNNs. The ASP learn algorithm be 
implement in BRIAN45 that be an open source large-scale SNN simulator with 
parameterized functional model (Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire) for spike neurons. 
We use the hierarchical SNN framework (Supplementary Fig. 9) to perform digit 
recognition with the MNIST dataset46. The network topology and the associate 
synaptic connectivity configuration be programmed in the simulator. The 
spike activity (or time instant of spikes) of pre- and post-neurons be 
monitor to track the correspond pre-/post-synaptic trace that be use to 
estimate the weight update in the recovery/decay learn phase of ASP.
