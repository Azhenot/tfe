Abstract 

Background: Each year, approximately 800,000 people die by suicide worldwide, accounting for 1–2 in every 100 deaths. It 
be always a tragic event with a huge impact on family, friends, the community and health professionals. Unfortunately, suicide 
prevention and the development of risk assessment tool have be hinder by the complexity of the underlie mechanism 
and the dynamic nature of a person’s motivation and intent. Many of those who die by suicide have contact with health service 
in the precede year but identify those most at risk remains a challenge. 
Objective: To explore the feasibility of use artificial neural network with routinely collect electronic health record to 
support the identification of those at high risk of suicide when in contact with health services. 
Methods: Using the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage Databank UK, we extract the data of those who die by suicide 
between 2001 and 2015 and pair controls. Looking at primary (general practice) and secondary (hospital admissions) electronic 
health records, we built a binary feature vector cod the presence of risk factor at different time prior to death. Risk factor 
included: general practice contact and hospital admission; diagnosis of mental health issues; injury and poisoning; substance 
misuse; maltreatment; sleep disorders; and the prescription of opiate and psychotropics. Basic artificial neural network be 
train to differentiate between the suicide case and pair controls. We interpret the output score a the estimate suicide 
risk. System performance be assess with 10x10-fold repeat cross-validation, and it behavior be study by represent 
the distribution of estimate risk across the case and controls, and the distribution of factor across estimate risks. 
Results: We extract a total of 2604 suicide case and 20 pair control per case. Our best system attain a mean error rate 
of 26.78% (SD 1.46; 64.57% of sensitivity and 81.86% of specificity). While the distribution of control be concentrate around 
estimate risk < 0.5, case be almost uniformly distribute between 0 and 1. Prescription of psychotropics, depression and 
anxiety, and self-harm increase the estimate risk by ~0.4. At least 95% of those present these factor be identify a 
suicide cases. 
Conclusions: Despite the simplicity of the implement system, the propose methodology obtain an accuracy like other 
publish method base on specialized questionnaire generate data. Most of the error come from the heterogeneity of pattern 
show by suicide cases, some of which be identical to those of the pair controls. Prescription of psychotropics, depression

Introduction 

Background 
The World Health Organization recognizes suicide a a public 
health priority. The World Health Organization Member States 
be commit to work towards the global reduction of 
suicide rate worldwide by 10% by 2020 [1]. In Wales alone, 
approximately 300 people die each year by suicide, accounting 
for about 1% of all deaths, and three time the rate of fatality 
follow traffic accident [2]. The suicide rate have barely alter 
over the last decade, and any change that have occur have 
generally be an increase [3]. Each death by suicide in the UK 
be estimate to cost more than £1,370,000 (direct and indirect 
costs) [4]. Considering these observations, adopt a public 
health approach to suicide prevention “has to be a national 
priority” [5]. 

Unfortunately, the prediction of suicide risk have proven to be a 
challenge problem for epidemiological study and how they 
apply to health care practice. The pathway to suicide be 
mediate by highly complex processes, integrate many 
interdependent risk factor variable [6-9]. This creates 
difficulty around the positive identification of the relatively 
small number of individual who will take their own life from 
the much large group of people in whom some or all the various 
risk factor have be identified. Assessment of immediate 
suicide risk require a clinical evaluation. However, the majority 
of those who take their own life present to health service other 
than mental health specialist in their final year. The 
identification of those at risk—so appropriate question can be 
ask in relation to suicidality—would support ongoing suicide 
prevention effort across a range of health services. 

Short-term suicide risk prediction (ie, days, weeks, or months) 
be particularly useful for target interventions; but less be know 
about the process underlie short-term suicidality than 
longer-term presentation [10]. Distal, or identify long-term 
risk factors, have complex effect on short-term risk and 
therefore separate, specific research be needed. 

At the same time, we have databanks curating a wealth of 
electronic health record (EHRs), and administrative information 
which, when linked, could provide a representative picture of 
the biological, societal and health status of an individual at any 
point in time. Use of this data at scale be expect to make a 
pivotal contribution to the study of many disease [11], 
especially those with complex longitudinal history like suicide. 
However, the sheer volume of data and the complexity of the 
suicide factors-risk model have proven to be a challenge for 
traditional epidemiological and statistical model methods. 
As a result, exist screen tool be reportedly inefficient 
[12]. Thus, advanced artificial intelligence (AI) technique be 

currently good position to tackle the combine challenge 
of big data and suicide risk prediction. 

Prior Work 
Although the application of AI technique in different area of 
medicine be extensive [13,14], the difficulty of processing 
routinely collect EHRs and big data in general have be 
report elsewhere [15-18]. These include the volume, 
complexity, heterogeneity and change nature of medical data 
a well a it poor mathematical characterization; the importance 
of physician’s interpretations; and the legal, ethical and social 
implications. It be only recently that we have have the resource 
to record, maintain and analyze routinely collect EHRs with 
million of records. 

In the last decade, the use of machine learn (a branch of AI) 
to analyze EHRs have grown dramatically, spur in part by 
advance in artificial neural network (ANNs) and deep learn 
[19]. Miotto and colleague [20] create a deep ANN that 
receive hospital diagnosis code and create a “patient 
representation” vector of 500 features. This vector be fed to 
a random forest to predict 78 different diseases, include mental 
disorder such a schizophrenia. This model generate an 
accuracy of more than 90% for (more than) 76,000 patients, but 
suicide risk be not part of the study. 

Indeed, the application of AI in psychiatry be a field that have 
receive relatively little attention but have great potential for 
innovation [11]. Some proposal found in the literature be 
optimization of the delivery of momentary cognitive-behavioral 
intervention [21], early identification of post-traumatic stress 
disorder [22], and analysis of social-network information for 
mental health research [23]. AI study specifically focus on 
suicide risk estimation be more recent and scarce. 

Passos and colleague [24] administer questionnaire to 144 
participant with major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder 
to extract risk-factor information. Suicidality be estimate 
base on a previous history of suicide attempts. This data be 
then fed into various machine learn algorithm with the aim 
of identify those at high risk of attempt suicide. A best 
performance of 72% accuracy be obtain with a relevance 
vector machine. 

Kessler and colleague [25] use a population cohort of 
non-deployed US Regular Army soldier who have a diagnose 
mental disorder and at least one outpatient visit. Their cohort 
include 147 death through suicide. Between 10 and 14 factor 
be extract after outpatient visit follow by suicide (cases) 
and visit not follow by suicide (controls) and use to build 
a logistic regression with elastic net regularization to predict 
suicidality in the five week after these visits. Their system 
obtain a sensitivity of 48% and a specificity of 84% when

predict suicidality. The author conclude that their system 
“outperformed mental health professional to a large margin.” 

Goal of This Study 
We aim to explore the use of ANNs with routinely collect 
EHRs to estimate suicide risk within the general population. 
This approach build on Passos et al and Kessler et al research, 
take it a step further by rely on routinely collect EHRs 
across health setting rather than mental health questionnaires. 
Hence, our system would not depend on information that be 
collect only in specific circumstance (eg, outpatient visit 
or hospital admissions), and could therefore be use to screen 
the entire population without increase the workload of health 
care practitioners. 

Our system aim to improve not only the quality of suicide risk 
assessment, but also it coverage. This be a crucial factor when 
consider that only 35% of those who die in Wales by suicide 
between 2010 and 2015, be admit to hospital in the year 
prior to death, and around 40% have an emergency department 
admission. Furthermore, of those who die in Wales by suicide 
between 2001 and 2015, 65% do not have a mental health 
record in the year prior to death; and 40% never had. However, 
approximately 83% of these suicide case have at least one 
contact with their general practitioner (GP) during that period. 
Therefore, our system seek to utilize these contact to ass 
suicide risk and increase population coverage. 

Additionally, our system have the potential to perform risk 
assessment continuously over time and in the background (ie, 
without human intervention) across healthcare settings. Rather 
than use this a an assessment of immediate “at risk” or “not 
at risk,” it will be use to flag patients, even those attend for 
reason other than mental health, so that appropriate question 
can be asked. The UK National Institute for Health and Care 
Excellence recommends that risk assessment tool and scale 
should not be use to predict future suicide or repetition of 
self-harm [26]. This be because of the dynamic nature of suicide 
risk. An individual assess a “not at risk” on one occasion 
could subsequently become “at risk,” but professional may not 
be a responsive to these change because of label effects. 
The propose system aim to flag at risk individual upon any 
contact with health service so that relevant question be ask 
and appropriately addressed. 

The goal of this study be to test the feasibility of this concept, 
validate the methodology from functionality (performance) 
and medical (validity of factors-risk model) point of view. 
Using an oversimplify system (shallow ANN), conservative 
result regard model complexity and performance be 
ensured. We combine data from primary and secondary care, 
use repeat cross-validation during evaluation, and explore 
the distribution of factor across different level of estimate 
suicide risk to describe the system’s behavior. 

In the remainder of this article, we describe the data source 
used, how we define our cohort of suicide case and controls, 
and the risk factor use during experimentation. A brief 
introduction to ANNs be provided, follow by a detailed 
description of the model evaluate here. We detail the analysis 
that be run to ass raw performance and the result 

factors-risk model. Following the presentation of the results, 
we discus their interpretation a well a the potential of the 
propose model, how it compare with the current state of the 
art approaches, it limitation and implication for practice, and 
conclusions. 

Methods 

Materials 

Data Sources 
Data available within the Secure Anonymized Information 
Linkage (SAIL) Databank [27] be used. The HIRU Information 
Governance Review Panel (IGRP) grant ethical approval. 
IGRP be an independent body consist of a range of 
government, regulatory and professional agencies, that oversee 
study approval in line with permission already grant to the 
analysis of data in the SAIL databank [28,29]. The current 
research take place under the SID-Cymru project [30] (approval 
number 0204). 

For this study, we link and analyze the National Statistics 
Annual District Deaths Extract (ADDE), the Welsh 
Demographic Service (WDS), the Welsh Primary Care GP 
dataset (WGP), the Patient Episode Database for Wales (PEDW) 
and the Emergency Department Data Set (EDDS). While all 
datasets be use to define the study case-control cohort, only 
WDS, WGP and PEDW be use to build the feature vector 
for experimentation. 

Data availability varied across individual and databases. While 
ADDE and PEDW datasets have a nationwide coverage, WPG 
contains data from 348 out of 474 (73%) GP practice in Wales. 
This variation be reduce by restriction apply during the 
cohort definition (see below). At the same time, while the WGP 
and PEDW datasets be available over the full study period 
(2001 to 2015), ADDE be only available from 2009. However, 
ADDE data be use only to determine a key date before death, 
not to train or test the ANN system, and therefore we do not 
expect this have significantly bias our results. 

Cohort Definition 
We extract our cohort from SID-Cymru, a population base 
electronic case-control study on complete suicide in Wales 
between 2001 and 2015 define within SAIL [30]. 
Approximately 32,000 death of Welsh resident be register 
each year, of which approximately 350 be suicide or event 
of undetermined intent. It be conventional research practice to 
include the latter in the definition of suicide [31]. 

The case-control study cohort be built accord to the 
follow steps: 

1. We identify those that die through suicide at age 10 or 
old between 2001 and 2015. Deaths of undetermined 
intent in those under 10 year of age may be related to abuse 
or neglect and thus be excluded. 

2. We follow individuals’ health history retrospectively 
from death date to identify the full calendar of health 
service contact lead up to death (CLD). This could 
include multiple entry within the WGP, PEDW and EDDS

database (eg, attendance at A and E, admission to hospital, 
transfer to another hospital, and finally GP letter receive 
from hospital notify of deaths). A maximum CLD 
duration of one month be consider to avoid include 
unrelated hospital stays. The CLD be subsequently 
remove from the analysis to avoid use information 
directly link with the death of cases. 

3. Only those reside in Wales at the time of their death, with 
GP data available for at least 80% of the five year prior to 
CLD be include in the study. This ensure that similar 
data coverage be available for all case and controls. The 
value of five year be chosen to balance between the length 
of health history and number of case retained. 

4. For each case, 20 control be randomly selected, without 
replacement and exclude cases, after match by gender 
and week of birth (±1 year). During control selection, those 
with a similar period of Welsh residency and GP data 
coverage be prioritize to ensure similar coverage quality. 
Although this number be unnecessarily large for traditional 
pair case-control studies, the propose methodology 
benefit from increase data availability during training. 

A total of 2604 suicide case be identified—2012 (77.3%) 
of which be males, and 58,080 controls. These have a perfect 
(deterministic) or very high (probabilistic) linkage score 
(between 0.95 and 1) within SAIL. 

Feature Vector 
Only data from WDS, WGP and PEDW be use during 
experimentation. Not all event record in WGP and PEDW 
represent face-to-face contact with the patient, and a single event 
may have multiple associate entry (eg, multiple diagnoses). 

Each entry be categorize in WGP and PEDW into type of 
health event: depression and anxiety; other common mental 
disorders; other mental health; non-intentional injury and 
poisoning; self-harm; alcohol misuse; drug misuse; possible 
maltreatment; physical sleep disorders; non-physical sleep 
disorders; and “others.” We also identify the prescription of 
opiate and psychotropics from WGP (PEDW have no 
prescription information) and record whether there be any 
entry record in WGP or PEDW (representing a hospital 
admission). This make a total of 15 factor (11 diagnoses, two 
prescriptions, WGP entry and hospital admissions). 

The above category be define in term of ReadCodes for 
WGP and ICD10 for PEDW with the help of expert clinician 
and base on previous publication when available (depression 
and anxiety [32], other common mental disorder [33], 
non-intentional and intentional (self-harm) injury and poison 
[34,35], alcohol misuse [36], drug misuse [36,37], possible 
maltreatment [38] and psychotropics [39]). Full code definition 
can be see in Tables A1 and A2, Multimedia Appendix 1. 

We identify the presence of the above 15 health event during 
four non-overlapping time-frames: 

• 1M: Between CLD and 1 month before CLD [CLD – 1 
month, CLD]. 

• 6M: Between 1 and 6 month before CLD [CLD – 6 months, 
CLD – 1 month). 

• 1Y: Between 6 and 12 month before CLD [CLD – 1 year, 
CLD – 6 months). 

• 5Y: Between 1 and 5 year before CLD [CLD – 5 years, 
CLD – 1 year). 

The final feature vector also include age at CLD and sex, 
result in a length of 62: 1 float age + 1 binary sex + 15 binary 
health event * 4 time-frames. This feature vector do not 
include data directly related to the CLD. Interactions between 
these factor be automatically take into account by the ANN. 

System Design 

Artificial Neural Networks 
Artificial neural network (ANNs) be biologically inspire 
compute system capable of learn task through example 
and experience, without the need of explicit program of 
task-specific rule or any a priori knowledge of the solution 
[40]. 

ANNs be typically compose of an input layer, one or more 
hidden layer and an output layer (Figure 1). Each unit (artificial 
neuron) in the input or output layer corresponds to one 
dimension of the input or output vector respectively, with each 
dimension correspond to one input or output variable. The 
complexity of the input-output model be govern by the 
activation function of neurons, the number of hidden layers, the 
number of neuron in each layer and the connection between 
neuron and layers. 

The term “black-box” be sometimes use to describe ANNs. 
This have contribute to the widespread misconception of ANNs 
not be transparent, which in turn have gain them a bad 
reputation in field such a medicine, where understand how 
and why decision be take be important. However, “black-box” 
alludes to the fact that the input-output model generate by the 
network be too complex to be express by a set of simple rule 
that be syntactically meaningful. Such a model can nevertheless 
be express a a mathematical equation. For example, a simple 
ANN compose of no hidden layer and a single output neuron 
with a logistic activation function be equivalent to the logistic 
regression model; 

y = S( b + ∑ ∀ iw ji x i) 

where xi be each of the input neuron (ie, variables), wji be the 
weight from the i-th input to the j-th neuron, b be a bias term, 
S(∙) be the sigmoid function and y be the output neuron (ie, result). 
Typically, the input-output equation quickly grows in 
complexity, and therefore we opt not to represent it.

Figure 1. Structure of an artificial neural network with 1 input layer (red), 2 hidden layer (green) and one output layer (blue) all fully connected. 

Evaluated Architecture 
A simple ANN be implement with seven different 
configurations: no hidden layer (nn0), one hidden layer of size 
10, 50 or 100 (nn10, nn50, nn100) and two hidden layer with 
size 10, 50 or 100 (nn10-10, nn50-50, nn100-100). All layer 
be fully connect (ie, each neuron in layer i be connect 
to all neuron of the previous layer i-1). The input layer be 
compose of the feature vector described above (ie, 62 neurons). 
Hidden layers, when present, have a tanh activation function. 
The output layer have a single neuron with a sigmoid activation 
function, return the score r of a sample belonging to a 
(suicide) case (r=1) or a control (r=0). A decision threshold of 
0.5 be used, ie, sample with r>0.5 be classify a case 
while sample with r ≤0.5 be classify a controls. We 
interpret this score r a the estimate risk of suicide, 
differentiate between very low risk (VLR; r ≤0.17), low risk 
(LR; 0.17<r ≤0.33), moderate-low risk (MLR; 0.33<r ≤0.5), 
moderate-high risk (MHR; 0.5<r ≤0.67), high risk (HR; 0.67<r 
≤0.83) and very high risk (VHR; r>0.83). 

The mean square error be adjust to account for data 
imbalance (20 control per case) so that the result cost of 
both class (case and control) be equal to 1. The final cost 
include l2 weight regularization with scale 0.01. 

All ANNs be train with the gradient descent algorithm and 
exponential learn rate decay start at 1. Training be 
perform sequentially with three different batch sizes: 25, 100 
and all case and their respective control (ie, total batch size 
525, 2100 and full). The learn rate be reset with every 
change in batch size. Training within each batch size continued 
until a maximum number of epoch be reached, the change of 
cost function evaluate on the validation set be low than a 

threshold or the change be in the negative direction (ie, not 
improving). 

Using the oversimplify system (ie, small number of feature 
and shallow ANNs) described above, we favor obtain 
conservative result in term of model complexity and 
performance, which we hope would counteract some of the 
limitation of the study (described below). In addition, in a 
practical application the cost of misidentify suicide case 
and control will probably not be the same. Whether the system 
should be tune to have a high sensitivity at the cost of low 
specificity or vice versa depends on many factor and be beyond 
the scope of this study. For simplicity, we equalize this cost 
to be the same for case and controls. Hence, accounting for the 
unbalanced 1:20 distribution of case and controls, the cost of 
misclassifying a case be 1, while the cost of misclassifying a 
control be 1/20. All experiment and ANNs be design 
and execute use TensorFlow in Python. 

Statistical Analysis 

System Performance 
We follow a 10x10-fold cross-validation approach to evaluate 
the performance of the ANNs. On each iteration, one-fold be 
use for testing, one for validation (used to inform the early 
stop training algorithm) and eight for training. Cases be 
randomly distribute across folds, follow by their respective 
control so that case-control pair be always maintain 
during partition (this partition rule be also apply during 
batch partition in training). 

On each iteration, a well a measure the classification error 
obtain with the threshold result from training, the threshold 
be varied to compute the receive operating characteristic 
(ROC) curve and the area under the ROC curve (AUC). We

compare performance between system use a correct 
resampled t test [41] base on the average over sort run [42] 
for 10x10-fold, and P value be further adjust (Q values) 
for multiple test use the false discovery rate Benjamini 
and Hochberg method [43]. 

Finally, we repeat the above analysis shuffle the label of 
each samples, ie, we randomly assign the label “case” to one 
of the 20 pair control of a case and rebranded the original 
case a “control,” This aim at evaluate whether our initial 
result be due to real relationship between label and data, 
rather than to random idiosyncratic pattern in the data. 

System Behavior 
In addition to measure system performance, we attempt to 
ass the factors-risk model obtain by the best perform 
ANN. Due to the dimensionality of the feature vector (ie, 
number of input factors) and the freedom of the ANN to build 
complex model with numerous non-linear interactions, get 
the full representation of the factors-risk model be not practical. 
However, the follow result give u insight into how large 
a role each factor played in the computation of the risk score: 

• The histogram of the number of case and control across 
estimate risk scores. This will provide information 
additional to the performance measurement about the 
classification capability for case and controls. 

• The histogram of the estimate risk difference when turn 
specific factor “on” and “off’” across the whole dataset. 
This will show an estimate role of each individual factor 
in the computation of the risk score, and how it varies due 
to interaction with other factors. 

• The distribution of each factor (ie, individual present 
a factor) across estimate risk scores. This will work in 
conjunction with the previous point to draw an estimate of 
the role of each individual factor. 

• The incidence of each factor within estimate risk scores. 
This will allow u to compare incidence across risk level 
for case and controls. 

Results of this analysis refer to the factor-risk model built by 
our ANN and do not necessarily agree with the real factor-risk 
model. Our confidence of how similar these two be depends 
on the size and quality of the test data and on the performance 
of our system. This be true for any AI application, but it be 
especially important in medical application such a the one 
propose here. 

Results 

System Performance 
The error rate of the described ANNs decrease slightly from 
28.9% to 26.8% when increase the number of hidden layer 
from 0 to 2 (Table 1). Overall, nn0 perform bad than the 
rest. The performance difference between network with 1 and 
2 hidden layers, although small, be statistically significant (q< 
0.05) (Table A3 of Multimedia Appendix 1). 

Figure 2 show the ROC curve of the best perform network 
for each number of hidden layer (ie, nn0, nn50 and nn10-10). 
ROC curve of nn10, nn50 and nn100 be virtually identical, 
a be curve of nn10-10, nn50-50 and nn100-100. In the false 
positive rate (fpr=1-specificity) range between 0 and 15%, nn50 
and nn10-10 perform good than nn0. Past this point, the ROC 
curve get closer together and for fpr>30% they become virtually 
identical. Despite the similarity between ROCs of nn50 and 
nn10-10, the difference in AUCs between them be statistically 
significant (q< 0.05) (Table A4 of Multimedia Appendix 1). In 
general terms, nn10-10 and nn50 can obtain good sensitivity 
for more restrictive specificity value than nn0 but perform 
similarly well for high specificity. 

Crucially, result after shuffle the label be characteristic 
of a random process (ie, 50% error rate and 0.5 AUC). 

System Behavior 
The distribution of case and control across estimate risk 
score reflect the result of Table 1 (Figure 3). Controls be 
mostly concentrate on score below 0.5 (hence, high 
specificity). Cases on the other hand be almost uniformly 
distribute (hence, low sensitivity). Overall, few individual 
receive an estimate risk score ≤0.2. 

Prescription of psychotropics, depression and anxiety, and 
self-harm seem to have the strong effect on the estimate 
risk, increase r by ~0.4 when change from “off’” to “on” 
across all time-frames (Figure 4). Most of the risk increase from 
prescription of psychotropics and depression and anxiety come 
on the first six month before CLD (∆r≈ 0.3), while self-harm 
have a more linear effect across time-frames. The distribution of 
∆r for prescription of psychotropics be the most concentrate 
around the peak. These three factor be follow in strength 
by hospital admission and alcohol misuse, with ∆r≈ 0.25. WGP 
entries, on the other hand, reduce the estimate risk by around 
0.2. 

Most sample be assign a risk below the 0.5 threshold, with 
only 70 individual result in a a very low risk r≤0.17 (Table 
2). In contrast, a many a 1366 individual obtain a very 
high estimate risk (r>0.83). Age and gender distribution be 
virtually identical across risk levels, except for the very low 
risk range (r ≤0.17) which be mainly compose of woman 
(Table 2). 

Looking at how factor (individuals with factor “on”) be 
distribute across risk score (Figure 5, and Tables A5 to A8 
of Multimedia Appendix 1), in the month before CLD, 97% of 
those with a prescription of psychotropics, 96% of those with 
depression and anxiety and 95% of those with self-harm be 
classify a be at risk of suicide (r>0.5) (Figure 5). More 
than 78% of those present with one of these factor or drug 
or alcohol misuse across most of the consider time-frames 
(i.e. 1M, 6M, 1Y and 5Y) be classify a at risk. Moreover, 
more than half of the individual with record self-harm in the 
five year before CLD, or depression and anxiety or alcohol or 
drug misuse in the month before CLD, receive a very high 
estimate suicide risk score (r>0.83).

Discussion 

Principal Results 
The present oversimplify system successfully differentiate 
between 2604 suicide case and 52,080 match control in 
73.22% of test instance during 10x10-fold cross-validation. 
It achieve this use only routinely collect EHRs from GP 
and hospital admission in the five year before the case’s CLD. 

The reduction in error rate a the number of hidden layer 
increase be representative of the complexity of the underlie 
suicide factors-risk model. In our case, result barely change 
when the number of neuron in the hidden layer increased. In 

fact, performance difference between network with the same 
number of layer come from a good tune of the output score 
result in an operational point closer to the optimal (ie, equal 
error rate). Overall, we expect the advantage of have more 
layer and neuron to become obvious when more factor be 
fed into the model. 

The disparity that be observe between sensitivity and 
specificity and on the score distribution between case and 
control highlight the variation in the level of difficulty 
experienced when analyze both groups. Controls seem to 
follow more uniform pattern and be therefore easy to identify, 
hence the high specificity and the cluster of control below 
a 0.5 score. On the other hand, pattern of the case be more 
heterogeneous, with some have feature vector identical to 
controls, which explains the low sensitivity and the almost 
uniform distribution of case across risk scores. 

The present behavioral evaluation do not unequivocally 
explain the factor-risk model built by the network. However, 
they do provide a general idea of what be drive the output 
score upwards. The input factor prescription of psychotropics, 
depression and anxiety, and self-harm, and, to a low degree, 
drug and alcohol misuse, be strongly link with increase 
estimate risk scores. This be in keep with previous literature

[6-8] and provide evidence for proof of concept and the 
feasibility of identify high risk individual use ANNs and 
routinely collect EHRs. Similarly, gender and age be not 
related with risk estimation, also in line with finding of 
short-term risk study [10]. 

On the other hand, some risk factor identify in the literature 
do not exhibit the same behavior in our results. Physical sleep 
disorder seem to decrease rather than increase the estimate 
risk. Due to the relatively low incidence of this factor in our 
data, it effect may be attenuate by and highly dependent on 
more active factors. This would also explain the dispersion of 
it effect on the estimate risk score (Figure 4). Furthermore, 
possible maltreatment also seem to reduce the estimate risk. 
However, after a closer look, it effect seem to change sign a 
the maltreatment get further away from the CLD, with possible 
maltreatment in the 5Y time-frame increase the estimate 
risk. This may be related to long last effect of maltreatment 
and with help and support receive in the first year after the 
maltreatment. 

Due to the non-perfect specificity and relatively low sensitivity 
obtained, result from the behavioral analysis should not be 
directly extrapolate to the real-world factor-risk model. Having 
say that, the remarkable agreement between our model and the 
exist literature work a an indication of the feasibility of 
our proposal. Additionally, we expect to substantially improve 
performance with a more complex system design, which will 
in turn increase our confidence in the validity of the obtain 
factors-risk model. 

Potential of the Proposal 
Perfect estimation of suicide risk use EHRs will never be 
possible, mainly because some individual take their own life 
without ever seek help or without present to health care 
service with sign of be at risk. In addition, of those that 
seek help or present with evidence, sign may be miss or 
inaccurately or insufficiently recorded. Others may simply 
present insufficient evidence to distinguish them from control 
(ie, have a pattern identical to controls). 

According to our data, around 90% of those that die through 
suicide in Wales have one or more contact with health service 
in the year prior to their CLD, and approximately 30% of them 
have a contact related to their mental health. Therefore, the 
propose methodology still have a good scope for application. 

Comparison with Prior Work 
To our knowledge, Passos’ [24] and Kessler’s [25] be the only 
two publication to date with proposal comparable to ours. 
They report 72% and 66% of accuracy respectively, compare 
to 73% obtain by our best system. However, these result 
cannot be directly compare due to difference in the application 
setting, data use and the evaluation process. Firstly, they 
apply and test their system in a hospital set with only 
mental health patients. Secondly, their system use small 
datasets and data extract from questionnaire or outpatient 
visit with a specialist. Here we use diagnosis in primary and 
secondary care which be less specific, and primary care record 
have little indication of severity. 

Interestingly, while Kessler’s method also suffer from low 
sensitivity, Passos’ system obtain comparable sensitivity and 
specificity. This may be due to the latter use data from the 
questionnaire Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV axis-I 
Disorders, which record highly specific diagnoses. In addition, 
Passos’ system aim at differentiate previous suicide 
attempter from non-attempters, rather than identify future 
risk. 

Limitations 
The result present here be limited by the purposely 
oversimplify system design use both in term of the number 
of factor consider (only 15 over four time-frames) and the 
design of the ANN (a maximum of two hidden layers). Still, 
our system improve chance identification by almost 50%. As 
we move from feasibility to pilot study and increase the 
complexity of the system we expect to increase performance 
substantially. 

The problem of suicide risk estimation suffers not only from a 
highly complex factors-risk model, but also from a lack of a 
quantitative measure of the real risk of suicide which be only 
know with certainty within a short time span before a record 
attempt. At any other time-point, we do not know the real risk 
for any individual. Someone at risk may refrain from ever 
attempt suicide, whereas another person may become at risk 
and attempt suicide within a very short period. This will have 
implication for a more practical evaluation (compared to the 
feasibility analysis present here), a we will need to find way 
to ass performance fairly without know the real risk 
ourselves. 

Without properly label data, we need to rely on clinician to 
ass the factors-risk model construct by the algorithm. In 
our case, most of the individual with a self-harm event be 
classify a case or a be at risk (ie, r>0.5). Some of them 
belong to the control group, and we consider these a error 
in our evaluation. However, should all these instance be 
consider errors? The answer to this question be not trivial, and 
have technical, clinical and ethical implication that we need to 
explore in more depth. 

Implications for Practice 
Our proposal will be most practical in setting where 
professional do not have specialist mental health training but 
be in contact with individual at risk of suicide. Nurses, 
emergency department staff, ambulance services, police and 
prison worker would be among the one benefiting the most 
from the tool propose here. These professional face both the 
challenge of see large number of people where it be difficult 
to discern those at risk, and of assess the suicidality of 
individual often without have receive sufficient training 
and under staff shortage [44,45]. As a result, it can be a 
challenge to identify individual for appropriate assessment and 
care [46]. Having an advanced assessment tool with complex 
factors-risk model that produce good estimation would be 
invaluable in these cases.

Conclusions 
Prescription of psychotropics, depression and anxiety, and 
self-harm be strongly link with high estimate risk scores, 
follow by hospital admission and long-term drug and alcohol 
misuse which be in keep with the current literature. Other 
risk factor such a sleep disorder and maltreatment have more 
complex effects. 

The system present here be an oversimplify one, use a 
short feature vector and shallow ANNs to ass the practicality 
of use EHRs in this way. As a feasibility study, we be more 
interested in (a) confirm the existence of discriminant 
information, and (b) validate the propose methodology, than 
obtain high accuracy rates. Nevertheless, our system obtain 
an accuracy like other publish method base on specialized 
questionnaire data. 

Prescription of psychotropics, depression and anxiety, and 
self-harm be strongly link with high estimate risk scores, 
follow by hospital admission and long-term drug and alcohol 
misuse. Age and gender have no effect on risk. Interestingly, 
possible maltreatment have the opposite effect in the short and 
long terms, decrease risk when recent and increase it when 
more than a year before CLD. 

The promising performance obtain with a basic ANN, and 
the fact that the result factors-risk model be in line for the 
most part with the literature, support the hypothesis of the 
possibility of building a tool capable of estimate suicide risk 
in the general population use only routinely collect EHRs. 
We be a long way from employ such method in clinical 
practice, but this be a first step to harness the potential of 
routinely collect electronic health record to support clinical 
practice in real time.
