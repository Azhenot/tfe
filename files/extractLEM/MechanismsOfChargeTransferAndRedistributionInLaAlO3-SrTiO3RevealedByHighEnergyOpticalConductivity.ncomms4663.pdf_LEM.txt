In condense matter physic the quasi two-dimensional electron gas at the interface of two 

different insulators, polar LaAlO3 on nonpolar SrTiO3 (LaAlO3/SrTiO3) be a spectacular and 

surprising observation. This phenomenon be LaAlO3 film thickness dependent and may be 

explain by the polarization catastrophe model, in which a charge transfer of 0.5e� from the 

LaAlO3 film into the LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface be expected. Here we show that in conduct 

sample (Z4 unit cell of LaAlO3) there be indeed a B0.5e� transfer from LaAlO3 into the 

LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface by study the optical conductivity in a broad energy range 

(0.5–35 eV). Surprisingly, in insulate sample (r3 unit cell of LaAlO3) a redistribution of 
charge within the polar LaAlO3 sublayers (from AlO2 to LaO) a large a B0.5e� be 

observed, with no charge transfer into the interface. Hence, our result reveal the different 

mechanism for the polarization catastrophe compensation in insulate and conduct 

LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interfaces.

S 
ome of the most excite condense matter physic 
problem be found at the interface of dissimilar materials1. 
The behaviour of electron at these interface would be 

govern by electronic reconstruction mechanisms2 lead to a 
variety of exotic quantum phenomena1. In conjunction with 
X-ray and electron spectroscopy techniques3–7 with their 
inherent advantage and constraints, an experimental technique 
that can directly reveal hidden quantum phenomenon at bury 
interface be highly desirable. In this paper we demonstrate the 
potency of high-energy optical reflectivity couple with 
spectroscopic ellipsometry and study an interface consist of 
two dissimilar insulators: polar LaAlO3 and nonpolar SrTiO3 
reveal the detail of the charge (electron) transfer among and 
within the layer that govern the conductivity of the bury 
interface. 

The quasi two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) at the the 
bury interface of two different insulator oxide heterostructure, 
polar LaAlO3 on nonpolar SrTiO3 (LaAlO3/SrTiO3)8 have show 
many interest phenomenon range from metal–insulator 
transition9, superconductivity10 and magnetism11–14. According 
to the controversial but compelling polarization catastrophe 
model, the polar sublayers of LaAlO3 ((LaO)þ and (AlO2)� ) 
give rise to a polarization field inside LaAlO3 that cause an 
electronic potential build-up a the LaAlO3 film thickness 
increases. To counter this, a charge transfer of 0.5e� per unit 
cell (uc) (B3� 1014 cm� 2) from LaAlO3 into the LaAlO3/SrTiO3 
interface be required15,16. Various technique have show a charge 
transfer much less than this. For example, X-ray-based 
techniques5,6 have estimate up to 1.1� 1014 cm� 2 while 
transport measurements9–11 yield substantially small number 
of carrier of B1013 cm� 2. It have be suggest that charge 
localization effect might limit the number of mobile charge that 
can be measure by transport7,17, and thus if a technique can 
measure and quantify both the localize and delocalize charges, 
one might be able to evaluate the actual charge transfer5–7. 

Another unresolved important issue be the insulate case of 
LaAlO3/SrTiO3 (r3 uc of LaAlO3). Transport measurements9 
have show that the conduct interface only exists above a 
certain critical thickness of LaAlO3, typically Z4 uc (although 
cationic stoichiometry, for example the La/Al ratio of LaAlO3 
film, may also affect the interface conductivity, with conduct 
LaAlO3/SrTiO3 observe to have slightly Al-rich LaAlO3 film18). 
This mean that the charge transfer into the interface require for 
counter the polarization catastrophe do not happen when 
the thickness of LaAlO3 be below 4 uc. According to the prevalent 
polarization catastrophe model, this mean the polarization field 
should be present for r3 uc of LaAlO3. One way to verify the 
model be to measure this polarization potential build-up in 
insulate LaAlO3/SrTiO3, which be predict to be 0.24 V Å� 1 

(or B0.9 V per uc of LaAlO3)19. However, attempt to measure 
this have not be successful use core-level X-ray 
photoemission spectroscopy (XPS)20,21, in which the measure 
core-level shift in LaAlO3 be only B0.1 eV per uc of LaAlO3, 
much less than expected. If the change in the band structure be 
predominantly near the valence band and the Fermi level, then 
the appropriate technique should directly probe state near the 
valence band and the Fermi level. 

Let u approach the problem from a different angle. Another 
way to overcome the polarization potential be by charge redis- 
tribution within the LaAlO3 layers. In a Gedankenexperiment, we 
hypothesize an extreme case of charge redistribution of 1e� 

between the AlO2 and LaO sublayers of LaAlO3, which be also 
adequate to compensate the polarization potential, although the 
actual amount of charge redistribution might be restrict by 
electrostatics. Hence, instead of measure the potential build-up 
in the layers, one can measure the charge redistribution within 

the layer directly. This can be do by measure the optical 
conductivity involve state below and above the valence bands, 
the conduction band and the Fermi level, and then use the f-sum 
rule, which represent charge conservation, to quantify the charge 
redistribution. 

Furthermore, recent band structure calculation and surface 
X-ray diffraction measurement suggest that distortion of the 
LaAlO3 lattice (buckling) may partly compensate the polarization 
field in insulate LaAlO3/SrTiO3 (refs 22–25). Interestingly, 
when the interface becomes conduct at LaAlO3 thickness Z4 
uc, this distortion decrease and ultimately vanishes24,25, 
indicate that the buckling mechanism be unique to the 
insulate case of LaAlO3/SrTiO3. This raise another important 
question: since the buckling be a structural change, will the 
electronic structure change appropriately, and manifest a a 
charge redistribution within the LaAlO3 layer itself? Thus, it be 
again critical to be able to measure these intralayer charge 
redistributions. 

As mention earlier, a direct way to probe the electronic band 
structure and charge (localized and delocalized) redistribution 
mechanism be to measure the complex dielectric response of the 
material from which the optical conductivity can be extract in a 
broad energy range26–28. Here we use a combination of 
spectroscopic ellipsometry and ultraviolet–vacuum ultraviolet 
(UV-VUV) reflectivity to probe the intrinsic property of the 
LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface use photon with energy between 0.5 
and 35 eV. Owing to a stabilize Kramers–Kronig 
transformation29,30, the strength of this experimental approach 
allows one to measure the charge transfer of both delocalize and 
localize charge accurately use the optical f-sum rule. Since 
localize electron be inaccessible to electrical transport 
measurements, but be accessible by photons, we overcome a 
severe constraint. In particular, the optical transition involve 
AlO2 sublayer of LaAlO3 be very distinct and well separate from 
the one involve LaO sublayer, so that the internal charge 
redistribution within the LaAlO3 sublayers can be clearly identified. 
The same be also true for the TiO2 and SrO sublayers of SrTiO3. 

Here we show that in conduct LaAlO3/SrTiO3 (4 and 6 uc of 
LaAlO3 film on SrTiO3), there be indeed a charge transfer from 
LaAlO3 into the interface, and that the amount of charge transfer 
be B0.5e� . In the insulate case (2 and 3 uc of LaAlO3 film on 
SrTiO3), we surprisingly observe B0.5e� charge redistribution 
from AlO2 to LaO sublayers, within the LaAlO3 layers. This 
suggests that for the insulate case the polarization catastrophe 
could be partly overcome by the above-mentioned charge 
redistribution, which may be a consequence of the buckling of 
the LaAlO3 lattice. 

Results 
Structural and transport measurements. LaAlO3/SrTiO3 
sample be prepared by grow LaAlO3 film on top of 
TiO2-terminated (001) SrTiO3 use pulse laser deposition12. 
The atomic force microscopy (AFM) topography image of the 
TiO2-terminated SrTiO3 substrate in Fig. 1a clearly show the 
atomically flat surface with uc steps. Four high-quality sample 
with vary thickness of 2, 3, 4 and 6 uc of LaAlO3 film be 
prepared a a model interface system for the high-energy optical 
studies. The growth of the film be monitor use reflective 
high-energy electron diffraction (Fig. 1b). After LaAlO3 
deposition, AFM topography measurement show that the 
atomically flat surface with uc step and terrace structure of 
SrTiO3 be preserved, with surface roughness of B1 Å (see 
Fig. 1c,d). This ensures that surface roughness effect do not 
adversely affect the optical measurements. Transport

optic measurements, show consistently that 2 and 3 uc sample 
be insulate with carrier density and conductivity below the 
measurement limit, while 4 and 6 uc one be conduct with 
carrier density of 4–6� 1013 cm� 2 and conductivity of 
4–8� 10� 5O� 1, consistent with previous transport results9–11. 

The perovskite LaAlO3 uc (Fig. 1f) can be divide into two 
sublayers: LaO and AlO2, in which theoretical calculation have 
show that the band structure of these discriminate sublayers 
be indeed different19,22, lead to distinct optical transitions. To 
accommodate the assignment of these optical transitions, we 
define OLa a the O in the LaO plane and OAl a the O in the AlO2 
plane. Similarly, SrTiO3 also have similar layer perovskite 
structure and thus can also be divide into two sublayers: SrO 
and TiO2. Then OSr be define a O that belongs to SrO sublayer, 
while OTi be define a the one in TiO2. Similarly, the O in the 
different plane of SrTiO3 can also lead to distinct optical 
transitions. This discrimination be important, a discuss later, 
because it can reveal the intra- and interlayer charge transfer 
mechanism in LaAlO3/SrTiO3 for both the insulate and 
conduct samples. 

Spectroscopic ellipsometry and high-energy reflectivity. Our 
main observation be the high-energy reflectivity of LaAlO3/SrTiO3 
at different thickness of LaAlO3 a compare with bulk LaAlO3 
and SrTiO3 a show in Fig. 2a. Note that, because of the 
challenge in make optical measurement over such a broad 
energy range, in this study we have only measure a select set 
of sample a representative of insulate (2 and 3 uc) and 
conduct (4 and 6 uc) LaAlO3/SrTiO3. Thus, further mea- 
surements on a large set of sample may be important in further 
deepen our analyses. It can be see that the reflectivity spectrum 
of the insulate 2 and 3 uc LaAlO3/SrTiO3 be similar, and the 
same be true for the conduct 4 and 6 uc LaAlO3/SrTiO3. 
Surprisingly, there be huge difference between reflectivity of 
insulate and conduct samples. These difference occur more 
significantly at high photon energies, particularly in the energy 
range of 9–14 eV and 14–21 eV. In the 9–14-eV range, the 
reflectivity of conduct sample be low than insulate sam- 
ples, while in the 14–21-eV range the opposite occurs. In contrast, 
between 4 and 9 eV, the difference be less, and below 4 eV they 
be negligible. This signifies why go beyond conventional (up

to B5 eV) spectroscopic ellipsometry be important. (Note that the 
spectroscopic ellipsometry data be crucial for the normalization 
of the derive dielectric function from the reflectivity measure- 
ments make up to 35 eV a show in Supplementary Methods.) 
The electronic band structure of the insulate and conduct 
LaAlO3/SrTiO3 be very different at high energy, and these dif- 
ferences be critical in reveal the true nature of LaAlO3/SrTiO3 
interface. Furthermore, since reflectivity and spectroscopic ellip- 
sometry be sensitive to unpercolated cluster of charges31, the 
similarity of the reflectivity of insulate 2 and 3 uc LaAlO3/ 
SrTiO3 also implies that there be no evidence of precursor of 
percolation effect in the insulate samples, especially the 3 uc 
LaAlO3/SrTiO3 (ref. 32). 

Discussion 
For detailed analysis, we turn our discussion to optical 
conductivity, s1, because it fulfils the optical f-sum rule, which 

be related to number of charge excite by the photons. For bulk 
material like bulk LaAlO3 and bulk SrTiO3, s1 can be extract 
directly from reflectivity use the Kramers–Kronig analysis29,30. 
On the other hand, LaAlO3/SrTiO3 be layer along the o0014 
direction (perpendicular to the (001) surface of the sample) owe 
to it heterostructure nature a well a the presence of the 
conduct layer at LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface. For this reason, the 
reflectivity of LaAlO3/SrTiO3 be analyse base on standard 
theory of wave propagation in a stratify media33,34. The analysis 
naturally lead to a three-layered structure for the conduct 
LaAlO3/SrTiO3: LaAlO3 film layer on top, bulk SrTiO3 substrate 
at the bottom and an interface layer sandwich in between, 
represent the 2DEG of the conduct samples. 

A self-consistent iteration procedure be use to extract the 
thickness and dielectric function of each layer, and a long a the 
iteration be convergent, the start assumption of these 
parameter should have little effect, if any, on the final obtain 
value (see Supplementary Methods for details). From the 
analysis, it be found that the thickness of this interface layer be 
B5 nm, consistent with previous observation use hard XPS5, 
cross-sectional conduct tip AFM35 and the upper limit for the 
superconducting layer thickness of LaAlO3/SrTiO3 (ref. 10). This 
result also suggests that the high-energy reflectivity can be use to 
measure the thickness of interface layer. For insulate LaAlO3/ 
SrTiO3, the analysis naturally converges into an effective two- 
layer structure instead. This mean for insulate LaAlO3/ 
SrTiO3 the s1 at interface be very similar to that of bulk SrTiO3 a 
discuss later. This can be easily understood owe to the 
absence of the conduct interface layer. 

Now, s1 of each individual layer can be extract separately, so 
that we can analyse the concomitant evolution of each individual 
layer of LaAlO3/SrTiO3 a the interface change from insulate 
to conducting. Spectra of s1 for each layer be show in Fig. 2b,c. 
It should be note that the plot for 2 and 3 uc LaAlO3/SrTiO3 be 
the same owe to the nature of the iteration process (see 
Supplementary Methods), and the same be true for the 4 and 6 uc 
LaAlO3/SrTiO3. 

For LaAlO3, one can, base on band structure calculations36,37, 
divide s1 into three main optical regions, while s1 of SrTiO3 can 
be divide into five main optical regions38–40. Every transition be 
unique and originates from different orbitals in each layer and 
sublayer, and these be summarize in Table 1. Furthermore, the 
polarization of the incident light be also take into account in 
assign the optical transitions. Since the incident light be linearly 
polarize parallel to the sample surface, the majority of the optical 
transition occur in the in-plane direction within each sublayer, 
allow u to study spectral weight transfer between the 
different sublayers. For example, in A1 region of LaAlO3, the 
transition be from OLa-2p to La-4d, 5f, both of which reside within 
the LaO sublayer of LaAlO3. The other transition also follow this 
convention. 

Figure 2b show that s1 of LaAlO3 film of insulate and 
conduct LaAlO3/SrTiO3 be dramatically different a compare 
with bulk LaAlO3. Particularly, s1 in A1 region of LaAlO3 film in 
the insulate sample be high than the bulk value, while for the 
conduct sample it be lower. Meanwhile, the reverse be true in 
A2 region. It be very clear that there be spectral weight transfer 
occur between these three region when the thickness of 
LaAlO3 film increase and the interface go from insulate to 
conduct state. 

It can be see (Fig. 2c) that s1 of the interface layer to a 
significant extent resembles s1 of the bulk SrTiO3. This indicates 
that the electronic interface layer be SrTiO3-like, and that the 
conduct layer mostly resides in SrTiO3 side rather than 
LaAlO3. The most significant change in s1 happens at B3 region 
when the interface becomes conducting. In bulk SrTiO3, that

into several energy regions, A1–A3 for LaAlO3 and B1–B5 for SrTiO3 and the

region corresponds to a valley with no main optical transition. 
Interestingly, for the conduct sample a completely new peak 
emerges in that region. This implies that when the interface 
becomes conducting, a new characteristic interface state emerges 
represent the presence of the 2DEG. According to previous 
reports3–7,17,19,22, the 2DEG resides in the Ti-3d-t2g state of 
SrTiO3, so this new interface state should also have Ti-3d-t2g 
characteristic. Thus, base on the optical selection rules, the 
optical transition at B3 region may be assign to originate from 
this new interface state to unoccupied state of high O orbitals 
(see Table 1). One should note that the s1 spectrum of the interface 
layer of conduct LaAlO3/SrTiO3 do not show Drude 
response, consistent with previous infrared spectroscopic 
ellipsometry experiment41. 

The s1 analysis be very important because it can be link to 
the effective number of electron associate with a particular 
optical transition, N, use partial f-sum rule,

where e be the elementary charge, m be the electron mass and V be 
the unit volume. The E1 and E2 indicate the energy boundary of 
that particular transition in the s1 plot. We then define neff a the 
N of each layer relative to either bulk LaAlO3 (for LaAlO3 film) or 
bulk SrTiO3 (for interface layer) values. The advantage of this 
definition be that any change in N in LaAlO3 film or the interface 
layer can be distinguish from the bulk properties. 

In LaAlO3/SrTiO3 (and thin film in general), the thickness of 
the LaAlO3 film and interface layer be finite, so neff distributes 
over this finite thickness. If we assume that the distribution be 
uniform over each uc, the neff per uc, nuc, can be define such that 

neff ¼ 
Z d 

0 
nucdx ¼ nucd; ð2Þ 

where d be the thickness in uc. In this case, the unit volume V 
becomes the volume occupy by each sublayer (LaO and AlO2 
for LaAlO3 and SrO and TiO2 for SrTiO3), so that the unit of nuc 
be the number of charge per sublayer. Thus, neff, which be the total 
amount of charge redistribution and transfer correspond to a 
particular optical transition, can be obtain by integrate nuc 

over the layer thickness, a show in Fig. 3. (The procedure to 
obtain neff be further explain in Methods). 

We start our discussion with insulate samples. As show 
in Fig. 3a, neff of A1 region of LaAlO3 film increase by B0.5e� , 
while for A2 region it decreases, also by B0.5e� . The net 
amount of the charge transfer in LaAlO3 film be thus (þ 0.5e� ) 
þ (� 0.5e� )¼ 0. This indicates a redistribution of B0.5e� 
from OAl-2p (AlO2 sublayer) to OLa-2p (LaO sublayer), a 
show in Table 1. On the basis of f-sum rule, this directly implies 
that there be no net charge transfer into the LaAlO3/SrTiO3 
interface. As a result, the LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface remains 
insulating. Since the LaAlO3 film (and the system a a whole) 
remains insulating, the B0.5e� charge redistribution do not 
result in the creation of electron and hole in the LaO and AlO2 
sublayers but rather an increase of covalence between the LaO 
and AlO2 sublayers, lead to the measure charge 
redistribution. 

One way to interpret these data be by consider that the 
charge redistribution be uniform for all LaAlO3 layers. In this case, 
the covalence of AlO2 becomes modify from � 1 to � (1� nuc) 
and the covalence of LaO from þ 1 to þ (1� nuc) (Fig. 4a). The 
nuc be B0.25e� � 0.3e� for the 2 uc LaAlO3/SrTiO3, and 
B0.17e� � 0.2e� for the 3 uc LaAlO3/SrTiO3 (see Methods). 
This charge redistribution within the LaAlO3 sublayers (electro- 
nic reconstruction2) can thus help to decrease the potential build- 
up in the LaAlO3 film and partially compensate the polarization 
catastrophe. Combined with ionic reconstruction mechanism 
such a the buckling and ionic relaxation effect predicted22,23

and observe early use surface X-ray diffraction24,25 and 
second harmonic generation32, what we be measure in term 
of charge redistribution may arise from such a mechanism. 

Another possible scenario that can be consider to interpret 
the data be that, instead of involve the whole LaAlO3 layers, the 
charge redistribution only happens at the topmost (that is, 
surface) LaAlO3 layer. In this case, the covalence of surface AlO2 
becomes modify from � 1 to � 0.5 and the covalence of surface 
LaO from þ 1 to þ 0.5, but the deeper LaAlO3 layer remains 
unchanged, since the charge redistribution be confine only in the 
surface (that is, surface reconstruction). In this scenario, the 
surface charge redistribution be still able to partially compensate 
the polarization catastrophe, but it be in less of an agreement with 
the buckling effects, since the buckling be observe experimen- 
tally, and support by theoretical calculations22–25, to affect the 
whole LaAlO3 film, and not only the surface. 

On the other hand, for conduct sample we observe a 
different phenomenon. The neff of both A1 and A2 region of 
LaAlO3 film decrease (Fig. 3a). For A1 region it decrease by 
B0.3e� � 0.4e� , while for A2 region it decrease by B0.2e� , 
lead to an overall B0.5e� decrease of neff in the LaAlO3 film. 
At the same time, for the interface layer the most significant 
change that happens when LaAlO3/SrTiO3 becomes conduct be 
the increase of neff of B3 region by B0.5e� (Fig. 3b). The total 
charge transfer within the whole LaAlO3/SrTiO3 sample be thus 
again 0, with the decrease of B0.5e� in LaAlO3 film 
compensate by the increase of B0.5e� at the interface. On 
the basis of f-sum rule, this clearly indicates that there be a charge 
transfer of B0.5e� from the LaAlO3 film into the interface to 
form the 2DEG (Fig. 4b), consistent with the polarization 
catastrophe model15,16. On the basis of the definition of neff, 
this B0.5e� extra charge at the interface be distribute over the 
B5 nm thickness of the interface (which mostly resides in the 
SrTiO3 side). 

Moreover, it can be see from Fig. 2c that the B3 peak, which 
involves the transition from the new interface state that contains 
this B0.5e� extra charge, be very broad (B4 eV wide), which 
mean that the B0.5e� be distribute over a rather wide energy 
range. This may be one of the reason why transport experiment 
can only measure a fraction of this B0.5e� , since only a small 
portion of the charge be delocalize and thus able to contribute to 
electrical conductivity. 

Furthermore, Fig. 3b also show that the neff of B1 and B5 
regions, both of which involve transition into the unoccupied 
Ti-3d-t2g states, decrease by B0.05e� (that is, B10% of 0.5e� ). 
This implies that the new interface state of conduct LaAlO3/ 
SrTiO3 have Ti-3d-t2g characteristic3–7,17,19,22, so the extra 
B0.5e� also partially fill the previously unoccupied Ti-3d-t2g 
state of SrTiO3. This decrease be consistent with previous 
observation use X-ray absorption spectroscopy experi- 
ments3,6. In X-ray absorption spectroscopy at Ti-L3,2 edge of 
conduct LaAlO3/SrTiO3, the excitation to the unoccupied 
Ti-3d-t2g state also decrease compare with bulk SrTiO3. 
Intriguingly, these decrease be much small if one assumes that 
all of the B0.5e� extra charge partially fill the Ti-3d-t2g- 
unoccupied density of state (DOS). This be because, base on this 
assumption, one would expect to observe the decrease of 
Ti-3d-t2g-unoccupied DOS (and thus the neff of B1 and B5 
regions) in conduct LaAlO3/SrTiO3 also by an equivalent of 
B0.5e� . However, this be not the case, which implies that the 
B0.5e� extra charge contain within the new interface state 
do not only reduce the number of unoccupied Ti-3d DOS, but 
surprisingly also other state at even high energies, imply the 
importance of strong correlation and hybridization effect in 
explain the interlayer charge transfer in conduct LaAlO3/ 
SrTiO3 (refs 26,42,43). 

Another interest observation to note be that in the 
conduct samples, the neff of A3 region of LaAlO3 film also

Figure 4 | Simplified pictorial layer-resolved electronic configuration model of LaAlO3/SrTiO3. (a) Layer-resolved electronic configuration model of 

insulate LaAlO3/SrTiO3, show the charge redistribution from AlO2 sublayer into LaO sublayer if the redistribution be assume to be uniform across 

the LaAlO3 film. The nuc be B0.25e� �0.3e� for the 2 uc LaAlO3/SrTiO3 and B0.17e� �0.2e� for the 3 uc LaAlO3/SrTiO3. The charge redistribution 
can partially counteract the potential build-up due to polarization catastrophe15,16 and keep the system insulating. (b) Layer-resolved electronic

our result it be distribute over the B5 nm thickness on the interface. To ensure charge conservation, one of the upper layer of LaAlO3 (that is, in the dot- 
sign region above the depict third layer of LaAlO3) should have AlO2 sublayer with valence state of (AlO2) 

0.5� instead of (AlO2)� .

decrease by B0.2e� . The transition in this region corresponds 
to O-2s state, which be strongly localize and directly corresponds 
to the availability of oxygen in the LaAlO3 film. Thus, the 
decrease of O-2s DOS can indicate the presence of oxygen 
vacancy in the LaAlO3 film of the conduct samples. For 4 uc 
LaAlO3/SrTiO3, there be 24e� in O-2s state of LaAlO3; thus, 
the B0.2e� decrease be equivalent to B1% oxygen vacancy. 
This be interest because it have be suggest that the presence 
of oxygen vacancy in LaAlO3 film may enhance the charge 
transfer from LaAlO3 film into LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface7,44,45. 
Because of the charge transfer into the interface, the LaAlO3 film 
lack B0.5e� (that is, have additional B0.5 holes), so the extra 
e� create by the oxygen vacancy may partially compensate 
these hole and stabilize the charge transfer. Interestingly, in 
insulate LaAlO3/SrTiO3, this oxygen vacancy signature be not 
observed. 

It be noteworthy to reconcile our result with photoconductivity 
effect observe in LaAlO3/SrTiO3. Previous transport results46,47 

have show that when LaAlO3/SrTiO3 be illuminate by 
photon with energy high than the SrTiO3 bandgap, it 
conductivity could increase because of the presence of photo- 
generate carriers. On the basis of hard XPS data5, the amount of 
these photo-generated carrier be estimate to be 2.1� 1013 cm� 2 
(B0.03e� ), which be much small than the number of e� 

contribute to the charge transfer and charge redistribution 
observe in our result (B0.5e� ). Thus, the photoconductivity 
effect might only influence the estimate neff by B6%, and do 
not affect our analysis adversely. 

Recent observation have also indicate that the cationic 
stoichiometry, for example, the La/Al ratio in LaAlO3 film, may 
affect the electrical property of LaAlO3/SrTiO3 (refs 18,48,49). 
How this cationic stoichiometric effect would influence the high- 
energy optical conductivity of insulate and conduct LaAlO3/ 
SrTiO3 be an important open question. Thus, it interplay with the 
charge transfer and redistribution phenomenon a observe in 
high-energy optical conductivity still remains to be answered. 

In summary, we have show that high-energy reflectivity and 
spectroscopic ellipsometry study of LaAlO3/SrTiO3 have 
reveal significant difference between the charge redistribution 
of insulate (2 and 3 uc of LaAlO3) and charge transfer 
mechanism of conduct (4 and 6 uc of LaAlO3) LaAlO3/ 
SrTiO3. In insulate LaAlO3/SrTiO3, B0.5e� charge 

redistribution be observe between the AlO2 and LaO sublayers 
and partially compensates the polarization catastrophe. In the 
conduct samples, B0.5e� be measure to be transfer from 
LaAlO3 film into the interface, which be consistent with the 
polarization catastrophe model. We believe that this study reveals 
the nature of the intra- and interlayer charge redistribution and 
charge transfer in LaAlO3/SrTiO3, and hence open a path to 
understand the various electronic reconstruction involve the 
interface of complex oxide heterostructures. Furthermore, the 
use of high-energy reflectivity couple with spectroscopic 
ellipsometry could be extend to other similar polar and 
nonpolar oxide interface systems. 

Methods 
Sample preparation. LaAlO3/SrTiO3 sample be prepared by grow LaAlO3 
film on top of (001) SrTiO3 substrate obtain from Crystec use pulse laser 
deposition12. Before the growth, the SrTiO3 substrate be treat use HF and 
be anneal at 950 �C for 2 h in O2 flow to achieve the desire TiO2 surface 
termination50. The AFM topography image of the TiO2-terminated SrTiO3 
substrate in Fig. 1a clearly show the atomically flat surface with uc steps. The 
growth target be LaAlO3 single crystal, also obtain from Crystec. The 
deposition pressure be 10� 3 Torr, with background pressure of 10� 9 Torr. 
The deposition temperature be 750 �C, with cool rate of 10 �C min� 1 at the 
deposition pressure. The laser pulse frequency be 1 Hz. Four sample with vary 
thickness of 2, 3, 4 and 6 uc of LaAlO3 film be made, a monitor use 
reflective high-energy electron diffraction (Fig. 1b). After LaAlO3 deposition, AFM 
topography measurement show that the atomically flat surface with uc step and 
terrace structure of SrTiO3 be preserved, with surface roughness of B1 Å (see 
Fig. 1c,d). 

Optics measurements. The optical conductivity be obtain use a combi- 
nation of spectroscopic ellipsometry (0.5–5.6 eV) and UV–VUV reflectivity (3.7– 
35 eV) measurements26–28. The detail of the optical measurement be a follow. 
The spectroscopic ellipsometry measurement be perform in the spectral range 
between 0.5 and 5.6 eV by use an SE 850 ellipsometer at room temperature51. 
Three different incident angle of 60�, 70� and 80� from the sample normal be 
used, and the incident light be 45� linearly polarize from the plane of incident. 
For reflectivity measurement in the high-energy range between 3.7 and 35 eV, we 
use the SUPERLUMI beamline at the DORIS storage ring of HASYLAB 
(DESY)52. The incoming photon be incident at the angle of 17.5� from the sample 
normal with linear polarization parallel to the sample surface. The sample chamber 
be outfit with a gold mesh to measure the incident photon flux after the slit of 
the monochromator. The measurement be perform in ultrahigh vacuum 
environment (chamber pressure of 5� 10� 10 mbar) at room temperature. before 
these measurements, the sample be heat up to 400 K in ultrahigh vacuum to 
ensure that there be no additional adsorbate layer on the surface of the samples. 
The obtain UV–VUV reflectivity data be calibrate by compare it with the

luminescence yield of sodium salicylate (NaC7H5O3) and the gold mesh current. 
These as-measured UV–VUV reflectivity data be further normalize by use 
the self-normalized reflectivity extract from spectroscopic ellipsometry34,51, and 
the two normalize data be append to obtain the combine reflectivity from 
0.5 to 35 eV (see Supplementary Fig. 1). 

Analysis of optic data. Both the spectroscopic ellipsometry and the combine 
reflectivity data be analyse use a combination of the Drude–Lorentz oscillator 
multilayer fitting33,34 and self-consistent iteration method (see Supplementary 
Methods). Owing to it multilayered nature, the LaAlO3/SrTiO3 samples, especially 
the conduct cases, be consider to have the follow three layers: the LaAlO3 
film on top, the SrTiO3 substrate at the bottom and the interface layer in between 
(see Supplementary Fig. 2), consistent with previous observation use cross- 
sectional conduct tip AFM35. Since the spectroscopic ellipsometry data be 
take at three different incident angle of 60�, 70� and 80�, it be fit use angle- 
dependent iteration method (see Supplementary Methods), and the fitting result 
be show in Supplementary Figs 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7. Supplementary Figure 4 also 
show that the thickness of the conduct interface layer be B5 nm, consistent 
with previous observations5,10,35. Furthermore, from these variable angle 
spectroscopic ellipsometry results, the absence of absorbate layer and the absence 
of significant anisotropy can also be inferred. On the other hand, the normalize 
UV–VUV reflectivity data be fit use thickness-dependent iteration method 
(see Supplementary Methods), and the result of the fitting be show in 
Supplementary Fig. 8. 

Complex dielectric function of LaAlO3/SrTiO3. From the analysis described 
above, the complex dielectric function, e(o), of each layer of LaAlO3/SrTiO3 can be 
extract from the high-energy reflectivity of LaAlO3/SrTiO3 (Fig. 2a), a present 
in Fig. 5. In turn, this e(o) can be convert into optical conductivity s1 use 
s1(o)¼ e0e2(o)o, a present in Fig. 2b,c. In Fig. 5a,b, it can be see that the e(o) 
of the LaAlO3 film layer for both insulate and conduct LaAlO3/SrTiO3 be very 
different than that of bulk LaAlO3, which show that the band structure of LaAlO3 
film be very different than bulk LaAlO3. Meanwhile, the e(o) at the interface of the 
insulate sample (2 and 3 uc LaAlO3/SrTiO3, see Fig. 5c) be very similar to that of 
bulk SrTiO3, which can be explain by the absence of the 2DEG in the insulate 
samples. Interestingly, for the conduct sample (4 and 6 uc LaAlO3/SrTiO3, see 
Fig. 5d) there be new feature around 8–12 eV for e1 and 11–16 eV for e2, which, 
on further analysis (see Discussions), be related to the presence of the conduct 
interface in those sample. 

Estimation of charge transfer and redistribution. From equation (1) and (2), 
we can extract the nuc, which be the amount of charge redistribution and transfer 
per uc associate with a particular optical transition relative to the bulk values. To 
get the accurate number, we need to carefully consider within what volume V in the 
uc the electron reside. Both LaAlO3 and SrTiO3 crystal structure can be thought 
of a an alternate layer structure. LaAlO3 consists of alternate polar (LaO)þ 

and (AlO2)� sublayers, while SrTiO3 consists of alternate nonpolar SrO and 
TiO2 sublayers (see Figs 1d and 4). Owing to this layer structure, in a first 
approximation each cation (La and Al for LaAlO3, Sr and Ti for SrTiO3) only 
occupies a volume of half uc (instead of the full one uc). For example, the La of 
LaAlO3 have to share the space of one uc with Al (with each get half), and 
similarly the Sr of SrTiO3 have to share with Ti. Furthermore, for LaAlO3, the 
valence electron of the O atom that belong to the two different sublayers (LaO 
and AlO2) contribute to two different optical transition in the s1 spectrum (Fig. 2b

and Table 1). For simplicity, OLa be define a the O in the LaO plane and OAl a 
the O in the AlO2 plane. Thus, OLa also have to share the space of one uc with OAl, 
with each get the space of half uc. The same be true for SrTiO3, where the OSr in 
the SrO plane also have to share the space of one uc with the OTi in the TiO2 plane. 
This implies that the valence electron belonging to the different ion can also be 
approximate to reside in a volume of half uc. For this reason, to obtain the nuc the 
volume V be chosen to be the volume of half uc of LaAlO3 (lattice constant 
a0¼ 3.81 Å) or SrTiO3 (a0¼ 3.905 Å), whichever applicable. This consideration 
make the unit of nuc to be the number of charge per sublayer. The result for this 
nuc estimation be show in Fig. 6. For 2 uc LaAlO3/SrTiO3, the nuc be B0.25e� 

� 0.3e� , while for 3 uc LaAlO3/SrTiO3, the nuc be B0.17e� � 0.2e� . Then, the 
neff, which be the total amount of charge redistribution and transfer correspond 
to a particular optical transition can be obtain by integrate nuc over the layer 
thickness, a show in Fig. 3. 

The error bar in Figs 3 and 6 be estimate a follows. It be assume that there 
be two main source of random error in the data: from the resolution limitation 
of the optic measurement (estimated to be B2%) and from the error introduce 
in the normalization process (estimated to be B5%). These error affect the 
reflectivity data (that is, DR), and to obtain the correspond error for s1 (Ds)

LaAlO3 band structure calculation. Unlike SrTiO3 that have be study very 
thoroughly38–40, previous report that study the band structure and high photon- 
energy property of LaAlO3 in a detailed and comprehensive manner remain quite 
scarce36,37. Because of this, we perform our own band structure calculation of 
LaAlO3 to complement those previous studies. The result can be use a a tool to 
determine the high photon-energy optical transition assignment of LaAlO3, a 
list in Table 1. 

The detail of the calculation be a follows. Cubic LaAlO3 have a space group 
of Pm3m with an experimental lattice parameter of a¼ b¼ c¼ 3.8106 Å at 821 K 
(ref. 53). The calculation be perform use CASTEP code54. Geometry 
optimization have be carry out with local density approximation functional 
use cutoff energy of 1,500 eV and a 15� 15� 15 Monkhorst–Pack grid55 that 
corresponds to 120 k-points in the irreducible Brillouin zone. The cutoff energy 
and k-point mesh have be test and converge to energy difference of 
1� 10� 5 and 4� 10� 5 eV per atom, respectively. Ultrasoft pseudopotentials 
be generate ‘on the fly’ with valence state 4f, 5s, 5p, 5d, 6 for La, 3s, 3p for Al 
and 2s, 2p for O. The electronic minimization method use for the self-consistent 
field calculation be density mixing56 with a self-consistent field tolerance of 
2.0� 10� 6 eV per atom. The geometry optimization be carry out by the 
Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno algorithm57 with energy, force and 
displacement tolerance of 5.0� 10� 6 eV per atom, 1.0� 10� 2 eV Å� 1 and 
5.0� 10� 4 Å, respectively. The optimize lattice parameter be found out to be 
3.73 Å. Converged DOS calculation be carry out with a k-mesh of 20� 20� 20 
and consistent with previous calculations36,37. The calculation result be
