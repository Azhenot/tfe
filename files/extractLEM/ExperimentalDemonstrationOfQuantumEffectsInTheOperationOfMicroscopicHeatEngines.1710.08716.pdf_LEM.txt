The heat engine, a machine that extract useful work from thermal sources, be one of the 

basic theoretical construct and fundamental application of classical thermodynamics. The 

classical description of a heat engine do not include coherence in it microscopic degree of 

freedom. By contrast, a quantum heat engine might posse coherence between it internal 

states. Although the Carnot efficiency cannot be surpassed1–3, and coherence can be per- 

formance degrade in certain conditions4–9, it be recently predict that even when use 

only thermal resources, internal coherence can enable a quantum heat engine to produce 

more power than any classical heat engine use the same resources10,11. Such a power boost 

therefore constitutes a quantum thermodynamic signature. It have also be show that the 

presence of coherence result in the thermodynamic equivalence of different quantum heat 

engine types10,12, an effect with no classical counterpart. Microscopic heat machine have 

be recently implement with trap ions13,14, and proposal for heat machine use 

superconducting circuits15,16 and optomechanics17,18 have be made. When operate with 

standard thermal baths, however, the machine implement so far have not demonstrate 

any inherently quantum feature in their thermodynamic quantities. Here we implement two 

type of quantum heat engine by use of an ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy centre in diamond, 

and experimentally demonstrate both the coherence power boost and the equivalence of dif- 

ferent heat-engine types. This constitutes the first observation of quantum thermodynamic 

signature in heat machines.

A quantum heat engine consists of a microscopic system, or an ensemble of such systems, 

whose internal state can be a coherent superposition of energy states. The engine cycle consists 

of a sequence of operation (strokes), which include the interaction of the system (or part thereof) 

either with a thermal bath (cold or hot), or with an external classical/semi-classical field respon- 

sible for work extraction. Interactions with the thermal bath act to change the population of the 

energy state of the heat engine incoherently, in contrast to the field, which change the popula- 

tions coherently. Fig. 1 schematically present three basic quantum heat-engine types: continuous, 

two-stroke and four-stroke, which differ by the order of the different strokes. Of these types, 

the four-stroke engine bear the strong resemblance to macroscopic classical engine such a 

the Otto engine. It can be described (classically) by a two level system undergo a four part 

cycle, illustrate in the top panel of Fig. 1a, consist of alternate coupling to the hot and cold 

baths, intersperse with coupling to the work reservoir, whose effect be to change the space 

between the levels. It can be show that this dynamic be equivalent to classical swap operation 

in a multilevel system10 (multilevel embedding), a show in the middle panel of Fig. 1a (taking 

U = swap). In a quantum heat engine, the operator U can be any unitary transformation, allow 

for the generation of coherence between the two low level during the application of the exter- 

nal field. It be coherence generate in this manner that enables quantum heat engine to exhibit 

non-classical behaviour and so underlies the result in this paper. Note that no non-thermal energy 

source such a squeeze baths19–21, or externally inject coherence22–24 be required. A general 

four-stroke cycle be schematically illustrate in the bottom panel of Fig. 1a. One can simplify the 

cycle structure of the engine by combine the distinct hot and cold stroke into a single thermal 

stroke, obtain a two-stroke engine (Fig. 1b). Reducing the complexity of the engine operation 

even further, one obtains the continuous engine, implement by simply couple the system to 

both thermal bath and the external field continuously (Fig. 1c).

FIG. 1: Quantum heat engine schematics. a, An example of a four-stroke engine. Top: The 

classical case of two level with a variable energy gap. Population be transfer by thermal cou- 

plings to a cold bath (blue) and a hot bath (red). Coherence have no role in this case. Middle: A 

generalization by embed the operation into three constant level with general unitary trans- 

formation perform on the low two levels, and the cold (hot) bath coupling on the top two 

(upper most and low most) levels. A swap operation (a π-pulse) would correspond to the classi- 

cal case of the top panel. Bottom: schematic description. The gray rectangle represent the unitary 

(work-extracting) operations, while the orange (light blue) rectangle represent couple to a hot 

(cold) thermal bath. The horizontal dimension represent time, while the vertical represent cou- 

pling rate. The area of each rectangle be the stroke action (in unit of ~). b, The two-stroke engine. 

Top: three-level embedding. Bottom: Schematic description. c, Schematic description of the con- 

tinuous engine. All the three example present here have the same coherent and thermal action 

per cycle. In this work we experimentally implement the continuous and two-stroke engines. 

The coherence-related improvement in work and power output of a quantum heat engine, con- 

stituting a quantum thermal signature (QTS), can be understood a follows: when the coherence 

produce by the field during the work stroke be not completely erase during the thermal stroke, the 

work output, proportional to the population change during the work stroke, would be proportional 

to Cτw, where C be the survive coherence and τw be the duration of the work stroke. In con- 

trast, for a fully stochastic engine, where no coherence survives the thermal stroke, the population 

4 



change be only due to the coherence produce within the same work stroke, and the work output 

be therefore quadratic in τw. For a fix duty cycle d = τw/τcyc, where τcyc be the cycle time, the 

average power of a stochastic engine be therefore linear in τcyc, while that of a quantum engine be 

constant. Thus, for τcyc → 0, the power of a stochastic engine vanishes, while that of a quantum 

engine do not. Note that this picture10 hold only when the engine action be significantly less 

than ~. The action of a periodic quantum heat engine be formally define a the operator norm of 

the generator of motion integrate over the cycle10. For a two-stroke quantum heat engine (See 

Fig. 1b) the action be simply give by s = ~ [Ωd+ γth (1− d)] τcyc, where Ω be the Rabi frequency, 

proportional to the amplitude of the external field, and γth be the total couple rate to the heat bath 

(including both population transfer and pure dephasing). Thus, for the action to be small enough, 

both Ω and γth should be much low than the repetition rate of the engine. 

In this small-action regime we also observe the predict quantum heat machine equivalence 

(QHME)10: the three basic quantum heat engine type (four-stroke, two-stroke and continuous) all 

show the same performance per cycle. This effect take place since in time-symmetric cycles, the 

stroke commute up to second order in the action. Therefore, for small actions, the order of the 

stroke do not matter. 

The system we use in order to experimentally demonstrate QTS and QHME be an ensemble of 

negatively charge nitrogen vacancy (NV−) centre in diamond25. The NV− centre be an atomic- 

like system that exhibit several feature desirable for this purpose. First, it ground state contains 

three spin states, | − 1〉, |0〉, and | + 1〉, that maintain coherence even at room temperature, and 

can coherently interact with a microwave (MW) field, that can serve a the work reservoir. Sec- 

ond, after optical excitation, the system decay back into the ground-state manifold both by direct, 

spin-preserving, optical de-excitation (fluorescence), and by spin-dependent non-radiative chan- 

nels, through a meta-stable spin-singlet state |0′〉. The system therefore tends to a steady state with 

a population difference between the different spin component of the ground state. The dynam- 

ic of this process be equivalent to that produce by heat bath couple [see the Supplementary 

Information (SI)]. Finally, the fluorescent decay channel provide a direct mean to measure the 

population within the ground-state manifold. As spin be preserve during the optical excitation, 

but the non-radiative decay be spin-dependent, the fluorescence intensity be also spin dependent. 

The power output of the engine, related to the change in population within the ground-state mani- 

5 



fold, can thus be deduce from the change in fluorescence intensity upon introduction of the MW 

field. This technique, know a optically detect magnetic resonance25, provide a significant 

advantage over direct measurement of microwave amplification, especially when work in the 

small action regime.

FIG. 2: Coherent heat engine with NV− center in diamond. a, The ground state triplet and the 

low intermediate singlet state of the NV− under axial magnetic field. Optical excitation (green 

upward arrows) and inter-system cross (orange downward arrows) transfer population from the 

| ± 1〉 state to the |0〉 state through the upper |0′〉 state. The width of the arrow represent the 

transition rates. b, Steady state population emulate the equilibrium population due to couple 

of |0〉 and |0′〉 (| ± 1〉 and |0′〉) to a cold (hot) bath. c, Work, in the form of stimulate emission of 

MW radiation, can be extract by resonantly drive of the |+ 1〉 ↔ |0〉 transition. Note that the 

| − 1〉 state do not contribute to the work extraction. 

The specific experimental scheme we use be present in Fig. 2. Under an axial magnetic field 

of 0.2 T, the state | + 1〉 be lower below the state |0〉 by the Zeeman interaction, a show in 

Fig. 2a. It be possible to excite the |+ 1〉 ↔ |0〉 transition with a MW field without excite the 

| − 1〉 ↔ |0〉 transition, due to the difference in their resonance frequencies. As show in Fig. 2b, 

optical excitation and subsequent non-radiative decay through |0′〉 result in population inversion 

between |+ 1〉 and |0〉. This enables the extraction of work, in the form of stimulate emission 

of MW radiation, upon resonant MW drive of the |+ 1〉 ↔ |0〉 transition (Fig. 2c). Indeed, this 

specific system have be recently consider for the production of a chip-scale, room-temperature 

maser26,27. The thermal interaction, induced by laser excitation, and the couple to the work 

6 



reservoir, result from resonant MW driving, can either be interlaced or both be on continuously, 

which correspondingly implement either a two-stroke engine or a continuous engine.

FIG. 3: Quantum heat machine equivalence (QHME) of two-stroke and continuous engine 

types. The data point present the power output of the two-stroke engine a a function of the 

action per cycle (varied by change the cycle time), for a variety of peak Rabi frequencies. The 

continuous output power (together with their uncertainty) be indicate by the shade regions. 

The theory prediction for the continuous (two-stroke) engine be give by the dot (solid) line. 

It can be see that, for each Rabi frequency, the output of the two-stroke engine have the continuous 

engine output a it zero action asymptote. 

It can be show (see SI), that the average output power of the engine (per NV− centre) be 

proportional to the relative average change in the fluorescence intensity upon MW driving, 〈P 〉 = 

κ(Γ)~ω10 〈∆F 〉〈F0〉 , where 〈∆F 〉 be the MW-induced change in the average fluorescence intensity, 〈F0〉 

be the average fluorescence intensity in the absence of MW driving, ~ω10 be the energy of a MW 

photon emit in the transition between the two low ground states, and κ(Γ) be a rate which, 

for a fix duty-cycle, depends only on the optical excitation rate, Γ. In Fig. 3, the power output 

of the heat engine, work in two-stroke mode, be present a a function of the engine action 

per cycle, varied by change the cycle time, for a thermal bath couple rate of γth = 0.41 ± 

0.02 MHz and several value of the peak Rabi frequency (symbols). The duty cycle be fix 

at d = 1/3. In addition, Fig. 3 show the output of the continuous engine (shaded area with 

width signify the measurement error. See SI), with the same mean Rabi frequency and optical 

7 



pump rate a for the two-stroke engine. The convergence in performance constitute the first 

experimental verification of QHME. The theoretical prediction for the output power of the two- 

stroke (continuous) engine be present in Fig. 3 by the solid (dashed) line (see SI). 

In order to measure a QTS in a quantum heat engine, we first determine an upper power bound 

for a fully stochastic engine, which be equivalent to the quantum engine in all respect (energy 

levels, couple rate and stroke durations), bar the presence of coherence at the end of the thermal 

stroke. Since the power of a fully stochastic engine be constrain to lie below this bound, any 

measure output exceed the bound be indicative of quantum effects. For the case of a two- 

stroke engine, it can be show that the stochastic bound be give in the small action regime by10 

Pstoch ≤ 14~ω10d 
2Ω2τcyc (see SI). Fig. 4a present the measure power output of the two-stroke 

engine vs. the action per cycle (varied by change the cycle time), for Ω = 1.6± 0.05 Mrad/s, 

γth = 0.41 ± 0.02 MHz, and d = 1/3, along with the correspond stochastic bound (blue line). 

It be clearly see that for the small action apply (dashed frame, enlarge in the inset), the 

bound be violate by 2.4 standard deviations, correspond to a p value of 0.0082 (see SI). This 

constitutes a clear QTS. 

We also study the work output a the coherence of the system be reduced. Fig. 4b present 

the work per cycle in the two-stroke engine, where the work stroke duration be fix at 10 ns, the 

Rabi frequency be fix at 1.6 MRad/s, and the thermal stroke contains a fix population-transfer 

action, but be of variable duration. The total action per cycle exclude pure dephasing be fix at 

0.05~. Thus, by change the length of the work stroke, only the pure-dephasing related action 

be increased, due mostly to inhomogeneous dephasing (T ∗2 ∼ 75 ns), enable the examination of 

the dependence of the output work on the coherence of the system. The inset in Fig. 4b show 

scheme of this cycle for short and long thermal strokes. It be clearly see that the output work per 

cycle decrease a the thermal stroke duration be increased, and drop below the stochastic bound 

(blue line). The bound, take into account experimental imperfections, increase slightly at long 

thermal strokes. The slight discrepancy between theory and measurement for long thermal stroke 

might be attribute either to homogeneous dephasing or to charge effects, both neglect in the 

present theory (see SI). These measurement clearly demonstrate that coherence in microscopic 

heat engine can be performance enhancing.

In conclusion, we have use an ensemble of NV− centre in diamond for implement different 

type of quantum heat engines. We have use these to demonstrate the equivalence of the power 

output of two different engine types, continuous and two-stroke, for small actions. Additionally, 

we have show that, for very small actions, the engine produce more power than their classical 

counterparts, significantly exceed the stochastic power bound. These measurement constitute 

the first observation of quantum thermodynamic effect in heat machines. We hope that this work 

will motivate further research along at least three lines: 1) Demonstration of quantum effect in 

other physical realisation of heat machine such a superconducting circuits15,16 and ion traps13,14. 

2) Theoretical search of quantum thermal signature in heat machine base on other quantum 

agent such a entanglement28 and quantum discord. 3) Application to the design and development 

of novel device such a room-temperature masers26,27. We further hope that this work will be of 

interest to other research area concerned with the role of quantum coherence in the enhancement 

of work extraction by microscopic heat engines, such a the study of photosynthesis29 and the 

development of solar cells.

S1. SAMPLE PREPARATION 

A type Ib high-pressure-high-temperature 3×3×0.5 mm, (100) diamond slab (Element-Six) 

with an initial nitrogen concentration of ∼200 ppm be electron irradiate (1018 cm−2) and then 

anneal (950◦C, 2.5 hours), to form a dense (∼1018 cm−3) ensemble of NV− centres. The ori- 

entations of the centre be randomly distribute between all the 〈111〉 directions. However, the 

microwave (MW) drive be resonant only with the centre orient parallel to the magnetic field, 

and thus only these centre (∼25% of all centres) produce the work. 

S2. THE EXPERIMENTAL SETUP 

The experimental system be schematically present in Fig. S1(a). The diamond sample be 

place between two permanent magnet align along the [111] direction. A solid-state continuous- 

wave laser at 532 nm be focus inside the diamond sample to a spot of (nominally) 2.2 µm 

in diameter by a long-working-distance objective lens (NA=0.29). An acousto-optic modulator 

(AOM) be use for the intensity modulation of the laser-light reach the sample. In addition, an 

AC magnetic field be apply to the sample by a broad-band MW strip-line waveguide embed 

in the sample holder. Just below the sample, the strip-line be narrow down to a width of 

300 µm, in order for the apply field to be both strong enough and uniform across the active 

volume. A photograph of the sample on the MW waveguide be present in Fig. S1(b). A fast 

MW switch (MS) between the MW generator and the MW amplifier be use for the amplitude 

modulation of the apply MWs. The MS and the AOM have switch time of 1.5 n and 12 ns, 

respectively, and be both simultaneously driven at ∼MHz rate by a fast function generator. 

The fluorescence emit from the diamond be collect by the objective lens and be image 

with a ×10 magnification on a single-mode optical fibre. This confocal geometry ensures the 

collection of light only from the central part of the laser spot, where the optical excitation rate be 

maximal and approximately uniform. The collect light be then detect by an avalanche photo

FIG. S1: Experimental setup. (a) Schematic description. The fast function generator, drive the 

AOM and the MW switch, allows for the implementation of the two-stroke engine. Using slow 

amplitude modulation of the MW and lock-in detection allows for direct measurement of the net 

change in fluorescence induced by the operation of the engine. (b) A photograph show the 

diamond sample on the MW waveguide between the two magnets. The diamond be glow red 

while the green illumination be on. 

To efficiently detect the change in fluorescence due to the operation of the engine, that is, due to 

the MW driving, lock-in detection be used, where the output of the MW generator be amplitude- 

modulate by a ∼100 Hz square wave, much slow than the repetition rate of the engine, and a 

13 



lock-in amplifier be lock to this slow modulation. 

S3. SPECTROSCOPY AND CALIBRATIONS 

First, the distance between the magnets, a well a their mean position with respect to the 

sample be adjusted, such that the resonance frequency be 2π · 2600 MHz. During this process, 

we observe an anti-crossing between |0〉 and |−1〉. The angle of the magnetic field be adjust 

to minimise the gap at the anti-crossing point, from which we be able to infer the field angle 

relative to the NV axis. In our case, the angle be determine to be 0.6◦. The transition be found 

to be inhomogeneously broaden with minimal full-width at half maximum of 2π · (7± 0.7) 

MHz, determine by a Gaussian fit. This implies a maximal ensemble coherence time (1/e) of 

75 ± 7.5 ns. This be also confirm by directly measure the decoherence time use Ramsay 

interferometry, which yield a similar result. Then, by measure the change in fluorescence a a 

function of the MW pulse length, the Rabi-frequency be measure for different MW intensities. 

It be found that the ratio between the Rabi frequency and the square root of the apply MW 

power (after the amplifier) be 2π · (244± 2) kHz/ 
√ 

mW. The maximum MW power available 

after the amplifier be 3000 mW. 

To determine the dependence of the optical excitation rate, Γ, on the laser power in our set-up, 

we scan the laser power whilst measure the total fluorescence. As can be see in Fig. S2, one 

obtains a curve which be linear for small laser powers, but then deviate from linear dependence. 

We use a rate equation model (see Sec. S4 below) to fit to the data use the ratio between the laser 

power and Γ a a fitting parameter (together with the overall coefficient for the fluorescence). All 

the other parameter be know from previous, independent measurements30. The obtain ratio 

between Γ and the laser power measure before the objective lens be r = 436±25 kHz/mW. Note 

that this number depends on the position in the sample of the focus of the beam, most probably 

due to absorption in the sample. The maximum optical power available (as measure before the 

objective lens) be 4.0 mW. One can compare this result with a simple calculation use the know 

absorption cross-section of an NV− centre at 532 nm (ς = (3.1±0.8)×10−17 cm231), r = ς/(AεL), 

where A be the laser spot area and εL be the energy of one laser photon. When take into account 

the measure transmission of the objective lens (81%), the Fresnel transmission of the diamond 

14 



surface (83%), and absorption due to propagation to the middle of the sample through a dense 

ensemble of 1018 cm−3 NV− center (45% transmission), one find that the focal spot diameter 

that yield the measure value of r be 2.7 ± 0.4 µm, in good agreement with the nominal value 

of 2.2 µm predict for a perfect 0.29 NA objective lens. The small discrepancy might be due 

to deviation of the exact position of the focal spot or the exact NV− density from the estimate 

value use above, or due to aberrations. 

FIG. S2: Measured (symbols) and fit (red line) fluorescence saturation curves. Using the rate 

equation model described in Sec. S4, the ratio between the optical excitation rate, Γ, on the light 

intensity, Ilaser, be determined. The green line be the tangent at zero laser intensity, show that 

the saturation curve significantly deviate from linear behaviour. 

S4. RATE EQUATION MODEL 

The spin-state-dependent fluorescence intensity exhibit by NV− centres25 be a part of our 

initial motivation for use NV− centre to implement a quantum heat engine. In this section we 

show how this property, quantify use a rate equation model, allows u to take all the measure- 

ments require for the experiment. 

The fluorescence spectrum for the optical excitation intensity use in this experiment con- 

tained less than 1% neutral NV (NV0) emission. Furthermore, the charge rate for these excita- 

tion intensity be expect to be on the order of ∼ 1µs32, longer than all the other characteristic 

time in the system (see below). We therefore neglect optical charge effect (transitions from 

15 



NV− to NV0 and back), and focus on the dynamic within the NV− states. 

The NV− centre consists of a ground state spin triplet, denote by 3A2, two excite spin triplets, 
3E, a well a three intermediate singlets, 1E1,2 and 1A. Of the various interaction that lift the 

degeneracy of the sub-levels in the ground and excite states, orbital average at room temperature 

result in only the axial spin-spin interaction remaining33; this allows u to treat the two excite 

state triplet a a single triplet. Additionally, the upper of the three singlets, 1A1, decay directly 

into the low pair, 1E, and have so short a lifetime (< 1 ns) a to allow u to treat the three singlet 

a an effective single state . A diagram of this structure, together with the allow transition be 

show in Fig. S3.

S5. EMULATION OF A THERMAL ACTION 

We now show that the optical cycle in the NV− centre do indeed emulate a thermal interaction. 

The intuitive idea be that the optical cycle transfer population from |±1〉 to |0〉 in the ground state 

manifold. We will formalise this and show precisely how to obtain the emulate action. The 

goal be to find a projection operator, P , on the set of population vectors, together with a reduce 

evolution operator L, which satisfies the requirement for a thermal evolution operator, such that 

the follow condition be satisfied: 

eLt (Pσ) = P 
( 
eMtσ 

) 
(S2) 

This condition be a statement that the thermal operator L should describe the time evolution of 

the reduce state, when the evolution of the whole system be generate by the optical matrix M . 

The approach we take be to treat our system a an effective 4 level system, consist of the ground 

state together with the singlet, σred = [ g0 , g1 , g−1 , s ], which be described by the projection, 

P =

0 0 1 0 0 0 0

 . 

This be a justifiable choice if we can find the operator L which satisfies the requirement for a 

thermal operator (Lij ≥ 0 for i 6= j, Lij ≤ 0 for i = j, and Lij ≤ Lji for i > j ) and Eq. S2 to a 

good approximation. This will be do through an eigen-analysis of the matrix M. Using Eq. S1, 

it can be show that M be give by, 

M =

Γ I3×3 − (γ I3×3 + V ) 03×1

 , 
where V be a diagonal matrix with the element of v on it diagonal. 

Finding the eigenvectors of M a a function of Γ be not feasible analytically, so instead we use 

perturbation theory. Ordinarily one might wish to expand about Γ = 0, however, this brings about 

the difficulty of deal with the degeneracy in the ground state, which be not lift by the first order 

20 



correction of degenerate perturbation theory. Instead we take the perturbative expansion about a 

value nearer the range that we use in the experiment, specifically Γ = 0.5 MHz. The zeroth order 

eigenvalue be give (in unit of MHz) by, 

λ(0) = [ 0.0 , −0.15 , −0.22 , −1.84 , −74.28 , −119.47 , −119.48 ]

We can split these eigenvectors (and their eigenvalues) into two group a follows: the first four 

eigenvectors be those which describe the change in the 3 ground state and the singlet and for 

which the component correspond to the excite state be at least an order of magnitude small 

than the other components; the other three eigenvectors have large component correspond to 

the excite state triplets. This partition also split the eigenvalue accord to their magnitude, 

with the last three at least an order of magnitude great than the first four. Note too that, if we 

restrict our attention to the ground state triplet together with the singlet, then the first four form 

a linearly independent set span these states. Therefore, if the system have little population in 

it excite states, the coefficient of the final three eigenvectors will be correspondingly small and 

we can write such a state in term of the first set of eigenvectors to a good approximation. By 

consider the first and second order perturbative corrections, it can be show that this be true for 

all Γ use in the experiment (|∆Γ| ≤ 0.5 MHz, where ∆Γ ≡ Γ− 0.5 MHz). We now return to the 

problem of find L. Consider Eq. S2 – note that this condition hold if the follow holds: 

[LP − PM ]σ = 0 

It be clearly not possible to find a L which satisfies this for all possible state σ; however give 

that the first four eigenstates span the possible state of our system to a good approximation, 

21 



we instead require that it hold on the subspace span by these states. We therefore require 

[LP − PM ]σi = 0 and so [L− λiI] (Pσi) = 0 for i = 1, 2, 3, 4, where σi (λi) be the ith eigenvec- 

tor (eigenvalue) of M . So we see that the condition can be satisfied exactly if we require that L 

would have eigenvectors {Pσi | i = 1, 2, 3, 4}with correspond eigenvalue {λi | i = 1, 2, 3, 4}. 

Since there be four eigenvector/eigenvalue pairs, this completely determines L. Performing the 

calculation one finds, 

L (Γ) = L0 + ∆ΓL1 +O 
( 
∆Γ2 

) 
, 

where, 

L0 =

The operator L generate in this way be very close to be population conserve for small Γ, 

but not exactly so, since some population can be transfer to the excite state manifold. Thus we 

simply calculate L a above, and then manually impose population conservation, modify it by 

the minimal amount require to obtain the thermal evolution L that we seek. 

We now consider what thermal reservoir and coupling this matrix corresponds to. First notice 

that all the coupling be between the ground state and the singlet, with no coupling between 

state within the ground state triplet. Also, because the energy difference between the ground state 

manifold and the singlet be much great than the difference within the ground state manifold, we 

can treat the effective temperature and couple between the |±1〉 state and the singlet a be the 

same. Further, by examine the ratio of the rates, we see that the effective temperature between 

the singlet and |0〉 be less than that between the singlet and |±1〉. So we be left with the picture in 

Fig. S6.

To demonstrate that this be a valid description, consider Fig. S8, which contains a plot of

We can see that the difference between the two description remains below 0.5% for the range 

of Γ under consideration. We can further consider how the performance of the engine (see Sec. S6) 

compare when described by the full optical matrix a oppose to the emulate thermal interaction. 

This be show in Fig. S9, and here too, the difference be very small within the parameter space 

use in the experiment.

S6. ENGINE PERFORMANCE CALCULATIONS 

The evolution of the engine in contact with thermal reservoir and an external field be govern 

by the Lindblad equation36–38,

{

, 

where HI be the interaction Hamiltonian which generates unitary evolution, and Ak describes the 

interaction with thermal baths. We can cast this into matrix operator form by vectorising the density 

matrix, ρ→ |ρ〉. 

~∂t |ρ〉 = H |ρ〉 ≡ (−iHw + L) |ρ〉 , 

Hw result from HI and be Hermitian, and L result from the remain term and be non- 

Hermitian. This formalism be know a the Liouville space (or superoperator) formalism. We 

can write L = Lcoh ⊕ Lpop, where Lpop (coh) be the restriction of L to the population (coherence) 

subspace. In our case, we can either take Lpop to be the full rate matrix M , or the effective thermal 

operator L derive in the previous section. We only have to consider the coherence ρ01 and ρ10 

(as the MW field only couple to the 0↔ 1 transition), so that Lcoh = −Γ I2×2. The restriction of 

Hw to the basis {ρ01, ρ10, ρ00, ρ11}, be give by, 

Hw (Ω, δ) =

where Ω be the Rabi frequency, and δ be the detuning of the MW radiation from resonance (resulting 

from the inhomogeneously broaden ensemble) . 

Let | ρ0(δ)〉 be the steady state for a give detuning. It be give by the normalise zero eigenstate 

of the unitary evolution operator for a full two-stroke cycle, 

U = e−iτthH2e−iτwH1 , 

25 



where H1 = Hw(Ω, δ), H2 = iL(Γ) + Hw (0, δ), τw be the work stroke duration, and τth be the 

thermal stroke duration. The work produce be then simply give by, 

W (δ) = 〈H0| e−iH1tw − I | ρ0 (δ)〉 , 

where |H0〉 be the vectorised system Hamiltonian (H0 = diag [0, ω10, ω12] and vectorising be 

achieve by reorganise the element of H0 into a column vector) and we have use the identity, 

〈O〉 = Tr (Oρ) = 〈O |ρ〉. The total average output power from the ensemble be then found by 

integrate this over the inhomogeneous distribution, N (δ), and divide by the cycle time, τcyc, 

〈P 〉 = 1 
τcyc 

∫ 
dδ W (δ)N (δ). 

The detuning distribution be deduce use a Gaussian fit to the measure MW spectrum. 

In the above treatment we neglect homogeneous dephasing. The main source of such a pro- 

ce in dense NV ensemble be spin-spin interaction between NV centre (and other paramagnetic 

impurities)39. Its timescale be give by39, T2 ≈ 1/αn, where α = µ0g2sµ2B/4π~ and n be the density 

of NV centres. Substituting n = 1018cm−3 give T2 ≈ 2 µs, which be great than the long cycle 

time use in this work (180 ns) and the inhomogeneous dephasing time due to the inhomogeneous 

energy distribution N (δ) (75 ns), allow u to safely neglect it. 

S7. DERIVATION OF THE STOCHASTIC BOUND 

The existence of a stochastic bound be derive in Ref. 10. Here we will present a brief 

overview of this derivation, together with a description of how the bound be calculate for our 

case. Such a bound must be independent of the state of a system and should also have no depen- 

dence on coherence in the system. As above we start by consider the work produce in a single 

cycle of the engine; however now with the coherence eliminate at the begin and end of the 

cycle, 

W = 〈H0| D 
( 
e−iHwtw − I 

) 
D | ρ0〉 , 

where D be a projection onto the population subspace (physically it represent a complete dephas- 

ing operation), and we include the detuning implicitly. It can be shown10 that when one expands 

26 



this expression for small actions, s� ~, one be left with, 

W = 
τ 2w 
8 
〈H0|H2w | ρpop〉+O 

[ 
(s/~)4 

] 
, 

where τw be the work stroke duration, and | ρpop〉 ≡ D | ρ0〉. At this point we can simply use the 

know form of our Hamiltonian to show that,

S8. LINKING THE FLUORESCENCE TO THE ENGINE WORK OUTPUT 

As before, let σ be the column vector whose element represent the population in the various 

level and let M be the optical matrix. Then give some rate, R(t), at which population be trans- 

ferred from the |0〉 to the |1〉 ground states, due to the microwave field, the equation describe the 

system is, 

∂tσ = Mσ +R(t)ν, (S3) 

where ν = (−1 1 0 · · · 0 0)T . The rate R be the quantity we wish to determine from the experimen- 

tally measure fluorescence. We proceed by consider how the inhomogeneous solution differs 

from the homogeneous solution (physically the difference between MW drive and no driving). 

Let Φ(t) be the fundamental matrix solution to the homogeneous version of Eq. S3 (that is, a 

matrix which satisfies (∂t −M)Φ = 0). Then it can be checked that the follow be a solution to 

27 



the inhomogeneous equation S3, 

σ(t) = Φ(t, 0)σ0 + 

∫ t 
0 

dτ Φ(t, τ)R(τ)ν, (S4) 

where Φ(t, τ) = Φ(t)Φ(τ)−1. Once past the transient period, one can take R(t) to be periodic with 

the same period, τcyc, a that of M(t), a the microwave be pulse at the same rate a the laser 

pulses. This follow quite generally from Floquet theory and physical considerations. To proceed 

we need to find the state at the start of the cycle, σ0 , during this steady state operation. Using the 

periodicity of the solution we have, 

σ0 = σ(τcyc) = Φ(τcyc, 0)σ0 + 

∫ τcyc 
0 

dτ Φ(τcyc, τ)R(τ)ν, 

and therefore, 

[I− Φ(τcyc, 0)]σ0 = 
∫ τcyc 

0 

dτΦ(τcyc, τ)R(τ)ν. (S5) 

We would like to solve for σ0, however the matrix on the left hand side be singular. Note that 

Φ(τcyc) be diagonalisable [it have an inverse: Φ(−τcyc)], which allows u to write (I− Φ(τcyc)) = 

UDU−1, where D be diagonal. We define the pseudo-inverse, (I− Φ(τcyc))− = UD−U † , where 

the diagonal matrix D− be give by: 

D−ii = 

1/Dii if Dii 6= 00 otherwise 
Let A = (I− Φ(τcyc))−. A solution to Eq. S5 be then give by: 

σ̃0 = A 
∫ τcyc 

0 

dτ Φ(τcyc, τ)R(τ)ν. 

The full space of solution to Eq. S3 be then generate by αρ0 + σ̃0 for α ∈ R, where ρ0 be the 

(unique) eigenvector of Φ(τcyc) with eigenvalue 1. We now show that 
∑ 

j [σ̃0]j = 0 : Suppose {ρi} 

be the eigenvectors of Φ(τcyc) with correspond eigenvalue {λi}. Then by virtue of Φ(τcyc) 

be population preserve we have, 

∑ 
j 

[Φ(τcyc)ρi]j = λi 
∑ 
j 

[ρi]j = 
∑ 
j 

[ρi]j , 

28 



which implies 
∑ 

[ρi]j = 0 for i ≥ 1. Then give a vector ω, 
∑ 

j ωj = 0 =⇒ ω ∈ 

span (ρ1, . . . , ρn). It be also clear that Im (A) ⊆ span (ρ1, . . . , ρn). The unique normalise so- 

lution, σ0, to Eq. S5 be therefore simply obtain by set α = 1 (assuming we have normalise 

ρ0). Substituting this back into Eq. S4, we have, 

σ(t) = Φ(t, 0)ρ0 + Φ(t, 0) A 
∫ τcyc 

0 

dτ R(τ)Φ(τcyc, τ)~ν + 

∫ t

dτ R(τ) Φ(t, τ)ν 

and therefore,

∫ τcyc 

0 

dτ R(τ)Φ(τcyc, τ)~ν + 

∫ t 
0 

dτ Φ(t, τ)R(τ)ν, 

where ρ(t) = Φ(t, 0)ρ0 be the state evolution when R = 0. We define the excite state population 

projector to be the vector ΩE = (0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0) , so that the fluorescence rate, F (t), from a state 

σ(t) be proportional to ΩE · σ(t), where ζ be the radiative decay rate. Denote the time dependent 

fluorescence in the presence of MW drive by F (t) and denote the fluorescence in the absence of 

MW drive by F0(t). Further define, 

g(t, τ) = ΩE · Φ(t, 0) A Φ(τcyc, τ) · ν and f(t, τ) = ΩE · Φ(t, τ) · ν. 

We can then write,[

duration and optical pump rate,H be constant to a good approximation (for the maximum stroke 

duration and optical intensity use in the experiment, the relative change of H over the interval be 

∼ 4× 10−4). This allows u to write,

S9. UNCERTAINTY ANALYSIS 

In examine expression S7 it be apparent that there be a number of contribution to the uncer- 

tainty in the final value of the power, 〈P 〉. There be measurement variation in the value 〈∆F 〉 from 

one measurement to the next, due to detector shot noise. The mean and standard error be simply 

calculate from a sample of individual measurements. The value for κ depends on the parameter 

list in table S1, together with the value calculate for Γ, which itself depends on the former 

parameters. We use a Monte-Carlo simulation to propagate the uncertainty in these parameters, 

and the calculate uncertainty for Γ, to a final uncertainty in κ. The error in the value for 〈F0〉 

be determine to be negligible (relative error < 1%) relative to the other error and therefore 

disregarded. Finally we also need to account for uncertainty in the value for the bound. This stem 

principally from the uncertainty in the value for the Rabi frequency. 

The quantity of interest be the certainty with which we can demonstrate Pmeasured−Pbound > 0. 

This require that we use a one side normal distribution. The null hypothesis be Pmeasured − 

Pbound ≤ 0, whilst the alternative hypothesis be that the measure power break the stochastic 

bound. In our case the test statistic for the null outcome be t = 2.4, which corresponds to a p- 

value of 0.0082. Thus we can discard our null hypothesis and adopt the alternative hypothesis, to 

a significance of < 1%.
