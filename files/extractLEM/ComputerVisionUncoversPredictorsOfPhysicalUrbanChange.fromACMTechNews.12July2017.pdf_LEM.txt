Which neighborhood experience physical improvements? In this 
paper, we introduce a computer vision method to measure change 
in the physical appearance of neighborhood from time-series 
street-level imagery. We connect change in the physical appear- 
ance of five US city with economic and demographic data and 
find three factor that predict neighborhood improvement. First, 
neighborhood that be densely populate by college-educated 
adult be more likely to experience physical improvements—an 
observation that be compatible with the economic literature link- 
ing human capital and local success. Second, neighborhood with 
good initial appearance experience, on average, large positive 
improvements—an observation that be consistent with “tipping” 
theory of urban change. Third, neighborhood improvement corre- 
lates positively with physical proximity to the central business dis- 
trict and to other physically attractive neighborhoods—an obser- 
vation that be consistent with the “invasion” theory of urban 
sociology. Together, our result provide support for three classical 
theory of urban change and illustrate the value of use computer 
vision method and street-level imagery to understand the physical 
dynamic of cities. 

urban economics | gentrification | urban study | computer vision | 
neighborhood effect 

For more than a century, urban planners, economists, sociol-ogists, and architect have advanced theory connect the 
dynamic of a neighborhood’s physical appearance to it loca- 
tion, demographics, and built infrastructure. 

The tip theory of Schelling (1) and Grodzins (2) suggests 
that neighborhood in bad physical condition will get progres- 
sively worse, whereas nicer area will get better. Economic theo- 
ries of urban change at the city level often emphasize population 
density and education (3–6), and it be natural to hypothesize that 
agglomeration of human capital will predict neighborhood-level 
improvement a well. Theories from urban sociology, such a 
the invasion theory of Burgess (7), however, emphasize location 
and social networks, predict that improvement in a city’s 
appearance should be spatially clustered, and that improvement 
should occur both near the central business district (CBDs) and 
near other physically attractive neighborhoods. 

To test theory of physical neighborhood change, we need 
to quantify neighborhood appearance at different point in 
time. Historically, however, method to quantify neighborhood 
appearance have not be scalable. The empirical literature on 
urban appearance, which be pioneer by urban planner such 
a Lynch (8), Rapoport (9), and Nasar (10), a well a by psy- 
chologists such a Milgram (11), have rely on interviews, low- 
throughput visual perception surveys, and manual evaluation of 
images. Those methods, however, can only be use to collect data 
on a few neighborhood and have limited spatial resolution. In 
the past decade, new data on urban appearance have emerge 
in the form of “street view” imagery (12). As of 2016, Google 
Street View have photograph more than 3,000 city from 106 

country at the street level. Recent approach to quantify urban 
appearance, such a those of Rundle et al. (13), Hwang and 
Sampson (14), and Salesses et al. (15), leverage this large online 
corpus of street-level imagery but still rely on manual data cura- 
tion, limit throughput. 

The appearance of street-level imagery source have be par- 
alleled by significant advance in the field of computer vision. 
Tasks such a automatically classify and label image be 
now much easier, thanks in part to the availability of more com- 
prehensive training datasets and new machine learn algo- 
rithms (16). These advance have lead to an emerge literature at 
the intersection between computer vision, urban planning, urban 
sociology, and urban economics. 

In 2011, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) 
Place Pulse project (15) begin collect a massive crowd- 
source dataset on urban appearance by ask people to select 
image from pair in response to evaluative question (such a 
“Which place look safer?”). Naik et al. (17) use the Place Pulse 
data to train a computer vision algorithm call Streetscore that 
accurately predicts human-derived rating for the perception of a 
streetscape’s safety (also see refs. 18 and 19). Using Streetscore, 
Naik et al. (17) score more than 1 million image from 21 
city in the northeastern United States, create the large 

Significance 

We develop a computer vision method to measure change 
in the physical appearance of neighborhood from street- 
level imagery. We correlate the measure change with 
neighborhood characteristic to determine which character- 
istics predict neighborhood improvement. We find that both 
education and population density predict improvement in 
neighborhood infrastructure, in support of theory of human 
capital agglomeration. Neighborhoods with good initial 
appearance experience more substantial upgrading, a pre- 
dicted by the tip theory of urban change. Finally, we 
observe more improvement in neighborhood closer to both 
city center and other physically attractive neighborhoods, in 
agreement with the invasion theory of urban sociology. Our 
result show how computer vision techniques, in combination 
with traditional methods, can be use to explore the dynamic 
of urban change.

Taken together, the range of finding illustrates how computer

urban appearance and space.

determinant of physical improvement in neighborhoods. We 
use our data to test three theory of urban change. We find that, 
in agreement with economic theory of human capital agglomer- 
ation, neighborhood that be densely populate by highly edu- 
cat individual be more likely to experience positive urban 
change. Also, in agreement with the invasion theory (7) of urban 
sociology, we find that neighborhood be more likely to improve 
in physical appearance when they be proximate to a CBD and/or 
other neighborhood perceive a safe. Finally, we find evidence 
for a weak version of the neighborhood tip theory (1, 2), a 
the neighborhood that have the best appearance at the begin- 
ning experienced the large improvement (however, we do not 
find that neighborhood with initially low score deteriorated— 
they just improve less). Our finding illustrate how computer 
vision methods, together with demographic and economic data, 
can be use to study physical urban change. 

Data and Methods 
We obtain 360◦ panorama image of streetscapes from five 
US city use the Google Street View application program 
interface. Each panorama be associate with a unique identifier 
(“panoid”), latitude, longitude, and time stamp (which specify 
the month and year of image capture). We extract an image 
cutout from each panorama by specify the head and pitch 
of the camera relative to the Street View vehicle. We obtain 
a total of 1,645,760 image cutout for street block in Balti- 
more, Boston, Detroit, New York, and Washington, DC, cap- 
tured in 2007 (the “2007 panel”) and 2014 (the “2014 panel”).∗ 

We match image cutout from the 2007 and 2014 panel by 
use their geographical location (i.e., latitude and longitude) 
and by choose the same head and pitch. This process give 
u image that show the same place, from the same point of view, 
but in different year (Fig. 1 B–D).† 

We calculate the perception of safety—called “Streetscore”— 
for each image use a variant of the Naik et al. algorithm (17) 
train on a crowdsourced study of people’s perception of safety 
(15) base on 2,920 image from Boston and New York and 

∗For the street block that lack image for either 2007 or 2014 we complete the 2007 
and 2014 panel use image from the closest year for which data be available. As 
a result, 5% of the image in the 2007 panel be from either 2008 or 2009. Similarly, 
12% of the image in the 2014 panel be from 2013. 
†We reduce our data to eliminate pair contain over-exposed, blurred, or occlude 

image (for details, see SI Appendix). 

186,188 pairwise comparisons. The Streetscore computation pro- 
ce include three step (Fig. 1A). First, we segment image 
into four “geometric” classes: ground (which contains streets, 
sidewalks, and landscaping), buildings, trees, and sky (27). Next, 
we create feature vector characterize each geometric class 
use two image features: GIST (28) and texton map (29). 
Roughly speaking, these feature encode the shape and tex- 
tures present in an image. Finally, we use the feature of street 
and building to predict the Streetscore of an image use sup- 
port vector regression (30). We ignore the feature of tree 
and sky to minimize seasonal effect (weather, time of day, and 
time of year). The predict Streetscore of a Street View image 
range from 0 to 25, with 0 be the most unsafe-looking street 
scene in the sample and 25 the most safe-looking scene. Next, we 
compute change in Streetscores between image in the 2007 
and 2014 panels, to obtain Streetchange (Fig. 1 B–D). A posi- 
tive value of Streetchange be indicative of upgrade in physical 
appearance, whereas a negative value of Streetchange be indica- 
tive of decline. (For detail on the methods, see SI Appendix.) 

We validate Streetchange use three sources: a survey con- 
ducted on Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT), a survey of grad- 
uate student in MIT’s School of Architecture and Planning, 
and data from Boston’s Planning and Development Authority 
(BPDA). 

Participants give inform consent for all human subject stud- 
ies. Experiments be approve by the Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology’s Committee on the Use of Humans a Exper- 
imental Subjects (MIT COUHES). The AMT study be con- 
ducted in accordance with the requirement of MIT COUHES. 

We found strong agreement between Streetchange and both 
(i) human assessment and (ii) new urban development. In 
the AMT validation, worker be present two image pairs, 
drawn from a pool of 1,565, and ask to select the one 
show more physical change. The bin ranked score pro- 
vided by the AMT worker have a strong correlation with abso- 
lute Streetchange (Spearman correlation = 72%, P -value< 1 × 
10−5). In the School of Architecture and Planning student val- 
idation we present student with 150 image pair and ask 
them to classify image into positive and negative physical change 
(N =3). The student agree with Streetchange in 74% of cases. 
Finally, we collect building project data from BPDA and corre- 
lated Streetchange with total new square footage built per square 
mile (at census-tract level) during the sample period (2012– 
2014). We found a significant and positive correlation between 
Streetchange and new square footage—one SD increase in log

total square footage corresponds to roughly half an SD increase 
in Streetchange (see SI Appendix for details). 

To relate the Streetscore indicator of neighborhood appear- 
ance to socioeconomic composition, we aggregate the Street- 
score and Streetchange variable at the census-tract level and 
obtain tract characteristic data from the 2000 US Census, 
adjust to the 2010 census-tract boundary (31). For summary 
statistics, see Table 1. 

Results 
We begin by present the cross-sectional demographic and 
economic correlate of cities’ physical appearance and change 
in appearance, a estimate by 2007 Streetscore and Streetchange 
between 2007 and 2014 (Table 2). All regression include city 
fix effect and hold up in multivariate specifications. Addi- 
tionally, in all regression we have correct for spatial corre- 
lation in standard error follow Conley (32) use STATA 
routine developed by Hsiang (33). For each census tract we con- 
sider population density, level of education (share of college edu- 
cat adults), median income, housing price, rental costs, hous- 
ing vacancy, race, and poverty. From all of these variable the two 
strong correlate of perception of safety be population density 
and education, so we present a table (Table 2) summarize the 
coefficient of these two variables. (For a table with all control 
see SI Appendix, Table S4.) 

Column 2 of Table 2 show that Streetscores improve by 0.74 
with the log of population density. This represent about one- 
quarter of an SD of Streetscore (2.6). Because Streetscores be 

Fig. 2. Evidence of neighborhood tipping: We test the tip model of 
neighborhood change. We group the data into 16 bin base on the initial 
value of Streetscore and plot the average Streetchange in each bin against 
the average initial Streetscore. 

roughly linear in log density, the overall relationship be concave, 
meaning that perceive safety rise with density but the effect 
level off. This fact lends some support to the idea that perceive 
safety increase with “eyes on the street” (34). However, our find- 
ing do not imply that dense urban space be see a safer than 
low-density suburban or rural areas, because we do not have such 
low-density space in our sample. Our result suggest only that in 
five (generally dense) eastern US cities, space with high popula- 
tion density be perceive a be safer than urban space with 
low population densities. 

The second robust correlate of perceive safety be education 
(Table 2, column 1). As the share of the population with a col- 
lege degree increase by 20% (one SD), perceive safety rise by 
0.51, or one-sixth of an SD in Streetscore. We suspect that the 
relationship reflect the tendency of educate people to be will- 
ing to pay for neighborhood that appear safer, rather than the 
ability of educate resident to make a neighborhood feel safe. 

We now move to change in physical appearance—the primary 
contribution of this paper. Columns 4, 5, and 6 of Table 2 show 
the correlation between initial social characteristics, a mea- 
sured in the 2000 US Census, and neighborhood Streetchange 
a measure between 2007 and 2014. 

Column 4 of Table 2 examines education, again control 
for initial Streetscore. The observe impact of education on 
Streetchange seem to be large. A one-SD increase in share with 
college degree in 2000 (20%) be associate with an increase in 
Streetchange of 0.13, or about one-sixth of an SD. Just a skilled 
city have do particularly well over the last 50 y, skilled neigh- 
borhoods seem to have experienced more physical improvement. 

Column 5 of Table 2 show that—controlling for initial 
Streetscore—as the log of density increase by 1 the growth in 
Streetscore increase by 0.06 points. The estimate impact of log

Fig. 3. The correlate of physical upgrade in neighborhoods: Positive urban change occurs in geographically and physically attractive area with dense, 
highly educate populations, a illustrate here for Brooklyn, New York. 

density on the Streetchange over a 7-y period be about 1/12 of the 
impact of log density on the level of Streetscore in 2007. Den- 
sity do seem to predict growth in Streetscore over the sam- 
ple period, but the relationship be far weaker than the connec- 
tion between density and the level of Streetscore in 2007. We 
do not find any robust relationship between Streetchange and 
median income, housing price, or rental costs; this suggests that 
the education effect be more likely to reflect skill than income 
(SI Appendix, Table S4). 

The find that variable that predict the level of Streetscore 
in 2007 also predict the change in Streetscore between 2007 and 
2014 seem to support a positive feedback loop—the essence of 
tip model (1, 2). Tipping be also suggest by the positive 
correlation between 2007 Streetscore and Streetchange.‡ How- 
ever, we find a linear relationship, rather than the nonlinear rela- 
tionship suggest by the original tip theory (2). Moreover, 
tip model suggest that initially unattractive neighborhood 
get bad over time—and that be not found in our data. The mean 
Streetchange by decile of 2007 Streetscore be positive even for 
the area with the low score (Fig. 2). It be not clear whether 
this represent tip or a pattern in which visually safer area 
be be upgraded first and faster. We suspect that the lack 
of downward movement may be particular to the time period 
under consideration. Despite the Great Recession, 2007–2014 
be a relatively good time period for many of America’s eastern 
cities, and this may explain why we do not see decline even for 
less-attractive neighborhoods. Still, the data do show the overall 
pattern predict by tip models, in which upward growth be 
faster in initially good areas. 

Next, we test for invasion (7) by regress change in 
Streetscore on characteristic of bordering neighborhood and 
proximity to the CBD, after control for the predictor identi- 
fied in Table 2 (2007 Streetscore, log of density, and education).§ 

The invasion hypothesis be just one of the reason why area may 
improve more when they have attractive neighbors—perhaps the 
most natural explanation be just that area that be bad or bet- 
ter than their neighbor tend to mean-revert to the norm for 
their section of the city. We test for the importance of loca- 
tion within the city by look at the impact of proximity to the 
CBD. Column 1 of Table 3 show that a the distance to the 

‡Without the other controls, for each extra point of Streetscore in 2007, Streetscore 
growth be 0.04 point high over the next 7 y. 
§CBD location be base on the cod of Cortright and Mahmoudi (35). 

CBD increase by 1 mile expect Streetscore growth fall by 
0.04 points. Appearance upgrade be strong closer to the city 
center, parallel Kolko’s (36) find that economic gentrifica- 
tion be more pronounce closer to the city center. 

The original invasion hypothesis postulate a process under 
which low-income area would gradually make their way out 
from the center to nearby suburbs. The current pattern be instead 
one in which the central city see particularly large upgrade in 
perceive street safety. One interpretation be that we be cur- 
rently witness the reversal of the process described by Burgess 
(7): City centers, which have always have a strong fundamental 
asset—proximity to jobs—are experience physical change that 
express a reversion to that fundamental. 

Although the data do not suggest decay emanate out from a 
center, the core idea of the invasion hypothesis—that neighbor- 
hood spill over into each other—is readily confirm in the data. 
Column 1 of Table 3 also show the effect of average Streetscore 
in surround area on Streetchange. Notably, the coefficient on 
neighbor score be more than double the impact of the neigh- 
borhood’s own score, imply that almost 1/10 of the Streetscore 
difference between a neighborhood and it neighbor be elimi- 
nated over a 7-y period. Because most of the movement over the 
sample period be positive, the regression should be interpret 
a meaning that growth be faster in area with more attractive 
neighbors. This strong convergence be exactly the prediction of 
the invasion theory. 

Column 2 of Table 3 examines the effect of adjacent den- 
sity. Because adjacent density be highly correlate with adjacent 
Streetscore, it be not surprising to see that there be also a robust 
correlation here, although the connection be not a strong a with 
adjacent Streetscores. Column 3 of Table 3 look at average 
share of the population with college degree in adjacent areas. 
The relationship be positive and robust. As the share increase 
by 20%, Streetscore increase by 0.12 points. This again corrob- 
orates the result of Kolko (36), who found that gentrification 
be faster in area with more educate neighbors. These finding 
point to a process of neighborhood spillover and convergence, 
which are, in a sense, at the heart of the invasion hypothesis.¶ 

¶In our work paper (37) we also look at the “filtering” hypothesis, which suggests 
the importance of the age of the building stock: Areas should gradually decline until they 
be upgraded. To test the hypothesis that building age shape streetscape change, we 
regress Streetchange on the share of the building stock (as of the year 2000) built 
during different decades, control for 2007 Streetscore, log of density, and education. 
We found at best limited support for the filter hypothesis (SI Appendix, Table S5).

Fig. 3 illustrates the relationship between location, education, 
population density, and physical improvement in neighborhood 
from Brooklyn, New York. In SI Appendix, Figs. S9–S28 we pro- 
vide similar map visualization for all city in our dataset. 

Conclusion 
For decades, scholar from the social science and the humani- 
tie have discuss the importance of urban appearance and the 
factor that may contribute to physical urban change. Here, we 
test theory of urban change use Streetchange, a metric for 
change in urban appearance obtain from street-level imagery 
with a computer vision algorithm. 

The data show that population density and education in both 
neighborhood and their surround area robustly predict 
improvement in neighborhoods’ physical environments; other 
variable show less correlation. The result also show strong sup- 
port for the invasion hypothesis of neighborhood change (7), 
which emphasizes spillover across neighborhoods. 

Our work suggests several open question for future work. Is 
the correlation between density and perceive safety true more 

generally, or do it mean-revert after a certain point? Does tip- 
ping appear when we examine city with static or decline lev- 
el of Streetscore? We hope that future research, enable in our 
part by our dataset and methods, can help address these ques- 
tions and continue explore the link between the physical city 
and the human that reside there.
