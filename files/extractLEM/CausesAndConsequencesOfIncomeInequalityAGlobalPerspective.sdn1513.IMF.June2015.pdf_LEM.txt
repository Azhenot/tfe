EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

“We should measure the health of our society not at it apex, but at it base.” Andrew Jackson 

Widening income inequality be the define challenge of our time. In advanced economies, the gap 
between the rich and poor be at it high level in decades. Inequality trend have be more mixed 
in emerge market and develop country (EMDCs), with some country experience decline 
inequality, but pervasive inequity in access to education, health care, and finance remain. Not 
surprisingly then, the extent of inequality, it drivers, and what to do about it have become some of 
the most hotly debate issue by policymakers and researcher alike. Against this background, the 
objective of this paper be two-fold. 

First, we show why policymakers need to focus on the poor and the middle class. Earlier IMF work 
have show that income inequality matter for growth and it sustainability. Our analysis suggests 
that the income distribution itself matter for growth a well. Specifically, if the income share of the 
top 20 percent (the rich) increases, then GDP growth actually decline over the medium term, 
suggest that the benefit do not trickle down. In contrast, an increase in the income share of the 
bottom 20 percent (the poor) be associate with high GDP growth. The poor and the middle class 
matter the most for growth via a number of interrelate economic, social, and political channels. 

Second, we investigate what explains the divergent trend in inequality development across 
advanced economy and EMDCs, with a particular focus on the poor and the middle class. While 
most exist study have focus on advanced country and look at the driver of the Gini 
coefficient and the income of the rich, this study explores a more diverse group of country and 
pay particular attention to the income share of the poor and the middle class—the main engine 
of growth. Our analysis suggests that 

 Technological progress and the result rise in the skill premium (positives for growth and 
productivity) and the decline of some labor market institution have contribute to inequality in 
both advanced economy and EMDCs. Globalization have played a small but reinforce role. 
Interestingly, we find that rise skill premium be associate with widen income disparity in 
advanced countries, while financial deepen be associate with rise inequality in EMDCs, 
suggest scope for policy that promote financial inclusion. 

 Policies that focus on the poor and the middle class can mitigate inequality. Irrespective of the 
level of economic development, good access to education and health care and well-targeted 
social policies, while ensure that labor market institution do not excessively penalize the poor, 
can help raise the income share for the poor and the middle class. 

 There be no one-size-fits-all approach to tackle inequality. The nature of appropriate policy 
depends on the underlie driver and country-specific policy and institutional settings. In 
advanced economies, policy should focus on reform to increase human capital and skills, 
couple with make tax system more progressive. In EMDCs, ensure financial deepen be 
accompany with great financial inclusion and create incentive for lower informality 
would be important. More generally, complementarity between growth and income equality 
objective suggest that policy aim at raise average living standard can also influence the 
distribution of income and ensure a more inclusive prosperity. 



INEQUALITY: CAUSES AND CONSEQUENCES 

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 5 

I. CONTEXT 
1. Rising inequality be a widespread concern. Inequality within most advanced and emerge 
market and develop country (EMDCs) have increased, a phenomenon that have receive 
considerable attention—President Obama call widen income inequality the “defining challenge 
of our time.” A recent Pew Research Center (PRC 2014) survey found that the gap between the rich 
and the poor be consider a major challenge by more than 60 percent of respondent worldwide, 
and Pope Francis have spoken out against the “economy of exclusion.” Indeed, the PRC survey found 
that while education and work hard be see a important for get ahead, know the right 
person and belonging to a wealthy family be also critical, suggest potential major hurdle to 
social mobility. Not surprisingly then, the extent of inequality, it drivers, and what to do about it 
have become some of the most hotly debate issue by policymakers and researcher alike. 

2. Why it matters. Equality, like fairness, be an important value in most societies. Irrespective of 
ideology, culture, and religion, people care about inequality. Inequality can be a signal of lack of 
income mobility and opportunity―a reflection of persistent disadvantage for particular segment of 
the society. Widening inequality also have significant implication for growth and macroeconomic 
stability, it can concentrate political and decision make power in the hand of a few, lead to a 
suboptimal use of human resources, cause investment-reducing political and economic instability, 
and raise crisis risk. The economic and social fallout from the global financial crisis and the resultant 
headwind to global growth and employment have heighten the attention to rise income 
inequality. 

3. This note. The objective of the note be two-fold. First, it show why policymakers need to 
focus on the poor and the middle class. Building on early IMF work which have show that income 
inequality matter for growth, we show that the income distribution itself matter for growth a well. 
In particular, our finding suggest that raise the income share of the poor and ensure that there 
be no hollowing-out of the middle class be good for growth through a number of interrelate 
economic, social, and political channels. Second, we investigate what explains the divergent trend in 
inequality development across advanced economy and EMDCs, with a particular focus on the 
poor and the middle class. In that context, we be fill a gap in the literature since exist study 
typically focus only on advanced economy or a small sample of EMDCs. This approach allows u 
to suggest policy implication depend on the underlie drivers, and country-specific policy and 
institutional settings. 

4. Roadmap. Section II provide an overview of the macroeconomic implication of high 
inequality of outcome and opportunity and show why policymakers’ focus on the income share 
of poor and the middle class can prove growth-enhancing. Section III provide a rich documentation 
of recent trend in both monetary and nonmonetary indicator of inequality across advanced 
economy and EMDCs, while Section IV investigates the driver of the rise in inequality, include 
from an empirical perspective. Section V concludes and discus policy implications.

II. MACROECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES: WHY WE CARE 
5. Outcomes and opportunities. The discourse on inequality often make a distinction 
between inequality of outcome (as measure by income, wealth, or expenditure) and inequality of 
opportunities―attributed to difference in circumstance beyond the individual’s control, such a 
gender, ethnicity, location of birth, or family background. Inequality of outcome arises from a 
combination of difference in opportunity and individual’s effort and talent. At the same time, it be 
not easy to separate effort from opportunity, especially in an intergenerational context. For instance, 
parental income, result from their own effort, determines the opportunity of their child to 
obtain an education. It be in this spirit that Rawls (1971) argue that the distribution of opportunity 
and of outcome be equally important and informative to understand the nature and extent of 
inequality around the world. 

6. Is inequality a necessary evil? Some degree of inequality may not be a problem insofar a 
it provide the incentive for people to excel, compete, save, and invest to move ahead in life. For 
example, return to education and differentiation in labor earnings can spur human capital 
accumulation and economic growth, despite be associate with high income inequality. 
Inequality can also influence growth positively by provide incentive for innovation and 
entrepreneurship (Lazear and Rosen 1981), and, perhaps especially relevant for develop 
countries, by allow at least a few individual to accumulate the minimum need to start 
business and get a good education (Barro 2000). 

7. Why be rise inequality a concern? High and sustain level of inequality, especially 
inequality of opportunity can entail large social costs. Entrenched inequality of outcome can 
significantly undermine individuals’ educational and occupational choices. Further, inequality of 
outcome do not generate the “right” incentive if it rest on rent (Stiglitz 2012). In that event, 
individual have an incentive to divert their effort toward secure favor treatment and 
protection, result in resource misallocation, corruption, and nepotism, with attendant adverse 
social and economic consequences. In particular, citizen can lose confidence in institutions, erode 
social cohesion and confidence in the future. 

8. Income distribution matter for growth. Previous IMF study have found that income 
inequality (as measure by the Gini coefficient, which be 0 when everybody have the same income and 
1 when one person have all the income) negatively affect growth and it sustainability (Ostry, Berg, 
and Tsangarides 2014; Berg and Ostry 2011). We build on this analysis by examine how 
individuals’ income share at various point in the distribution matter for growth draw on a large 
sample of advanced economy and EMDCs (Table 1).2 A high net Gini coefficient (a measure of 


2 This analysis be base on a sample of 159 advanced, emerging, and develop economy for the period 1980– 
2012 use a simple growth model (with time and country fix effects) in which growth depends on initial income 
(convergence hypothesis), lag GDP growth, and inequality (as measure by net Gini or the income share 
accrue to various quintiles) estimate use system GMM. Augmenting this model with standard growth 
determinants, such a human and physical capital, do not affect our main findings. See Annex for data sources.

inequality that net out tax and transfers) be associate with low output growth over the medium 
term, consistent with previous findings. More importantly, we find an inverse relationship between 
the income share accrue to the rich (top 20 percent) and economic growth. If the income share of 
the top 20 percent increase by 1 percentage point, GDP growth be actually 0.08 percentage point 
low in the follow five years, suggest that the benefit do not trickle down. Instead, a similar 
increase in the income share of the bottom 20 percent (the poor) be associate with 0.38 percentage 
point high growth. This positive relationship between disposable income share and high growth 
continue to hold for the second and third quintiles (the middle class). This result survives a variety 
of robustness checks, and be in line with recent finding for a small sample of advanced economy 
(OECD 2014). In the remainder of this section, we discus potential channel for why high income 
share for the poor and the middle class be growth-enhancing.

9. Inequality affect growth drivers. 
Why would widen income disparity matter 
for growth? Higher inequality lower growth by 
deprive the ability of lower-income 
household to stay healthy and accumulate 
physical and human capital (Galor and Moav 
2004; Aghion, Caroli, and Garcia-Penalosa 
1999). For instance, it can lead to under- 
investment in education a poor child end 
up in lower-quality school and be less able to 
go on to college.3 As a result, labor productivity 
could be low than it would have be in a 
more equitable world (Stiglitz 2012). In the 
same vein, Corak (2013) find that country 
with high level of income inequality tend to 
have low level of mobility between 
generations, with parent’s earnings be a more important determinant of children’s earnings 
(Figure 1). Increasing concentration of income could also reduce aggregate demand and 
undermine growth, because the wealthy spend a low fraction of their income than middle- and 
lower-income groups.4 

10. Inequality dampens investment, and hence growth, by fuel economic, financial, and 
political instability. 

 Financial crises. A grow body of evidence suggests that rise influence of the rich and 
stagnant income of the poor and middle class have a causal effect on crises, and thus directly 
hurt short- and long-term growth.5 In particular, study have argue that a prolong period of 
high inequality in advanced economy be associate with the global financial crisis by 
intensify leverage, overextension of credit, and a relaxation in mortgage-underwriting 
standard (Rajan 2010), and allow lobbyist to push for financial deregulation (Acemoglu 
2011). 

 Global imbalances. Higher top income share couple with financial liberalization, which itself 
could be a policy response to rise income inequality, be associate with substantially large 


3 Widening income disparity can depress skill development among individual with poorer parental education 
background, both in term of the quantity of education attain (for example, year of schooling) and it quality (that 
is, skill proficiency). Educational outcome of individual from richer backgrounds, however, be not affected by 
inequality (Cingano 2014). 
4 See Carvalho and Rezai (2014) for a discussion of the empirical and theoretical underpinnings of this assertion. 
5 In a theoretical setting, Kumhof and Ranciere (2010) and Kumhof and others (2012) show that rise inequality 
enables investor to increase their hold of financial asset back by loan to workers, result in rise debt-to- 
income ratio and thus financial fragility. The latter can eventually lead to a financial crisis.

external deficit (Kumholf and others 2012). Such large global imbalance can be challenge for 
macroeconomic and/or financial stability, and thus growth (Bernanke 2011). 

 Conflicts. Extreme inequality may damage trust and social cohesion and thus be also associate 
with conflicts, which discourage investment. Conflicts be particularly prevalent in the 
management of common resource where, for example, inequality make resolve dispute 
more difficult; see, for example, Bardhan (2005). More broadly, inequality affect the economics 
of conflict, a it may intensify the grievance felt by certain group or can reduce the 
opportunity cost of initiate and join a violent conflict (Lichbach 1989). 

11. Inequality can lead to policy that hurt growth. In addition to affect growth drivers, 
inequality could result in poor public policy choices. For example, it can lead to a backlash against 
growth-enhancing economic liberalization and fuel protectionist pressure against globalization and 
market-oriented reform (Claessens and Perotti 2007). At the same time, enhance power by the 
elite could result in a more limited provision of public good that boost productivity and growth, 
and which disproportionately benefit the poor (Putnam 2000; Bourguignon and Dessus 2009). 

12. Inequality hamper poverty reduction. Income inequality affect the pace at which growth 
enables poverty reduction (Ravallion 2004). Growth be less efficient in lower poverty in country 
with high initial level of inequality or in which the distributional pattern of growth favor the non- 
poor. Moreover, to the extent that economy be periodically subject to shock of various kind that 
undermine growth, high inequality make a great proportion of the population vulnerable to 
poverty. 

III. STYLIZED FACTS: WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT 
INEQUALITY OF OUTCOMES AND OPPORTUNITIES? 
13. Measuring inequality. Income inequality—the most widely cite measure of inequality of 
outcomes—is typically measure by the market (gross) and net (after tax and transfer from social 
insurance programs) Gini, and by track change in the income share of the population (for 
example, by decile/quintile). Information on the asset held by the wealthy offer a 
complementary perspective on monetary inequality. Inequality of opportunity be often measure 
by track health, education and human development outcome by income group, or by examine 
access to basic service and opportunities. In this section, we document recent trend in both 
monetary and nonmonetary indicator of inequality across a large sample of advanced and EMDCs. 

Inequality of outcomes: Income 

14. Global inequality remains high. Global inequality range from 0.55 to 0.70 depend on 
the measure use (Figure 2). The high level of global inequality reflect sizeable per caput income 
disparity across countries, which account for around three quarter of global inequality (Milanovic 
2013). Some measure of global inequality exhibit a decline trend in the last few decade in 
response to rise income for those living in China and India, where hundred of million of people 
have be lift out of poverty. However, other measure of global income inequality—adjusted for

top income which tend to be underreported in most household surveys—appear to be broadly 
stable since the early 1990s. 

Figure 2. Global Inequality and the Distribution of Income 

Sources: Lakner and Milanovic (2013); Milanovic (2013); and IMF staff calculations. 
Note: Unweighted inter-country inequality (blue line) be calculate across GDPs obtain from household survey of all 
country in the world, without population-weighting. The population-weighted inter-country inequality (red line) take into 
account population weights. Finally, the global inequality concept (green dot line) focus on individuals, instead of 
countries. The calculation be base on household survey with data on individual income or consumption. 


15. Globally, the middle class and the top 1 percent have experienced the large gains. 
Examining change in real income between 1998 and 2008 at various percentile of the global 
income distribution, Lakner and Milanovic (2013) show that the large gain acrued for the global 
median income (50th percentile) earner and for the top 1 percent. This coincides with the rapid 
growth of the middle class in many emerge market economies, and the concentration of top 
earner in advanced economies, respectively. Moreover, income gain rapidly decrease after the 
50th percentile and become stagnant around the 80th–90th global percentile before shoot up 
for the global top 1 percent (Krugman 2014). In what follows, we focus on recent trend in within- 
country inequality which drive these global developments. 

16. Widening income inequality within countries. Measures of inequality base on Gini 
coefficient of gross and net income have increase substantially since 1990 in most of the 
developed world (Figure 3). Inequality, on average, have remain stable in EMDCs, albeit at a much 
high level than observe in advanced economies. However, there be large disparity across 
EMDCs, with Asia and Eastern Europe experience marked increase in inequality, and country in 
Latin America exhibit notable decline (although the region remains the most unequal in the 
world).6 Redistribution, gauge by the difference between market and net inequality, played an 
important, albeit partial, role in cushion market income inequality in advanced economies. During

and Middle East and North Africa regions, respectively.

year be used. 


17. Income decile under the microscope. Changes in income inequality across advanced 
economy and EMDCs have be driven by different development in income share by deciles. 
Figure 4 show that rise income inequality (positive number on the vertical axes) in most 
advanced and many emerge market economy have be driven primarily by the grow income 
share of the top 10 percent (see also Piketty and Saez (2003) for the United States). Indeed, the top 
10 percent now have an income close to nine time that of the bottom 10 percent. These effect have 
be magnify by the crisis (OECD 2014). The story be somewhat different in EMDCs. Rising 
inequality for this group of country be primarily explain by a shift in income of the “upper 
middle class to the upper class” (for example, in China and South Africa). Figure 4 show that in 
EMDCs with fall inequality (negative number on the vertical axis), the main beneficiary (that is, 
with the large increase in their income shares, show on the horizontal axis) be those at both 
the bottom and the middle of the income distribution (for example, Peru and Brazil). 

18. Top 1 percent on the rise. The top 1 percent now account for around 10 percent of total 
income in advanced economies. (Figure 5; Piketty and Saez 2011; Alvadero and others, 2013). While 
data on top income share be scant for most EMDCs, available evidence suggests that the share of 
top income have risen in China and India. The grow share of the top 1 percent in advanced 
economy reflect both high inequality in labor income a well a capital gains—returns from 
investment (Atkinson, Piketty, and Saez 2011). Indeed, about half of the income of the top 1 
percent constitutes non-labor income compare with 30 percent for the top 10 percent a a whole.

19. Middle class squeeze. A shift in the allocation of labor income towards the high and 
low end of the distribution have result in a 
shrinkage of the income share accrue to the 
middle 20 percent in many advanced 
economy (Australia, Canada, and Sweden be 
important exceptions), and some large 
emerge market economy (Autor, Katz, and 
Kearney 2006; Figure 7). Indeed, pretax income 
of middle-class household in the United States, 
the United Kingdom, and Japan have 
experienced decline or stagnant growth rate 
in recent years. Additional pressure on the 
middle class reflect a decline share of labor 
income—the predominant source of income for 
the majority of households. Indeed, average 
wage have risen at a slow pace than 
productivity growth amid large economic rent 
(for example, high profitability and large increase in executive compensation) accrue to the top 
end of the income distribution (Figure 8).

20. Sources behind the middle class squeeze vary. In advanced economies, the large driver 
have be the decline share of middle-skilled occupation relative to low- and high-skilled 
occupation (Autor, Kerr, and Kugler 2007; Goos, Manning, and Salomons 2009). In EMDCs, the 
middle class squeeze in some country reflect income polarization (Duclos, Esteban, and Ray 2004; 
Zhang and Kanbur, 2011). In China, for example, more than one-third of all wealth be concentrate in 
the top 1 percent, while the majority of the population remains poor despite strong economic 
growth (Hairong 2014). Widespread informality and persistently large geographical difference in 
economic performance have also played a particularly important role in shape income inequality 
in EMDCs. 

21. Poverty have decline in many countries, but be on the rise in advanced economies. In 
many EMDCs, poverty—measured in term of the share of population living below a pre-defined 
poverty line—has declined, despite rise income inequality in some (Figure 9). In contrast, recent 
data suggest that poverty rise in advanced country since the 1990s (OECD 2011). The ratio of the

earnings of the 90th percentile to the earnings of the 10th percentile—another method of 
measure inequality among the bottom 90 percent—grew in most advanced economy over the 
period between 1980 and 2011 (Autor 2014), particularly in the United States and the United 
Kingdom.

Inequality of outcomes: Wealth 

22. Rising concentration of global wealth. Estimates suggest that almost half of the world’s 
wealth be now own by just 1 percent of the population, amount to $110 trillion—65 time the 
total wealth of the bottom half of the world’s population (Fuentes Nieva and Galasso 2014).7 For 
instance, a third of the total wealth in the United States be held by 1 percent of the population 
(Figure 10, left panel). In most country with available data, the share held by the 1 percent 
wealthy population be rise at the expense of the bottom 90 percent population (Figure 10, right 
panel).

23. Inequality be more extreme in wealth 
than income. In both advanced economy and 
EMDCs, income Ginis, on average, be half the 
size of wealth Ginis (Figure 11). Possible 
explanation for the high wealth Ginis include 
stagnant wage growth, which make it difficult 
for middle- and lower-income worker to set 
aside money for saving, and a low propensity 
to consume by the rich.8 While many study 
suggest that grow wealth inequality in 
advanced economy be largely driven by rise 
wealth concentration at the top (Piketty 2014; 
Saez 2014), various explanation have be 
posit for the rise in EMDCs, range from 
wealth polarization between urban and rural 
area in China to inequality among class and 
caste in India (Zhong and others 2010; Credit 
Suisse 2013). 

Inequality of Opportunity: Health Services 

24. Inequality in health outcome be widespread in develop economies. While health 
outcome be broadly similar across income group in advanced countries, large disparity exist in 
EMDCs (Figure 12, left panel). For example, the infant mortality rate be twice a high in the poor than 
in the rich household (in term of wealth) in emerge market economies. Similarly, female 
mortality rate tend to be disproportionately high for lower-income groups. 

25. Inequality in health care access and use be more pervasive in develop countries. 
Commonly use indicator to gauge access and use of health care be generally favorable in 
advanced countries, irrespective of the income level of the population. For EMDCs, however, data on 
access to skilled health personnel for birth suggest that there be large disparity in health access 
across income level within develop countries, and to a lesser extent in emerge market 
country (Figure 12, right panel). However, even in advanced economies, income inequality be 
increasingly be reflect in low life expectancy. This be particularly strike in the United States, 
where income today be a strong predictor of life expectancy than it be a generation ago (Murray, 
Lopez, and Alvarado 2013). 




8 Based on national balance sheet in nine advanced economies, Piketty and Zucman (2014) find that wealth-income 
ratio have double over the past 40 years.

Inequality of opportunity: Education 

26. Declining education inequality in EMDCs. The education Gini—a measure of the variation 
of average year of education for different income levels—has decline significantly in EMDCs, over 
the last 60 year (Figure 13, left panel). This be largely driven by improvement in access at the lower- 
end of the income distribution (Castello-Climent and Domenech 2014). Despite this improvement, 
education outcome remain much bad for disadvantage groups, partly because of pro-rich 
bias in the incidence of public spending (Dabla-Norris and Gradstein 2004). Indeed, almost 60 
percent of the poorest youth population (aged 20–24 years) in sub-Sahara Africa have few than 4 
year of school compare to 15 percent in the richest quintile (Figure 13, right panel). In contrast, 
education inequality, on average, be unchanged in most advanced economy over the last decade, 
although rise university cost have contribute to low access to education by the poor in some 
countries. In the United States, for instance, college cost grow must faster than most households’ 
income since 2001 (Federal Reserve 2014).

Inequality of opportunities: Financial service 

27. Disparities in financial service access. There be large disparity in the use of financial 
service between advanced economy and EMDCs and across income level within a country (Figure 
14). More than 80 percent of adult in advanced economy have an account at a formal financial 
institution—twice more than in EMDCs. Within EMDCs, the share of adult with an account or a loan 
at a formal financial institution be largely skewed toward the top income earners. The rest rely on 
their own limited saving to invest in education or become entrepreneurs, suggest that financial 
inequality and income inequality go hand in hand. In many EMDCs, low-income household and 
small-scale firm often face challenge in access financial service due to lack of financial 
knowledge, complicate processes, onerous paperwork, and other market failures. Moreover, 
available financial product tend to be more limited and relatively costly.

IV. INEQUALITY DRIVERS 

A. Factors Driving Higher Income Inequality 

28. Global trends: the good side of the story. Over the past four decades, technology have 
reduce the cost of transportation, improve automation, and communication dramatically. New 
market have opened, bring growth opportunity in country rich and poor alike, and hundred 
of million of people have be lift out of poverty. However, inequality have also risen, possibly 
reflect the fact that growth have be accompany by skill-biased technological change, or 
because other aspect of the growth process have generate high inequality. In this section, we 
discus potential global and country-specific driver of income inequality across countries. 

29. Technological change. New information technology have lead to improvement in 
productivity and well-being by leap and bounds, but have also played a central role in drive up the

skill premium, result in increase labor income inequality (Figure 15). This be because 
technological change can disproportionately raise the demand for capital and skilled labor over 
low-skilled and unskilled labor by eliminate many job through automation or upgrade the skill 
level require to attain or keep those job (Card and Dinardo 2002; Acemoglu 1998). Indeed, 
technological advance have be found to have contribute the most to rise income inequality in 
OECD countries, accounting for nearly a third of the widen gap between the 90th and the 10th 
percentile earner over the last 25 year (OECD 2011). Evidence from large emerge market 
economy also show a similar trend of a grow earnings gap between high- and low-skilled 
worker despite a large rise in the supply of highly educate labor (which should reduce the gap). 


30. Trade globalization: two side of a coin. Trade have be an engine for growth in many 
country by promote competitiveness and enhance efficiency. Nonetheless, high trade and 
financial flow between countries, partly enable by technological advances, be commonly cite a 
drive income inequality (Figure 16). In advanced economies, the ability of firm to adopt labor- 
save technology and offshoring have be cite a an important driver of the decline in 
manufacturing and rise skill premium (Feenstra and Hanson 1996, 1999, 2003). Trade openness 
could potentially have mixed effect on the wage of unskilled labor in advanced countries. It raise 
the skill premium, but could also increase real wage by lower (import) price (Munch and 
Skaksen 2009). At the same time, increase trade flow could low income inequality in EMDCs by 
increase demand and wage for abundant lower-skilled workers. Thus, disentangle the impact of 
trade on inequality be challenge a it depends on relative factor abundance and productivity 
difference across countries, and the extent to which individual obtain income from wage or 
capital.

31. Financial globalization. Financial globalization can facilitate efficient international 
allocation of capital and promote international risk sharing. At the same time, increase financial 
flows, particularly foreign direct investment (FDI) and portfolio flow have be show to increase 
income inequality in both advanced and emerge market economy (Freeman 2010). One potential 
explanation be the concentration of foreign asset and liability in relatively high skill- and 
technology-intensive sectors, which push up the demand for and wage of high skilled workers. 
In addition, FDI could induce skill-specific technological change, be associate with skill-specific 
wage bargaining, and result in more training for skilled than unskilled worker (Willem te Velde 
2003). Moreover, low-skill, outward FDI from advanced economy may in effect be relatively high- 
skilled, inward FDI in develop economy (Figini and Görg 2011), thus exacerbate the demand 
for high-skilled worker in recipient countries. Financial deregulation and globalization have also 
be cite a factor underlie the increase in financial wealth, relative skill intensity, and wage in 
the finance industry, one of the fast grow sector in advanced economy (Phillipon and 
Reshef 2012; Furceri and Loungani 2013). 

32. Financial deepening. Financial deepen can provide household and firm with great 
access to resource to meet their financial needs, such a save for retirement, invest in 
education, capitalize on business opportunities, and confront shocks. Financial deepen 
accompany by more inclusive financial system can thus low income inequality, while improve 
the allocation of resource (Dabla-Norris and others 2015). Theory, however, suggests that financial 
development could benefit the rich in the early stage of development, but the benefit become 
more broadly share a economy develop (Greenwood and Jovanovic 1990). Indeed, some study 
have found that financial development, measure a the relative share of the banking and stock 
market sector in the economy, boost top income the most in the early stage of development 
(Roine, Vlachos, and Waldenström 2009). Moreover, inequality can increase a those with high 
income and asset have a disproportionately large share of access to finance, serve to further 
increase the skill premium, and potentially the return to capital (Claessens and Perotti 2007).

33. Changes in labor market institutions. 
More flexible labor market institution can foster 
economic dynamism by reallocate resource to 
more productive firm and enable firm 
restructuring. However, great flexibility can 
pose challenge for workers, especially those 
with low skills, and hence play an important role 
in explain inequality development (Alvadero 
and others 2013). A decline in trade union 
membership (union rate) could reduce the 
relative bargaining power of labor, exacerbate 
wage inequality (Frederiksen and Poulsen 2010; 
Wilkinson and Pickett 2010; Figure 17).9 Jaumotte 
and Osorio-Buitron (2015) and forthcoming IMF 
work find that a reduction in the minimum wage 
relative to the median wage be associate with high inequality in advanced economies, while a 
decline in unionization rate be strongly associate with the rise of top income shares. Moreover, 
some study have point to the role of wage dispersion and a high share of part-time and 
temporary employment in drive inequality in labor earnings in some advanced economy (OECD 
2012). For many labor market policies, such a reform to employment protection legislation, the 
impact on inequality be less clear cut a they affect both the dispersion of earnings and the level of 
employment in sometimes conflict ways.10 In many EMDCs, the combination of rigid hire and 
fire and employment protection regulation and weak income protection system often 
encourages informality, fuel wage inequality. However, evidence from a large sample of country 
suggests that de facto labor market regulation (such a minimum wages, unionization, and social 
security contributions), on average, tend to improve the income distribution (Calderón and Chong 
2009; OECD 2011). 

34. Redistributive policies. Governments in advanced economy have historically mitigate 
inequality through public policy—primarily progressive tax and social transfer such a public 
retirement benefit (CBO 2011). However, many advanced country have now see an increase in 
net income inequality, indicate gap in exist tax-and-transfer system to counteract rise 
market inequality. The progressivity of tax system have decline in some advanced economy over 
the past few decades, with the result be that high-income household and corporation now face 


9 There be a difference between coverage rate of collective bargaining agreement and union density because in many 
advanced economy multi-employer bargaining and public policy extend the negotiate contract to 
nonorganized firm guarantee coverage rate in excess of density rates. 
10 Stronger labor market institution could increase unemployment rates, reduce the wage differential between high- 
skill and low-skill workers, and affect the labor share of income. The overall impact on income inequality, however, 
can be ambiguous: they increase unemployment, which tends to raise inequality, they can reduce wage dispersion, 
which tends to low it, and they increase the wage share, which can have an ambiguous effect on inequality.

low effective tax rate (Hungerford 2013).11 
Indeed, Figure 18 indicates that rise pre-tax 
income concentration at the top of the 
distribution in many advanced economy have 
also coincide with decline top marginal tax 
rate (from 59 percent in 1980 to 30 percent 
in 2009). Conditional cash transfer have 
become an important policy tool for direct 
resource towards the low end of the 
distribution in EMDCs (IMF 2014a), but their 
redistributive impact varies widely across 
countries, reflect both difference in the 
size and progressivity of these transfers. 

35. Education. Education can play an 
important role in reduce income inequality, 
a it determines occupational choice, access 
to jobs, and the level of pay, and play a 
pivotal role a a signal of ability and productivity in the job market. From a theoretical perspective, 
the human capital model of income distribution (Mincer, 1958; Becker and Chiswick, 1966) suggests 
that while there be an unambiguously positive association between educational and income 
inequality, the effect of increase educational attainment on income inequality could be either 
positive or negative depend on the evolution of rate of return to education (that is, the skill 
premium). Moreover, there can be oppose force at play stem from “composition” (that is, 
increase the share of high-wage earners) and “wage compression” (that is, decline in the return to 
high education relative to low levels) effects. Overall, the evidence suggests that the inequality 
impact of education depends on various factors, such a the size of education investment by 
individual and government and the rate of return on these investments. It be in this spirit that Rajan 
(2015) note that “prosperity seem increasingly unreachable for many, because a good education, 
which seem to be today’s passport to riches, be unaffordable for many in the middle class.” 

B. Empirical Analysis 

36. This section investigates the driver of income inequality.12 The discussion above 
suggests that a variety of inter-related factor can impact inequality and have potentially differential 
effect across country and income groups. In this section, use a simple panel econometric 


11 Tax regime can influence the mix of compensation, tilt it towards low taxed form of compensation, and 
thereby boost disposable income, particularly at the top. For example, capital gain be often taxed at a low rate 
than other income and, in a few countries, they be not taxed at all. Stock option also benefit from preferential tax 
treatment in many advanced economies. 
12 We be unable to also investigate the driver of wealth inequality due to data unavailability for a broad sample of 
advanced economy and EMDCs.

approach with year and country fix effects, we investigate the driver of within country change in 
income inequality for a sample of almost 100 advanced economy and EMDCs over the period 
1980–2012 (see Box 1 for empirical specification). In contrast to other studies, we focus on a large 
group of country to ass whether the determinant of inequality vary across advanced, emerge 
market and develop economies, and across different measure of inequality. In addition to the 
Gini coefficient of both market and net inequality, we build on our early result that the income 
distribution itself matter for growth by examine the determinant of the disposable income 
share (after tax) of the poor (bottom 10 percent), the middle-class (fifth decile), and the rich (top 10 
percent). This allows u to focus on the factor drive income concentration in recent years, 
especially change in the income share of the poor and the middle class. 

37. Drivers of gross and net inequality. Table 2 (Columns 1 and 2) present the result of the 
regression analysis for gross and net inequality. Our result on the role of globalization and 
technological progress in drive inequality be broadly in line with the finding in the literature. In 
particular, trade openness be associate with low inequality (albeit not in a statistically significant 
way), while great financial openness and technological progress be associate with rise income 
inequality, likely reflect the fact these disproportionately benefit high-tech and labor-skilled 
sectors. Indeed, we find that financial globalization and technological progress be associate with an 
increase in the top 10 percent disposable income share across all country (Column 3). 

38. Differential impact of financial deepen across country groups. The impact of 
financial deepening, a proxied by the ratio of private credit to GDP, on both market and net 
inequality varies across advanced economy and EMDCs, in line with Roine, Vlachos, and 
Waldenström 2009. In particular, our result 
suggest that financial deepen be associate 
with high income inequality in EMDCs. This 
likely reflect the fact that while financial 
deepen have accelerate over the past two 
decades, the record on financial inclusion 
may not have kept apace in these countries. 
Indeed, Figure 19 indicates that financial 
deepen be associate with high market 
and net income inequality in country with 
low level of financial inclusion (typically 
EMDCs), possibly reflect that large 
amount of credit be often concentrate 
among the large firm and wealthier 
households. By contrast, financial deepen 
be associate with less of an increase in 
market inequality (and low net inequality) 
in advanced economies, reflect easy 
access to credit for household and firms.

Box 1. Assessing the Drivers of Income Inequality Around the World 

Our empirical approach be base on a simple model of within-country variation in inequality, control 
for difference in level across country use five-year panel over the period 1980–2012. Specifically, 
the analysis build on Jaumotte, Lall, and Papageorgiou (2013) and be base on the follow 
specification: 

in which refers to the relevant inequality measure use for country i at time t, trade proxy 
for trade globalization, measure a the sum of export and import a a share of a country’s GDP, 
financial capture financial globalization, measure a the sum of foreign asset and liability relative to 
GDP, and technology measure the share of information and communication technology (ICT) capital in 
the total capital stock. Credit capture domestic financial market development, and be proxied by the ratio 
of private credit to GDP. Since the effect of financial development could vary across advanced economy 
and EMDCs, we also include an interaction term between the credit variable and a dummy variable which 
take the value of 1 for advanced economies, and zero otherwise. Given data limitations, and in line with 
Mincer’s (1958) wage specification, we use the average year of education in the population age 15 and 
old a a proxy for the skill premium. As note in the literature, the effect of skill-biased technological 
change could vary across advanced economy and EMDCs. To capture this, we also include an 
interaction term between the skill premium variable and a dummy variable that take the value of 1 for 
advanced economies, and zero otherwise. We also include a measure of labor market flexibility from the 
World Economic Forum that measure the extent by which regulation govern fire and hiring, collective 
bargaining, and minimum wages. 

Additional control variable attempt to capture aspect of inequality of opportunities, include the 
begin of period education Gini (a proxy for access to education); the quality and availability of health 
system be measure by the begin of period female mortality (aged 15–60) rate. Given data limitations, 
a a proxy for redistributive policies, we include the begin of period Fraser Institute index that 
measure total government spending a a share of GDP (see also Perotti [1992]).,The term and 
represent a full set of time and country dummies, respectively, and εit capture all the omit factors. 
Country fix effect allow u to focus on within-country change instead of cross-country level 
differences. In addition, time dummy be include to capture the impact of common global shock such 
a business cycle or growth spurts. All specification include lag GDP growth and share of 
employment in agriculture and industry a additional controls. Lagged GDP growth be include in the 
specification a there could be a two way causality between output growth and inequality. 

While causality be difficult to establish with full confidence, the result survive a variety of robustness 
check for omit variables, endogeneity problems, and estimation method and be broadly in line with 
finding from the literature that focus on small country samples. For example, we checked the 
robustness of our result by include dummy for financial crises, GDP per capita, and alternative 
measure of the skill premium, trade, and financial openness. For some Organisation for Economic Co- 
operation and Development (OECD) country with available tax and benefit data, we also consider 
alternative measure for redistributive policy a well a top marginal personal income-tax rates. The 
results, not report here but available upon request, suggest that low marginal tax rate be 
associate with high market and net inequality and a high income share of the top 10 percent.

39. Higher skill premium be associate with widen inequality in advanced economies. In 
advanced economies, increase in the skill premium exacerbate market income inequality, reflect 
the fact that education gain accrue disproportionately at the high end of the income 
distribution.13 The statistically insignificant effect of the skill premium in drive net income 
inequality, however, could reflect the fact that the net Gini be underestimate increase in inequality 
at the top of the distribution (Kakwani 1980). Indeed, an increase in the skill premium be associate 


13 Our specification us the average year of education in the population a a proxy for skills; see also Card and 
DiNardo (2000), essentially imply that the skill premium be determine solely by the supply of skills. Similar result 
be obtain use alternative measures, such the ratio of earnings from employment after complete tertiary 
education compare to the earnings after complete upper- and post-secondary education for a small sample of 
OECD country (available upon request).

with a significantly high disposable income share of the top 10 percent. This effect be found to be 
statistically insignificant in EMDCs, and be in line with study that find an absence of a correlation 
between income differential and the quantity of skill in these countries, likely reflect large 
difference in factor endowment and capacity to absorb new technology across EMDCs (Behar 
2013). 

40. Easing of labor market regulation be associate with high market inequality and 
income share of the top 10 percent. In particular, a decline in organize labor institution and the 
resultant ease of labor market measure by an increase in labor market flexibility index by 8½ 
percent—from the median to 60th percentile—is associate with rise market inequality by 1.1 
percent. The relationship between the top 10th percentile income share and ease of labor market 
regulation be also positive and statistically significant (Column 3) for our sample of countries, likely 
reflect the fact that labor market flexibility benefit the rich and reduces the bargaining power of 
lower-income workers. This result confirms Jaumotte and Osorio-Buitron (2015) and forthcoming 
IMF work which find that weaken of union be associate with a high top 10 percent income 
share for a small sample of advanced economies.14 Indeed, empirical estimation use more 
detailed data for OECD country (not report here, but available upon request) suggest that, in 
line with Jaumotte and Osorio-Buitron (2015) and forthcoming IMF work, more lax hire and fire 
regulations, low minimum wage relative to the median wage, and less prevalent collective 
bargaining and trade union be associate with high market inequality. The impact of labor 
market institution on inequality, however, be somewhat blunt by government action a show by 
the statistically insignificant coefficient in the net Gini regression (Table 2, Column 2). 

41. Government action can contribute to great equality. In particular, we find that an 
increase in our proxy for government redistributive spending relative to total spending by 7.1 
percent (that is, a shift from the median value to the 60th percentile) be associate with a 0.6 percent 
decrease in income inequality. While total government spending can be a poor proxy for the 
progressivity of tax-transfer systems, this result continue to hold for other measure of 
redistribution for a small sample of OECD country (not report here, but available upon 
request), suggest that the composition of government spending be important for reduce 
inequality.15 Moreover, healthier societies, a proxied by a low female mortality rate, tend to have 
low income inequality. While causality be difficult to establish, the latter find suggests that 
great and more equal access to quality health service allows people to be more productive, thus 
lower income disparities. 

42. Overall contributor to change in inequality. Based on the estimate models, the 
contribution of the various factor to the change in the market Gini coefficient can be calculated.16 


14 This find be also in line with recent research that find that wage inequality fall during period when union 
density be increase and rise when union membership be in decline (World Bank 2013). 
15 Joumard, Pisu, and Bloch (2012) look at the role of tax and transfer while OECD (2012b) look at how education 
policies, progressive tax and transfer can tackle inequality. 
16 These estimate be calculate a the average annual change in the respective variable multiply by the 
correspond coefficient estimate in Table 2, Column 1. 



INEQUALITY: CAUSES AND CONSEQUENCES 

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 27 

We find that less-regulated labor markets, financial deepening, and technological progress largely 
explain the rise in market income inequality in our full sample over the last 30 year (Figure 20). 
Globalization (that is, financial openness) have played a small but reinforce role, while 
improvement in health outcome mitigate around ½ percent of the almost 3 percentage point 
average increase in the Gini coefficient. The relative importance of the skill premium, globalization, 
technological progress, and financial deepen in drive inequality, however, varies across 
advanced economy and EMDCs. 


43. What have be drive income share of the poor and the middle class? Given the 
importance of the poor (bottom 10 percent) and the middle class for boost growth, we 
investigate what explains change in the income share for these income group across different 
countries. On average, the income share of the poor and the middle class have risen much more 
slowly than that of the top 10 percent, which explains the rise income inequality observe in many 
countries. Looking more closely into the determinant (Table 2, Columns 4 and 5, and Figure 21), we 
find: 

 Better access to education (as capture by decline educational inequality), improve health 
outcomes, and redistributive social police help raise the income share of the poor and the 
middle class irrespective of the level of economic development of a country.17 By contrast, 
ease of labor market regulation and technological progress dampen the income share of the 
poor and the middle class, consistent with other studies. This result be not surprising, since the 
poor be often disproportionally employ in lower-paying and less secure job (often in the 
informal sector) and tend to benefit more from labor market regulation such a minimum 
wage and fire restrictions. This point to the policy role of make education more accessible 
(Bruckner, Dabla-Norris, and Gradstein 2015), while ensure that change in labor market 
institution do not excessively penalize lower-income individuals. Moreover, to the extent that 


17 In a recent speech, Rajan (2015) refers to economic inclusion—easing access to quality education, nutrition, health 
care, finance, and market to all our citizens, a a “necessity for sustainable growth,” in addition to “obviously, a 
moral imperative.”

redistributive policy can play a role in reduce inequality, they can be support by make 
the tax system more efficient and progressive and improve target spending. 

 There be important difference in inequality driver between advanced economy and EMDCs, 
suggest the need to tailor policy to country-specific conditions. In particular, we find that 
financial deepen have played a role in raise the income share of the poor and the middle 
class in advanced economies, but not in EMDCs, likely reflect difference in credit allocation 
and the extent of financial inclusion. In contrast, reduce gap in access to education have be 
one of the most important driver of high income share for the bottom 10 percent and the 
middle class in EMDCs. A complementary way to look at the income share of the poor be to 
examine the driver of the interplay between inequality and the poverty rate—defined a the 
population living below $2 a day (Box 2). Our finding suggest that great equality in access to 
education lift the poverty elasticity of economic growth. 

 Financial globalization and a high skill premium have account for a more significant share of 
the widen income gap between the top 10 percent and the poor and the middle class in 
advanced economy than in develop countries. Policies to raise skill and reform to increase 
human capital be thus important for improve living standard and reduce labor income 
inequality in advanced economies. In contrast to conventional wisdom, our result suggest that 
globalization have played a less significant role in drive down income share of the bottom 10 
percent and the middle class in EMDCs (see also Box 2), suggest that the benefit of 
globalization discuss early potentially outweigh the cost in some of these countries.

Box 2. Drivers of Poverty 

Another way to look at the income share of the poor be to examine the driver of poverty rate—defined a the 
population living below $2 a day (PPP-adjusted)—and look at the interplay between poverty and inequality. 
The literature point to various source for poverty reduction, include high economic growth (Kraay 2006) 
and a rise in the income share of the poor (Ravallion 2004). A large strand of the literature also explores how 
inequality affect poverty reduction via it growth impact; see for example, Bourguignon (2003) and Fosu 
(2010). 

Using a sample of almost 100 EMDCs for the period 1985–2010, we investigate what be behind the decline 
share of people living below the $2 a day poverty line over the last 30 years. Following Bourguignon (2003), we 
first investigate the importance of inequality and growth on poverty reduction. Our result suggest that while 
the impact of the change in inequality, a measure by the Gini, do not appear to be significant per se, 
high initial inequality lower the growth elasticity of poverty reduction (Table 3, Column 1). Moreover, a 
high initial level of education inequality dampens the growth elasticity of poverty, while a high 
employment growth in manufacturing, a see in emerge market economy in Asia for instance, be 
associate with a low share of the population living below the poverty line (Column 2). We also find that 
great trade openness can amplify the growth elasticity of poverty, albeit not in a statistically significant way, 
while financial openness amplifies it in a significant way (Column 3).

44. Caveats. We should of course be cautious about draw definitive policy implication from 
cross-country regression analysis, a different policy be likely to have vary effect across 
country and at different point in time. Measurement limitation in compare inequality across 
time and country also need to be considered. In addition, it be hard to go from the sort of 
correlation present in the note to firm statement about causality a there can be a two-way 
causality run from growth-to-income inequality. Indeed, in-depth country-specific analysis 
suggest that a number of inter-related factor drive growth, the income level, and income inequality. 
Despite these limitations, our analysis point to a policy role for tackle inequality. 

V. POLICY DISCUSSION AND FINAL REMARKS 
45. No one-size-fits-all. Policymakers around the world need to consider policy to tackle 
inequality. Raising the income share of the poor, and ensure that there be no hollowing-out of the 
middle class be actually good for growth. Our empirical analysis also suggests that the driver of 
inequality and their impact differ across country for different income groups. As such, the nature of 
appropriate policy would necessarily vary across countries, and would also need to take into 
account country-specific policy and institutional settings, and capacity/implementation constraints. 
Recent work by the World Bank (2015) also highlight the importance of adopt a psychological 
and social perspective on policymaking that take into account what policy be implement and 
how. 

46. Squaring equity and efficiency concerns. Lowering income inequality do not need to 
come at the cost of low efficiency. Previous IMF work have show that there do not need to be a 
stark efficiency-equity tradeoff (Ostry, Berg, and Tsangarides 2014). Redistribution through the tax 
and transfer system be found to be positively related to growth for most countries, and be negatively 
related to growth only for the most strongly redistributive countries. This suggests that the effect of 
redistribution on enhance opportunity for lower-income household and on social and political 
stability could potentially outweigh any negative effect on growth through a damp of incentives. 

47. Fiscal policy can be an important tool for reduce inequality. Fiscal policy play a 
critical role in ensure macrofinancial stability and can thus help avert/minimize crisis that 
disproportionately hurt the disadvantage population. At the same time, fiscal redistribution, carry 
out in a manner that be consistent with other macroeconomic objectives, can help raise the income 
share of the poor and middle class, and thus support growth. Fiscal policy already play a significant 
role in address income inequality in many advanced economies, but the redistributive role of 
fiscal policy could be reinforce by great reliance on wealth and property taxes, more progressive 
income taxation, remove opportunity for tax avoidance and evasion, good target of social 
benefit while also minimize efficiency costs, in term of incentive to work and save (IMF 2014a). 
In addition, reduce tax expenditure that benefit high-income group most and remove tax 
relief—such a reduce taxation of capital gains, stock options, and carry interest—would increase 
equity and allow a growth-enhancing cut in marginal labor income tax rate in some countries. In 
EMDCs, good access to education and health services, well-targeted conditional cash transfer and 
more efficient safety net can have a positive impact on disposable income of the poor (Bastagli, 
Coady and Gupta 2012). In many cases, this increase public spending would need to be

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 31 

undertaken in tandem with rise revenue mobilization, reduce tax loopholes, and tax evasion, and 
low less- well-targeted spending (such a oil subsidies). 

48. Education policy be key. In a world in which technological change be increase 
productivity and simultaneously mechanize jobs, raise skill level be critical for reduce the 
dispersion of earnings. Improving education quality, eliminate financial barrier to high 
education, and provide support for apprenticeship program be all key to boost skill level in 
both tradable and nontradable sectors. These policy can also help improve the income prospect 
of future generation a educate individual be good able to cope with technological and other 
change that directly influence productivity levels. In advanced economies, with an already high 
share of secondary or tertiary graduate among the working-age population, policy that improve 
the quality of upper secondary or tertiary education would be important. In develop country 
with currently low level of education attainment, policy that promote more equal access to basic 
education (for example, cash transfer aim at encourage good attendance at primary schools, 
or spending on public education that benefit the poor) could help reduce inequality by facilitate 
the accumulation of human capital, and make educational opportunity less dependent on socio- 
economic circumstances. 

49. Fostering financial inclusion safely. Financial deepen in EMDCs need to be 
accompany by great inclusion to make a dent in inequality. Governments have a central role to 
play in alleviate impediment to financial inclusion by create the associate legal and regulatory 
framework (for example, protect creditor rights, regulate business conduct, and oversee 
recourse mechanism to protect consumers), support the information environment (for example, 
set standard for disclosure and transparency and promote credit information-sharing system 
and collateral registries), and educate and protect consumers. Country experience also 
suggest that policy such a grant exemption from onerous documentation requirements, 
require bank to offer basic accounts, and allow correspondent banking be useful in foster 
inclusion. The promotion of credit without sufficient regard for financial stability, however, can result 
in crises, a evidence by the subprime mortgage crisis in the United States, with disproportionately 
adverse effect on the poor and the middle class. Moreover, it illustrates the broader point that deep 
social issue cannot be resolve purely with an infusion of credit. Policies thus need to strike a 
balance between foster prudence stability, and inclusion, while encourage innovation and 
creativity. 

50. Well-designed labor market policy and institution can reduce inequality, and, at the 
same time, not be a drag on efficiency. Policies that reduce labor market imperfection and 
institutional failure that affect job creation can help support poor and middle-income workers. For 
instance, appropriately set minimum wages, spending on well-designed active labor market policy 
aim at support job search and skill match can be important. Better use of in-work benefit 
for social benefit recipient also help reduce income disparities. Moreover, policy that reduce labor 
market dualism, such a gap in employment protection between permanent and temporary 
workers—especially young worker and immigrants—can help to reduce inequality, while foster 
great market flexibility. More generally, labor market policy should attempt to avoid either 
excessive regulation or extreme disregard for labor conditions. Labor market rule that be very

32 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 

weak or program that be nonexistent can leave problem of poor information, unequal power, and 
inadequate risk management untreated, penalize the poor and the middle class (World Bank 
2012). In contrast, excessively stringent regulation can compound market imperfection with 
institutional failures, and weigh on job creation and efficiency. 

51. In EMDCs, make labor market more inclusive and create incentive for lower 
informality be a key challenge. Workers in these country often lack equal access to productive job 
opportunity and do not benefit evenly from economic growth. Many individual with low skills, in 
particular, remain trap in precarious jobs, often in the informal and unregulated economy. In 
such jobs, even full-time employment tends to be insufficient to lift household out of poverty. Thus, 
create accessible, productive, and reward job be key to escape poverty and reduce 
inequality. Informal worker need to have the necessary legal, financial, and educational mean to 
access formal sector employment. Higher formal sector employment also require good incentive 
for firm to become formal. Policies to reduce tax, financial, and regulatory constraint can expand 
formal sectoral employment by reduce the incentive for firm to operate informally, both by 
increase the benefit of participate in the formal sector and by reduce the cost of do so 
(Dabla-Norris and Inchauste 2008). 

52. Complementarities between growth and income equality objectives. Reforms aim at 
raise average living standard can also influence the distribution of income. Indeed, tackle 
inequality go beyond the remit of labor, social welfare, financial inclusion, and tax policies. The key 
to minimize the downside of both globalization and technological change in advanced economy 
be a policy agenda of a race to the top, instead of a race to the bottom—an agenda that include 
policy to encourage innovation, reduce burdensome product market regulation that stifle 
competition and technology diffusion, move good produce upwards in the value chain, and 
ensure that this rise benefit everyone. In develop countries, raise agricultural productivity, 
rapid accumulation of capital, and technology diffusion in labor-intensive sector can substantially 
lift growth and ensure that the fruit of prosperity be more broadly share (Dabla-Norris and others 
2013). Sustaining growth in emerge market economy will require more intensive pattern of 
growth, great flexibility to shift resource within and across sectors, and the capacity to apply 
more knowledge and skill-intensive production techniques. Policies to improve skill for all, to 
ensure that a nation’s infrastructure meet it needs, and to encourage innovation and technology 
adoption be thus all essential to drive growth and ensure a more inclusive prosperity.
