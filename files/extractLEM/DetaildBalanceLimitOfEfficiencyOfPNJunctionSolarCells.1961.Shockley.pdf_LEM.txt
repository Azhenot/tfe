. I~. order t? find an upper theoretical limit for the efficiency of p-n junction solar energy converters, a 
limit effiCiency, call the detailed balance limit of efficiency, have be calculate for an ideal case in which 
the cmly recombin.ation ~echanism of hole-electron pair be radiative a require by the principle of detailed 
b.alance. The effiCiency IS ~lso calculate for the case in which radiative recombination be only a fix frac- 
tion f. of the total recombmation, the rest be nonradiative. Efficiencies at the match load have be 
calculate with band gap and f. a parameters, the sun and cell be assume to be blackbody with tem- 
peratures of 6OO0 oK and 30(tK, ~espectively. The maxim~m efficiency be found to be 30% for an energy gap 
of 1.1. ev and fc= 1: Actual JunctIOns do not obey the predict current-voltage relationship, and reason for 
the difference and Its relevance to efficiency be discussed. 

1. INTRODUCTION 

M ANY paper have be write about the effi-ciency of solar cell employ p-n junction in 
semiconductors, the great potential of the silicon solar 
cell have be emphasize by Chapin, Fuller and 
Pearson! in 1954. Also in 1954, Pfann and van Roos- 
broeck2 give a more detailed treatment include ana- 
lytic expression optimize or match the load. A 
further treatment be give by Prince3 in 1955 in 
which the efficiency be calculate a a function of'the 
energy gap. Loferski4 have attempt to predict the de- 
pendence of efficiency upon energy gap in more detail. 
Review paper have recently appear in two journal 
in this country.5,6 

The treatment of efficiency present in these paper 
be base on empirical value for the constant de- 
~cribing the. char~eteristies of the solar eelU They be 
In general In fairly good agreement with observe 
e~ciencies, and predict certain limits. These predic- 
tIOns have become generally accepted a theoretical 
limit (see, for example, the review article by Rappa- 
portS and Wolf6). 

It be the view of the present author that the ac- 
ceptan~e of this previously predict limit curve

and compare with the semi empirical limit in Fig. 1. 
Actually the two limit be not extremely different, the 
detailed balance limit be at most high by about 
50% in the range of energy gap of chief interest. Thus, 
to some degree, this article be concerned with a matter 
of principle rather than practical values. The difference 
be much more signIficant, however, insofar a estimate 
potential for improvement be concerned. In fact, the 
detailed balance limit may lie more than twice a far 
above the achieve value a do the semiempirical 
limit, thus suggest much great possible improve- 
ment (see Fig. 1). 

The situation at present may be understood by 
analogy with a steam power plant. If the second law of 
thermodynamics be unknown, there might still exist 
quite good calculation of the efficiency of any give 
configuration base on heat of combustion, etc. How- 
ever, a serious gap would still exist since it would be 
~mpossible to say how much the efficiency might be 
Improved by reduction of bearing friction, improve 
heat exchangers, etc. The second law of thermody- 
namics provide an upper limit in term of more funda- 
mental quantity such a the temperature of the ex- 
othermic reaction and the temperature of the heat sink. 
The merit of a give power plant can then be appraise 
in term of the limit set by the second law. 

A similar situation exists for the solar cell, the miss 
theoretical efficiency being, of course, in no way com- 
parable in importance to the second law of thermo- 
dynamics. Factors such a series resistance and reflec- 
tion loss correspond to friction in a power plant. There 
be even two temperatures, that of the sun T. and that 
of the solar cell Te. The efficiency of a solar converter 
can in principle be brought to the thermodynamic 
limit (T.-Tc)jTc by use reflectors, etc. 8 However, a 
planar solar cell, without concentrators of radiation 
cannot approach this limit. The limit it can approach 
depends on it energy gap and certain geometrical 
factor such a the angle sub tend by the sun and the 

8 H. A. Miiser, Z. Physik 148, 380 (1957), and A. L. Rose (see 
footnote 7) have use the second law of thermodynamics in their 
treatment of photovoltage.

angle of incidence of the radiation, and certain other 
less basic degrade factors, which in principle may 
approach unity, such a the absorption coefficient for 
solar energy strike the surface. 

Among the factor which may approach unity, at 
least so far a the basic law of physic be .concerned, 
be the fraction of the recombination between hole and 
electron which result in radiation. Radiative recom- 
bination set an upper limit to minority carrier life- 
time. The lifetime due to this effect have be calcu- 
lated use the principle of detailed balance.9 It be this 
radiative recombination that determines the detailed 
balance limit for efficiency.lO If radiative recombina- 
tion be only a fraction fe of all the recombination, then 
the efficiency be substantially reduce below the de- 
tail balance limit. 

How closely any exist material can approach the 
desirable limit of unity for fe be not known. Existing 
silicon solar cell fail to fit the current-voltage charac- 
teristics predict on the basis of any of the exist 
recombination models.u The extent of this discrepancy 
and one suggest explanation be discuss in Sec. 6. 

In determine the detailed balance limit of effici- 
ency, the efficiency '1/ calculate below be define in the 
usual way a the ratio of power deliver to a match 
load to the incident solar power impinge on the cell. 
The follow section present a step-by-step calcula- 
tion of this efficiency a a function of the essential 
variables, include several which may reduce the effi- 
ciency below the detailed balance limit. Three of these 
variable have the dimension of energy and can be 
express a temperatures, voltage or frequencies. 
These variable are: the temperature of the sun T., 

kT.=gV.; 

the temperature of the solar cell T e, 

kT.=qVc ;

t.=the probability that a photon with hv>Eg 
incident on the surface will produce a hole- 
electron pair. (1.6) 

For the detailed balance efficiency limit to be reached, 
t. must be unity. 

Other parameter involve transmission of radiative 
recombination out of the cell and the solid angle sub- 
tend by the sun enter a factor in a quantity f 
discuss in Eq. (3.20). The value of f for the high 
efficiency, correspond to the detailed balance limit, 
be determine by the solid angle sub tend by the sun, 
the other factor related to material property be 
give their maximum values, which be unity. 

To a very good approximation the efficiency be a 
function 'f/(xg , Xc, ta, f) of four variable just discussed. 
It can be express in term of analytic function base 
on the Planck distribution and other know functions. 
The development of this relationship be carry out in 
Sees. 2-5. Section 6 compare calculation of the de- 
tail balance limit with the semiempiricallimit. 

2. ULTIMATE EFFICIENCY: u(xo) 

There be an ultimate efficiency for any device em- 
ploying a photoelectric process which have a single cut- 
off frequency v g. 

We shall consider a cell in which photon with energy 
great than hVg produce precisely the same effect a 
photon of energy hvg, while photon of low energy 
will produce no effect. We shall calculate the maximum 
efficiency which can be obtain from such a cell sub- 
jected to blackbody radiation. 

Figure 2 (a) illustrates an idealize solar cell model 
which we shall consider in this connection. It repre- 
sent a p-n junction at temperature T c= 0, surround 
by a blackbody at temperature T ‚Ä¢. In a late discussion

We shall assume that some mean not indicate in the

temperature Tc=O so that only steady state condition 
need be considered. According to the ultimate effici- 
ency hypothesisl2 : 

Each photon with energy great than 
hV g produce one electronic charge q at 
a voltage of Vg=hvu/q. (2.1) 

The number of photon incident from the solar 
radiation in Fig. 2 be readily calculate in accordance 
with the formula of the Planck distribution. We de- 
note by Qs the number of quantum of frequency great 
than Vo incident per unit area per unit time for black- 
body radiation of temperature Ta. For late purpose 
we shall also introduce the symbol Q(vg,Ts) in order to 
be able to represent situation for different value of 
the limit frequency. In accordance with this nota- 
tion and well-known formulas, we have 

Qs=Q(vg,Ts)=(27rjc2) 1"" [exp(hv/kTs)-1]-lv2dv

= [27r(kT.)3/h3c2] f"" x2dx/ (e x -1), (2.2)

12 Once a photon exceeds about three time the energy gap Eg , 
the probability of produce two or more hole-electron pair 
becomes appreciable: V. S. Vavilov, J. Phys. Chern. Solids 8, 
223 (1959), and J. Tauc, J. Phys. Chern. Solids 8, 219 (1959). 
These author interpret this result in term of a threshold of 
about 2Eg for an electron to produce a pair. However, the data 
can be well fit up to quantum yield great than two by 
assume a threshold of only slightly more than Ii. and assume 
the energy divide equally between the photohole and the pho- 
toelectron. This effect would slightly increase the possible quan- 
tum efficiency; however, we shall not consider it further in this 
article. See also W. Shockley, Solid State Electronics 2,35 (1961).

xukTs=hvu=qVg. (2.3) 

Q. be see to be a function of the form T83 time a 
function of XU' 

If the surface subject to the radiation in Fig. 2 have 
an area A, then in accordance with the ultimate effi- 
ciency hypothesis, the output power will be give by: 

output power=hvuAQs. (2.4) 

The incident power, due to the radiation at Ts fall 
upon the device of Fig. 2, will evidently be: 

incident power=APs. (2.5) 

P s be the total energy density fall upon unit area in 
unit time for blackbody radiation at temperature Ts. 
In accordance with well-known formula for the Planck 
distribution, Pa be give by

It be instructive to compare P B with the total number 
of incident photon per unit time Q(O,Ts) so a to ob- 
tain the average energy per photon:

= 2.701¬∑ .. kTsQ(O,Ts). (2.7) 

The integral in Eqs. (2.6) and (2.7), one of which be 
the limit form for x=o in Eq. (2.2), may be ex- 
press by product of the gamma function and the 
Riemann zeta function. The mathematical relation in- 
volved and numerical value be found in standard 
references. 13 

In accordance with the above definitions, the ulti- 
mate efficiency be a function only of Xu and be

It be evident that u(xu) have a maximum value, since 
the numerator in Eq. (2.8) be finite and vanishes both 
a Xu approach zero and a it approach infinity.14 
Figure 3 show the dependence of u(xo) a a function 
of X g ‚Ä¢15 It be see that the maximum efficiency be ap- 
proximately 44% and come for an Xg value of 2.2 in 
term of a temperature of 6000 0 K for the sun. This 
corresponds to an energy gap value give by Eq. (2.3) 
of 1.1 ev. 

3. CURRENT-VOLTAGE RELATIONSHIP 
FOR A SOLAR CELL 

In this section we shall consider a solar cell sub- 
jected to radiation from the sun, which be consider 
to subtend a small solid angle a represent in Fig. 
2 (b). The treatment will be base upon determine 
the steady state current-voltage condition which pre- 
vails on the basis of require that hole-electron pair 
be eliminate a rapidly a they be produced. In 
order to carry out the calculation, five process must 
be considered: (1) generation of hole-electron pair by 
the incident solar radiation, the rate for the entire 
device be Fs; (2) the radiative recombination of 
hole-electron pair with resultant emission of photons, 
the rate be Fe; (3) other nonradiative process 
which result in generation and (4) recombination of 
hole-electron pairs; and (5) removal of hole from the 
p-type region and electron from the n-type region in 
the form of a current I which withdraws hole-electron 
pair at a rate II q. The steady state current-voltage 
relationship be obtain by set the sum of these 
five process equal to zero. 

Consider first the net rate of generation of hole- 
electron pair for the solar battery of Fig. 2 (a) under 
the condition in which it be surround by a blackbody 
at it own temperature, Tc¬•-O. Under these condition 
photon with frequency high than Vo will be incident 
per unit area per unit time on the surface at a rate 
Qe, where Qe=Q(vy,Tc) a give by Eq. (2.2). Evidently 
Qc be a function of the form Te3 time a function of 
xol xc. The number of these photon which enter the 
cell and produce hole-electron pair be represent by 

14 For the calculations, numerical table of the integral in- 
volved be use a give by K. H. Bohm and B. Schlender, Z. 
Astrophysik 43, 95 (1957). We be indebted to A. Unsold who 
direct our attention to this publication. A convenient aid to 
such calculation be a slide rule, manufacture by A. G. Thornton, 
Ltd., Manchester, England. It be described by W. Makowski, 
Rev. Sci. Instr. 20, 884 (1949). 

15 Similar conclusion have be reach by H. A. Muser, Z. 
Physik, 148, 385 (1957), who estimate approximately 47% for the 
maximum of u(xa), but do not show a curve. Results similar 
to those described above have also be derive by W. Teutsch, 
in an internal report of General Atomic Division of General 
Dynamics, and by H. Ehrenreich and E. O. Kane, in an internal 
report of the General Electric Research Laboratories. A curve 
which be quantitatively nearly the same have also be published, 
since the submission of this article, by M. Wolf (see footnote 6) 
who defines the ordinate a "portion of sun's energy which be 
utilized in pair production," a definition have the same quan- 
titative significance but a different interpretation from our 
quantity u(Xy). 

Feo, where 

(3.1) 

In this expression, te represent the probability that an 
incident photon of energy great than Eg will enter 
the body and produce a hole-electron pair. A be the 
area of the body. 

The total rate of generation of hole-electron pair 
due to the solar radiation fall upon the body be 
give by 

(3.2) 

in which the factor fw be a geometrical factor, take 
into account the limited angle from which the solar 
energy fall upon the body. t8 be the probability that 
incident photon will produce a hole-electron pair and 
may differ from te because of the difference in the 
spectral distribution of the blackbody radiation at 
temperature Tc and T s , and the dispersion of the re- 
flection coefficient or transmission coefficient for the 
surface of the battery. 

The geometrical factor fw be dependent upon the 
solid angle subtend by the sun and the angle of 
incidence upon the solar battery. The solid angle sub- 
tend by the sun be denote by W s , where 

ws=7r(DI L)2j4 = 7r(1.39/149)2j4 
(3.3) = 6.85 X 10-5 sr, 

and D, L are, respectively, the diameter and distance 
of the sun, take a 1.39 and 149 million km. 

If the solar cell be isotropic (i.e., be itself a sphere) 
then it be evident that fw should be simply the fraction 
of the solid angle about the sphere subtend by the 
sun, so that 

(3.4) 

If the cell be a flat plate with project area A p, then it 
be more natural to deal with incident energy on the 
basis of the project area A p rather than the total

area of both sides, which be 2A p. In term of A p the 
total power fall on the cell is: 

incident power=ApP.w. cosOlrr, (3.5) 

where 8 be the angle between the normal to the cell and 
the direction of the sun. This expression integrates a 
it should to A pP 8 when w. be integrate over a hemi- 
sphere (2rr steradians) since cosO have an average value 
of t. For normal incidence, the incident power be thus: 

incident power=ApPsfw, 
where 

jw=ws/rr= 2.18X 10-6‚Ä¢ 

(3.6) 

(3.7) 

It be evident that the rate of generation of hole-electron 
pair by solar photon involves the same factor so that 
this value of f", should be use in Eq. (3.2). The black- 
body radiation from the cell come from an area of 
2Ap so that 

(3.8) 

The rate of recombination, with resultant radiation, 
of hole-electron pair depends upon the disturbance 
from equilibrium. For the case in which the battery be 
in equilibrium, and be surround by a blackbody at 
temperature T e, the rate of emission of photon due to 
recombination must be exactly equal to the rate of 
absorption of photon which produce recombination. 
As discuss above, this be give by Feo in Eq. (3.1). 
To begin with, we shall consider that the only radiative 
recombination of importance be direct recombination 
between free hole and electron and be accordingly 
proportional to the product of the hole ~nd electro.n 
density, i.e., to the product np. When th1S product 1S 
equal to the thermal equilibrium value n?, the rate .of 
recombination will be F co. Accordingly we may wnte 
for Fe, the rate of radiative recombination throughout 
the cell, 

F e(V)=F cOnp/ni2=F cO exp(V lYe), (3.9) 

in which V represent the difference in imrefs or quasi- 
Fermi level for hole and electrons, and the product 
np be proportional to the Boltzmann factor for this 
difference express a a voltage.I6 V be evidently the 
voltage between the terminal connect to the p- and 
n-regions of the solar cellI7 ; I' e stand for kTcI q. 

The net rate of increase of hole-electron pair in- 
volves, in addition to generation, correspondi~g ~o f!., 
and recombination, correspond to Fe, nonradlatlVe 
process and removal of hole-electron pair by current 
to the external circuit. The nonradiative recombination 
and generation process be represent by R(V) and 
R(O) respectively. They will be equal for V =0, the 
thermal equilibrium condition. The algebraic sum of 
the rate of increase of hole-electron pair must vanish 

16 For example: W. Shockley, ]{lecirons and Holes in Semicon- 
ductors (D. Van Nostrand Company, Inc., Princeton, New Jersey, 
1950) p. 308; the product of Eqs. (18) and (19).

J. 28, 435 (1949), Sec. 5. 

for the steady state condition. This lead to 

O=F.-Fe(V)+R(O)-R(V)-I/q (310) 
= Fs- F co+[F eO- Fe(V)+ R(O) - R(V) J- II q. . 

In Eq. (3.10) the quantity in square bracket repre- 
sent the net rate of generation of hole-electron pair 
when the cell be surround by a blackbody at tempera- 
ture Te. If the cell be so surrounded, it be evident that 
the term F.-Feo vanishes. The steady state condition, 
under these circumstances, give the current-voltage 
characteristic of the cell in the absence of a disturbance 
in the radiation field. On the other hand, if the cell be 
surround by cold space, it will generate a small 
open-circuit reverse voltage due to the -Feo term. 

In order to describe the current-voltage character- 
istics of the cell we introduce the quantity fe, which 
represent the fraction of the recombination-generation 
current which be radiative. This lead to 

For the particularly simple case, which occurs in ger- 
manium p-n junctions, that the nonradiative recom- 
bination fit the ideal rectifier equation, we can write 

R(V)=R(O) exp(V IVe). (3.12) 

For this condition fe be a constant independent of 
voltage, and be give by 

(3.13) 

Under these condition the current-voltage character- 
istic for the cell in the absence of radiative disturbance 
be give by 

where 
I =Io[1-exp(VIVe)], 

Io=q[Feo+R(O)] 

be the reverse saturation current. 

(3.14) 

(3.15) 

It be note that this equation differs in sign from the 
usual rectifier equation, the convention chosen in this 
paper be that current flow into the cell in what 
be normally the reverse direction be regard a positive, 
and voltage across the cell in the normally forward 
direction be also regard a positive. These be the 
polarity exist when the illuminate cell be furnish- 
ing power to an external load, so that positive value 
of I and V correspond to the cell act a a power 
source. 

For an energy gap of 1.09 ev and a temperature of 
.')OOoK, Q c be 1.7 X loa cm-2 secl ‚Ä¢ Thus per cm2 of sur- 
face the recombination current be 2.7XIo-I6 amp. For 
a planar cell with tc= 1 radiate from both side this 
lead to a contribution to 10 of S.4X1O-16 amp/cm2 of 
junction area, accord to Eq. (3.8). As discuss in 
Sec. 6, actual cell have current large by about 10 
order of magnitude, so that je"'" 10-1¬∞. 

In the event that R(V) do not obey Eq. (3.12), 
then the quantity fe must be regard a a function of 



EFFICIENCY OF p-n JCNCTION SOLAR CELLS 515 

the voltage, so that [0 must be regard a voltage 
dependent. 

The current-voltage relationship for the cell when 
subject to radiant energy may be obtain by solv- 
ing Eq. (3.10) for I. This lead tol8 : 

1= q(Fs- Feo)+ (qFeo/ fe)[l-exp(V /Ve)J 
= I sh+Io[l-exp(V/Ve)], 

(3.16) 

in which the symbol I8h represent the short circuit 
current correspond to V = 0, and for the case of a 
planar cell of project area A p be give by 

Ish=-q(Fs- F co) = qA p(jwt,Qs- 2tcQc) 
=qFs=-qA p(fwl,Q.). (3.17) 

The last form in Eq. (3.17) corresponds to the approxi- 
mation that in most condition of interest the solar 
energy fall upon the body produce hole-electron 
pair at a rate that be so much large than would black- 
body radiation at the cell's temperature that the latter 
term can be neglect in comparison with the former. 

The open-circuit voltage Vop which the cell would 
exhibit be obtain by solve Eq. (3.16) for the case 
of 1=0. This lead to 

Vop= Ve In[(Ish/Io)+lJ 
= Ve In[(feFs/Feo)-fe+1]. 

(3.18) 

This particular solution be valid for the case in which 
R depends upon voltage a give in Eq. (3.12). Other- 
wise, Eq. (3.18) will contain the open-circuit voltage 
in the term 10 on the right side of the equation. 

As discuss in connection with Eq. (3.17), for most 
case of interest the solar energy fall on the cell will 
be very large compare to blackbody radiation at the 
temperature of the cell, and accordingly the term 
which do not involve Fs in Eq. (3.18) can be neglect 
in comparison, a long a fe be not too small. This lead 
to the approximate result 

in which it be see that the geometrical and transmission 
factor together with the effect of excess recombination 
over radiative recombination may be lump together 
in the single expression f, where 

(3.20) 

The factor 2 come from the fact that sunlight fall on 
only one of the two side of the planar cell. [See 
Eq. (3.8).J 

It be thus evident that a far a open-circuit voltage 
be concerned, similar result be produce by any of the 
four follow variations: (1) reduce the efficiency of 
transmission of solar photon into the cell; (2) reduce 

18 Equations like (3.16) occur in publish treatment of solar- 
cell efficiency. The difference be that the term in Ish due to Fco, 
which be small but require by the principle of detailed balance, 
be included, and the coefficient of 10 be related to the fundamental 
minimum reverse saturation current rather than to a semi- 
empirical value. 

the solid angle sub tend by the sun, or (3) it angle of 
incidence upon the solar cell; or (4) introduce addi- 
tional nonradiative recombination processes, thus mak- 
ing small the fraction of the recombination which be 
radiative. 

The maximum open-circuit voltage which may be 
obtain from the cell, in accordance with the theory 
presented, be the energy gap Vg. This occurs a the 
temperature of the cell be reduce towards zero. Under 
these circumstance the quantity Qe tends towards 
zero and the logarithm in Eq. (3.19) to large values. 
The limit behavior can be understood by note 
that in accordance with Eq. (2.2) we have 

-lnQe=hvg/kTc+order of InTe 
= Vu/Ve+order of InTe. 

(3.21) 

The term which be of the order Ve InTe vanish a 
To and Ve approach zero in Eq. (3.19), so that 

(3.22) 

At high temperature the voltage be only a fraction 
of Vg' This fractionl9 denote by v may be express a 
a function of three of the four variable discuss in 
the introduction for the important case in which the 
last two term in the In term of Eq. (3.18) can be neg- 
lected. The necessary manipulation to establish this 
relationship be a follows: 

= (xci Xg) function of (xg,xe and f) (3.23) 

(3.24) 

where the integrands be each that of Eq. (2.2). [For 
case of very low illumination in which the approxi- 
mation of Eq. (3.19) would not hold, v also depends 
explicitly on fe.J 

In the follow two section we shall consider expres- 
sion for the output power in term of the open-circuit 
voltage and short circuit current just discussed. 

4. NOMINAL EFFICIENCY 

For the geometrical configuration represent in 
Fig. 2 (b), the incident power fall from the sun 
upon the solar cell may evidently be write in the 
form 

Pine= fwAPs=AfwhvgQ8/U(Xg), (4.1) 

in which Eq. (2.8) have be use to introduce the 
ultimate efficiency function u(Xg) for purpose of sim- 
plifying subsequent manipulations. ~ 

A nominal efficiency can be define in term of the 

19 As for Eq. (3.16), factor like v have be introduce by 
various authors, most recently by M. Wolf (see footnote 6). 
However, the form be dependent upon additional semiempirical 
quantity so that they cannot be use for the purpose give in 
the introduction.

voltage Vop and the short circuit current I. it ‚Ä¢ The actual 
efficiency will be somewhat low since the current- 
voltage characteristic be not perfectly rectangular. We 
shall consider the problem of match the impedance 
in the follow section. 

The nominal efficiency in term of open-circuit volt- 
age and short circuit current be evidently give by 

Voplsh/ Pinc = VopAqj",tsQ./[Aj",hllIlQ,,/U(Xy)] 
= (V op/V g)u(Xy)t, (4.2) 
= v (Xg,xc,j)u (xg)t" 

in which the symbol v be the ratio of Eq. (3.23) of the 
open-circuit voltage Vop to the ultimate voltage V g 
that could be obtain if the battery be at zero 
temperature. 

5. DETAILED BALANCE LIMIT OF 
EFFICIENCY AND 'r1(X.,xc,t.,f) 

The maximum power output from the solar battery 
be obtain by choose the voltage V so that the 
product IV be a maximum. In accordance with the 
current-voltage relationship, Eq. (3.16), and Eq. (3.18) 
for the open-circuit voltage, the current-voltage rela- 
tionship may be rewrite in the form 

1=1811+10-10 exp(V/VJ 
= Io[exp(Vop/V c) -exp(V /V c)]. 

(5.1) 

The maximum power occurs when20: 

d(IV)/dV=O 

This equation may be conveniently rewrite by intro- 
ducing the symbol 

Zop= Vop/Vc=vxv/xc, Zm= V(max)/V c, (5.3) 

In which V (max) be the voltage which satisfies Eq. 

20 Similar maximization of the output power have be carry 
out in term of the maximum area rectangle on the J- V plot by 
various authors, in particular W. G. Pfann and W. van Roos- 
broeck (See footnote 2). The result do not, however, appear to 
have be publish in analytic form in which the match 
factor m be show to be a function solely of the variable zop 
= Vop!Vc=v(xo,xc,f)(xo!xc). 

(5.2). Substituting the symbol introduce in Eq. (5.3) 
into Eq. (5.2) lead readily to the relationship 

(5.4) 

This gIves the functional relation between the C?pen- 
circuit voltage and the voltage at which maximum 
power be obtained. In effect it establishes a functional 
relationship between Zm and Zop, and thus between Zm 
and the variable f, Xc and XII' 

It be see that the open-circuit voltage be always 
large than the voltage for maximum output, and when 
both voltage be small compare to thermal voltage 
V" then Eq. (5.4) lead to a maximum power voltage 
equal to one-half the open-circuit voltage, the situation 
correspond to a battery with an ohmic internal 
resistance. On the other hand, when either Zop or Zm 
be large compare to unity, then the ratio between the 
two approach unity.20 

The maximum power be small than the nominal 
power IshVop by the impedance match factor m, 
where m be give by 

m= I[V(max) JV(max)/ Ish Vop 
=zm2/ (1 +zm-e-zm)[zm+ln(l +Zm)] 
=m(vxy/xe) =m(xy,xc,j). (5.5) 

Figure 4 show the dependence of m upon Zop obtain 
by compute pair of value of m(zm) and Zop(Zm) for 
various value of Zm. The limit of mare 0.25 and 1.0 
for small and large value of Zop. 

In term of m the efficiency 1) can now be express a 
a function of the four variable Xy, Xc, t s , and j intro- 
duced in Sec. 1. The detailed balance limit corresponds 
to set 18=1 and f= fw/2. The efficiency 1) may be

To summarize, the efficiency be define a the electrical 
power out of the cell into a match load, divide by 
the incident solar energy fall on the cell. The factor 
in Eq. (5.6) be a follows: t be the probability, average 
over incident solar photon have sufficient energy to 
produce electron-hole pairs,lthat a photon will produce 
an electron-hole pair; u(Xy) be the ultimate efficiency in 
accordance with Eq. (2.1); V(Xg,Xe,j) be the ratio of the 
open-circuit voltage to the energy gap of the cell; and 
m(vxg/Xe) be the impedance match factor, which be a 
function of the ratio of the open-circuit voltage to 
thermal voltage for the cell. 

In the follow section result of calculation of '1J be 
present and compare with the semiempirical limit 
of efficiency. 

6. CONCLUSIONS 

Efficiencies compute on the basis of Eq. (5.6) be 
show in Figs. 5 and 6 a a function of Vo, base upon 
the follow value for the parameters: 

xe=Tc/Ts=0.05 (Ts=6000oK, Te=3000K) 
(6.1) 

xg=qVg/kTs = 1.94Vg. 
Curves be give for different value of the parameter 
j. Figure 5 show the decrease of the efficiency with 
f lower from it maximum value 1 by factor of 10-a‚Ä¢ 
For Fig. 6, f be calculate accord to it definition 
(3.20). Curve (f) corresponds to a perfectly absorb 
cell (tc=ts= 1) with normal incidence (jw=ws/rr) and 
no nonradiative recombination (je= 1). Curves (g), 
(h) and (i) be calculate on the assumption of 90% 
absorption with a value of 1.36X 10-6 for fw, which 

give 100 mw/cm2 incident power, and different value 
of fe. 

Also on Fig. 6 be show the generally accepted curve 
for the "limit conversion efficiency." This curve be in 
agreement with Prince3 and Loferski4 a report by 
Wolf.6 Also show be the value of 14% for silicon solar 
cells, which Wolf6 report a the best achieve to date. 

On the basis of the semiempirical limit it would 
appear that silicon solar cell might be improve by 
from 14 to 21.7%, an improvement of a factor of 1.55. 
On the basis of the detailed balance limit, the improve- 
ment might be 14 to 26% [curve (g)], or a factor of 
1.9. The true physical limit for silicon must lie some- 
where between these two limits. 

Figure 7 show the current voltage characteristic 
for several silicon solar cells. These be discuss 
further in the Appendix. The figure also show the 
minimum forward current characteristic for a planar 
cell with tc= 1 a discuss in Sec. 3. 

Somewhere between the empirical curve and the 
limit set by detailed balance be a true limit determine 
basically by the fact that silicon be element 14 in the 
Periodic Table and have a certain rate of "unavoidable"21 
nonradiative transitions. 

On the basis of the precede paragraph two ques- 
tions be obvious: (1) Where be the true physical limit 
and what process determine it? (2) What determines 
the location of the present experimental curves? 

It be evident that question (1) will be difficult if not 
impossible to answer before question (2) be answered. 
We shall first discus question (2).

efficiency that the empirical data be not in agreement 
with the diffusion theory of p-n junctionsP This theory 
predicts that forward current vary a exp (qV/AkT) 
with A = 1. The experimental data conform typically 
to A value of about two to three at room temperature 
(see Appendix). There be a theory which predicts an A 
value of two over a range of voltages23 and this theory 
have recently be confirm for heavily gold-doped 
silicon.24 Nevertheless, the calculation of efficiency 
which give the semiempirical curve of Fig. 6 be base 
upon the diffusion theory. 

The origin of A value a high a three be at present 
largely a mystery. As discuss in the Appendix, two 
explanation involve series resistance and surface 
current can be rejected. 

Wolf25 proposes that the explanation may be internal 
field emission of the form report by Chynoweth and 
McKay.26 Such a current will clearly be of the non- 
radiative type and will reduce fe. Thus, if it occurs, it 
be clear that solar cell can be improve by widen 
the transition region slightly since tunnel decrease 
exponentially with the width. If Wolf's propose ex- 
planation be correct, therefore, it seem improbable 
that it would not have be eliminate in the large 
amount of development direct towards improve 
exist solar cells. 

It be the conjecture of the present author that the 
large value of A and large reverse current both arise 
from recombination centers. 

One recent observation which appear to support this 
view be the find by Wolf and Prince27 that "optimiza- 
tion of power conversion from light into electrical power 
result in device with extremely soft reverse charac- 
teristics." Since soft reverse characteristic be clearly 
evidence of unnecessary current path in p-n junctions, 
it be clear that they cannot of themselves contribute to 
the efficiency. An attractive explanation of this seem- 
ingly contradictory observation be that the softness 
result from the precipitation of impurities. Evidence 
that such precipitate cause soft reverse characteristic 
with current proportional to Vn, with n range from 
about four to seven, have be report by Goetzberger 
and Shockley,28 a well a mean of remove certain

metal impurity by "gettering."29 This explanation 
cannot be checked from the publication of Wolf and 
Prince, who give no data on reverse characteristic and 
who state, "Since the solar cell be operate exclusively 
in the forward direction, no attention need be paid to 
the reverse characteristic of the device." This be not in 
agreement with the view of the present author that 
an attempt should be make to understand a fully a 
possible the physic of the p-n junction involved. 

A theory base on recombination center by which 
A value a high a three may be explain might 
possibly be developed along the follow lines: In a 
forward bias junction the recombination occurs pre- 
dominantly in a very narrow region in which the elec- 
trostatic potential varies by about 2kT / q.23 As the po- 
tential be varied, this region should move in position. 
If it move into a region of low recombination center 
density, value of A great than two will arise. If the 
recombination center be highly charged, they may 
be distribute in a very nonuniform manner through 
the junction.30 ,3! Further investigations, which be cur- 
rently be undertaken, be require to appraise this 
theory. If the theory do prove to be correct, important 
improvement in solar cell can probably be make by 
reduce contamination by chemical impurities. 

An example of a new area in which a detailed balance 
treatment be need be the proposal that a solar cell 
may be improve by add trap to it to absorb the 
longer wavelength radiation.32 It appear to the present 
author that this may well be equivalent to shunt 
one cell with a threshold vo=Eo/h with another cell 
with a threshold much lower. Such a combination of 
cell would appear more likely to low than to raise 
efficiency. A detailed balance argument, involve only 
radiative transition for the traps, would set an upper 
limit for such a model like that of the curve for fe= 1 
on Fig. 5. The present author anticipate that trap 
will probably low this limit; trap in general con- 
tribute strongly to recombination because they facilitate 
deliver energy to phonons. This implies that trap 
inherently have low fe values, so that it be improbable 
that they would improve efficiency. 

Returning briefly to question (1), we may note that 
one inherent process which may reduce fe be the Auger 
effect, in which the energy of recombination be carry 
off by a hole or an electron.33 Another mechanism that 
may have to be consider be the formation of donor 
and acceptor complex at the high dope level em- 
ployed. These may also act a recombination centers. 
In any junction form at high temperatures, there 
will be certain density of vacancy and even disloca- 
tion loops. These imperfection do not appear to be

Graded energy gap structure for solar cell to aid in 
collection efficiency be discuss by W Olf6 follow 
previous proposal for increase emitter efficiency.34 
Such structure will in general also involve a gradation 
of lattice constant, and for minimum free energy sub- 
ject to a fix concentration gradient, there will be an 
equilibrium density of dislocation which reduce the 
store elastic energy. These dislocation will, of course, 
have a deleterious effect on lifetime, diffusion length, 
and collection efficiency. The probable necessity of 
their presence do not appear to have be note in 
the cite pUblications. 

Note add in prooj. The presence of slip band due 
to stress in thin, heavily doped, diffuse layer in silicon 
have recently be observed.3s The associate disloca- 
tions may be important in reduce solar-cell efficiency.

where v be the function of three variable define in 
Sec. 4. The final expression for efficiency be a function 
of five variables: 

7]* (xy,xc,ts,j*, V / /V c) 
= (t x V / / c) Vu(xg)v(Xg,xc,j*)m(vxa! xc). 

Values of 1)* calculate for the three cell of Fig. 7 
be show in Table I. The value for the five variable 
need for the calculation be a follows: t8=O.97=tc36 ; 
V/ from Fig. 6, V c=25.9 mv correspond to 300oK; 
j*= j",j/t./2tc with j",= 1.36X 10-5 in order to give 
100 mw/cm2 on the expose surface; j/=qQcAp/I* 
where qQc= 1.6XlO-19 X 1.7 X 103=2.7X 10--16 amp/cm2 ; 
and 1*/ A p be take from Fig. 7. 

The fact that the calculate value of 7]* be about 
twice a large a the measure value be evidence, a 
have be point out in the reference cited, of loss 
due to collection efficiency, series resistance, etc. If 
these loss could be avoided, the cell would have an 
efficiency of about 14%, which be the high value 
obtain to date. 6 

This value be about half the limit efficiency of Fig. 
6. Thus a significant potential for improvement of cell 
appear to exist by improve junction characteristics. 
The first step toward this improvement appear to be 
an understand of the physic behind the high V / 
values.
