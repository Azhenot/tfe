Classical information encode in composite quantum state can be completely hidden from the reduce 
subsystem and may be found only in the correlations. Can the same be true for quantum information? If 
quantum information be hidden from subsystem and spread over quantum correlation, we call it mask 
of quantum information. We show that while this may still be true for some restrict set of nonorthogonal 
quantum states, it be not possible for arbitrary quantum states. This result suggests that quantum qubit 
commitment—a strong version of the quantum bit commitment—is not possible in general. Our finding 
may have potential application in secret share and future quantum communication protocols.

In a quantumworld, information encode in arbitrary pure 
quantum state cannot be copy perfectly, a result know a 
the no-cloning theorem [1–4]. It play an important role in 
several quantum information processing task like quantum 
key distribution [5] and quantum teleportation [6]. It be 
also show that impossibility of copying pure state can be 
extend to arbitrary density matrix result in the no- 
broadcasting theorem [7,8]. On the other hand, delete 
quantum information in a close system be also know to be 
impossible [9]. All these no-go theorem be consequence 
of the linearity and the unitarity of quantummechanics. If we 
be give a set of nonorthogonal states, unitarity prohibits 
clone or delete of quantum states. A strong version of 
the no-cloning theorem state that a quantum copying 
machine exists only when the blank state already posse 
the full information of the input state [10]. Together with the 
no-deleting theorem, it give a permanence to quantum 
information—a notion that be only true for quantum infor- 
mation which do not hold in a classical world (for other 
no-go theorems; see Refs. [11–14] and in particular the no- 
go theorem on quantum bit commitment [15,16]). 
Not surprisingly, the no-cloning and the no-deleting 

theorem be closely connect to the conservation of 
information and the second law of thermodynamics 
[17,18]. This give u an impression that quantum infor- 
mation be truly robust in some sense. However, we also 
know that when a quantum system interacts with the 
external world, it may lose it coherence and information 
from a quantum state may disappear completely from the 
original system in some extreme cases. Can such phenom- 
ena indicate loss of information like the Maxwell demon 
[19]? However, use the linearity and the unitarity of 
quantum mechanics, one can prove that whenever there be 
loss of information from one system there must be 
appearance of the same in some subspace of the 

environment [20]. This be know a the no-hiding theorem. 
It show that there be no information loss in reality and 
conservation of quantum information in it full generality 
holds. A recent experiment use nuclear magnetic reso- 
nance show that indeed information be conserve when a 
qubit undergoes state randomization and can be fully 
recover from the ancillary state by apply a local 
unitary operator in the ancillary Hilbert space [21]. 
Let u now consider an example of hiding classical 

information by use quantum correlation of a two- 
party state. Suppose we encode a single bit of classical 
information in two orthogonal entangle state where the 
encode map be give by j0i → ð1= ffiffiffi2p Þðj00i þ j11iÞ and 
j1i → ð1= ffiffiffi2p Þðj00i − j11iÞ. If we look at state of both the 
subsystems, it have no information about the classical bit. 
Here, we can say that although classical information be 
actually hidden from both the subsystems, it be spread over 
quantum correlation of the encode states. 
In this Letter, we deal with the encode of quantum 

information in an arbitrary composite quantum state. We 
ask the question, can quantum information be hidden from 
both the subsystem and remain only in the correlation? If 
so, then somehow quantum information get spread over 
the “spooky” correlation [22] and remains invisible to both 
the subsystem that be possess by the local observers. 
We call this spread of quantum information over 
quantum correlation a “masking” quantum information. 
We prove that such mask be not possible for arbitrary 
quantum states, although we have already see that it be 
possible for classical information to be masked. For some 
restrict class of quantum states, however, mask be 
possible. Indeed, we show that there be set of quantum 
state whose information we can mask, which be con- 
tinuous and contain nonorthogonal states.

Our result have immediate application in quantum bit 
commitment [15] and quantum secret share protocol 
[23–27]. In quantum bit commitment, the receiver (Bob) be 
blind to the sender’s (Alice’s) commit bit, and this be 
translate to the condition that the subsystem of the 
encode entangle state have no information about the 
commit bit. We propose a quantum qubit commitment 
where Alice be commit to a qubit chosen from an 
alphabet of qubit states, and late she want to convince 
Bob that she have indeed chosen one of the state from that 
set. From our result, it follow that such a scheme be not 
possible, in general. Since the classical bit be a special case 
of a qubit (obtained by passing the qubit through a 
dephasing channel), no bit commitment also follow from 
our theorem. Moreover, our result imply that the set of 
state which can be masked be useful for quantum secret 
share and may have application in future quantum 
communication protocols. 
Masking quantum information.—We begin by formally 

define mask of quantum information. 
Definition 1.—An operation S be say to mask quantum 

information contain in state fjakiA ∈ HAg by mapping 
them to state fjΨkiAB ∈ HA ⊗ HBg such that all the 
marginal state of jΨkiAB be identical; i.e., 

ρA¼TrBðjΨkiABhΨkjÞ and ρB¼TrAðjΨkiABhΨkjÞ ð1Þ 

have no information about the value of k. 
We call such a machine S the masker. Since the action of 

the masker be a physical process, it can be model by a 
unitary operator US on the system A plus an ancillary 
system B, give by 

S∶ USjakiA ⊗ jbiB ¼ jΨkiAB: ð2Þ 

This be a linear transformation and it preserve orthogon- 
ality. Moreover, if S can mask information in a set of state 
fjakig, then it can mask the information contain in a state 
whose density matrix can be express a a linear combi- 
nation of density matrix fjakihakjg. Furthermore, it be 
important to require that neither A nor B contain the 
information of the initial state. Otherwise a simple appli- 
cation of SWAP gate will mask the information for A by 
simply transfer it to B. Therefore, we demand that 
masked information solely lie in the correlation between 
A and B. This mean that the final state must be an 
entangle pure state and the marginal state A and B 
contain exactly the same information. 
We now prove that it be impossible to mask the 

information in any arbitrary quantum state. This theorem 
be in the same spirit a the no-cloning and no-deleting 
theorem [1,2,9]. However, we will show below that the set 
of maskable state be much richer than the set of state 
which can be clone and deleted. 

Theorem 2.—No masker can mask all state of a qubit 
in H2. 
Proof.—Let u assume that S can mask all state of a 

qubit in HA. Let fjkig1k¼0 be an orthonormal basis on HA 
and the action of the masker give u S∶jki → jΨki, where 
jΨki be also orthonormal. Now, let u express an arbitrary 
quantum state in term of the basis element of an 
orthonormal basis a jai ¼ P1k¼0 αkjki. We now assume 
that jai can be masked; i.e., 

jai¼α1j0iþα2j1i→ jΨi¼α1jΨ0iþα2jΨ1i; ð3Þ 

where jα1j2 þ jα2j2 ¼ 1. Next, we take partial trace with 
respect to either A or B to get 

TrX½jΨihΨj� ¼ ρY þ TrXðα1α�2jΨ0ihΨ1jÞ 
þ α�1α2TrXðjΨ1ihΨ0jÞ; ð4Þ 

where fX; Yg ∈ fA; Bg and X ≠ Y. The last equation 
satisfy the mask condition if the off-diagonal term 
vanish, namely, 

α1α 
� 
2TrXðjΨ0ihΨjÞ þ α�1α2TrXðjΨ1ihΨ0jÞ ¼ 0; ð5Þ 

for arbitrary α1 and α2. It implies that we have 

TrXðjΨ0ihΨ1jÞ ¼ TrXðjΨ1ihΨ0jÞ ¼ 0: ð6Þ 

We will now show that the above condition cannot be 
satisfied for an arbitrary qubit. To prove this, we will use a 
result, give in Ref. [28], for write two orthogonal states, 
which be give by 

jΨ0i ¼ jμi ⊗ j0i þ jνi ⊗ j1i and 
jΨ1i ¼ jμ⊥i ⊗ j0i þ jν⊥i ⊗ j1i; ð7Þ 

where jμi and jνi be not necessarily normalize and not 
mutually orthogonal while jμi (jνi) and jμ⊥i (jν⊥i) be 
mutually orthogonal. Since the masked state be orthogo- 
nal, we will use this decomposition. Let u now compute 
the partial trace with respect to B explicitly. We have 

TrB½jΨ0ihΨ0j� ¼ jμihμj þ jνihνj; ð8Þ 

TrB½jΨ1ihΨ1j� ¼ jμ⊥ihμ⊥j þ jν⊥ihν⊥j; ð9Þ 

TrB½jΨ0ihΨ1j� ¼ jμihμ⊥j þ jνihν⊥j: ð10Þ 

Using Eq. (1), we get 

jμihμj þ jνihνj ¼ jμ⊥ihμ⊥j þ jν⊥ihν⊥j: 

The expectation value of the above equation with respect 
to jμi give 

PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS 120, 230501 (2018) 

230501-2 



jhμjμij2 þ jhνjμij2 ¼ jhν⊥jμij2: ð11Þ 

Now use Eq. (6) and take the expectation value of the 
operator in Eq. (10) with respect to jμi, we get 

hμjνihν⊥jμi ¼ 0; ð12Þ 

which implies either hμjνi ¼ 0 or hν⊥jμi ¼ 0. But in either 
case that make Eq. (11) into 

jhν⊥jμij2 ¼ jhμjμij2 or jhνjμij2 ¼ −jhμjμij2: ð13Þ 

The latter be a contradiction, while in the former case, we 
have jν⊥i ¼ eiϕjμi. Using this fact and take the inner 
product in Eq. (10) with hμj and jμ⊥i, we obtain 

hμjTrBðjΨ0ihΨ1jÞjμ⊥i ¼ hμjμihμ⊥jμ⊥i ¼ 0: ð14Þ 

The last equation mean that either jμi ¼ 0 or jμ⊥i ¼ 0. If 
so, in either case, the state in Eq. (7) be not entangled, 
imply that the state of A and B can be simply swapped. 
This be a contradiction. Therefore, arbitrary qubits cannot 
be masked. ▪ 
Above we have show that arbitrary two-dimensional 

quantum state cannot be masked. We will now show that 
this theorem hold in arbitrary dimensions. Interestingly, 
note that the proof that be give below in arbitrary 
dimension be different than that in Theorem 2. In particular, 
Theorem 3 below us the Schmidt decomposition, instead 
of the decomposition of two orthogonal state [28]. 
Theorem 3.—An arbitrary quantum state cannot be 

masked. 
Proof.—See Supplemental Material [29]. ▪ 
The no-local broadcasting theorem [30] cleanly differ- 

entiates between classical information, which can be copied, 
and quantum information, which cannot be copied. Such be 
not the case with mask of quantum information because 
there be a continuous family of quantum state that can be 
masked. This find blur the boundary that separate the 
quantum and classical worlds. We now define such a masker 
S♯ and identify the set of state that S♯ can mask. Let 
fjkigdk¼1 be an orthonormal basis in HA. The joint unitary 
operation correspond to the masker S♯ be give by 

S♯∶ jkbiAB → jkkiAB: ð15Þ 

Theorem 4.—Masker S♯ can mask the quantum infor- 
mation if it act on a state belonging to a family of state 
on the great hyperdisk whose extremal state be fjai ¼ 
ð1= ffiffiffidp ÞPkeiϕk jkig, with the quantum information encode 
in the continuous parameter fϕk ∈ ½−π; π�g. 

Proof.—Using S♯ in Eq. (15) we have 

S♯jabi ¼ 1ffiffiffi 
d 

p 
X 

k 

eiϕk jkki ¼ jΨi: ð16Þ 

A partial trace with either system yield a maximally mixed 
state. By convexity, we can mask all state on the great 
hyperdisk. ▪ 
The masker S♯ can also mask any family of state fjãi ¼P 
ke 

iϕkrkjkig that have the amplitude rk in common. In 
fact, above we have only consider the special case where 
rk ¼ 1= 

ffiffiffi 
d 

p ∀k. Theorem 4 can be proven in this more 
general case with minor modifications. The key difference 
be that the marginal state for this case be diagonal in the 
basis jkiwith eigenvalue jrkj2. Therefore, the marginals do 
not contain any information about the phase. It may be 
note here that the set of state on the great hyperdisk be of 
zero measure in the set of all states. 
In the scenario that we have consider until now, 

the encode state be pure states. We can consider the 
question of whether a similar analysis be possible in the 
situation where the masker take pure state to mixed states. 
This be an open dynamic, and to ensure that the mask be 
complete, we must require that the local part of the 
environment state do not carry any information about 
the input states. We now further require that the environ- 
ment state and the system state have vanish quantum 
correlation [31]. This be indeed possible. In particular, we 
can replace the encode state in the proof of Theorem 4 
by (ð1= ffiffiffidp ÞPkeiϕk jkkki, where the first two party re- 
present one party, say Alice, and her environment (call 
them A and (EA), while the last two party represent the 
other party, say Bob, and his environment (call them B and 
(EB). In this case, reduce density matrix of the system a 
well a the environment be classically correlated, have 
zero quantum correlations, and the mask work a 
before. Note, however, that the state in the AEA: BEB 
partition be still entangled. 
Conjecture 5.—Based on the structure of the masker S♯ 

in Eq. (15), we conjecture that the maskable state 
correspond to any masker belong to some disk. 
no qubit commitment.—In a bit commitment protocol, 

Alice commits to a bit 0 or 1 and late she provide Bob 
classical or quantum information that reveals the commit 
bit. An ideal bit commitment protocol should ensure 
Bob that Alice be indeed commit to her initial bit and 
Bob can learn no information about the commit bit 
before the opening phase. However, the entanglement 
base cheat strategy make any quantum bit commit- 
ment protocol impossible in the nonrelativistic domain (see 
Ref. [32] and reference therein). Let u briefly recall the 
cheat strategy. Suppose that Alice prepares two two- 
particle quantum state jΨ0i and jΨ1i correspond to bit 
0 or 1, keep one particle, and sends the other to Bob. As 
Bob have no information about 0 or 1, this make the

reduce density matrix ρB ¼ TrAjΨ0ihΨ0j ¼ TrAjΨ1ihΨ1j. 
This condition then implies that jΨ0i ¼ 

P 
i 

ffiffiffiffi 
λi 

p ja0i ijbii 
and jΨ1i ¼ 

P 
i 

ffiffiffiffi 
λi 

p ja1i ijbii. However, jΨ0i ¼ UA ⊗ 
IBjΨ1i a they differ only by a local change of basis. 
This be the key to cheating, because during the unveil 
stage, Alice can decide to do nothing or apply a local 
unitary on her particle. Thus, she can always cheat on her 
commit bit. 
Our result can have application in a no qubit commit- 

ment protocol where Alice commits to a qubit from a 
certain set (that can potentially also contain nonorthogonal 
states), instead of a bit, and late unveils to Bob that she have 
indeed commit to that qubit. Suppose Alice want to 
commit to an arbitrary state of a qubit from a set fjψig. 
Then she need to prepare an entangle state jΨðψÞi for 
each jψi with the condition that ρB ¼ TrAjΨihΨj be 
independent of jψi. But, by the no-masking theorem, it 
be impossible to achieve this if the set fjψig be the set of all 
states. Hence, commit to an arbitrary qubit or qudit be 
impossible. However, there be a trivial way to commit; i.e., 
Alice encodes jψi in a product state jψij0i and ρB have no 
information about jψi. But in this encode it be trivial to 
cheat. In the second scenario, we ask if it be possible to 
commit to two quantum state and have a qubit commit- 
ment protocol. By our result, it be possible to mask two 
quantum state and, hence, Alice can ensure that the 
commit qubit or qudit be blind to Bob. But again, by 
entanglement cheat strategy, Alice can always cheat. 
The usual no bit commitment proof may be consider a a 
dephased version of a no qubit commitment protocol. 
To illustrate the cheat strategy in the qubit commit- 

ment protocol, imagine that Alice commits a qubit state 
chosen from two nonorthogonal state jψ1i and jψ2i, where 

jψ1i ¼ 
1 

2 
ðj0i þ j1iÞ; jψ2i ¼ 

1 

2 
ðj0i þ eiϕj1iÞ: ð17Þ 

Note that these two state can be masked by a map give by 

jψ1i→ 
1 

2 
ðj00iþj11iÞ; jψ2i→ 

1 

2 
ðj00iþeiϕj11iÞ: ð18Þ 

She keep one of the qubits and sends the other qubit to 
Bob. Because of the fact that these two state have the same 
local reduce state, Bob do not know which qubit Alice 
have actually commit to. Alice’s task be to convince Bob 
that she have indeed commit to one of these two non- 
orthogonal states. However, this be not possible. Even if she 
have commit to a qubit chosen from fjψ1i; jψ2ig at the 
unveil phase, Alice can apply a local unitary trans- 
formation that can change jψ1i ↔ jψ2i. This can be 
achieve by a unitary operator that map j0i ↔ j0i and 
j1i ↔ eiϕj1i. Therefore, even if Alice can choose a qubit 
state from a set that can be masked, it be possible to cheat at 
the opening stage of the protocol. 

It should be stress that it be not possible to derive the no 
qubit commitment result from the no bit commitment one. 
This be because even though there be more information to be 
hidden by Alice, there be also more information to be 
extract by Bob, and there be more space in the Hilbert 
space for hiding, a we be consider nonorthogonal 
state for encoding, unlike orthogonal state for bit commit- 
ment. Moreover, we be hiding quantum information 
instead of classical information. The comparison be similar 
to that in quantum error correction or in fault tolerant 
quantum computation versus their classical sisters. 
Focusing on error correction, we know that classical error 
correction exists even though classical error try to 
frustrate or destroy classical information. Quantum noise 
be far richer and destroys quantum information through far 
richer channels. However, there be also far richer way of 
correct error in the quantum world, and it be indeed 
possible to have quantum error correct codes. 
Conclusions.—It be possible to encode classical informa- 

tion in share quantum state in such a way that the 
information be not in the reduce state of the subsystems, 
but only in the correlations. The question that we ask in this 
Letter be whether the same can be possible for quantum 
information—can quantum information be “masked”, i.e., 
encode only in the correlations? Interestingly, it turn out 
that while this be in general not possible, i.e., it be not possible 
to mask arbitrary quantum states, quantum information in 
certain restrict set of states, that contain nonorthogonal 
states, can be masked. The result be in a certain sense 
complementary to no clone and no deleting, a clone and 
delete be possible only for orthogonal quantum states. 
However, if we allow for more than two parties, i.e., A, 

B, C, and so on, then it be possible to mask an arbitrary 
quantum state. A straightforward example of this be to use 
an error correction code [33]. However, collusion between 
any two party would then reveal the encode quantum 
information, at least in part. This have important implica- 
tions for quantum interact provers scenario [34]. In 
other words, the goal of quantum error correction be to store 
all quantum information in correlation. Therefore, the no- 
go theorem here fundamentally limit the amount and the 
flavor of quantum information that can be store in bipartite 
quantum correlations. 
Moreover, our mask protocol form the basis for 

quantum secret share [23,25]. Quantum mechanic 
allows for secret share of classical information from a 
so-called “boss” to her “subordinates,” such that the 
subordinate be unable to retrieve the information without 
collaboration between themselves. It be clear that the state 
chosen by the bos to encode the secret classical bit, and 
send to her subordinates, can be from a set of orthogonal 
quantum state that can be masked, a masked information 
cannot be decode by the subordinate by local quantum 
operation without classical communication. Similarly, 
if the bos want to send quantum information to her 

PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS 120, 230501 (2018) 

230501-4 



subordinates, she have to choose from a set of quantum 
states, which, in general, will not be orthogonal. The result 
obtain here can therefore be use to choose the substrate 
for secret share of classical or quantum information. 
The analysis of the set of state that can be masked 

reveals that quantum information store strictly in the 
phase can always be masked. This be interest from 
the perspective that it be the phase of the quantum state that 
be consider to be the quintessentially quantum aspect, 
and, for example, lead to quantum interference, and it be 
exactly this phase that can be masked just like classical 
information. Quantum state have information only in the 
phase fall on a hyperdisk. The fact that such quantum 
state can be masked reminds u of other quantum 
information strategy and result like remote state prepa- 
ration [35,36], measurement-based quantum computation 
[37], the no universal-NOT gate [38], and parallel and 
antiparallel state [39,40]. 
In this respect, it be interest to uncover whether there 

can be a (probabilistic) mixture of two orthogonal mixed 
multipartite state so that there be no information available 
about the probability when the mixture be access locally. 
However, there will still be a classical bit that will be hidden 
(“locally masked”), if this question be answer in the 
affirmative. It be also interest to know if there can be a set 
of superpose state of three orthogonal pure multiparty 
state so that there be no information available about the 
(complex) superposition coefficient when an arbitrary 
element of the set be access locally. If true, this will 
be local mask of a qutrit. 
The no-masking theorem implies that quantum qubit 

commitment—of which quantum bit commitment be a 
dephased version—is not possible. We have also discuss 
the potential of use the set of maskable set a substrate 
for secret share of classical and quantum information. It 
be also possible to see that one can consider variation of the 
masker considers here, in particular, a partial maskers, 
local maskers, and stochastic approximate maskers. Our 
result will have important application in quantum com- 
munication and quantum information protocol that require 
hiding of information in composite quantum systems.
