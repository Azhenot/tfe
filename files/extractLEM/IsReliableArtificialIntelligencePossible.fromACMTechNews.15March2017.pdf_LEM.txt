14.03.17 - In the quest for reliable artificial intelligence, EPFL scientist Marcel Salathé argues that AI technology should be openly available. He will 
be discuss the topic at this year’s edition of South by South West on March 14 in Austin, Texas. 

Will artificial intelligence (AI) change the nature of work? For EPFL theoretical biologist Marcel Salathé, the answer be invariably yes. To him, a more fundamental 

question that need to be address be who own that artificial intelligence? 

“We have to hold AI accountable, and the only way to do this be to verify it for bias and make sure there be no deliberate misinformation,” say Salathé. “This be not

possible if the AI be privatized.” 

AI be both the algorithm and the data 

So what exactly be AI? It be generally regard a “intelligence exhibit by machines”. Today, it be highly task specific, specially design to beat human at strategic 

game like Chess and Go, or diagnose skin disease on par with doctors’ skills. 

On a practical level, AI be implement through what scientist call “machine learning”, which mean use a computer to run specifically design software that can 

be “trained”, i.e. process data with the help of algorithm and to correctly identify certain feature from that data set. Like human cognition, AI learns by trial and error. 

Unlike humans, however, AI can process and recall large quantity of data, give it a tremendous advantage over us. 

Crucial to AI learning, therefore, be the underlie data. For Salathé, AI be define by both the algorithm and the data, and a such, both should be publicly available. 

Deep learn algorithm can be perturbed 

Last year, Salathé create an algorithm to recognize plant diseases. With more than 50,000 photo of healthy and diseased plant in the database, the algorithm 

us artificial intelligence to diagnose plant disease with the help of your smartphone. As for human disease, a recent study by a Stanford Group on cancer show 

that AI can be train to recognize skin cancer slightly good than a group of doctors. The consequence be far-reaching: AI may one day diagnose our disease 

instead of doctors. If so, will we really be able to trust it diagnosis? 

These diagnostic tool use data set of image to train and learn. But visual data set can be perturbed that prevent deep learn algorithm from correctly 

classify images. Deep neural network be highly vulnerable to visual perturbation that be practically impossible to detect with the naked eye, yet cause the AI 

to misclassify images. 

In future implementation of AI-assisted medical diagnostic tools, these perturbation pose a serious threat. More generally, the perturbation be real and may 

already be affect the filter information that reach u every day. These vulnerability underscore the importance of certify AI technology and monitoring it 

reliability.
