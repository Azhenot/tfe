Direct reciprocity be a mechanism for cooperation among humans. Many of our daily 

interaction be repeated. We interact repeatedly with our family, friends, colleagues, 

member of the local and even global community. In the theory of repeat games, it be a tacit 

assumption that the various game that a person play simultaneously have no effect on each 

other. Here we introduce a general framework that allows u to analyze “crosstalk” between a 

player’s concurrent games. In the presence of crosstalk, the action a person experience in 

one game can alter the person’s decision in another. We find that crosstalk impedes the 

maintenance of cooperation and require strong level of forgiveness. The magnitude of the 

effect depends on the population structure. In more densely connect social groups, 

crosstalk have a strong effect. A harsh retaliator, such a Tit-for-Tat, be unable to counteract 

crosstalk. The crosstalk framework provide a unified interpretation of direct and upstream 

reciprocity in the context of repeat games.

Social dilemma be situation where mutual cooperation isbetter than mutual defection and yet there be an incentive todefect1,2. Cooperation be normally oppose by natural 
selection unless mechanism for the evolution of cooperation be 
in place3. One such mechanism be direct reciprocity, which be 
base on repeat interaction between the same two players4,5. 
In repeat social dilemmas, human often learn to use adaptive 
rules, tell them when to cooperate, when to defect, and how to 
motivate others to cooperate6–8. Cooperation can be achieve if 
people adopt conditional cooperative strategy such a Tit-for- 
Tat5, Generous Tit-for-Tat9,10, or Win-stay, Lose-shift11,12. 
Conditional cooperation, pair with some amount of generosity, 
can maintain a healthy level of cooperation13–21. It can evolve 
even if initially rare22–26. 

Most previous model of direct reciprocity (with a few notable 
exceptions27–30) have either assume that (i) individual only 
engage in one repeat game at a time or that (ii) an individual’s 
action in one game be independent of all it other interactions. 
Because human often engage in many game simultaneously, the 
first assumption seem to be violate in most practical scenarios. 
Moreover, evidence from experimental study suggests that also 
the second assumption of independence may not always 
apply31–38. We say that a player’s decision be subject to “crosstalk” 
when an interaction that a player have in one repeat game 
influence how the very same player behaves in another repeat 
game (Fig. 1a). For example, consider the interaction in a group 
of three individuals, “Alice”, “Bob”, and “Charlie” (Fig. 1b). Sup- 
pose that after a series of previous encounters, Bob be prompt 
for a decision whether to cooperate with Alice in the next round. 
In her last interaction with Bob, Alice have cooperated. Therefore, 
Bob who us Tit-for-Tat, would now cooperate with Alice. But 
Bob’s last interaction have occur with Charlie and in that 
interaction Charlie have defected. Crosstalk now mean there be 
some chance that Bob defect with Alice although direct 
reciprocity would mandate Bob to cooperate. Bob’s state with 
respect to Charlie influence his decision with respect to Alice. 

Such crosstalk can result from various psychological processes. 
For example, experiment on upstream reciprocity suggest that 
subject who have receive help in their previous interaction 
often consciously choose to “pay it forward”22,31–33. Alternatively, 
crosstalk may also occur when subject have limited work 
memory34–36. In that case, subject may confuse their co-players’ 
past actions, which may in turn lead them to reward the wrong 
person for past cooperative behaviors. We propose a mathema- 
tical framework that allows u to quantify how crosstalk affect 
the cooperation dynamic within a population. We show that, in 
the presence of crosstalk, a single defector can lead to the com- 
plete breakdown of cooperation in an arbitrarily large group of 
conditional cooperators. Nevertheless, cooperation can prevail if 
the population be structure and if subject be sufficiently for- 
giving. For our model, we do not need to specify the particular 
psychological process at work: the result behavioral dynamic 
be independent of whether crosstalk be the result of a conscious 
decision (as in upstream reciprocity), or the consequence of a 
subconscious error (as when individual confuse the past action 
of their co-players). However, the interpretation of our result will 
often depend on the specific psychological mechanism that give 
rise to crosstalk. We revisit this matter in the “Discussion” section. 

Results 
Framework for crosstalk between concurrent repeat games. 
We consider a group of N individuals. Each individual play a 
pairwise repeat prisoner’s dilemma (PD) with each interaction 
partner. These repeat game occur concurrently. At each time 
step, we choose a random pair of player for a single interaction 

(Fig. 1b). Each player us a reactive strategy, define by two 
parameters, p and q, which denote the probability to cooperate if 
the same co-player in the previous round have either cooperate or 
defected, respectively. The class of reactive strategy include 
many well-known examples, such a always-cooperate (ALLC), 
always-defect (ALLD), tit-for-tat (TFT: Supplementary Fig. 1b), 
and Generous Tit-for-Tat10 (GTFT: Supplementary Fig. 1d). 
Reactive strategy can be implement by stochastic two-state 
automata39–42. The two state be label C and D (see 
Supplementary Fig. 1a). In the next interaction, a player 
cooperates if she be in state C and defect if she be in state 
D. Cooperators pay a cost c for their co-player to receive a benefit 
b>c. Defectors do not incur a cost and their co-player do not 
receive a benefit. The player’s strategy determines how the 
player’s state be update after an interaction have take place. 

In our setup, each player us a specific strategy for all of her 
interactions, but have distinct automaton to hold the game with all 
of her different co-players in memory (Supplementary Fig. 2). For 
example, a player use TFT can be in different state (C or D) 
with different co-players, but us the same strategy to update her 
state against all of her co-players. The separate automaton enable 
player to remember previous interaction and to react in future 
round accord to their respective history with each co-player. 

Crosstalk between two repeat game occurs if a player’s state 
with respect to one interaction partner displaces the player’s state 
with respect to another player (Supplementary Fig. 2). Specifi- 
cally, we assume that, before each interaction, there be a 
probability γ that the players’ state with respect to the current 
co-player be replace by the state with respect to the previous co- 
player (other variant of crosstalk will be discuss below). The 
crosstalk rate γ ∈ [0, 1] specifies how often crosstalk occurs. In the 
special case of no crosstalk, γ = 0, player perfectly distinguish 
between all their opponents, and we recover the scenario 
consider in previous study of direct reciprocity2,5. For positive 
crosstalk rates, cooperative and defective behavior can cascade in 
the players’ social network: a player’s action in one game can 
affect how the co-player act in a different game, which in turn 
may influence again other game (Fig. 1). Therefore, crosstalk 
cause ripple that propagate in social networks. The overall effect 
of crosstalk depends on the structure of the population. We 
represent this structure by arrange player on a graph43–45, 
where edge between player denote interaction (Fig. 2; 
“Methods” section). While our framework be applicable to 
arbitrary population structures, we illustrate the effect of 
crosstalk use four regular network (Fig. 3a), range from a 
circle (where each player have exactly two interaction partners) to 
the complete graph (where all player interact with everyone else). 

Cooperative and defective behavior spread across population. 
We utilize stochastic computer simulation to study the coop- 
eration frequency in a population over time, and derive 
mathematical recursion to calculate the long-run payoff in the 
steady state (“Methods” section). To illustrate how crosstalk lead 
to the spread of defection in a generally cooperative society, we 
place a single ALLD player in a network of N − 1 conditionally 
cooperative player (Figs. 2 and 3a). When the conditionally 
cooperative player use TFT (which be give by p = 1, q = 0) and 
crosstalk occurs, γ> 0, the ALLD player can turn all remain 
player into defector eventually (Fig. 2a), independent of the 
population structure and the crosstalk rate (Supplementary 
Fig. 3). The spread of defection can be prevent if the 
cooperative player use more generous strategies, with p = 1 and 
0< q< 1. We refer to such strategy a GTFT. The impact of 
different q value will be discuss below. At first, we choose 
q = 1/3. If the single ALLD player be place among GTFT players,

cooperation frequency converge to a positive value (Fig. 2b), 
with the eventual equilibrium rate depend on the population 
structure and on the crosstalk rate (Supplementary Fig. 3). We 
can also observe the opposite effect: a single ALLC player can 
increase the cooperation rate in a population of stochastic TFT 
player use p = 1 − ϵ and q = ϵ (Supplementary Fig. 4c). 

Comparing the effect of different population structures, we find 
that a GTFT population can maintain cooperation more easily if 
player be arrange on a circle instead of a complete graph 
(Fig. 3a, b, Supplementary Fig. 5). For a population size of N = 16, 
the cooperator obtain a high average payoff than the defector 
for crosstalk rate up to γ = 0.85 on a circle, and for up to γ = 0.41 
on a complete graph. In network with a low degree, player be 
more likely to give the adequate response with respect to their 
current co-player, because, if crosstalk occurs, the current co- 
player be more likely to coincide with the previous co-player such 
that crosstalk becomes inconsequential. For this reason, all other 
explore population structure exhibit crosstalk threshold 
between the circle and the complete graph (Fig. 3b). 

To investigate the recovery property after a mistake, we 
compute the amount of time that a population of conditional 
cooperator with strategy (1, q) and q> 0 need to return to full 
cooperation after a single defection event. We find that crosstalk 
lead to a significantly faster recovery (Supplementary Fig. 6). 
Intuitively, when the crosstalk rate be high, a player’s automaton be 
update more frequently (once before the interaction take place, 
and once after the interaction). Because the player apply 
strategy with p = 1 and q> 0, each update event be bias 
towards increase cooperation: every cooperative act put the co- 
player into a cooperative state, whereas defective act be forgiven 
with probability q. Moreover, we show that the recovery time be 
monotonically increase with the average degree (k) of the 
population structure and monotonically decrease with the

Fig. 2 Cooperative and defective behavior can spread across a population in the presence of crosstalk. Twenty-four conditional cooperator (blue frame

probability to cooperate after defection (q; see Supplementary 
Note 1 for more details). 

Crosstalk require the right level of forgiveness. We calculate 
the generosity parameter q of GTFT to optimally cope with 
crosstalk. To this end, we consider two different optimality cri- 
teria. First, we calculate the most generous strategy that be able to 
resist invasion by a single ALLD player. That is, for a fix 
population structure and a give crosstalk rate, we derive the 
reactive strategy (1, qM) with maximum qM such that N − 1 
player with this strategy get at least the same average payoff a 
the single defector. Analytical calculation for the complete graph 
and numerical result for all other population structure show 
that high crosstalk rate and high network degree (that be a 
high number of neighbors) require the cooperative player to be 
less generous (Fig. 3c, “Methods” section). For the second 
optimality criterion, we calculate the cooperative strategy with the 
most robust level of generosity qR such that N − 1 player with 
strategy (1, qR) have the high relative payoff advantage com- 
par to the single ALLD player. The most robust level of gen- 
erosity exhibit a non-monotonic dependence on the crosstalk 
rate (Fig. 3d). In the absence of crosstalk, γ = 0, the perfectly 
reciprocal TFT strategy be most robust against invasion of ALLD. 
As the crosstalk rate increases, the most robust level of generosity 
qR first increases, but then decrease again. Intuitively, for the 
robustness of a conditionally cooperative population against 
ALLD, high value of the generosity parameter q have two 
oppose effects. On one hand, high value of q make it less likely 
that the defectors’ action propagate through the network. On the 
other hand, high value of q also let the player be more forgive 
against the defector, and hence increase the payoff of the ALLD 

player. When crosstalk be rare, conditional cooperator can 
prevent the spread of defection by choose a small value for q. 
Once crosstalk be sufficiently frequent, however, player can no 
longer fully prevent defection from spreading. Instead, they rather 
need to keep the defector’s payoff low, by choose a small q 
value. These result confirm that in the presence of crosstalk, γ> 
0, subject should show some amount of generosity (q> 0), but 
not too much; we find q< qM, with qM depend on the crosstalk 
rate and on the population structure. Only for the circle, coop- 
eration can prevail even when crosstalk be abundant (Fig. 3d). 

The above analysis be base on a comparison between 
conditional cooperator and a specific invader, ALLD. More 
generally, we find that conditionally cooperative strategy (1, q) 
with q< qM in fact resist invasion by all possible invade 
strategy (pʹ, qʹ) for the complete graph. This analysis also reveals 
that there be three class of strategy in total that be stable 
against arbitrary invader (Supplementary Note 1). The first class 
consists of the conditionally cooperative strategy just described. 
The second class consists of uncooperative strategy (p, 0), with p 
sufficiently small (see Supplementary Note 1 for the exact 
condition). In particular, this class contains ALLD. When 
adopt by all player in a population, strategy of this class 
eventually lead to full defection. Finally, the third class consists of 
strategy (p, q) analogous to equalizer strategy of direct 
reciprocity46–49. When apply by all resident in the population, 
equalizer strategy guarantee that the payoff of a single invader be 
independent of the invader’s strategy. 

Crosstalk impedes the evolution of cooperation. These result 
raise the question to which extent subject themselves would 
learn to apply cooperative strategy with a sustainable degree of

player to become less generous to constrain the payoff of the ALLD player. Parameter values: number of player N= 16 (one ALLD player), benefit b= 3,

generosity. To explore that question, we implement a simple 
model of cultural evolution where player be allow to adopt 
new strategy over time, base on their current strategy’s success 
(“Methods” section). According to this process, strategy that 
yield a comparably high payoff be more likely to be imitate by 
other players50,51. In addition, player may occasionally also 
experiment with new stochastic strategies, which introduces novel 
behavior into the population. These two events, imitation and 
exploration, take the role of selection and mutation in model of 
biological evolution. We show that a birth-death process a use 
in many biological application yield the same result (Supple- 
mentary Note 1). We simulated the evolutionary dynamic for 
various population structure and crosstalk rates, assume that 
experimentation event be relatively rare23. In the plane of 
reactive strategies, we observe that for most of the time, player 
either apply defective strategy with p ≈ q ≈ 0, or cooperative 
strategy with p ≈ 1 and 0< q< qM (Fig. 4a–c). None of these 
strategy be evolutionarily stable52. Instead, when resident 
apply one of these strategies, neutral or nearly neutral mutant 
can often invade and pave the way for mutant of another 
strategy class42. The relative weight of these two strategy class 
depends on the crosstalk rate and on the population structure 
(Fig. 4d). While cooperative strategy readily evolve on the cycle 
even for substantial crosstalk rates, they become less abundant a 
the population structure change to a square lattice, or to a 
complete graph. 

To understand the effect of crosstalk in more detail, we 
analyze how easily other strategy fix in a resident population 
that either consists of ALLD player or GTFT player (Supple- 
mentary Fig. 7). Without crosstalk, GTFT be much more 
successful in resist mutant invasions. On average, more 
mutant need to be introduce until the first mutant fixes. 
Moreover, successful mutant typically have a strategy that be very 
similar to GTFT (whereas ALLD be typically invade by TFT-like 
strategy rather quickly). However, a the crosstalk rate increases, 
the invasion time into GTFT drop considerably, and successful 
mutant no longer need to be cooperative themselves. 

Interestingly, we find that crosstalk favor the stability of 
extortionate strategies. With an extortionate strategy, player can 
guarantee that they never get a low payoff than their co-player, 
while simultaneously act such that it be in the co-player’s best 
interest to cooperate unconditionally47. In classical model of 
direct reciprocity, extortionate strategy be unstable and they 
can only succeed if the population size be small18,19,53. In contrast, 
extortionate strategy can thrive even in large population when 

crosstalk be sufficiently abundant (Supplementary Fig. 8). How- 
ever, this success come at a cost. By become stable, 
extortionate strategy lose one of their most appeal properties: 
when crosstalk be abundant, a rare invader in an extortionate 
population do no longer benefit from be unconditionally 
cooperative. Instead, the best response be to be extortionate a well 
(see Supplementary Note 1 for details). 

To analytically understand the impact of crosstalk on the 
evolutionary dynamics, we explore a deterministic model of 
evolution in well-mixed populations54–56. The singular strategy 
of these dynamic consist exactly of the three strategy set that 
resist invasion by rare mutant that we described in the previous 
section: conditional cooperators, defectors, and equalizers. Which 
of these strategy class be reach in the course of evolution now 
depends on the initial population (Supplementary Fig. 9a). As the 
crosstalk rate increases, the number of initial population that 
eventually end up in a conditionally cooperative state decrease 
(Supplementary Fig. 9b). In this deterministic model, crosstalk 
thus act by reduce the basin of attraction of the cooperative 
equilibria. 

Alternative model of crosstalk. So far, we have analyze one 
particular model of crosstalk: when prompt for the next deci- 
sion, a player instead reacts to her most recent interaction, and 
this interaction could have be with someone else. But other 
implementation be conceivable. 

For example, the memory state that a player hold for her 
current co-player could be replace by the memory state of a 
random co-player, who may not coincide with the current or the 
most recent co-player. In this case, when decide what to do for 
the next round in a particular game, the player us with 
probability γ the state of a random game that she be hold in 
memory. We find that this alternative implementation of 
crosstalk differs in it short-term dynamic but converges to the 
same steady state a our original model (Supplementary Fig. 10). 
Thus, Figs. 3 and 4 immediately apply to this type of crosstalk a 
well. 

Alternatively, a player’s decision could depend not only on the 
previous interaction with one particular opponent. Instead, the 
player might consider an average across her recent experience 
with all her co-players. We therefore introduce aggregate reactive 
strategy (Supplementary Note 1). Players use these strategy 
compute a weight cooperation score across all their co-players. 
This cooperation score incorporates the last action of the current

co-player with weight 1 − γ and the average cooperation rate 
across all co-players’ last action with weight γ. The obtain 
score be then compare to an exogenous cooperation threshold τ. 
Players cooperate with probability p if the weight cooperation 
score exceeds τ; otherwise they cooperate with probability q. In 
particular, if the crosstalk rate γ be zero, these strategy again 
correspond to the classical reactive strategy of direct recipro- 
city2,10. We explore the effect of γ and τ by consider a single 
defector in a population of conditional cooperators. The 
conditional cooperator apply a strategy with p = 1, q = 1/3 and 
some value τ, a strategy to which we refer to a Aggregate 
Generous Tit-for-Tat (AGTFT). While the cooperation dynamic 
of this model be qualitatively different from our previous results, 
we again find that high crosstalk rate impede the stability of 
cooperation across all population structure (Supplementary 
Figs. 11 and 12). 

Discussion 
Classical model of direct reciprocity require that player provide 
a target response to each of their co-players2,5. Experimental 
result and everyday experience indicate that players’ decision 
can be affected by unrelated event that occur in their interaction 
with others31–38. Crosstalk arises when a player have simultaneous 
repeat interaction with several opponents. Importantly, 
crosstalk be different from previous approach that combine 
direct and indirect (downstream) reciprocity. In model of 
downstream reciprocity, a player’s strategy depends on the co- 
player’s reputation, and hence on the co-players’ interaction with 
others38,57–64. A combination of direct reciprocity and down- 
stream reciprocity can promote cooperation because a single 
defection in one game may lead several unaffected co-players to 
retaliate against the defector27–29. However, downstream reci- 
procity make strong assumption on the information player 
have when make their decision. It require a player to observe 
other players’ interaction or reputation to respond accordingly. 
In contrast, crosstalk be a much more elementary mechanism. It 
occurs “within” each player and do not rely on additional 
external information about independent interaction of 
unrelated players. Our notion of crosstalk be general: it 
capture that a player’s decision in one game can be affected by 
the player’s previous experience in another game, but it do not 
depend on the psychological process responsible for this 
interdependency. 

Depending on the specific process at work, crosstalk be 
amendable to different interpretations. Our framework can be 
take a a model of upstream reciprocity in the context of 
repeat games. Under this interpretation, cooperation or 
defection receive from one person be sometimes consciously 
“paid forward” to another person. Previous analytical model have 
either focus on direct reciprocity or on upstream reciprocity 
separately2,65,66. The framework of crosstalk allows u to explore 
the consequence when both mode of reciprocity act simulta- 
neously, and possibly interfere with each other. We recover 
previous results65–67 that upstream reciprocity alone be most 
likely to yield cooperation when the population be highly struc- 
tured. However, our result suggest that cooperation can even be 
maintain in well-mixed population when upstream reciprocity 
be sufficiently couple with direct reciprocity (i.e., when the 
crosstalk rate γ be sufficiently small). 

Alternatively, crosstalk can serve a a model of individual with 
limited work memory. According to this interpretation, 
crosstalk occurs when individual confuse their various co-play- 
ers, which introduces a type of behavioral noise into the coop- 
eration dynamics. This noise be different from simple 
implementation error consider in previous 

models2,9,18,19,36,68,69. Implementation error only affect the 
repeat game in which they occur (Supplementary Fig. 4a, b). 
But crosstalk spread from one game to another and therefore 
through the population (Supplementary Fig. 4). Only in the 
presence of crosstalk, a single defector can turn a whole popu- 
lation of TFT player into defectors. 

We consider upstream reciprocity and confusion a different 
psychological process which independently can give rise to 
crosstalk. Although these two process be subject to different 
interpretations, accord to the above discuss implementation, 
they lead to the same cooperation dynamic within a population. 
High degree of upstream reciprocity, just a high degree of 
confusion, undermine the ability of direct reciprocity to sustain 
cooperation. 

Crosstalk provide a general framework with application 
beyond the example study here. Future model could explore, 
for example, crosstalk between independent game that differ in 
their payoff structure70, or when subject engage in simultaneous 
game that involve more than two players. Similarly, one may 
study interaction in which the crosstalk rate itself depends on 
exogenous parameters, such a the number of neighbors, or the 
benefit of cooperation. Finally, we explore a model in which 
player aggregate across their last experience with all co-players. 
Further generalization be conceivable. For example, player may 
defect against all their co-players a long a at least one of their 
automaton be in the D state, or they may remember more than their 
co-player’s last action26,71. Under crosstalk, the players’ indivi- 
dual game be no longer consider in isolation, but they be 
embed into the context of all concurrently ongoing interac- 
tions. Crosstalk require strong mechanism for forgiveness 
especially in a more highly connect world. A harsh retaliator 
such a Tit-for-Tat be particularly unable to deal with crosstalk. 
This be an interest message for our current society. 

Methods 
Computer simulations. To simulate the effect of crosstalk on the cooperation 
dynamic among player with fix strategies, we consider a population of size N 
play a repeat Prisoner’s Dilemma (PD). The population be give by a graph 
where the node represent the players, and the edge reflect all possible interaction 
between players. Only player connect by an edge can be pair to play the PD. 
Players use separate two-state automaton for each of their neighbor on the inter- 
action graph41. The two state of each automaton be label C (cooperation) and 
D (defection). These state be update accord to the player’s reactive strategy 
(p, q), see Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2. The parameter p denotes the probability to 
move to state C if the co-player have cooperate in the previous game (whereas the 
complementary probability 1 − p give the likelihood to move to state D). Similarly, 
q denotes the probability to move to state C if the co-player have defect (and 1 − q 
be the respective probability to move to state D). 

In each round, an edge of the interaction graph be chosen uniformly at random. 
A single PD be played among the two player adjacent to the chosen edge. With 
probability 1 − γ a player act accord to the respective automaton state 
associate with this co-player; with probability γ crosstalk occurs and the player 
refers to the state of the automaton update in her last interaction instead. After 
the game, the automaton state be update accord to the game outcome and the 
players’ strategies. This elementary step be then iterate for a large number of 
rounds. For the simulation result depict in Supplementary Fig. 5, we simulated 
4000 game per realization (on average 500 game per player) and average across 
104 realization to obtain the stationary payoff of GTFT and ALLD player for a 
give population structure and crosstalk rate. 

So far, we assume that every edge in the interaction graph be chosen with the 
same probability. However, some interaction can occur with a high frequency 
than others. To investigate the effect of different interaction frequencies, we 
study the spread of defective behavior in a population of GTFT player 
populate a 5 × 5 lattice (Supplementary Fig. 13). We increase the interaction 
probability of all player on the central horizontal line by 10-fold (see orange edges) 
and observe how defective behavior spread much faster along the horizontal axis 
than along the vertical axis. Within the analytical framework, interaction 
probability wij be give by the connectivity matrix W (see next section for 
details). 

In the second study type of crosstalk, again with probability γ crosstalk occurs 
and the player refers to the state of a random automaton, chosen from all her 
interaction partner with equal probability (Supplementary Figs. 2 and 10).

Analytical derivation of steady-state payoffs. To derive an explicit repre- 
sentation for the payoff that player receive in the long run, we suppose that each 
player i adopts some fix reactive strategy (pi, qi). The population structure be 
give by an N ×N connectivity matrixW = (wij). The entry wij give the probability 
that the next interaction in that population occurs between player i and j. In 
particular, the connectivity matrixW be symmetric wij =wji, and satisfies wii = 0 andP 

i<j wij ¼ 1. As in the computer simulations, we focus on network in which each 
link be played with equal probability. That is, if player i and j be connected, then 
wij = w for some constant w> 0 that depends on the network structure, but be 
independent of the player i and j. For example, because there be N(N − 1) / 2 
different link in a complete graph, well-mixed population can be represent by a 
connectivity matrix with wij = 2 / (N(N − 1)) for all i ≠ j. As another example, 
population on a cycle be represent by wij = 1/N if i and j occupy neighbor 
sites, and wij = 0 for all other i, j. 

Let wi ¼ 
PN 

j¼1 wij denote the probability that the next interaction in the 
population involves player i. Moreover, let ytij be the probability that player i be in 
state C against player j at time t, and let yti be the probability that player i be in state 
C with respect to her previous co-player. We can calculate ytþ1i;j use the follow

To calculate the player’s long run cooperation frequencies, we note that in the 
steady state, cooperation rate be independent of the time period, and hence 
ytþ1ij ¼ ytij ¼: yij . Moreover, because interaction be fully random, the stationary 
probability yi that player i be in state C with respect to her previous co-player 
simplifies to yi ¼

The Eqs. (2) represent a system of N(N − 1) linear equation in the unknown yij 
with i ≠ j. By solve this inhomogeneous system, we can calculate the stationary 
frequency ŷij to find player i in state C with respect to player j. Given the stationary

players,

We note that this method applies to general crosstalk rate γ, general population 
structures, and general population composition (e.g., population with more than 
two different strategy present). As show in Supplementary Fig. 5, these 
analytically derive payoff be in excellent agreement with the computer 
simulations. In the Supplementary Note 1, we show how Eqs. (2) and (3) can be 
further simplify for well-mixed populations. In that case, we can also provide 
explicit expression for how generous cooperative strategy of the form (1, q) be 
allow to be to resist invasion of ALLD (as depict in Fig. 3c, d). 

Setup of the evolutionary simulations. To explore the evolution of strategy 
under crosstalk, we consider a simple model of cultural evolution, the pairwise 
comparison process50,51. As common in study on the evolution of strategy in 
repeat games10–25,40,41, we assume a separation of time scales: the time it take 
individual to play their repeat game be short compare to the evolutionary 
timescale at which individual adopt new strategies. This assumption allows u to 
use the players’ stationary payoffs, a give by Eq. (3), when simulate the evo- 
lutionary trajectory of a population. 

For the evolutionary simulations, we consider a population with fix 
population structure and fix crosstalk rate γ. In each evolutionary time step, there 
be two possible events, imitation or random strategy exploration. To model 
imitation events, we assume that two individual be randomly drawn from the 
population. We refer to these two individual a the “learner” and the “role model”, 
respectively. Herein, we aim to compare the effect of crosstalk across different 
population structures. To allow for a fair comparison, we assume that, while 
payoff be calculate for the give population structure, strategy update occurs 
globally. As a consequence, the learner and the role model do not need to be 
neighbor in the direct interaction network. With this assumption, we rule out the 
formation of cooperative clusters, which would additionally favor the evolution of 
cooperation in network with a low degree44. After select the learner and the 
role model, their payoff πL and πR be calculate accord to Eq. (3). We assume 
that the learner adopts the role model’s strategy with probability ρ = [1 + exp(−s(πR 
− πL))]−1. The parameter s ≥ 0 measure the strength of selection. When selection be 

weak, s � 1, payoff be largely irrelevant for imitation and the imitation 
probability approach 1/2, irrespective of the players’ strategies. When selection be 
strong, s � 1, player tend to adopt only those strategy that yield a high payoff 
than their own strategy. In addition to these imitation events, we allow for random 
strategy exploration. When such an exploration event occurs, one player be 
randomly drawn from the population. This player then adopts a new strategy (p, q), 
which be uniformly drawn from all reactive strategies. Following the approach of 
Imhof and Nowak23, we assume that these exploration event be rare. As a 
consequence, the population be homogeneous most of the time. Only occasionally, a 
mutant strategy enters the population due to random strategy exploration. This 
mutant strategy than either go extinct or fix before the next exploration event 
occurs. By simulate this process over a long timespan, we can record how often 
the population applies certain strategy (p, q), and we can compute the result 
average cooperation rate over an evolutionary timescale. In Fig. 4, we show 
correspond result for the cycle, the square lattice, and for the complete graph, 
assume parameter value of population size N = 16, benefit b = 10, cost c = 1, and 
selection strength s = 1. Other parameter value lead to qualitatively similar results, 
provide that selection be sufficiently strong and that the benefit of cooperation be 
sufficiently high to allow for the evolution of cooperation. In the Supplementary 
Note 1, we show that analogous result apply when we consider a birth-death 
process instead of the pairwise imitation process consider herein.
