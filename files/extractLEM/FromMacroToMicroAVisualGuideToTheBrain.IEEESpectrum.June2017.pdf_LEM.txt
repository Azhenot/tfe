Here’s how the brain’s 86 billion neuron do their work

higher-level information 

processing occurs in the neocortex, neural tissue that 

form the outer layer of the cerebral cortex. In it 

intricate folds, brain cell work together to interpret 

sensory information and to form thought and plans. 

The neocortex be divide into region that take the 

lead on different type of processing. However, much 

of today’s neuroscience research focus on mapping 

the connectome: the neural connection between 

regions. 

In the human brain,
