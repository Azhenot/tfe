achine learn have be use to 

beat a human competitor in a game 

of Go (1), a game that have long be 

view a the most challenge of 

board game for artificial intelli- 

gence. Research be now under way 

to investigate whether machine learn can 

be use to solve long outstanding problem 

in quantum science. On page 602 of this 

issue, Carleo and Troyer (2) use machine 

learn on one of quantum science’s great- 

est challenges: the simulation of quantum 

many-body systems. Carleo and Troyer use 

an artificial neural network to represent the 

wave function of a quantum many-body sys- 

tem and to make the neural network “learn” 

what the ground state (or dynamics) of the 

system is. Their approach be found to per- 

form good than the current state-of-the-art 

numerical simulation methods. 

Early machine-learning demonstration 

be on specific pattern-recognition prob- 

lems. They have since show great capabil- 

ity in perform multifaceted tasks, such 

a play video game (3) or board game 

(1). This capacity to take control of complex 

system and achieve difficult goals, in some 

case good than human competitors, have 

recently be use to tackle difficult prob- 

lem in quantum science. In experimental 

quantum science, machine learn have be 

use to design new experiment (4), perform 

automatic optimization (5), and improve 

feedback control (6). All of these application 

have solve problem that have only recently 

face the field. 

Due to vast number of complex number 

require to save a complete wave function, 

the simulation of many-body system have 

be an immense challenge in quantum sci- 

ence. For example, consider a many-body 

system compose of N qubits, the simplest 

quantum bodies. We must save a complex 

number for every configuration of this sys- 

tem. Each qubit can be in a state of 0 or 1, 

so that mean we need to save 2N complex 

numbers. Even a small number of qubits 

require an extreme amount of memory. For 

example, 26 qubits require around a giga- 

byte, 46 qubits require a petabyte, and 300 

qubits would require more byte than the 

number of atom in the universe. Richard 

Feynman recognize this problem, which lead 

to his suggestion that quantum computer 

may have an advantage over conventional 

computer (7) [although we now know that 

the reason behind the quantum speedup be 

more nuanced (8)]. 

To circumvent this memory requirement 

issue, a variety of approximate technique 

have be developed to solve quantum many- 

body problems. These involve invent some 

compact approximate representation for the 

wave function. For example, matrix prod- 

uct state be the current state-of-the-art 

technique for find ground state of one- 

dimensional many-body system (9). A set 

of matrix be use to save the approximate 

state-of-the-wave function; subset of these 

matrix can be multiply together to get 

the complex number correspond to a par- 

ticular system configuration. Many different 

representation of the wave function exist, 

each have advantage in particular physi- 

cal settings. Discovering new representation 

for each physical problem have previously re- 

quired human ingenuity and effort. 

Carleo and Troyer suggest use machine 

learn to automatically discover a compact 

representation for the wave function appro- 

priate for each physical problem. The wave 

function can be thought of a a function that 

take a system configuration and return a 

complex number. They assume that this func- 

tion can be well approximate with a neural 

network, make of a set of weight and a single 

layer of hidden bias (see the figure). Given 

the Hamiltonian for a particular physical sys- 

tem, they let the neural network learn a com- 

pact representation for the wave function of 

the system’s ground state (or dynamics). The 

learn algorithm they use be adapt from 

variational Monte Carlo and minimizes the 

so-called local energy of the system. 

Carleo and Troyer found that the neural 

network be able to discover ground state of 

quantum many-body system with a small 

memory footprint than those of compete 

techniques, such a matrix product states. 

Furthermore, the accuracy of the neural net 

estimate can be systematically improve by 

increase the number of hidden bias and 

weights. On the problem they tested, they 

found the machine-learning algorithm be 

able to outperform all of the current state-of- 

the-art numerical techniques. 

Carleo and Troyer have currently test 

their approach on a few problem that have 

know solutions. We will not know for cer- 

tain that machine learn have solve the 

challenge of simulate many-body quantum 

system until more physical system have 

be tested. Nevertheless, there be great po- 

tential to expand on their work. Carleo and 

Troyer only consider a single-layer neural 

net. Deep neural nets, which have multiple 

layers, have be show to have the great 

capacity for learn and expression and be 

yet to be investigated. The work present a 

new pathway for physicist to benefit from 

the rapid development in the machine- 

learn community and will hopefully lead 

to new physical discoveries. j
