Abstract 

Traffic wave be phenomenon that emerge when the vehicular density exceeds a critical threshold. Considering the 
presence of increasingly automate vehicle in the traffic stream, a number of research activity have focus on the 
influence of automate vehicle on the bulk traffic flow. In the present article, we demonstrate experimentally that 
intelligent control of an autonomous vehicle be able to dampen stop-and-go wave that can arise even in the absence of 
geometric or lane change triggers. Precisely, our experiment on a circular track with more than 20 vehicle show 
that traffic wave emerge consistently, and that they can be dampen by control the velocity of a single vehicle in 
the flow. We compare metric for velocity, brake events, and fuel economy across experiments. These experimental 
finding suggest a paradigm shift in traffic management: flow control will be possible via a few mobile actuator (less 
than 5%) long before a majority of vehicle have autonomous capabilities.

1. Introduction 

1.1. Motivation 

The dynamic of traffic flow include instability a density increases, where small perturbation amplify and grow 
into stop-and-go wave that travel backwards along the road [1, 2, 3, 4]. These so-called phantom traffic jam be an 
experimentally reproducible phenomenon, a demonstrate in different experiment [2, 5, 6]. Common wave trigger 
include lane change [7, 8, 9], but they can even be generate in the absence of any lane changes, bottlenecks, merges, 
or change in grade [2, 5]. Moreover, these wave can be capture in microscopic model of individual vehicle motion 
[10, 11, 12] (see also the review [13, 14, 15]) and macroscopic model described via solution to continuum problem 
[3, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. Since these wave emerge from the collective dynamic of the driver on the road, they be in 
principle avoidable if one could affect the way people drive. Recognizing the rapid technological innovation in traffic 
state estimation and control, this work provide experimental evidence that these wave can be reduce by control 
a small number of vehicle in the traffic stream.

A necessary precursor to dissipate traffic wave be to detect them in real-time. Advancements in traffic state 
estimation [21, 22, 23] have facilitate high resolution traffic monitoring, through the advent of GPS smartphone 
sensor [24, 25, 26, 27] that be part of the flow—termed Lagrangian or mobile sensors. Now commercialize by 
several major navigation services, the use of a small number of GPS equip vehicle in the traffic stream have 
dramatically change how traffic be monitor for consumer-facing mobility services, which previously rely on 
predominantly fix sense infrastructure. 

Currently, traffic control be dominate by control strategy that rely on actuator at fix location or be cen- 
tralized. Such system include variable speed advisory (VSA) or variable speed limit (VSL) [28, 29, 30, 31, 32], 
which be commonly implement through sign on overhead gantries, and ramp meter [33, 34, 35], which relies 
on traffic signal on freeway entrance ramps. More recently, coordinate system to integrate both ramp meter and 
variable speed limit have be propose [36, 37, 38, 39]. A common challenge of VSL and ramp meter system be 
the small flexibility of the system due to the high cost of installation of the fix infrastructure, which consequently 
limit the spatial resolution of the control input. 

Recent advancement in vehicular automation and communication technology provide new possibility and 
opportunity for traffic control in which these smart vehicle act a Lagrangian actuator of the bulk traffic steam. 
When a series of adjacent vehicle on a roadway be connect and automated, it be possible to form dense platoon 
of vehicle which leave very small gaps. A key challenge for vehicle platoon be to design control law in which the 
vehicle platoon remains stable, for which significant theoretical and practical progress have be make [40, 41, 42, 
43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48]. In contrast to the vehicle platoon setting, in which all vehicle be controlled, or the variable 
speed limit and ramp meter strategy which actuate the flow at fix locations, this research aim to dissipate 
congestion-based stop-and-go traffic wave use only a sparse number of autonomous vehicle already in the flow, 
without change how the other, human-driven, vehicle operate. 

The notion to dissipate stop-and-go wave via control vehicle in the stream represent a shift from stationary 
to Lagrangian control, mirror the transition to Lagrangian sense that have already occurred. The key advantage 
in mobile sense project [24, 26, 27] be that a very small number of vehicle be measure (3-5%) suffices to 
estimate the traffic state on large road network [25]. In the same spirit, our research experimentally demonstrates that 
a small number of Lagrangian controller suffices to dampen traffic waves. 

The ability of connect and automate vehicle to change the property of the bulk traffic flow be already rec- 
ognized in the transportation engineering community. For example, the work [49, 50, 51, 52] directly address the 
set where a subset of the vehicle be equip with automate and/or connect technologies, and then ass via 
a stability analysis or simulation the extent to which the total vehicular flow can be smoothed. Recently, several work 
have explore extension to the variable speed limit control strategy in which connect or automate vehicle be 
use to actuate the traffic flow [53]. For example, the work [54] develops a VSL strategy that be implement in sim- 
ulation with connect vehicle where the traffic evolves accord to the kinematic wave theory. It follow a similar 
strategy propose in [55], where a coordinate VSL and ramp meter strategy be implement via actuation of the 
entire vehicle fleet (i.e., 100% penetration rate). Although not explicitly design a a variable speed limit controller, 
the article [56] advocate a “slow-in, fast-out” drive strategy to eliminate traffic jams, use a microscopic model 
also in line with kinematic wave theory. The work [57] proposes a similar jam absorb strategy a [56] base on 
Newell’s car follow theory, and it effectiveness be assess in simulation. 

Interestingly, an experimental test of the “slow-in, fast-out” strategy [56] be provide in [58], in which five vehicle 
be driven on a close course. The lead vehicle in the platoon of five vehicle drive initially at a constant speed, then 
decelerates a if drive through a congestion wave, and then accelerates back to the cruise speed. The third vehicle 
in the platoon initially leaf a large gap, and due to the extra gap it be able to maintain the cruise speed and 
effectively absorb the jam. In contrast to the experiment [58], the present work fully replicates the setup of Sugiayama 
et al. [2, 5], in which the stop-and-go wave be generate naturally from the human driver in the experiment, without 
an external cause. Moreover, the controller propose in the present work be distinct. 

We also note some preliminary field experiment to harmonize speed via connect vehicle be recently report 
in [59, 60], in part to measure the impact of connect vehicle follow an infrastructure-generated advisory speed 
on the traffic stream behind the connect vehicles. In the present article, we instead dampen wave on a close ring, 
which simplifies the experimental setup, and facilitates detailed data collection on the performance of the controllers.

1.2. Problem statement and contribution 

The present article be inspire by the work of Sugiyama et al. [2, 5] which be the first work to demonstrate via 
experiment that traffic wave can emerge without infrastructure bottleneck or lane changing. A series of experiment 
be conduct where approximately 20 vehicle drive in a ring of fix radius with each driver follow the vehicle 
in front of them. The experiment [2, 5] be foundational because they demonstrate the emergence of traffic wave 
cause (unintentionally) by human drive behavior. However, they do not offer a solution for dampen these waves. 

To address this gap, we design and execute a series of ring-road experiment which show that an intelligently 
control autonomous vehicle be able to dampen stop-and-go waves. The experimental setup (described in Section 2) 
follow the set of Sugiyama et al. [2, 5], with the modification that one vehicle be an autonomous-capable vehicle 
which can run a variety of longitudinal control laws. Similar to the Sugiyama et al. [2] experiment, the position and 
velocity of each vehicle be tracked via a 360 degree camera. We additionally instrument each vehicle in the 22-car 
fleet (see Table 5 in Appendix 5.1 for a detailed description of the vehicle fleet) with an OBD-II scanner to log the 
real-time fuel consumption of each vehicle, such that the impact of the traffic wave and controller on the bulk fuel 
consumption can be recorded. 

We present three experiment (labeled a A, B, and C in Section 4) and two distinct control strategy (detailed 
in Section 3) that can be use to dampen stop-and-go wave create by human drivers. The first control strategy 
be to follow a fix average velocity (selected base on observation) a closely a possible without collisions. It 
be implement in Experiment A via an automatic control algorithm (called FollowerStopper) and in Experiment B 
via a carefully train human driver. The second type of control strategy be a proportional-integral (PI) controller 
with saturation, which be a natural extension of the PI controller, a simple and widely use controller in industrial 
applications. The controller be only base on the knowledge of the autonomous vehicle speed over a time horizon. The 
control action be saturate at small gap to avoid collisions, and long gap to avoid slow down of traffic. Compared 
to the average velocity controller (Experiments A and B), the PI controller with saturation directly estimate the 
average velocity and thus need no external input. 

The result of each of the three experiment be present and compare in Section 4. In each experiment, stop- 
and-go wave arise dynamically when all vehicle be under human control. Once one vehicle be activate to be 
autonomous (with the control algorithm described in Section 3), the traffic wave be dissipated. Compared to when 
wave be present, the Lagrangian control result in up to 40% less fuel consumption, and a throughput increase of up 
to 15%. Future perspective for Lagrangian vehicular control be provide in Section 5. 

2. Experimental methodology 

We briefly describe the experimental set in which stop-and-go wave be observe to develop and subsequently 
dampen via control of a single vehicle in the experiment (mimicking a low penetration rate on a long freeway 
stretch). The experiment follow the ring set Sugiyama, et al. [2, 5]. A key advantage of the ring road experimental 
setup [2, 5] be that it remove other effect like boundary conditions, merge lanes, or intersections. To aid in 
interpretation of trajectory and fuel consumption datasets make available with this work, we concisely describe the 
experimental design and data collection method in Section 2.1. The protocol for each experiment, include the 
specific instruction give to the driver be present in Section 2.2. 

2.1. Experiment design 

We consider a single-lane circular track of radius 41.4 meter to the center of the lane (260 meter circumference) 
with 21 to 22 vehicle depend on the experiment (see Figure 1). Small modification to the Sugiyama et al. [2, 5] 
setup include a large circumference of the circle and drive in counter-clockwise direction, to account for the large 
average US vehicle size and the location of the steer wheel. An asphalt track be marked with small circular cones, 
and be otherwise nearly flat and uniform (no marking, light poles, parking barriers, or other potential obstacles). Short 
(3 cm) orange indicator be place to mark the inside of the track ring. 

A fleet of 22 passenger vehicle equip with data acquisition hardware be use in the experiment. One of the 22 
vehicle be the University of Arizona self-driving capable Cognitive and Autonomous Test (CAT) Vehicle, which can 
be transition between manual velocity control and autonomous velocity control. A train human driver control 
the steer wheel of the CAT Vehicle at all time during all experiments. We underscore that only one vehicle be ever

control to dampen the traffic wave, either via automation of the vehicle velocity or through the train driver. This 
set in which a single vehicle be control on a ring road mimic a low penetration rate of automate vehicle on a 
long stretch of highway. All other vehicle be driven by University of Arizona employee that have complete safe 
driver training but receive no other special drive training. Drivers be instruct to drive safely and be request to 
attempt to close any widen gap between their vehicle and the vehicle ahead (see Section 2.2 for the precise driver 
instructions). 

Data from each experiment be collect via a video camera and OBD-II data loggers. The 360 degree camera be 
place at the center of the track and use to record each experiment. The result video be process via computer 
vision technique to identify the center of each vehicle in each frame, which be then smooth to generate the vehicle 
trajectories, follow the approach described in [61]. Data from the in-vehicle device be gather through the OBD- 
II standard interface available on all US car start in 1996 [62]. The in-vehicle device measure the instantaneous 
fuel consumption of each vehicle. 

2.2. Experiment mechanic 

Each experiment last between 7–10 minute to limit driver fatigue and begin with all vehicle uniformly space 
around the track accord to the position of their front-left tire. The CAT Vehicle begin each experiment in manual 
mode, and be switch into a control mode during the experiment. Traffic wave appear in all experiments, and the 
unsteady traffic be allow to persist for at least 45 second before a controller be activated. For some controllers, a 
desire average velocity be communicate from an external observer. 

Precisely, each experiment consists of the follow phases: (i) setup; (ii) evacuation; (iii) initialize; (iv) drive; (v) 
stop; and (vi) conclusion, summarize below. 

i. Setup: Vehicles be distribute equally accord to the space of their front-left tire. Drivers be individually 
instruct to turn on their in-vehicle data recorders. Additional driver instruction (if any) be deliver to 
individual driver through the window. 

ii. Evacuation: The central camera be switch on. All research team personnel evacuate the track. 
iii. Initialize: An air horn sound to instruct all driver to switch gear from Park to Drive, without moving. 
iv. Drive: An air horn sounds, to instruct all driver to begin driving. 
v. Stop: An air horn sounds, instruct driver to come to a safe stop and switch gear into Park. 

vi. Conclusion: Experiment personnel enter the track after all vehicle have stopped. Drivers be individually 
instruct to turn off their in-vehicle recorders. The central camera be switch off.

The follow instruction be provide to each driver prior to the start of the experiments. “Drive a if you be 
in rush hour traffic. Follow the vehicle ahead without fall behind. Do not pas the car ahead. Do not hit the car 
ahead. Drive safely at all times. Do not tailgate. But put an emphasis on catch up to the vehicle ahead, if a gap 
start opening up.” The purpose of these instruction be to explicitly prevent the human driver from intentionally 
smooth out traffic wave themselves. This be important, so that the wave-smoothing effect solely cause by the 
CAT Vehicle can be studied. 

In the event of an unsafe scenario, the driver be instruct to steer out of the circle, at which the experiment 
coordinator will sound the air horn and the experiment will stop. All driver be instruct that the CAT Vehicle would 
be switch back and forth between autonomous and manual mode, and that they should focus on their drive rather 
than attempt to guess what mode the vehicle be in at any give time. The vehicle directly follow the CAT Vehicle 
be told to drive a if the CAT Vehicle be in the same lane, and that the CAT Vehicle will be drive at a large radius 
(1/2 vehicle width) to facilitate evasive emergency maneuvers. 

3. Description of controller of the autonomous vehicle 

This section present the velocity controller implement on the CAT Vehicle to dampen traffic wave on the 
ring track. The controller be generally motivate by the fact that mathematical model of vehicular traffic can be 
stabilize via the control of a small number of vehicles, see for example [49, 50, 51, 52, 63]. One important notion 
that can help stabilize the overall flow be to have a subset of vehicle drive with a smooth drive profile relative to the 
traffic conditions, which be the basis of the work [55, 56, 57]. 

One possible way to create a smooth drive profile be to follow the average speed of the vehicle ahead, which 
drive faster then the average speed before a stop-and-go wave, and slow than the average speed during the wave. 
By simply drive at the average speed, a vehicle cover the same distance in the same amount of time, but with 
less acceleration and breaking. Additional logic be necessary to prevent extremely small gap (unsafe) situation from 
appearing, or large gap that may induce lane change on multi-lane roadways. With these idea in mind, we propose 
two possible control law and show experimentally that they be able to stabilize the flow on the ring. 

The general structure of the controller be a follows. The CAT Vehicle continuously track it velocity vAV, and 
measure (at a sample rate of 30Hz) the gap ∆x, define a the distance from it front bumper to the rear bumper of 
it lead vehicle ahead. This signal, suitably smoothed, be use to calculate the velocity difference ∆v = ddt∆x between 
the lead vehicle and the AV. The lead vehicle’s (i.e., the car ahead of the AV) velocity be estimate on-board the CAT 
Vehicle a vlead = vAV + ∆v. Moreover, a desire velocity U be define (obtained in various ways, see below), which, 
when chosen correctly, can stabilize the traffic flow. From the desire velocity, the gap, and the velocity of the CAT 
Vehicle and lead vehicle, a command velocity vcmd be determined. The command velocity be then pass to a 
low-level controller on the CAT Vehicle that translates it into an actuation of the accelerator or brake. Note that all 
of these quantity be function of time; but the time argument be frequently omit for notational efficiency. Below, 
we describe: strategy to define a desire velocity, the FollowerStopper controller and a PI controller with saturation, 
the low level controls, and a control law implement by a train human driver. 

3.1. The FollowerStopper controller 
The premise of this controller be to command exactly the desire velocity U whenever safe (i.e., a in a standard 

cruise controller), but to command a suitable low velocity vcmd < U whenever safety requires, possibly base on 
the lead vehicle’s velocity. 

Using the gap ∆x and the velocity difference ∆v = ddt∆x = v 
lead− vAV , the ∆x–∆v phase space be divide into 

region (see also Figure 2): 

i. a safe region, where vcmd = U ; 
ii. a stop region, where a zero velocity be commanded; and an 

iii. an adaptation region (two parts), where some average of desire and lead vehicle velocity be commanded. 

The boundary between the region be parabola in the ∆x–∆v phase space (trajectories that the AV/lead vehicle 
pair would traverse when decelerate at constant rates), define a 

∆xk = ∆x

Figure 2: Regions define in FollowerStopper controller. 

Here ∆x0k be a parameter that defines the intercept in the ∆x–∆v phase space, and dk control the curvature and be 
interpret a a deceleration rate. Moreover, ∆v− = min(∆v, 0) be the negative arm of velocity difference, i.e., the 
case of the CAT Vehicle fall behind be treat just like the case vAV = vlead. 

Using the region boundary define in (1), the command velocity be 

vcmd = 

 
0 if ∆x ≤ ∆x1 
v ∆x−∆x1∆x2−∆x1 if ∆x1 < ∆x ≤ ∆x2 
v + (U − v) ∆x−∆x2∆x3−∆x2 if ∆x2 < ∆x ≤ ∆x3 
U if ∆x3 < ∆x . 

(2) 

In (2), the velocity v = min(max(vlead, 0), U) be the lead vehicle velocity (if positive) or the desire velocity, 
whichever be smaller. In the adaptation region (∆x1 < ∆x ≤ ∆x3), the command velocity transition contin- 
uously from stop (vcmd = 0, for short gaps) to safe drive (vcmd = U , for large gaps), via a transition involve 
the lead vehicle’s velocity. 

As implemented, in (1) and (2) we set ∆x01 = 4.5 m, ∆x 
0 
2 = 5.25 m, and ∆x 

0 
3 = 6.0 m, and the deceleration 

rate be d1 = 1.5 ms2 , d2 = 1.0 
m 
s2 , and d3 = 0.5 

m 
s2 . Note that the ∆xk boundary of the region depend strongly on 

the velocity difference between the CAT Vehicle and the lead vehicle. For instance, if the CAT Vehicle be catch up 
rapidly at ∆v = −3 m , then ∆x1 = 7.5 m, ∆x2 = 9.75 m, and ∆x3 = 15 m. 

3.2. The PI with saturation controller 

The idea behind this controller be that the CAT Vehicle may estimate the average speed of the vehicle in front, 
and then drive accord to the average speed. When stop-and-go wave be present, it allows a gap to open up in 
front of the CAT Vehicle when the lead vehicle accelerates, which be then close when the lead vehicle decelerates. 
An estimate of the average speed require by the controller be obtain by measure the CAT Vehicle speed over a 
large enough time horizon. 

The controller determines a command velocity vcmd follow a standard proportional integral control logic [64], 
where the deviation from the average speed be treat a the error signal in the PI controller. This simple idea need 
to be pair with saturation: for small gap the CAT Vehicle should follow the lead vehicle speed to avoid dangerous 
situations, while for large gaps, the CAT Vehicle should catch up to the lead vehicle. 

More precisely, this controller estimate the desire velocity, U , a a temporal average of the CAT Vehicle’s own 
velocity over an interval. Letting vAV1 , . . . , v 

AV 
m denote the CAT Vehicle velocity over the last m measurements, the 

desire velocity be compute a the temporal average U = 1m 
∑m 
j=1 v 

AV 
j . In practice, we choose m correspond to 

a 38 second interval, which be approximately the time require to travel one lap around the ring. 
The desire average velocity be then translate into a target velocity depend on the current gap between the 

6 



CAT Vehicle and lead vehicle: 

vtarget = U + vcatch ×min(max(∆x−glgu−gl , 0), 1) , (3) 

which be up to vcatch above U . This allows the CAT Vehicle to drive faster than the average velocity and catch up to the 
lead vehicle, should it face a gap above the low threshold gl, while at low gap the target velocity reduces to the 
average U . At gap above the upper gap limit gl, CAT Vehicle vehicle should close the gap by travel vcatch above 
U . 

The command velocity sent to the low level CAT Vehicle controller be update via the rule 

vcmdj+1 = βj(αjv 
target 
j + (1− αj)v 

lead 
j ) + (1− βj)vcmdj , (4) 

where the subscript j denotes the time step. This rule (4) chooses the new command velocity a a weight average 
of the prior command velocity, the target velocity, and the lead vehicle’s velocity. The weight αj and βj depend 
on the gap a follows: β = 1− 12α, and 

α = min(max(∆x−∆x 
s 

γ , 0), 1) . (5) 

In (5), the distance ∆xs be a safety distance. We have α = 0 if ∆x ≤ ∆xs and α = 1 if ∆x ≥ ∆xs + γ, meaning 
that for relatively short gaps, only the lead vehicle’s velocity matters, while for relatively large gaps, only the target 
velocity be average with the command velocity. The parameter γ control the the rate at which α transition from 0 
to 1, and be set to γ = 2 m in the current implementation. This mean that when the gap be short, the CAT Vehicle have 
the same speed of the lead vehicle, while when the gap be large the CAT Vehicle speed tends towards the target vehicle, 
which allows the CAT Vehicle to reduce the gap with the lead vehicle. The parameter β determines how rapidly the 
controller adjusts to new situation (with more rapid adjustment occur in more safety-critical situations). At it 
core, this be a PI controller, but with a saturation at small gap (for safety purposes), and a saturation at large gap (so 
that the CAT Vehicle close gaps). 

The model parameter for both controller be determine via test in a simulation environment (with a data- 
fit human-driver model), a well a via car-following field test (before the actual experiments). As a result we set 
the low gap limit gl = 7 m, the upper gap limit a gu = 30 m and vcatch = 1 m/s. The safety distance be implement 
a ∆xs = max(2 s×∆v, 4 m). The term 2 s×∆v represent the recommend follow distance accord to the 
2 second rule, with a low bound of 4 m. 

3.3. Low level vehicle control 
The command velocity produce by the two controller described above be translate to the actual vehicle 

control (i.e., gas and brake signals) via a multi-mode controller. The use of a multi-mode controller permit different 
gain to be use for acceleration or for braking, to enable faster brake when need while avoid chatter at 
steady-state velocities. 

Each mode be a PID controller, with gain determine through system identification of the CAT Vehicle at constant 
velocity representative of those record in the experiment, use a similar structure a in [65]. The CAT Vehicle 
plant be simplify a a first-order model base on constant accelerator inputs. The controller’s design be thus: 

aj+1 = 

 
h1(vj , v 

cmd 
j ) if v 

cmd 
j − vj > −0.25 m 

h2(vj , v 
cmd 
j ) if v 

cmd 
j − vj ≤ −0.25 m 

0 otherwise , 

in which aj+1 ∈ [−100, 100] represent the next command “acceleration” value, where 100 be the maximum 
depression of the accelerator, and -100 be the maximum depression of the brake. Moreover, vj be the current speed 
of the CAT Vehicle, and vcmdj be the desire speed. When a < 0 the brake be depressed, and when a > 0 the 
accelerator be depressed. Controller h1 be design to accelerate to the desire reference speed and maintain that 
desire speed primarily through control of the vehicle’s accelerator, and controller h2 be design to effect more rapid 
speed reduction via the brake. Thus when the desire speed be less than 0.25 m of the current speed, the brake be used, 

7 



and otherwise the accelerator be use to control speed (as in normal drive when release the accelerator reduces 
speed). These controller be provide sample data at 20 Hz and be permit to send new update to the CAT 
Vehicle at 20Hz. 

The performance characteristic of each controller be provide for a change of input a a step function of 1 m/s 
(-1 m/s for braking). The controller h1 have a rise time of approximately 1.6 s with an overshoot of 5% and a settle 
time of approximately 5.52 s. The controller h2 have a rise time of approximately 0.8 s, with an 11% overshoot and 
settle time of approximately 1.94 s. 

Given the dynamic of the CAT Vehicle, a tradeoff must be perform on the comfort of the ride and the physical 
dynamic for a change in reference speed. The switch nature of the controller provide robustness to noise in 
sample speed, since the accelerator be primarily use to control speed at steady state. Finally, the PID controller be 
reset at 0 velocity, and standard approach for windup avoidance be use to prevent unsafe acceleration [66]. 

3.4. Human driver controller 
The driver who implement human control of the CAT Vehicle (coauthor M. Bunting) be instruct to attempt to 

maintain a desire velocity, but to slow down to avoid collision with the vehicle ahead. This be similar to the control 
law use in Experiment A, with the notable exception that the desire velocity be give in miles/hour (the primary 
readout of the speedometer in the CAT Vehicle). The driver receive training from the University of Arizona on safe 
drive of high-occupancy vehicles, and have extensive practice to drive in this way, before the actual experiment be 
performed. 

4. Experimental results: Dampening traffic wave with a single vehicle 

The experimental result be present in this section. To be able to effectively compare the result of the exper- 
iments, it be important to define metrics, which be consistent across the experiments. To this end, we present the 
metric use to describe the traffic flow in Section 4.1. With the metric fully defined, we present the result of the 
three experiment conduct in Section 4.2. 

4.1. Definition and calculation of metric 
At each time step, we have the follow data. From the image processing, we have the position x, the velocity 

v, and the acceleration a of each vehicle. From the OBD-II sensors, we have the instantaneous fuel consumption c 
of each vehicle. Let f ij denote the sample of a quantity f , correspond to vehicle i, at time tj . A temporal average 
of a quantity over an interval t ∈ [tstart, tend] be calculate a f̄ i = 1m

4.2. Experimental result 

Experiment A contains 21 vehicles, include the CAT Vehicle. The CAT Vehicle be initially under human control, 
and the first traffic wave be observe 79 second into the experiment. The FollowerStopper wave-dampening controller 
be activate 126 second into the experiment, and set with a desire velocity of U = 6.50 m/s. Over the next several 
minutes, the desire velocity be varied step by step to test the dependence of the traffic condition on the set point. It be 
change to 7.00 m/s (222 second into the experiment), 7.50 m/s (292 second into the experiment), and finally 8.00 
m/s at 347 second into the experiment. At 415 seconds, the desire velocity be reduce to 7.50 m/s, where it remains 
for 48 seconds. At 463 second into the experiment, the human driver resume control of the CAT Vehicle speed. The 
experiment be end at 567 seconds. 

Experiment B also involves 21 vehicle and follow a similar design a Experiment A. The main difference be that 
in Experiment B, after the wave initially appears, a train human driver implement the control strategy described 

9 



in Experiment A but without the aid of automation. The human-executed control strategy be to maintain a desire 
velocity, calculate by an external observer a the average velocity of the previous lap, without collide with the 
vehicle ahead. The CAT Vehicle be always under human control, but the driver switch from initially follow the 
instruction give to all human driver to mimic the control strategy in Experiment A after a wave appears. A 
traffic wave be first observe 55 second from the start of Experiment B, and the active control to dampen the wave 
begin after 112 second at a desire velocity of 6.25 m/s (14 mph in the unit displayed in the CAT Vehicle dashboard) 
with the command to “drive with an average speed of 14 mile per hour, unless safety require slow speeds.” After 
202 seconds, the CAT Vehicle operator be instruct to increase the desire speed “to 16 mile per hour,” (7.15 m/s) 
which be maintain for 98 second before revert to typical human drive behavior. The experiment be end after 
409 seconds. 

Experiment C be conduct with 22 vehicles. Note that one vehicle be add for this experiment, to demonstrate 
that instability and wave damp be not specific to have exactly 21 vehicle on the ring. At 161 second into 
the experiment, a traffic wave appears. At 218 seconds, the PI controller with saturation wave damp controller 
be activated, and remains active until the end of the experiment at 413 seconds. Because the controller directly 
determines the desire velocity a part of the control algorithm, there be no external parameter that be change 
during the experiment. 

After conclusion of the experiments, the data gather through a 360◦ camera place at the center of track, in- 
vehicle devices, and CAT Vehicle control computer be analyze to characterize the performance of each experiment 
with respect to dampen traffic waves. 

Displacement data describe each vehicle’s distance travel from their initial position on the ring at the begin 
of the experiment. These data be extract from the central camera use standard computer vision technique to 
track vehicle position along the ring. Velocity data be derive through discrete differentiation of displacement data 
(likewise, acceleration from velocity data) [61], which be validate against the CAT Vehicle control computer and 
the in-vehicle devices. The full data set and code use to generate the plot can be found in [67]. 

Notable event in each experiment define time interval over which to evaluate the state of traffic. In each analysis 
we quantify the traffic state accord to (a) the standard deviation of traffic velocity; (b) the fuel consumption [68]; (c) 
the rate of excessive brake events; and (d) the traffic throughput. A detailed description of how these calculation be 
performed, a well a the specific definition of common metric of fuel consumption, velocity (average and standard 
deviation), and excessive brake be available in Section 4.1. 

In Experiment A, the traffic state be quantify over eight time interval throughout the experiment. In each interval, 
the fuel consumption, velocity standard deviation, excessive braking, and throughput be report in Table 1. The 
position of each vehicle’s center over time be show in Figure 3a, with the CAT Vehicle be show in red and all other 
vehicle be show in gray. In Figure 3b, the velocity profile of the CAT Vehicle be show in red, and all other vehicle 
velocity be plot in gray. For each interval, the black dash line denotes the average velocity of traffic over that 
interval, and the blue dash line denote the average velocity plus/minus one standard deviation. 

When the CAT Vehicle be initially under human control, a wave begin to appear. After the controller be activate 
the wave be noticeably affected, but not fully removed, through the interval when the CAT Vehicle control be activate 
at a desire velocity of 6.50 m/s. The wave-dampening effect of the controller be observe in the velocity profile 
(Figure 3b), which exhibit a low magnitude of oscillation from the mean after control begins. When the CAT 
Vehicle desire speed set in the FollowerStopper be increase to 7.00 m/s 222 second into the experiment, further 
wave dampen be observed, and at a desire speed of 7.50 m/s, the best performance of the controller be achieved. 
Compared to the initial period where a wave be present under human control, the velocity standard deviation be 
reduce by 80.8%, the fuel consumption be reduce by 42.5%, and the excessive brake event be reduce from 8.58 
event per vehicle per kilometer to 0.12 event per vehicle per kilometer. Because the average velocity of traffic on 
the ring be also increased, the throughput on the roadway increase by 14.1%. 

At 7.50 m/s, the CAT Vehicle’s speed match the average traffic speed almost precisely, and consequently it 
do not need to slow down. However, at 347 seconds, the CAT Vehicle desire velocity be increase further to 8.00 
m/s and the CAT Vehicle is, on average, faster than the flow of traffic—which inevitably induces a wave again. The 
reappearance of a wave have the effect of increase fuel consumption relative to the slow desire velocities, but still 
represent a benefit of the control compare to the uncontrolled traffic. At 415 second the CAT Vehicle’s desire 
velocity be reduce to 7.50 m/s, and the wave be once again dampened. The FollowerStopper controller be deactivate 
after 463 seconds, and the traffic wave reappears.

The control of the CAT Vehicle have the impact of reduce the total fuel consumption of the traffic, a show in 
Table 1. The low fuel consumption of 14.13 `/100km be observe when the FollowerStopper be operate with the 
set point of 7.50 m/s. This be also the low fuel consumption amongst all experiment conducted. A video of of 
Experiment A be provide in Movie S1 in the supplementary materials. 

In Experiment B, the CAT Vehicle operator initially drive accord to the same instruction a the other vehicle 
operator and a traffic wave appear at 55 seconds. At 112 second into the experiment, the CAT Vehicle operator 
begin to drive at a desire velocity of 6.26 m/s without collide with the vehicle in front. Later the desire velocity 
be increase before return to the gap closing instruction follow by all other human drivers. The trajectory be 
show in Figure 4 and the traffic state be quantify in each interval in Table 2. 

The dampen effect of the human-implemented controller be quantify by the standard deviation of the veloci- 
ties, which be reduce by 49.5% when the 6.26 m/s control be active compare to when it be not. Similarly, excessive

brake be reduce by 76.2% when control be applied. 
The desire speed give to the CAT Vehicle driver also influence the reduction in the velocity variability. When 

the desire speed of the CAT Vehicle be increase to 16 mph (7.15 m/s), the standard deviation reach the minimum 
value for the experiment. The throughput be also high during this period compare to when the traffic be uncontrolled 
(2008 veh/hr vs. 1828 veh/hr). Once the CAT Vehicle return to a typical gap closing behavior (i.e., no longer under 
human control to maintain a desire speed), the traffic wave reappears, and the velocity standard deviation increases. 

When the CAT Vehicle be under wave dampen control by a human, the control reduces the overall fuel con- 
sumption when compare to the uncontrolled case (Table 2), where average fuel consumption (`/100km) be record 
for each period of the experiment. The result be a decrease in fuel consumption when the CAT Vehicle begin to 
dampen the traffic wave (a decrease from 21.8 `/100km to 17.9 `/100km, (17.9%)). A further decrease in fuel con- 
sumption (to 17.0 `/100km, a decrease of 22.0% compare to when a wave be present initially) be observe when the 
desire velocity be increase from 14 mph (6.25 m/s) to 16 mph (7.15 m/s). Finally, when the CAT Vehicle return to 
human-driven behavior and stop actively dampen the traffic wave, fuel consumption increase again and return 
to a level similar to the pre-control fuel consumption (21.8 `/100km) before control start compare to (21.6 `/100km) 
after control end and the traffic wave reappears). 

Finally, in Experiment C, an additional vehicle be add to the track, bring the total number of vehicle to 22.

Table 4: Summary metric over all vehicle by interval with correspond start time, for Experiment C. 

As in other experiments, the CAT Vehicle begin the experiment in human control. The traffic be relatively smooth 
until the first strong wave occurs at 161 seconds. Comparing the traffic condition under no control before the strong 
wave appear to when it be observed, the traffic wave result in a 37.7% increase in the average velocity standard 
deviation, a 63.8% increase in fuel consumption, and a 18.8% reduction in throughput. 

At 218 seconds, the PI controller with saturation wave damp traffic controller be activated, and the wave be 
substantially reduced. Compared to the interval when the wave be present, the controller result in a reduction of the 
speed variability (54.7% reduction in standard deviation see Table 4). It also reduces the fuel consumption by 27.9%, 
and the rate of excessive brake be reduce by 74.4%. The throughput be also slightly reduce by 2.5%. Note that 
this controller only us information directly measure by the CAT Vehicle itself, and it do not require any external 
information. One consequence of this more local nature be that the wave dampen be not a perfect a in Experiment 
A. In particular, the controller slightly reduces the average velocity. Nevertheless, the velocity standard deviation, 
excessive braking, and fuel consumption be substantially reduce compare to when uncontrolled traffic wave be 
present. 

By examine the trajectory (Figure 5), it be apparent that the control law be able to eliminate the initially present 
wave, but another wave be generate during the control period. The second wave be also damped by the control law, 
but it presence for a period of the active control account for the difference relative to the period where no wave 
occur in the uncontrolled period at the start of the experiment. 

To conclude, these experiment demonstrate that traffic flow control via low penetration rate automate vehicle 
be in fact possible. Moreover, the data collect quantify the benefit of conduct control via the AV. Specifically, 
under proper control, (a) the velocity standard deviation reduces noticeably; (b) the fuel consumption be reduce by 
a significant margin; (c) brake event be substantially reduced; and (d) in some experiments, even the average 
velocity (and thus the throughput) be increase (Table 3). 

Velocity standard deviation: The velocity standard deviation be reduce in all experiments, range between 49.5% 
for Experiment B, 54.7% for Experiment C, and a high of 80.8% for Experiment A. 

Fuel consumption: The fuel consumption in all experiment be reduce from when wave be present and under 
human control compare to when the autonomous car be active. The improvement include a reduction of 42.5%, 
22.1%, and 28.1% in Experiments A, B, and C, respectively. 

Excessive braking: The number of excessive brake event be also substantially reduced, from 8.58 to 9.66 
excessive brake events/veh/km down to 2.47 events/veh/km in the bad perform controller and nearly complete 
elimination (0.12 events/veh/km) in the best perform controller. 

Throughput: Changes in throughput for each experiment be +14.1% for Experiment A, and +9.8% for Experiment 
B, with a −2.5% change in Experiment C. 

5. Conclusions 

AVs can revolutionize the control of traffic flow. They offer the potential to shift from localize control measures, 
like ramp metering, and centralize ones, a variable speed limit gantries, to Lagrangian actuator immerse in the 
traffic stream. Strikingly, it be not necessary for all vehicle to be automate in order to benefit from mobile actuation. 
A single autonomous vehicle can control the flow of at least 20 human-controlled vehicle around it, with substantial 
reduction in velocity standard deviation, excessive braking, and fuel consumption.

deviation above and below the mean speed of traffic in the interval. 

Figure 5: Trajectories and standard deviation in velocity for Experiment C. 

Moreover, this study demonstrates that these benefit can be achieve via structurally very simple control strategies, 
base only on the AV’s velocity, it spatial gap between the vehicle immediately in front, and some estimate of the 
average velocity of traffic flow. The PI with saturation controller (Experiment C) be a fully automatic control, while 
the FollowerStopper (Experiment A) and the human-implemented control (Experiment B) have an external input 
(dependent on observe traffic conditions). This simple structure implies that a noticeable impact on congest traffic 
flow can in principle be achieve by mean of adaptive cruise control system that be already in place in certain new 
vehicles, and the use of intelligent infrastructure and/or connect vehicle to provide the require external inputs. 

Most contemporary traffic control strategy (implemented in practice, and/or propose in the literature) be base 
on centralize interventions, such a ramp-metering, variable speed limits, and traffic light controls. For example, a 
successful variable speed limit control may yield a 5% increase in capacity [28]. However, those traditional control 
approach will always have limited effect on the traffic dynamic that emerge between the fix control points. In 
contrast, the control of traffic flow via a sparse set of Lagrangian actuator (AVs or train human drivers) enables 
new opportunity for control, with a direct positive effect on the dynamic of traffic flow, and without the need of a 
dedicate actuation infrastructure. 

The present ring experiment represent a stretch of single-lane roadway. However, the theory extends also to 
multi-lane freeways, on which lane change can serve a an additional trigger of stop-and-go waves. The lane change 
can also open up gap in the vacate lane, which can serve to dampen wave in that lane. The central challenge in the 
multi-lane set be to have controller that dynamically dampen waves, but without leave too large gaps, because 
large gap may trigger additional lane changing, which may reduce the effectiveness of the strategy. The result of 
Experiment A demonstrate that the controller do in fact not leave a large gap once the wave have be damped. To 
fully quantify the benefit of Lagrangian actuator on urban freeways, future multi-lane experiment be needed. 

The control of complex multi-agent system have impact beyond vehicular traffic flow, include coordinate 
robot [69], social network [70], animal swarm [71, 72], and many other applications. However, in contrast 
to many application in robotics or fleet control, the human agent play a crucial role in traffic flow dynamics. More- 
over, in contrast to other human-in-the-loop cyber-physical systems, the automate controller and the human agent 
be spatially separated, and they do not work cooperatively. Rather, the AVs counteract the humans’ tendency to
