Magnetic memory cell associate with the stress-mediated magnetoelectric effect promise extremely 

low bit-writing energies. Most investigation have focus on the process of write information in 

memory cells, and very few on readout schemes. The usual assumption be that the readout will be 

achieve use magnetoresistive structure such a Giant Magneto-Resistive stack or Magnetic 

Tunnel Junctions. Since the write energy be very low in the magnetoelectric systems, the readout 

energy use magnetoresistive approach becomes non negligible. Incidentally, the magneto-electric 

interaction itself contains the potentiality of the readout of the information encode in the magnetic 

subsystem. In this letter, the principle of magnetoelectric readout of the information by an electric 

field in a composite multiferroic heterostructure be consider theoretically and demonstrate 

experimentally use ½N � ðTbCo2=FeCoÞ�/½PbðMg1=3Nb2=3ÞO3�ð1�xÞ � ½PbTiO3�x stress-mediated 
ME heterostructures. Published by AIP Publishing. [http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4983717] 

The new generation of data storage technology require 

high speed, high density, low power, and nonvolatile random 

access memory (RAM).1,2 Prospective RAMs use different 

physical principle (Ferroelectric-RAM, Magnetic-RAM, 

Spin Torque Transfer-RAM, Resistive-RAM, Conductive 

Bridge RAM, and Phase Change RAM) have be widely 

discuss in the last few years,3 and for a decade, magnetic 

RAMs have be foreseen a the strong contender, espe- 

cially with the advent of Spin Transfer Torque (STT) and 

Spin Orbit Torque (SOT)-RAMs.4,5 However, these two tech- 

nologies require large current density to switch the magneti- 

zation between memory state and be therefore far from be 

optimum.6 For this reason, the control of magnetization with 

electric field be of prime interest,7,8 and a number of work 

be related on multiferroics and magnetoelectric (ME) effect 

and compound for memory applications.9–12 

Among the different solution to achieve the ME 

effect, it have be show that couple the magnetoelastic 

and piezolectric material through mechanical interaction13 

could yield very energy-efficient memory devices14–19 with 

simulated energy consumption a low a a few ten of atto- 

joule per write bit.20–23 Because of the symmetry of the 

Joule magnetostriction, which be the main phenomenon at 

play, many propose device rely on the anisotropic nature 

of the piezo-strain generate by the electric field, and 

½PbðMg1=3Nb2=3ÞO3�ð1�xÞ � ½PbTiO3�x (PMN-PT) compound 
in the h011i cut be often chosen a an electroactive sub- 
strate.24,25 Another approach us nonspecific piezoelectric 

material in which an anisotropic stress distribution can be tai- 

lored use planar electrodes.14,22,26,27 In any of those 

configuration of stress-mediated magnetoelectric memory, 

most investigation have focus on the process of write 

information in the memory cell, and very few on the readout 

schemes. The usual assumption be that the readout will be 

achieve use magnetoresistive structure such a Giant 

Magneto-Resistive (GMR) stacks28 or Magnetic Tunnel 

Junctions (MTJ).27 Although they have be experimentally 

demonstrated, the integration of these complex element at a 

very low scale together with “exotic” electro-active substrate 

such a PMN-PT and the control micro-electronics remains a 

challenge. It be also worth note that, since the write energy 

be potentially very low in the ME systems, the readout energy 

use magnetoresistive approach becomes non negligible.29 

In this respect, alternative readout way be of high interest. 

Incidentally, the ME interaction itself contains the 

potentiality of the readout of the information encode in the 

magnetic subsystem. Because the system be fully coupled, 

the reorientation of magnetic moment by electric field indu- 

ce an elastic stress in the piezoelectric layer and generates a 

piezoelectric potential in the structure. This ME potential 

depends on the initial state of the magnetic subsystem. If the 

magnetic state be not modify by the apply electric field, 

no ME voltage be induced on the piezoelectric layer. On the 

other hand, if the polarity of the apply electric field corre- 

sponds to the reorientation of the magnetic moments, a ME 

potential should appear. Like the ME writing, the advantage 

of a ME readout be that it be perform through an electric 

field and therefore do not require any current go 

through highly resistive tunnel junctions. Because it relies on 

the same physical principle, the ME readout require an

energy a low a the ME writing. In previous theoretical 

studies, we have demonstrate that the require energy for 

write a bit in a 50 nm stress-mediated memory cell be in the 

2� 10�16 J/bit range, which be mainly due to the dissipate 
energy during the charge/discharge of the capacitor form 

by the PbðZrxTi1�xÞO3(PZT) piezoelectric material between 
the drive electrodes.23 For PMN-PT with four time high 

piezoelectric constant the expect energy consumption be 

one order of value smaller. As a comparison, a typical 45 nm 

Spin Torque Transfer Magnetic memory (STT-RAM) base 

on a Magnetic Tunnel Junction (MTJ) with a resistance-area 

product of 10 X lm2 lead to a MTJ resistance of 5 kX. For 
sense current in the low end of the require values, that be to 

say, 10 lA, and an optimistic readout time of 1 n (those value 
be usually high for an accurate readout of the store informa- 

tion), the reading energy lose in Joule heating will still be of 

5� 10�16 J/bit30,31 which be more or at best comparable with 
what could be achieve use the ME readout. In the present 

paper, we theoretically describe and experimentally demon- 

strate the principle of both write and reading information 

use an electric field in ½N � ðTbCo2=FeCoÞ�/PMN-PT stress- 
mediate ME heterostructures. 

The MagnetoELectric Random Access Memory 

(MELRAM)14,15,25,32 cell show schematically in Fig. 1 con- 

sists of a uniaxial magnetostrictive multilayered structure 

with N layer of TbCo2=FeCo deposit on a PMN-PT pie- 
zoelectric crystal in the h011i cut.25 A magnetic field with a 
strength H be apply in the plane of the structure normally to 
the anisotropy axis EA direct at an angle p=4 with respect 
to the x axis. If the value of H be small than the anisotropy 
field HA, the equilibrium state of the magnetic subsystem be 
bistable. This bistability result from the symmetry of the 

thermodynamic potential Fm of the magnetic subsystem

the potential energy Fm have two minimum correspond to the

state be associate with the bit state “0” and “1”. The 

switch between these states, correspond to the informa- 

tion recording, be achievable by an anisotropic in-plane stress

where the index m indicates the magnetic film, Tmij be the 
stress tensor in the magnetic film, Cmij be it elastic moduli, 
and B be the magnetoelastic constant. An apply anisotropic 
stress break the symmetry of the thermodynamic potential 

and result in only one equilibrium state for the magnetiza- 

tion depend on the sign of the stress. If the magnetic sys- 

tem be already in the correspond state prior to the 

application of the stress, it will remain unchanged. In the 

opposite case, the system will switch to the new state upon 

application of the stress and remain stable in the say state 

after the stress be released. The dynamic of the magnetic 

switch in the system under consideration have already be 

described in detail.14,20,21,23 The energy efficient way for the 

creation of the stress in a magnetic film be the application of 

an electric field to the piezoelectric crystal that be elastically 

couple to the film. For this purpose, and a it follow from 

Eq. (2), the in-plane stress should be anisotropic. From a 

memory cell design point of view, the most appropriate ori- 

entation of the electric field ~E be normal to the plane of the 
structure. This requirement be satisfied, for example, by use 

a PMN-PT ferroelectric relaxor in the h011i cut. The corre- 
spondent piezoelectric energy density for such a crystal be

This stress contributes to the magnetoelastic energy in Eq.

Equation (12) describes the magnetic feedback on the elec- 

tric polarization that allows for the detection of the switch 

between different magnetic state define by the magneti- 

zation directions. In the simplest electrical scheme show

where s ¼ RC with C be the cell capacity and e33 be the z 
component of the dielectric permittivity of the piezoelectric 

material. For switch time much small than s, the 
magneto-electric signal VME, described by the second term 
in Eq. (13), be proportional to the variation of polarization

Consequently, this ME signal indicates the magnetiza- 

tion switch induced by the electric field and reveals the 

initial state of the magnetic subsystem. For example, if the 

apply voltage V0 be positive, the switch be possible only if 
the initial state corresponds to “0”. If it corresponds to “1” 

no switch and therefore no ME signal be expected. On the 

other hand, for a negative voltage the signal can be measure 

if the initial state be “1.” Thus, the magneto-electric interac- 

tion be applicable not only for record a bit but also for 

reading the information via an electric field in the MELRAM 
cell. 

The experiment be carry out on a cell consist of 

a nanostructured magnetostrictive film of 25 bilayers 

ðTbCo2Þ4nm=ðFeCoÞ4nm deposit by RF sputter on a 
10� 10� 0:3 mm3 commercial PMN-PT h011i crystalline 
substrate. The measurement be make use the electrical 

scheme show in Fig. 1. The result be present in Fig. 2. 

Figure 2(a) show the sequence of electric pulse V0ðtÞ 
apply to the scheme. After each pulse, the cell capacity be 

discharged. Fig. 2(b) display the VR voltage pulse that be 
detect across the resistance R. Figure 2(c) show the ME 
signal VME ¼ VRðHÞ � VRð0Þ obtain by subtraction of the 
signal measure when the magnetize field be equal to

and H¼ 0. In the last case, where H¼ 0, no 
switch of magnetization be possible independently of the sign 

of the apply electric voltage. The application of the pri- 

mary “writing” electric pulse result in the orientation of the 

FIG. 2. (a) Sequence of the electrical pulse apply to the MELRAM cell;

and (d) Variation of magnetization projection on the easy axis detect by

magnetization accord to the pulse polarity. The applica- 

tion of the “reading” electric pulse with the same polarity 

do not change the magnetic state and no ME response be 

detected. However, if the “reading” pulse polarity be 

changed, a magnetization switch be induced and the ME 

response be observed. Figure 2(d) show the correspond 

behavior of the magnetization projection on the easy axis of 

the cell. The last measurement be make use the 

magneto-optic Kerr effect. 

The maximum value of the observe ME signal be equal 

to VME ¼ 75 mV. The theoretical value predict by Eq. (14) 
can be estimate use the thickness of the magnetic layer 

hm ¼ 200 nm, magnetoelastic constant B ¼ �7 MPa,33 and 
the follow parameter of PMN-PT:34 d31 ¼ 610 C=N; 
d32 ¼ �1883 C=N; e33 ¼ 4033. The estimate signal VME 
¼ 98 mV be close to the experimental value. 

The obtain theoretical and experimental result show 

the feasibility of the two basic operation of record and 

reading of information store in the magnetic subsystem 

use electric field pulse apply to the MELRAM cell. The 

main challenge for the implementation of the ME readout 

lie in the separation of the magneto-electrically induced 

potential VME from the V0 apply voltage for the magnetic 
state identification. Here, the VME signal be extract by a 
mathematical subtraction of the experimental data. In a real 

cell, the separation can be achieve by use a Wheatstone 

bridge scheme with a passive nonmagnetic capacitor in the 

branch parallel to the cell. Moreover, the experiment under 

consideration be perform on a cell of a millimetric size. 

Nevertheless, accord to Eq. (8), the ME potential do not 

depend on the thickness of the piezoelectric layer when 

hp � hm nor on the in-plane cell dimension (except for the 
lateral effect from the fringe field35). It mean that the 

ME readout principle allows for the cell down-scaling with- 

out any visible decrease of the ME signals. A drawback of 

this energy efficient readout approach be that it be a destruc- 

tive one when the readout voltage pulse switch the magne- 

tization. Nevertheless, by use the output electric signal 

generate by the switch to trigger a delayed write pulse 

with an opposite polarity, the initial state of the magnetic 

system can be restore automatically.
