1 LIST OF EYE MOVEMENT FEATURES 

From each time window, we extract a list of 207 feature which be summarise in the list below. For 
brevity, we sometimes collapse several item into one bullet point and give the number of feature per 
bullet point in brackets. E.g. ’mean/variance/minimum/maximum of the fixation duration (4)’ mean that 
there be four features, namely statistical mean, variance, minimum and maximum of the fixation duration. 

Please note that all code we use to extract these feature be publicly available on GitHub1. 

Statistics over fixations, saccade and blink 

Fixations be detect use a dispersion-threshold algorithm with a threshold of 2.5% of the track 
range width (and an additional threshold on the minimum duration of 100ms). This dispersion threshold 
be also use to define small and large saccade by compare the amplitude of a saccade to twice the 
dispersion threshold. 

A saccade that end right (left) of it point of origin be call right (left) saccade. Note that this be 
independent of the saccade’s absolute position, e.g. a saccade within the left low corner of a person’s 
field of view might still be a right saccade, if it end a little further right than it started. 

A ratio between eye movement be meant to describe the ratio between the number of occurrence in 
one time window. E.g. if there be 1 fixation and 2 saccade in a time window, the ratio of fixation to 
saccade would be 12 . 

The rate of an eye movement be define a it number of occurrence per second (e.g. 5 fixation per 
second). 

• fixation/saccade rate (2) 
• small/large saccade rate (2) 
• left/right saccade rate (2) 
• saccade to fixation ratio 
• ratio of small/large/right/left saccade to the 

total number of saccade (4) 

• mean/variance/minimum/maximum saccade 
amplitude (4) 

• mean/variance/minimum/maximum saccade 
saccadic peak velocity (4) 

• mean/variance/minimum/maximum of the 
mean pupil diameter during saccade (4) 

• mean/variance/minimum/maximum of the 
fixation duration (4)

Statistics over raw gaze data 

Features that be compute on the raw x coordinates, raw y coordinate and pupil diameter separately be 
abbreviate a on ’XYD’. 

• heatmap count with 8× 8 cell (64) 
• mean of XYD (3) 
• minimum of XYD (3) 
• maximum of XYD (3) 
• range of XYD (3) 
• standard deviation of XYD (3) 
• median of XYD (3) 
• 1st quartile of the distribution over XYD (3) 

• 3rd quartile of the distribution over XYD (3) 
• inter quartile range of the distribution over 

XYD (3) 
• absolute value of mean difference between 

subsequent XYD (3) 
• mean difference between subsequent XYD (3) 
• mean angle between two subsequent raw gaze 

point (i.e. between the x-axis and the vector 
connect the two gaze points) 

Information on the temporal course of saccade and fixation 

n-grams describe series of n events, for instance 2-grams base on the event {short fixation, long 
fixation, saccade} could be: [short fixation, saccade] or any of the 32 possible combination of events. The 
frequency of one such n-gram be define a it number of occurrence here, e.g. the example 2-gram [short 
fixation, saccade] could occur twice in a give time window. The frequency for all possible event could 
be computed, concatenate and then feature such a the mean over these frequency can be extracted. 

For n-grams with n from 1 to 4, 
each once base on saccade only, once base on saccade and fixations. 
For saccade only, each saccade be label a small or large, and with one out of 8 possible directions. 
For saccade and fixations, a fixation be label a either short or long; a saccade be label a small 
or large and with one out of 4 possible directions. 

• number of different movement 
• highest/lowest frequency within the n-gram (2) 
• most/least frequent movement (2) 
• range/mean/variance of frequency within the n-gram (3)

3 DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS 
To facilitate comparison with related work we also provide correlation coefficient between personality 
score and those feature extract from a slide window with a length of 15 second (which be the 
window length that be most frequently select in our training scheme) in Table S2. These correlation 
coefficient describe property of the collect data and, in contrast to the feature importance score in 
Figure 2 in the main article, be independent of the machine learn approach. 

Table S2. Correlation coefficient between personality score range for each trait and feature extract from a 
slide window with a length of 15 seconds. The feature list in the table form the small set that contains the 15 
feature with high correlation for each trait. These 15 coefficient be highlight in bold. The n-gram feature 
be call sacc. movement if they be base on saccade only and SF if fixation be consider a well.

4 TRAINING PROCEDURE 
In the following, the scheme to train a single random forest classifier will be described (see GitHub for our 
implementation): 
A priori, no clear hypothesis about useful window size for the slide window approach or informative 
feature for every day life recording existed. Therefore, each classifier be train in a nest cross 
validation scheme that fit parameter during training while prevent overfitting. Cross validation mean 
that a give set of recording be not simply split into one training and one test set, but instead the algorithm 
cycle different split into the training and test sets. On each pair of training and test set, a separate classifier 
be train and the performance measure be then average over all splits. Typically, a single classifier be 
train on the training set and be late evaluate on the unseen test set. In nest cross validation however, 
another (so-called inner) cross validation take place on the training set. This is, the algorithm again cycle 
through different split of the (outer) training set into (inner) training and (inner) test set. In this inner cross 
validation, different parameter can be test on the inner training set and apply to the inner test set. Once 
the best perform parameter (i.e. in our case window size and features) be chosen, a classifier with 
these parameter be newly train on the entire outer training set and evaluate on the still unseen outer test 
set. Figure S1 show the distribution of all chosen window sizes.

Figure S1. During the training procedure, a nest cross validation scheme be use to determine the best 
perform parameters, one of which be the size of a slide window use to process raw gaze data. This 
histogram show the frequency of each window size (x-axis) sum up over all cycle of the training 
scheme. While the y-axis show relative frequency, the number above each bar be the absolute number of 
time a window be chosen. 

The inner cross validation cycle include 3 different data split (folds) that be chosen to contain an 
approximately equal number of sample for each class. The goodness of a classifier on the inner test set 
be evaluate use the accuracy over all sample (i.e. independent of the participant they belong to). For 
the outer cross validation, the data use for test be cycle such that each time, 5 different participant be 
in the test set and the remain 37 in the training set. Finally, a prediction for each participant in the outer

test set be derive by majority voting over all time window associate with that particular participant. 
The prediction from all outer fold be merge into a set of exactly one prediction per participant and 
evaluate in term of an F1 score with macro averaging. The F1 score be define a the harmonic mean of 
precision and recall, where precision for a certain class capture how many of the actual class instance 
be correctly detected, whereas recall capture how many of the instance that be predict to be class 
instance be actually correct. Macro average mean that one F1 score per class be compute and those 
be then averaged. This reflect the intuition that a personality prediction system be expect to predict 
extreme values, a oppose to a system that typically predicts the most frequent personality class. 
Feature selection within the inner cross validation cycle be perform base on the Random Forests’ feature 
importance: all feature that do not reach a high average importance than 0.005 across all split be 
disabled for the outer cross validation.
