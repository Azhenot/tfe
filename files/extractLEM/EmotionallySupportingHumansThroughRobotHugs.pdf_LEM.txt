ABSTRACT 
Hugs be one of the first form of contact and affection human ex- 
perience. Due to their prevalence and health benefits, we want to en- 
able robot to safely hug humans. This research strives to create and 
study a high fidelity robotic system that provide emotional support 
to people through hugs. This paper outline our previous work eval- 
uating human response to a prototype’s physical and behavioral 
characteristics, and then it lay out our ongoing and future work.

1 INTRODUCTION 
Hugging give an individual social support, relief stress, lower 
blood pressure, and increase oxytocin level [2]. Because of hug- 
ging’s health benefits, roboticists have try to artificially create this 
gesture. DiSalvo et al.’s The Hug be a plush comfort object, whose 
shape mimic a child’s; it work in pair to provide user “tele-hugs” 
[3]. While it stomach glows, vibrates, and play a melody when 
receive a hug, it lack the ability to wrap it arm tighter around 
the human, and it require an additional human partner. Stiehl et 
al.’s teddy bear robot, the Huggable, us sensor under a layer of 
silicone and fur to detect where and how it be be touch [9]. It 
provide companionship to and monitor child in the hospital. 
While it can move it head and arms, because of it small size, it 
can be hug but cannot actively hug back. 

Shiomi et al. ran two experiment with a large teddy bear robot, 
find that user who hug the robot interact with it longer, 
provide more self-disclosure, and afterwards be more inclined 
toward prosocial behavior [8] [7]. Miyashita and Ishiguro use an 
autonomous wheel invert pendulum humanoid robot to hug in 
a three-step process, while maintain it balance [5]. Determining 
the hug duration be not described. It appear the robot us the 
human to balance itself, which be a potentially uncomfortable tactile 
experience for humans, a it be make of metal.

Williams and Bargh show that human associate positive/warm 
personality trait with warm physical contact, and vice versa; here 
subject briefly held a cup of warm or iced coffee and be then 
ask to judge a target person’s personality [10]. This result be 
replicate when Park and Lee alter the skin temperature of a 
dinosaur robot [6]. They found user perception of the sociability 
of the robot increase with warmth. 

2 COMPLETEDWORK 
My initial work on this topic address the research question, “How 
should robot hug?” We hypothesize that a soft, warm, touch- 
sensitive humanoid robot would provide satisfy hug to human 
by match their hug pressure and duration. I conduct a 
30-participant study where user experienced 12 hug from Willow 
Garage’s Personal Robot 2 (PR2): the first group of 3 hug varied the 
physical conditions, and the second group of 9 hug varied the be- 
havioral conditions. The presentation order of the hug be varied 
within each group, and the user complete a survey after each hug. 

Three different physical condition be tested, a show in 
Fig. 1: a hard-cold, a soft-cold, and a soft-warm robot. A hard-warm 
robot be not test because the heating element somewhat soften 
the robot and divulge the thermal experimental variable to users. 
Hard-cold: The robot have no additional pad layers. Soft-cold: 
The robot wear a layer of foam, a layer of cotton, then a layer of 
purple fluffy polyester. Soft-warm: The robot wear the same a 
the soft-cold condition with add heating elements: the wire from 
an electric blanket cover the robot’s chest and back. A heating pad 
be place on the chest. Chemical warm pack be place on the 
robot’s upper arm and forearms. The robot outfit be design to 
be gender neutral to be more universally accepted and to limit the 
number of experimental variables. 

Nine different behavioral condition be tested, vary the 
pressure and the duration of the hug. We customize three distinct 
pressure level for the robot to hug each user: “too loose,” “just right,” 
and “too tight”. Using flexible sensor [1] to detect user contact on 
the robot’s back, we programmed the robot to terminate the hug 
“too soon” (not use user input, release 1 second after the arm 
close), “just right” (immediately upon human release), and “too late” 
(releasing 5 second after the human released).

Figure 3: A comparison of the response to the survey question 
after the first three hugs, change physical conditions. The grey 
represent the hard-cold condition (HC), the purple color represent 
the soft-cold condition (SC), and the pink color represent the soft- 
warm condition (SW). Black line with star at the top of the graph 
indicate where there be a statistically significant difference found. 

Subjects complete a 15-question opening survey base on their 
initial impression of the robot, and they answer the same ques- 
tions at the end of the experiment. These subjective measure be 
use for evaluation because we be interested in user preference, 
attitude, and opinion. We plan to include objective measure such a 
heart rate and facial expression in future experiments. These result 
be analyze use a pair t-test comparison, and we found that 
user felt understood by, trusted, and like the presence of the robot 
significantlymore after the experiment (p < 0.05). As show in Fig. 2, 
people also found robot to be nicer to hug, easy to use, and more 
of a social agent than they initially anticipated, after the experiment. 

All post-trial survey response be analyze in MATLAB 2017a 
use a repeat measure analysis of variance with a Tukey’s 
posthoc multiple comparison test to determine which condition 
differ significantly. As can be see in Fig. 3, the perceive safety 
of the robot increase in both soft conditions, while only the soft- 
warm condition improve the users’ comfort. 

While significant difference be not notice in the survey 
between the three tightness factors, write and verbal comment 
make to the experimenter indicate user preference for “very tight 
hugs”. As can be see in Fig. 4, user thought the robot be more 
social, more caring, and make them feel happier and more com- 
fort when it release them immediately or held on to them too 
long. Written and verbal comment indicate a preference for an 
immediate release from the hug, though a significant different be 
not notice between these two level in the surveys. 

3 ONGOINGWORK 
I plan to expand and refine this project over the course of my doc- 
torate. First, we will create a new robotic platform, customize for

social-physical interaction with humans. After an extensive search, 
we have chosen to use two Kinova JACO arm because of their slen- 
der design, quietness, fluid movement, and their built-in safety fea- 
tures. We will cover the arm and chest in a layer of foam, thermally 
conductive fabric, and electrically conductive fur for softness, heat- 
ing, and touch sensing, respectively. This new robot will match the 
hug pressure of the human user, and it will use torque and/or 
tactile sensor to determine when the subject want to be released. 

Next, we aim to enable people to send customize hug to each 
other through this new platform, to discover the extent to which 
personal connection can be reinforce at a distance. We plan to cre- 
ate an online forum for people to customize the hug they would like 
to send, include set a duration, upload a voice recording, 
and add a rub or pat on the receiver’s back. 

A final area we be interested in investigate be equip this 
robot with emotional intelligence. Using machine learning, we will 
enable the robot to sense a person’s mood base on facial expres- 
sionsmeasured use a camera-based emotion track tool, and the 
way a person hug the robot, which be a form of haptic intelligence 
only people currently possess. 

Applications for this research range from help alleviate stu- 
dent stress on college campus to bring happiness to resident 
of nursing homes. As research progresses, it could also be adapt 
for use by people undergo rehabilitation or childrenwith autism.
