Regression-based algorithm have show to be good at denoising Monte Carlo (MC) rendering by leverage it inexpensive by-product 
(e.g., feature buffers). However, when use higher-order model to handle complex cases, these technique often overfit to noise in the 
input. For this reason, supervise learn method have be propose that train on a large collection of reference examples, but they use 
explicit filter that limit their denoising ability. To address these problems, we propose a novel, supervise learn approach that allows the 
filter kernel to be more complex and general by leverage a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. In one embodiment of 
our framework, the CNN directly predicts the final denoised pixel value a a highly non-linear combination of the input features. In a second 
approach, we introduce a novel, kernel-prediction network which us the CNN to estimate the local weight kernel use to compute each 
denoised pixel from it neighbors. We train and evaluate our network on production data and observe improvement over state-of-the-art 
MC denoisers, show that our method generalize well to a variety of scenes. We conclude by analyze various component of our 
architecture and identify area of further research in deep learn for MC denoising.
