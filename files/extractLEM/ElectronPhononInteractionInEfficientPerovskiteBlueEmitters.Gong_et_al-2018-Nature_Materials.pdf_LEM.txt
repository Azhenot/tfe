The promise of energy-saving solid-state light and full-colour display have motivate rapid advancement in lumi-nescent material that exhibit bright emission and high colour 
purity1. Red, green and blue source that span the full colour gamut 
be require to generate white light2. Blue have proven to be the most 
challenging3,4: in epitaxial inorganic technology, for example, it take 
20 additional year to create the first blue light-emitting diode 
(LEDs) after red and green LEDs be successfully create in the 
1950s and 1960s5. 

A principal challenge for blue emission remains the design of 
material that simultaneously exhibit high luminescence efficiency 
and narrow emission linewidth. Table 1 summarizes the key photo- 
physical property of currently available blue emitter (Fig. 1e,f). 
Among inorganic semiconductor single crystals, wide-bandgap 
analogue of GaAs, GaP, SiC, ZnSe and GaN have be explored6,7; 
however, even the highest-purity and most defect-free epitaxially 
grown GaN film exhibit a maximum photoluminescence quantum 
yield (PLQY) of less than 1% at low injection density8–10. The loss 
of luminescence efficiency come from rapid non-radiative recom- 
bination through surface and bulk defects11, combine with a low 
radiative recombination rate associate with a small exciton binding 
energy (Eb = 20 meV)12. 

Though inorganic phosphor have demonstrate high bright- 
ness with PLQYs over 90%, their relatively insulate nature and 
long radiative lifetime result in high turn-on voltages, and this lim- 
it their application in LEDs13,14. In addition, their spectrally broad 
luminescence (full width at half maximum, FWHM > 100 nm) 
diminishes the usable PL yield when a narrow emission bandwidth 
be required15. Similarly, recently synthesize blue organic emit- 
ters with 70~85% PLQY in solid-state thin films16 also suffer from 
spectrally broad emission (FWHM ~ 75 nm). Organic materials, in 
contrast to inorganic materials, exhibit binding energy of several 

hundred millielectronvolts17. Their strongly bound excitons there- 
fore luminesce radiatively with high rates18, and the desire radia- 
tive process dominates recombination (Fig. 1b). 

Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites have emerge a prom- 
ising candidate for light-emission applications19. Chloride-based 
three-dimensional (3D) perovskites emit in the deep-blue region 
with sharp emission (FWHM ~ 25 nm)20. However, owe to their 
small exciton binding energy (~50 meV) and their appreciable trap- 
ping loss (Fig. 1c), these material have so far show low PLQYs 
(< 1%)20,21. Colloidal perovskite quantum dot recently achieve 
high PLQYs in the blue region through strong quantum confine- 
ment22,23; however, the high PLQY of colloidal dot have so far be 
lose once solid-state perovskite CQD film be made24. 

In this work, we focus on reduced-dimensional—also know 
a 2D layered—perovskites. When we add longer organic ligand 
to an otherwise 3D perovskite crystal, the new ligand segregate at 
the surface, and this lead to localization within the newly form 
layer materials. Two-dimensional (2D) layer perovskites offer 
fast radiative recombination rate (krad)25 due to excitonic localiza- 
tion and therefore be promising candidate to address the above- 
mention need for high PLQY combine with narrow emission 
width. Photogenerated excitons inside 2D perovskites be strongly 
confine inside each layer (Fig. 1d). This be exemplify by exciton 
binding energy that can reach up to 300 meV, value comparable to 
those of organic materials26. 

Intensive study have be carry out that have link struc- 
ture and performance in low-dimensional (2D, 0D) perovskites27,28. 
The important goal of high luminescence efficiency (PLQY > 80%) 
with broadband emission (FWHM > 100 nm) have be achieve 
in the yellow and red regions29,30. Nevertheless, blue-emitting 
perovskites have yet to deliver the desire performance: the 
PLQY of polycrystalline thin film have be report to be

Low-dimensional perovskites have—in view of their high radiative recombination rates—shown great promise in achieve 
high luminescence brightness and colour saturation. Here we investigate the effect of electron–phonon interaction on the 
luminescence of single crystal of two-dimensional perovskites, show that reduce these interaction can lead to bright 
blue emission in two-dimensional perovskites. Resonance Raman spectrum and deformation potential analysis show that strong 
electron–phonon interaction result in fast non-radiative decay, and that this lower the photoluminescence quantum yield 
(PLQY). Neutron scattering, solid-state NMR measurement of spin–lattice relaxation, density functional theory simulation 
and experimental atomic displacement measurement reveal that molecular motion be slowest, and rigidity greatest, in the 
brightest emitter. By vary the molecular configuration of the ligands, we show that a PLQY up to 79% and linewidth of 20 nm 
can be reach by control crystal rigidity and electron–phonon interactions. Designing crystal structure with electron–pho- 
non interaction in mind offer a previously underexplored avenue to improve optoelectronic materials' performance.

about 10%, and recently 26% be obtain from atomically thin 
2D perovskite single crystal fabricate use a solvent anneal- 
ing strategy31–33. This contrast with colloidal material that can 
achieve high PLQY (54% for 2D perovskites and 84% for 3D 
perovskite quantum dots23,34). The application of 2D perovskites 
in blue LEDs—which rely on solid-state materials—remains lim- 
ited by low solid-state PLQYs. We argue herein that the origin of 
previous low emission efficiency and large emission linewidths 
need further study in order to inform progress towards bright 
narrowband emitters. 

We sought therefore to explore further the potential of 2D 
perovskite blue emitter use high-quality single crystals, and 
investigate the determinant of high brightness and thus offer an 
improve set of guideline in material design. Specifically, we focus 
on the origin of non-radiative rate and on devise strategy to 
achieve a substantial reduction of these parasitic processes. 

In our initial experiments, we sought to produce large (macro- 
scopic, ~mm3 and above) single crystal of 2D perovskite. Single 
crystal have the potential to achieve high PLQYs due to their low 
defect density when compare with polycrystals and amorphous 
materials; they also provide a platform for study the determi- 
nants of the PLQY of a material, a they be substantially free from 
the effect of film morphology and grain boundaries. Recent stud- 
y have also elucidate the promise of perovskite single crystal 
directly utilized in electronic device applications35. 

Building these macroscopic, atomically layer sheet structure 
require u to develop a new synthesis strategy a high-brightness 
macroscale 2D perovskite single crystal have not previously be 
reported. We have initially attempt the previously report vapour 
diffusion method36, but the crystal obtain thereby be small in 
size (< 1 mm) and poor in luminescence quality. 

Towards the goal of achieve high-quality crystals, we pur- 
sue the use of a ternary solvent system to control crystalliza- 
tion kinetics (Fig. S1). Our crystallization strategy be base 
on a co-solvent N,N-dimethylformamide–dimethylsulfoxide 
(DMF–DMSO) mixture. When we rely on a mixture of DMF– 
diethyl ether (DEE) alone, undesirably fast crystallization lead to 
small crystal size and low PLQYs. We found that—compared 
with the case of pure DMF, widely utilized in perovskite prepa- 
ration—introducing DMSO dramatically enhance both crystal 
size and the optical quality of the single crystals. We attribute the 
improve crystal quality and the high PLQY to the formation 
of the DMSO–PbBr2 complex37, which slows the crystallization 
process, ultimately lead to higher-quality perovskite crystal 
(Fig. S1 and Table S1). Single crystal grow a DEE slowly diffuses 
into the perovskite solution38. 

We then explore two class of organic ammonium cation 
base either on aliphatic chain group (R = alkyl chain) or phenyl 
group (Ph = C6H5) motifs. The macroscopic shape of the single crys- 
tals reveals a strong cation dependence: C4, C12 (R = CH3(CH2)3,

R = CH3(CH2)11) and PhC, PhC2 (Ph–R = Ph–CH2, Ph–R = Ph– 
(CH2)2) grow into thin flakes, while with Ph and PhC3 (Ph–R = Ph– 
(CH2)3) the crystallization result in needle-like crystal (Fig. S2). 
The product also show dramatically different luminescence 
property (Table S2): layer-shaped crystal show narrowband 
(FWHM ~ 20 nm) deep-blue emission, while needle-shaped crystal 
result in non-2D crystal structure (Fig. S3) with broadband white- 
light emission (Fig. 2g–i, FWHM > 70 nm). 

To measure the absolute PLQY, we exfoliate thin sample 
mechanically from single crystal (Supplementary Materials, 
Exfoliated sample preparation). Exfoliation reduces the sample 
thickness and hence the reabsorption of PL (Fig. S4). Crystals that 
form 2D solid (C4 and PhC2) be easily exfoliate into thin flakes, 
in contrast with the needle-shaped crystals. 

For the deep-blue region, the best sample of PhC2 crystal have 
a PLQY of 79%, a notable improvement compare with previ- 
ously report 2D perovskites33,34 (Table 1). This high PLQY be also 
accompany by a sharp emission spectrum (FWHM ~ 20 nm) and 
be independent of photoexcitation power (Fig. S5). We account for 
this by note the strong excitonic quality of the 2D perovskites 
and that no multi-exciton recombination occurs under low injec- 
tion intensity (1010 cm−3)39. This PLQY be up to two order of mag- 
nitude high than that of inorganic materials. It be comparable to 
that of the brightest organic blue emitter (Table 1)16; yet, it exhibit 

a fully three time narrower emission linewidth (FWHM of 20 nm 
compare with 75 nm for organic emitters). 

We then turn to study the structure of each crystal with the 
goal of elucidate the physical origin of the efficient blue emis- 
sions. We carry out single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) on 
sample with high PLQY (PhC2), low PLQY (C4) and broadband 
emission spectrum (Ph). In Ph single crystals, the precursor prefer- 
entially form a network of truncate PbBr6 octahedron (PbBr3), while 
plate-shaped crystal (C4 and PhC2) form layer structures, with 
corner-sharing inorganic PbBr6 octahedron sandwich between 
organic layer (Fig. 2d–f). In the PhC2 structure, benzene ring 
stack between the adjacent PbBr6 layer via CH–π interactions. 

To gain further insight into the crystal quality and high PLQY, 
we carry out density functional theory (DFT) calculation on C4, 
Ph and PhC2 structures. We first calculate the formation energy 
of these compound by relax the SCXRD-determined struc- 
tures. The calculate formation energy of C4, Ph and PhC2 be 
determine to be 160, 595 and 200 meV/f.u. respectively relative to 
solid precursors. The high formation energy suggest more stable 
structure with a low chance of defect formation. However, cal- 
culations predict Ph to have an indirect bandgap, in contrast with 
direct bandgaps calculate for C4 and PhC2 (Fig. S6). 

We thus focus on the two best 2D perovskites within the ali- 
phatic and phenyl group (C4 and PhC2 respectively). We carry

out transient absorption spectroscopy to probe the defect density 
in C4 and PhC2 and found comparable density in these materi- 
als, in agreement with DFT calculation (Methods, Fig. S7, S8). The 
comparable defect densities, contrast with the dramatic differ- 
ences in PLQY, lead u to probe further the origin of the high bright- 
ness for the case of PhC2. 

The quantum efficiency be determine by the ratio of the radia- 
tive recombination rate (krad) to the sum of radiative and non-radi- 
ative (knon) recombination rate (ktot):

To identify and compare krad and knon, we use equation (1) with 
the directly measure ktot (from transient PL) and the mea- 
sured PLQY (Supplementary Materials, Photoluminescence 
Measurements, Fig. S9). 

Figure 3a show that radiative recombination be dominant over 
the entire temperature range for PhC2 crystals, consistent with the 
fact that their high PLQY be preserve even at room temperature. 
The fast radiative recombination rate be related to a small Bohr 
radius (Table S3). In the case of C4 crystals, the non-radiative rate 
surpasses the radiative rate when the temperature increase beyond 
250 K (Fig. 3b). The dramatically increase knon result in the pro- 
nounced drop of PLQY in C4 to 17% at room temperature. It should 
be note that no phase transition be observe over the tempera- 
ture range discuss here (Fig. S10). 

We then investigate the cause of the undesirably rapid knon. 
From the precede discussion, we note that the intrinsic trap den- 
sities in C4 and PhC2 be similar, while the knon of C4 be four time 

high than that of PhC2. Clearly the transition from bandedge to 
trap state must be increase in C4 compare with PhC2. We there- 
fore investigate the role of electron–phonon interaction in facili- 
tat these transitions. 

One way to quantify the intensity of electron–phonon interac- 
tion be by use the deformation potential (D)—the shift in energy 
band per unit strain. We extract D for both PhC2 and C4 by 
study the temperature-dependent behaviour of their PL line- 
widths40,41 (Table S5). We first observe that the FWHM increase 
fivefold from 10 K to 290 K in C4, but by less than twofold in PhC2: 
thermal broadening be dramatically more intense in C4. The quan- 
titative indicator of electron–phonon couple strength—D—is also 
twice a high in C4 a in PhC2, reflect the faster bandedge-to- 
trap process in the case of C4. 

These initial result lead u to investigate further the impact 
of electron–phonon couple on the electronic transition 
rate. We select resonance Raman (RR) spectroscopy since it 
directly reveals phonon couple to the electronic transition 
between the excite and ground states. We employ a photoex- 
citation energy (457 nm) near the energy of the relevant band- 
to-band transition. Figure 3d show the RR spectrum of C4 and 
PhC2 after normalization for sample concentration and transi- 
tion dipole strength. The C4 RR spectrum be several time more 
intense than that of PhC2, indicate that the vibrational mode 
of C4 be substantially more strongly couple to the electronic 
excitation than those of PhC2 (Fig. S11, Table S4). C4 be there- 
fore expect to undergo faster non-radiative decay due to the 
improve vibrational overlap between the ground- and excited- 
state vibrational wavefunctions. This result corroborates the 
observe faster knon and low PLQY for C4 relative to PhC2 
(details in Methods).

To investigate the connection between material structure and 
electron–phonon coupling, we characterize the role of crystal 
rigidity. We sought to compare atomic displacement (from both 
simulation and experiment), spin–lattice relaxation and the time- 
variation in the electronic bandstructure. 

Atomic displacements—at their essence, optical phonons—are 
important indicator of crystal rigidity. Figure 4a present calcula- 
tion result (bottom panel) alongside experimentally determine 
atomic displacement for atom of interest, the latter quantify 
use the equivalent isotropic displacement parameter (Ueq) from 
single-crystal XRD measurement (Fig. 4a top panel). We find that, 
in C4, tail carbon atom have a large root mean square displace- 
ment compare with respective atom in PhC2. The large root 
mean square displacement indicates that more phonon mode be 
activate in C4. In particular, the root mean square displacement 
of Br and Pb (which determine the valence band maximum and con- 
duction band minimum in perovskites) be high in the case of C4. 
Overall, PhC2 show a more rigid structure. 

The crystal rigidity be further investigate use solid-state 
NMR spin–lattice relaxation time (T1) measurement (Fig. S12). 
In the C4 crystal, relaxation rate (R1) of 0.5 s−1 be observe for 
terminal methyl carbon (Cd), while PhC2 show an order of mag- 
nitude slow R1 of 0.02 s−1 at the terminal aromatic ring carbon 

(Fig. 4b). This agrees with the observation from SCXRD that the 
rigid structure of sp2 phenyl ring result in small thermal dis- 
placement ellipsoid of atom and less vibrational motion in PhC2 
compare with the case of aliphatic C4. This also agrees with our 
observation of the sharpen PL emission peak. We propose that 
denser molecular pack inside the organic layer in the PhC2 
structure contributes to high crystal rigidity. 

As note earlier, the deformation of a crystal result in a change 
in it crystal geometry and therefore a shift in it electronic energy 
bandstructure. We can therefore characterize the structural fluctua- 
tions by probe the bandstructure. Figure 4c and Fig. S13 present 
the time variation of the valence band maximum and conduction 
band minimum in C4, PhC2 and PhC (Fig. S14) from DFT calcula- 
tions. We plot the histogram of instantaneous bandgaps for each 
material class. We again see the large variation in the bandgap in 
C4 compare with PhC2, consistent with it low crystal rigidity.

C4. This indicates that the ligand of C4 crystal undergo great 
librational motion (including the rocking, wag and twist 
modes), while the movement of the lattice in PhC2 be more confine 
spatially. We ascribe therefore the high crystal rigidity of PhC2 to 
the low conformational freedom of the crystal structure associ- 
ated with closer pack among the organic molecules. 

To further complement these measurements, we measure the 
mean square displacement, u2 , for the crystals. To achieve this, 
we use elastic neutron scatter a a function of temperature 
(Fig. 4e). These measurement (which be most sensitive to the 
motion of hydrogen) give information related to the rigidity pos- 
sessed by the ligands. The slope of the mean square displacement 
with temperature provide a mean force constant that describes the 
motion of the ligand relative to their equilibrium positions42. At 
low temperature we see PhC2 and C4 behave similarly, but above 
about 150 °C the motion of C4 increases, cause it to diverge from 
PhC2. This behaviour for C4 correlate with the transition to faster 
knon at high temperature, a show in Fig. 3b. 

This work report a deep-blue emitter with a high PLQY base 
on high-quality 2D perovskite single crystals. The crystal structure 
and rigidity contribute to achieve the observe brightness and 
sharp PL spectra. This study elucidates the performance and pros- 
pects of high-brightness perovskite emitter towards their potential 
application in blue light sources.

Methods 
DFT simulation. Calculations be carry out use a Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof 
generalize gradient exchange correlational functional use the project 
augment wave pseudopotentials a implement in the computational package 
VASP. All calculation be carry out with planewave basis use a planewave 
kinetic energy cutoff of 400 eV. The electronic wavevector grid be obtain 
individually for each material by converge total energy to 0.005 eV/f.u. 
This corresponds to converge gamma-centred Monkhorst pack electronic 
wavevector grid of 3 × 3 × 1, 4 × 4 × 1 and 4 × 4 × 3 with 156-, 124- and 188-atom 
computational cell for C4, Ph and PhC2 respectively. Van der Waals interaction 
be include in all of our calculation use the DFT-D2 method of Grimme. 

Total energy be converge to within 1 × 10−5 eV for each electronic self- 
consistent loop. We start with experimentally determine crystal structure 
and carry out structural relaxation until change in total energy be less than 
1 × 10−4 eV. 

The formation energies, Ef, be calculate a 

∑ ∑= −E E Ef prod reac 
where Eprod and Ereac be DFT calculate total energy of product and precursors. 

Molecular dynamic simulation be carry out within the NVT ensemble 
use the Nose thermostat a implement in the VASP package. 624- and 
752-atom computational cell be use for C4 and PhC2 respectively with a time 
step of 1 fs. All atom be initially allow to equilibrate for 5000 time step at a 
temperature of 300 K before the collection of final data. 

We obtain the Bohr exciton radius a 

ϵ ∕a m*0 

where ε, a0 and m* be the dielectric constant, Bohr radius and exciton effective 
mass. The dielectric constant use be the macroscopic dielectric constant (including 
local field effects) a report by VASP. The Bohr radius be 0.529 Å and m* be 
obtain a memh/(me + mh). me and mh be the electron and hole effective mass 
obtain by fitting parabola to bandstructures in the vicinity of the conduction 
band minimum and valence band maximum respectively. 

The simulated atomic displacement be obtain from molecular dynamic 
simulation at a temperature of 300 K. In particular, molecular dynamic 
simulation be carry out with a time step of 1 fs. From these molecular 
dynamic trajectories, average atomic position be obtain and these average 
atomic position be use in the calculation a reference state of instantaneous 
displacement from the time-dependent trajectories. 

Materials and characterization. Growth of high-quality single crystals. PbBr2 and 
ANH3Br (1 to 2 by molar ratio, 1 M), with A = organic cation, be dissolve in a 
mixed solvent of DMF and DMSO (Fig. S1). In this study, we found that add 
30–60% DMSO be favourable for high-quality crystal growth, result in large 
crystal size and PLQY, and this have be utilized a the crystallization condition 
for all samples. 0.2 ml of perovskite precursor solution be put into a 20 ml vial 
with no cap, which be put in a large and seal container with 40 ml antisolvent 
(for example, diethyl ether or chloroform). Crystallization proceeds at room 
temperature and the final product be take out after few days, rinse use 
antisolvent three time and dry under vacuum. All step be carry out under 
ambient conditions. 

Exfoliated sample preparation. Samples for all PL measurement be prepared by 
mechanical exfoliation from single crystals. Perovskite single crystal be put on a 
clear, transparent and non-emissive one-sided tape, on top of which another clean 
area of tape be folded. Part of the crystal be detach from the crystal for further 
exfoliation, expose fresh cleave layers, and the rest of the crystal remain on the 
tape. For the PLQY measurements, we chose one piece of crystal and transfer 
it onto the tape. The lateral dimension of the chosen crystal be in the macro 
range of mm × mm, therefore the effect from the grain boundary be negligible 
and do not need to be take into consideration. Samples with reduce thickness 
and freshly peel 2D layer be prepared by repeat this process several times. 
The coverage of crystal on the tape will be multiply with increase number 
of exfoliations. The lamp that be utilized a the excitation source for the PLQY 
measurement have a round spot with a diameter of 2 mm. The tape with various 
flake of 2D perovskite crystal be attach to the glass substrate. 

Single-crystal X-ray diffraction measurements. Single crystal be mount on a 
nylon loop with oil. SCXRD data be collect on a P4 Bruker diffractometer 
upgraded with a Bruker SMART 1 K CCD (charge-coupled device) detector and a 
rotate anode utilize Mo KR radiation (λ = 0.710 73 Å). All measurement be 
make at room temperature. Fitting and refinement of single-crystal structure be 
do use OLEX2. 

The equivalent isotropic displacement parameter (Ueq in Fig. 4a, top panel) be 
define and quantify a one-third of sum of the eigenvalue of the orthogonalized 
displacement tensor (Uij). The result come directly from the refinement of the 
structure from the SCXRD measurement. 

Photoluminescence measurements. Absolute PLQY measurement of exfoliate 
crystal be carry out in a Quanta-Phi integrate sphere. For each 
measurement, a large perovskite single crystal be ground into small crystals, and 
crystal with an area of 0.5 mm × 0.5 mm and thickness of ten of nanometre be 
select for mechanical exfoliation. The exfoliation be continued until the crystal 
could fully cover the tape and become appropriately thin (around 50 nm). Then the 
tape be transfer to a clean glass substrate. For each sample, the absorption of 
the incident pump (350 nm) be control between 10% and 15%, so that the film 
thickness be close enough to make a fair comparison. 

The value of PLQY be measure and calculate base on a previously 
report method43. A continuous-wave xenon excitation lamp be use a the 
excitation source with an excitation wavelength of 350 nm, with a power density 
of 0.25–3.5 mW cm−2, and the carrier density be measure around 1010 × cm−3 
(using the follow equation n ≅ × ×incidence power relaxation lifetime absorption coefficientenergy of each phonon 
with the absorption coefficient approximately 1 × 104 cm−1, and about 10−9 s). 
The bandpass value be 5 and 5 nm for the excitation and emission slits, 
respectively. The incident and PL spectrum be collect with the exfoliate sample 
(tape/exfoliated crystals/glass substrate) directly in the excitation beam path offset 
from the beam path and remove from the sphere, in accordance with the standard 
method. The tape use for exfoliation should not have photoluminescence in 
the visible range. If the tape absorbs incident light, the effect of the tape should 
be excluded. For example, 3M Scotch tape absorbs 15% incident light (350 nm 
excitation) before it reach the exfoliate crystals, the effect of which be 
calibrate by multiply the measure PLQY by 1/(1 − 0.15) = 1.17. The detector 
and integrate sphere be calibrate for spectral variance with a Newport 
white-light source. 

Temperature-dependent steady-state PL spectrum be collect use an Ocean 
Optics USB 2000 spectrometer. The sample be in an ARS closed-cycle cryocooler. 
Time-resolved PL be measure use Horiba TCSPC (time-correlated single- 
photon counting) components. 

I. Temperature-dependent PL (Fig. S8) be plot by take the peak 
intensity of the PL spectrum and then normalize to the high brightness 
over the temperature range from 10 K to 290 K. At low temperature, T = 10 K 
in this study, the radiative recombination rate be dominant, which lead to 
PLQYs close to 100% and non-radiative recombination near zero33. Therefore, 
the PLQY at other temperature can be estimate by the ratio between 
the PL intensity at high temperature and the low-temperature PL. This method 
be cross-validated by the current work: the room-temperature PLQYs of PhC2 
and C4 be 70% and 17% use this extrapolation approach, which be in good 
agreement with the independently and directly measure values. In the sample 
of exfoliate PhC2 single crystals, the PL intensity of PhC2 slightly increase 
from 10 K to 150 K, which might originate from gradual thermal activation 
of the bright excitonic state. This be common for nanoscale emitters, 
where due to the exchange interaction the lowest-energy exciton be always 
dark (spin forbidden). 

II. Temperature-dependent PL dynamic (Fig. 3a,b): we choose the 
monoexponential decay to obtain the total recombination rate, a exciton 
decay be a first-order recombination process, and therefore the kinetics 
follow a monoexponential model. We also observe deviation from 
monoexponential behaviour mainly after 10 n (Fig. S8), which we attribute 
to trap recombination. Therefore, the fitting of the lifetime be mainly do 
within 10 ns, when PL be the dominant depopulation process of excitons. 

III. Power-dependent PLQY measurement (Fig. SX): we vary the incident power 
density by change the slit width on the Fluorolog monochromator. The 
excitation power density be calculate a the measure power divide by 
the beam area. The power be measure use an Ophir Laser Dual Channel 
Power Meter, and the beam area be calculate use the give dispersion 
relation for the monochromator. The PLQY at different power be measure 
with the same method a described above. 

Resonance Raman spectroscopy. RR spectrum of C4 and PhC2 dilute in a KBr 
pellet be collect with a 457 nm pre-RR pump, from a continuous-wave 
diode laser (Cobolt). This wavelength be chosen so that the Raman spectrum 
be not contaminate by sample photoluminescence, but it be close enough 
to electronic resonance that the Raman intensity will be dominate by 
resonance terms. Scattered light be collect by an aspheric collection lens in a 
backscattering geometry. The Rayleigh line be attenuate by a 458 nm long-pass 
edge filter (Semrock, RazorEdge). A single monochromator with a 1200 gr mm−1 
(600 gr mm−1 for the > 2700 cm−1 region) diffraction grate (Princeton 
Instruments, TriVista) disperse the backscatter light onto a CCD camera 
(Princeton Instruments, Pixis 400). The entrance slit width be kept at 100 μ m. 
Spectra be collect use a 15 s exposure time for 10 accumulations. KBr pellet 
be prepared to a molar ratio of 0.0051 for C4 (0.5 mmol KBr + 4.4 μ mol 
C4 + 0.36 mmol NaClO4*H2O) and 0.0056 for PhC2 (0.5 mmol KBr + 4.4 umol

The raw spectrum be first normalize to the internal intensity standard at 

953 cm−1 and then scale for concentration differences. Next, to separate the 
contribution to the Raman scatter cross-section due to the vibrational Franck– 
Condon displacement from the strength of the transition dipole, the transition 
dipole scale of the signal be take into account. The spectrum be scale for 
their relative transition dipole length use the experimental rate of radiative 
decay, since μ∝krad tr 

2 and σ μ∝Raman tr 
4. The radiative decay rate be take from 

photoluminescence spectrum at 10 K where the quantum efficiency be assume to be 
100%. Since the radiative rate of PhC2 be (3.6 ns)−1 and that of C4 be (9.5 ns)−1, and 
they emit at the same wavelength,

In other words, a vibrational mode with the same displacement in PhC2 and 
C4 will have a Raman cross-section that be seven time high in PhC2 than in C4. 
In order to isolate a rough measure of the relative displacement between the two 
perovskites, the C4 Raman spectrum be multiply by 7.0. 

The spectrum in Fig. 3d demonstrate that the vibrational mode of C4 be 
substantially more displace in the excite state than those of PhC2. This suggests 
that C4 will have a faster non-radiative decay rate due to the improve vibrational 
overlap between the ground- and excited-state vibrational wavefunctions. This 
result corroborates the observe photoluminescence efficiency for C4 relative to 
PhC2 and suggests that nuclear rigidity upon electronic excitation be an essential 
feature of efficiently emit materials. Table S2 contains the Raman shift and 
intensity for representative Raman mode of the samples. Fig. S10 represent 
the control experiment of 457 nm Raman of the ligand in the absence of 
the perovskite material. From Fig. S10 it be clear that the perovskite structure 
resonantly enhances the ligand vibrational modes, thus validate the scale by 
the relative radiative rates. 

Solid-state NMR. A solid-state NMR experiment be carry out on powder 
sample of C4 and PhC2 on an Agilent DD2 700 MHz NMR spectrometer. Spectra 
be obtain use a cross-polarization magic angle spin experiment at 25 °C 
and 70 °C. The relaxation rate R1 = 1/T1 be obtain by fitting the intensity of 
individual 13C resonance a a function of the inversion recovery time τ (details 
in Supplemental Information). A high R1 value indicates high mobility and 
faster molecular motion. For the PhC2 sample three peak be observed, at 128 
(phenyl), 43.5 (Ca) and 34.8 (Cb) ppm, with R1 relaxation rate of 0.0162 s−1 (Ph), 
0,1226 s−1 (Ca) and 0.1135 s−1 (Cb) at 25 °C and 0.58 s−1 (Ca) and 0.19 s−1 (Cb) at 
70 °C. For the C4 sample four peak be observed: 41.38 ppm (Ca), 31.25 ppm 
(Cb), 20.47 ppm (Cc) and 16.25 ppm (Cd) with R1 relaxation rate of 0.098 s−1 (Ca), 
0.1387 s−1 (Cb), 0.1828 s−1 (Cc) and 0.4978 s−1 (Cd) at 25 °C and 0.7699 s−1 (Ca), 
0.36 s−1 (Cb), 0.44 s−1 (Cc) and 0.4982 s−1 (Cd) at 70 °C. 

In C4 crystals, we observe a relaxation rate of 0.5 s−1 for the terminal methyl 
group (Cd) compare with 0.1 s−1 for the carbon atom proximal to the ammonium 
group (Ca) (Fig. S11), indicate that the terminal methyl group exhibit faster 
molecular motion. This observation be in good agreement with the increase 
thermal ellipsoid size from Ca to Cd from SCXRD data. In comparison, PhC2 
show an R1 of 0.02 s−1 at the aromatic ring end, which be an order of magnitude 
slow than for the aliphatic carbon (Cc, 0.2 s−1; Cd, 0.5 s−1). 

Transient absorption. Femtosecond pulse be generate use a regeneratively 
amplify Yb:KGW laser at a 1 kHz repetition rate (Light Conversion, Pharos). 
A portion of the 1030 nm fundamental be sent through an optical parametric 
amplifier (Light Conversion, Orpheus), and the second harmonic of the signal 
pulse be chosen for a 360 nm or 460 nm pump. Both the pump and residual 
fundamental be sent into an optical bench (Ultrafast, Helios), and the time delay 
be adjust by optically delay the probe pulse, with time step increase 
exponentially. The repetition rate of the pump be halve use an optical chopper. 
The fundamental be focus into a calcium fluoride crystal to generate a white- 
light continuum probe, and both the probe and pump be focus onto the 
sample. The probe be then direct onto a CCD after dispersion by a grate 
spectrograph (Ultrafast, Helios). 

Transient absorption be use to compare the relative number of trap between 
C4 and PhC2. Exfoliated single-crystal sample be first excite with 360 nm light, 
with increase power range from 25 μ W to 1000 μ W (Fig. S6a,b). For both 
samples, the magnitude of the bleach signal increase with increase power, and a 
negative signal be present at wavelength longer than 450 nm. Bleaching below the 
bandgap have be assign previously to absorption involve trap state within 
the bandgap45. 

We then photoexcited the same spot on the sample with 460 nm light 
(Fig. S6c,d), which be only absorbed by trap state (a 450 nm shortpass filter be 
use to low the pump scattering). Since this result in electron in the conduction 
band, a bleach of the bandgap be still expected. In this way, the observe signal 
should be proportional to the number of trap states, although we have to ensure that 
the signal be not influence by other factors. We measure the transient signal at 
500 μ W, 1000 μ W and 2000 μ W pump power, and the observe signal show a linear 
dependence on power, ruling out two-photon pumping. In order to exclude effect 

from crystal thickness (that is, pathlength) and absorption cross sections, 
we compare the magnitude of signal obtain from pump the sample with 
1000 μ W of 360 nm light (Fig. S7a). C4 have a bleach of about 17 Δ mOD, whereas 
PhC2 have a signal of about 6 Δ mOD. Essentially, if the two crystal have a similar 
trap density, we would expect a similar bleach ratio when pump with 460 nm 
(Fig. S7b). For clarity, we have include a comparison for 460 nm pumped sample 
(Fig. S7c), where we have adjust the spectrum to take into account the ratio from 
the 360 nm pumped experiment (by divide by a constant equal to the bleach 
magnitude mention above). The result spectrum (Fig. S7c) show similar bleach 
magnitude for C4 and PhC2, with PhC2 even exhibit a slightly (around 22%) 
large signal (that is, number of traps). This indicates that the number of trap state 
be very unlikely to be the cause behind the difference in PLQY (that is, PLQY of 
PhC2 be high than C4). 

Deformation potential calculation. The origin of the thermal broadening of 
exciton emission linewidth stem from the fluctuation of the bandgap, which be 
cause by the displacement of the atom in the crystal. Therefore, the temperature 
dependence of the FWHM be govern by the strength of electron–phonon 
coupling. One of the quantitative expression of electron–phonon couple be the 
deformation potential (D), define a the change in the bandgap energy per unit 
strain due to phonon scattering. 

Deformation potential have be use since 1950 to describe the electron– 
phonon interaction40. It be define a the derivative of the electronic energy level 
with respect to strain. One way to estimate deformation potential be by model 
the FWHM of photoluminescence linewidth, the broadening of which be due to 
phonon scatter when crystal lattice vibrates. We apply the follow model to 
fit the temperature-dependent FWHM of PhC2 and C4 in our study, base on the 
report from previous literature41:

The effective mass of the electron and hole be calculate use DFT with 
the result in Table S2; the ωhomo homopolar phonon mode for the Pb–Br–Pb 
stretch be measure from RR result (for PhC2 the correspond wavenumber 
be 133 cm−1, and for C4 it be 131 cm−1). Densities (ρ) of for both perovskites be 
calculate use the unit-cell volume measure from SCXRD (2.8 g cm−3 for both 
materials). The width of the quantum well (L) be quantify use the thickness of 
the Pb–Br–Pb inorganic layer (0.6 nm). 

The fitting result be list in Table S5. 
It also should be note that the inhomogeneous linewidth (Γ0) be 

large in PhC2 than in C4, indicate that the structural distortion (even 
at very low temperature) be higher. This structural distortion come from 
within the Pb–Br6 octahedra: the Br–Pb–Br bond angle inside the octahedron 
of PhC2 be 172–174°, instead of the 180° in the C4 crystals. However, structural 
distortion do not vary with temperature: the Br–Pb–Br bond angle be 
measure a 168–172° (PhC2) and 180° (C4) at 100 K. The DFT calculation 
also show that at 0 K the correspond angle for PhC2 be 168–170° and 
that for C4 be 180°. 

At room temperature, the width of the PL spectrum be the combine result of Γ0 
and thermal broadening. We observe that C4 crystal show great FWHM than 
PhC2, indicate that the more intense phonon vibration in C4 result in strong 
thermal broadening.
