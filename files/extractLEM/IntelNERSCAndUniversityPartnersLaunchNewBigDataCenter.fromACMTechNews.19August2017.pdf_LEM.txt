August 17, 2017 

A collaboration between the Department of 

Energy’s National Energy Research Scientific 

Computing Center (NERSC), Intel and five Intel 

Parallel Computing Centers (IPCCs) have 

result in a new Big Data Center (BDC) that 

will work both on code modernization and tackle 

real science challenges. 

According to Prabhat, BDC Director and Group 

Lead for NERSC Data and Analytics and 

Services team, “The goal of the BDC be to solve 

DOE’s lead data-intensive science problem 

at scale on the NERSC Cori supercomputer 

(http://www.nersc.gov/users/computational- 

systems/cori/). The BDC, in collaboration with 

Intel and the IPCCs, will test to see if the current 

HPC system can support data-intensive 

workload that require analysis of over 100 

terabyte datasets on 100,000 core or greater. 

The BDC will optimize and scale the production 

data analytics and management stack on Cori. 

All BDC project will run on the NERSC Cori 

supercomputer. Courtesy of NERSC. 

“Our first task will be to identify capability 

application in the DOE data science 

community, articulate analytics requirement 

and then develop scalable algorithms.” Prabhat 

continued. “The key be in develop algorithm 

in the context of the production stack. Our multi- 

disciplinary team consist of performance 

optimization and scale expert be well 

position to enable capability application on 

Cori. All the optimization do at the BDC will 

be open source and make available to peer 

HPC center a well a the broader HPC and 

data analytics communities.” 

Quincey Koziol, BDC co-director and principal 

data architect at NERSC, noted, “While data 

analytics be undoubtedly the rage at this point in 

time, scalable analytics fundamentally relies on 

a robust data management infrastructure. We

will be work on examine the performance of 

parallel I/O a exercise through modern data 

analytics language (Python, R, Julia) and 

machine learning/deep learn libraries.” 

Joseph Curley, director for Intel’s code 

modernization efforts, states, “We’ve combine 

the BDC goal of provide software stack and 

access to HPC machine where the data driven 

method can be developed with our IPCC 

program. We married the two idea together by 

combine research member of the community 

with a program that we have for outreach. 

“The objective of the Big Data Center (BDC) 

come from a common desire in the industry to 

have software stack that can help the NERSC 

user base, use data driven methods, to solve 

their large problem at scale on the Cori 

supercomputer. So one of our main goal be to 

be able to use the supercomputer hardware to 

it full capability. Some underlie objective 

at BDC be to build and harden the data 

analytics framework in the software stack so 

that developer and data scientist can use the 

Cori supercomputer in a productive way to get 

insight from their data. Our work with NERSC 

and the IPCCs will involve code modernization 

at scale a well a create the software 

environment and software stack need to meet 

these needs.” 

The five IPCCs who be part of the BDC 

program include the University of California- 

Berkeley, University of California-Davis, New 

York University (NYU), Oxford University and the 

University of Liverpool. Their initial BDC work 

include this research: 

The University of California-Berkeley team be 

work on the Celeste project. Celeste aim 

on develop highly scalable inference 

method for extract a unified catalog of 

object in the visible universe from all 

available astronomy data. 

The University of California-Davis group be 

work on development of computational 

mechanic technique to extract pattern from 

climate simulation data. The technique build 

upon technique in information theory to 

achieve unsupervised pattern discovery. 

The New York University (NYU) team be 

work on extend deep learn to operate 

on irregular, graph-structured data. The 

technique be be apply to problem in 

high-energy physics. 

The Oxford University group be develop a 

new class of method call probabilistic 

program and apply the method to 

challenge pattern and anomaly detection in 

high-energy physics. The work combine 

probabilistic program with deep learn 

to train large network on Cori. 

The University of Liverpool team be work on 

develop topological method to analyze 

climate datasets. The technique be be 

use to extract stable, low-dimensional 

manifolds, and robust pattern descriptor for 

weather patterns.

The BDC work will also benefit the large data 

analysis and HPC communities. Curley states, 

“In our IPCC program, we encourage system 

user to discover method of solve problem 

on HPC systems, document what they did, and 

teach others how to follow their methods. This 

creates a beneficial cycle of new research, 

harden the machine, develop new 

software stack lead to research that be more 

productive—what we call a virtuous cycle. 

“We be excite about the IPCCs work in 

conjunction with the BDC because there will be 

people work on problem we never could 

have anticipate and advance human 

knowledge in way we never could have 

guessed. If you can combine this with the BDC 

at NERSC that have a large machine like Cori 

and a diverse user group, you end up create 

network of knowledge and create scientific 

result that be unpredictably wonderful.”
