Do public policy on gay and lesbian right affect the incidence of hate crime base on 
sexual orientation? We propose that legal inequality increase hate crime because they 
provide discursive opportunity for bias, discrimination, and violence. Legal equality, 
however, will reduce violence. Using annual panel data from 2000 to 2012, a period of 
substantial policy change, we analyze how three state policy affect report hate crimes: 
same-sex partnerships, employment non-discrimination, and hate crime laws. Hate crime 
and employment non-discrimination law that include sexual orientation reduce hate 
crime incidence. Partnership recognition increase report hate crimes, though it may not 
increase actual crime incidence. Because incidence be spatially correlated, policy change in 
one state yield spillover benefit in other states. These result provide some of the first 
quantitative evidence that public policy affect hate crime base on sexual orientation. 
Findings confirm the role of institutional heterosexism and discursive opportunity in 
produce hate crimes.

American debate balance individual liberty against majority will be a old a the formation of the country. What 
start a a slow march toward equal right for several subjugate demographic group during the nation’s first 100 year 
become substantial progress toward equality in the twentieth century. Women and racial minority won the right to vote, 
achieve great economic empowerment, and successfully argue for integration of a host of social institutions. In stark 
contrast, right for gay and lesbian individual have lag behind e in some way become bad toward the end of the 
twentieth century. This lag have a far-reaching impact on the health and well-being on the gay and lesbian population. In fact, 
follow political campaign against same-sex marriage and other anti-equality initiatives, gay and lesbian individual and 
their family report stress, anxiety, fear, and health change (Arm et al., 2009; Rostosky et al., 2010) a well a risky sexual 
behaviors, mental illness, and suicide (Amadio, 2006; Baiocco et al., 2010; Hughes and Eliason, 2002; Meyer, 2003; Ryan et al., 
2009; Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2012). 

The twenty-first century, however, have see rapid change in gay and lesbian rights. The federal government rescind the 
Don’t Ask Don’t Tell ban on be openly gay in the military, President Obama add sexual orientation to the federal hate 
crime law by signing theMatthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, and the U.S. Supreme Court recently 
rule ban on same-sexmarriages unconstitutional. At the regional and state level, since the start of 2013 over thirty state have 
their ban on same-sex marriage overturn by district or circuit courts. The ability of legislature and court to produce

sweep social change be the subject of a long line of sociological inquiry (e.g., Burstein, 1998; Burstein and Monaghan, 1986; 
Dobbin et al., 1993; Korpi and Palme, 1998; Rosenberg, 2008). The practical consequence of these policy be clear, and gay 
and lesbian individual who live in state with pro-equality policy report few psychiatric disorder and low psychiatric 
comorbidity (Hatzenbuehler et al., 2009). In addition to these individual impacts, externality have long accompany policy 
change and other type of organize social action (Merton, 1936). For example, pro-equality policy might not only promote 
equality in access to individual benefits, but they also could foster a more tolerant social climate. 

One indicator of increase social tolerance would be a reduction in hate crimes. Scholarship on anti-gay and lesbian 
violence identifies heterosexist ideology (Herek, 1992) and cultural stereotype (Franklin, 1998) a potential driver of in- 
dividual bias and, in extreme cases, violence. Among these societal drivers, the law stand out a a particularly salient 
institution (Herek, 2009b). As far a we be aware, however, extant sociological research have yet to investigate the effect of 
public policy e or broader sociocultural environment e on hate crime base on sexual orientation. Research on racially- 
motivate hate crime be comparatively well-developed. Blalock (1967) identifies power threat a a key driver of discrimi- 
nation. Likewise, lynching and racial hate crimesmay bemotivated by discursive opportunity (Koopmans,1996; Koopmans 
and Olzak, 2004) or defense of a neighborhood against in-migration of racial minority (Grattet, 2009; Green et al., 1998; 
Lyons, 2007). We bridge the literature on cultural heterosexism and racially-motivated hate crime to examine how 
change in public policy related to sexual orientation create or restrict discursive opportunity for hate crimes, condition 
for defend marriage, and crime motivate by economic competition. 

This article examines the relationship between law and hate crime by analyze the impact of change in a particularly 
salient social policy issue: public policy related to sexual orientation. Specifically, we ask whether policy change affect the 
incidence of report hate crime base on sexual orientation.1 We begin by discuss the literature on anti-gay and lesbian 
attitudes, the impact of attitude and policy on hate crimes, and prominent theory of hate crimes. Next, we present the 
data and our method of analysis. We leverage the recent, rapid change in policy regard gay and lesbian right by use a 
Prais-Winsten panel regressionmodel with state fix effect to analyze the impact of policy on annual report hate crime 
over a period of 13 years. This research also include a spatially lag dependent variable to capture the artificial nature of 
state border and diffusion of hate crime production across space. Then, we present and discus our results, which generally 
find positive externality (reductions in report hate crimes) from pro-equality policies. These findings, which be 
consistent with theory of institutional heterosexism and the law a a driver of discursive opportunity for bias crimes, 
provide some of the first quantitative evidence regard the impact of public policy on hate crime base on sexual 
orientation and demonstrate that social externality like hate crime should be include in pro-equality arguments. 
1. Background and literature 

1.1. Policy change 

Passed in 1996, the Defense of Marriage Act be just one prominent example of a recent spate of federal and state policy- 
make limit same-sex partnership during the late 1990s and 2000s. Over the past fifteen years, twenty-eight state have 
implement constitutional amendment restrict marriage to one man and one woman (Human Rights Campaign, 2014). 
Eleven of these amendment be pass in the 2004 general election, when activist and state legislator may have place 
them on the ballot to increase conservative turnout (Smith et al., 2006). Earlier ban arose, in part, a a backlash against 
progressive policy gain (Soule, 2004). Recently, however, state and federal appellate court have overturn state ban on 
same sexmarriage. Before the Supreme Court rule state ban unconstitutional, nearly forty state plus the District of Columbia 
issue same-sex marriage licenses, and several others provide recognition or right to same-sex couple (Human Rights 
Campaign, 2014). Moreover, in the 2012 general election, Maine, Maryland, and Washington become the first state to pas 
(or affirm) same-sex marriage at the ballot box, and Minnesota become the first state to reject a marriage ban by popular vote. 

As same-sex marriage policy have change over time, so have policy on hate crime base on sexual orientation. Sexual 
orientation be only recently add to the federal hate crime law with the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes 
Prevention Act of 2009, but state have address the issue for over twenty year with some passing their own law prior to 
2009. Although the federal law allows for the provision of resource to state and local authorities, 20 state do not cover 
sexual orientation a part of their hate crime law (Anti-Defamation League, 2011). Conversely, a number of state take action 
before the federal policy change in 2009, with the District of Columbia passing it law in 1989, a handful of state passing law 
in the 1990s, and many state passing law in the early 2000s (Human Rights Campaign, 2014). 

Nondiscrimination policy have receive less public attention recently despite some significant policy actions. A 1998 
executive order sign by President Clinton prohibits federal employment discrimination base on sexual orientation in the 
executive branch (Office of Personnel Management, n.d.). In addition, 21 state plus the District of Columbia prohibit 
employment discrimination base on sexual orientation, with 10 state enact their first nondiscrimination policy in the 
past 10 year and an additional 5 state in the past 20 year (Human Rights Campaign, 2014). 
1 Although this article focus on gay and lesbian individuals, other populations, such a bisexual, transgender and queer individuals, be often impact 
by same-sex partnership, employment nondiscrimination, and hate crime policies. Scholars may wish to expand this research to include these additional 
population in the future.

1.2. Changes in social attitude 

As public policy have liberalized, so too have people become more accept of homosexuality e though most of the 
decline in stigmatization do not begin until the 1990s (Hicks and Lee, 2006; Keleher and Smith, 2008; Loftus, 2001). The 
majority of research suggests that there be a relationship between public policy and approval of homosexuality (Andersen and 
Fetner, 2008; Hooghe and Meeusen, 2013; Lewis and Oh, 2008). Nevertheless, to date there exists “no systematic analysis of 
the relation between public attitude toward homosexuality and the legal recognition of same-sex marriage and register 
partnership” (Hooghe and Meeusen, 2013, p. 258), particularly the causal direction of any relationship. 

Besides public policy, other cultural and political force be related to an individual’s odds of approve of homosexuality. 
State and national ideological affiliations, especially religious and political orientations, be related to public opinion on same- 
sex relationship (Adamczyk and Pitt, 2009; Lewis and Oh, 2008). Nations emphasize self-expression over a survivalist 
orientation tend to be more accept of homosexuality (Adamczyk and Pitt, 2009). In the United States, county with high 
community cohesion be less approve of same-sex marriage bans, whereas county with traditional value and gendered 
employment pattern be more approve of a ban (McVeigh andMaria-Elena, 2009). Other factor associate with increase 
tolerance over time include a reduction in right-wing authoritarianism, increase awareness of research suggest that 
homosexuality be innate, the de-linking of AIDS with sexual orientation, and increase acceptance by public, religious, and 
political authority (Altemeyer, 2001). These finding suggest that despite the need for additional research on the impact of 
public policy, broad cultural and political force be related to acceptance of homosexuality at the individual level. 

A logical question follows: if public policy be related to attitudes, could they encourage or prevent hate crimes? Given 
that prejudice be the “basic underlie factor” for all individual commit hate crime base on sexual orientation 
(McDevitt et al., 2002, p. 306), societal force also seem a likely influence on hate crime incidence. We now turn to the 
literature explore public policy and the sociocultural environment a distal cause for hate crimes. 

1.3. Hate crime base on sexual orientation 

There be a dearth of theory and research a to why hate crime base on sexual orientation occur, perhaps because most 
research on hate crime focus on experience of survivor (Roxell, 2011). Studies that explore the motivation behind these 
hate crime tend to examine the characteristic and attitude of individual perpetrators. For instance, perpetrator of anti-gay 
action be more likely to be young, male, Black, religious, conservative, and heterosexual (Franklin, 2000; Jewell and 
Morrison, 2010; Roxell, 2011). In addition, McDevitt et al. (2002) have developed a typology of offender that identifies 
four distinct motivation for hate crimes: thrill, defense, retaliation, and mission. 

Although individual attitude and situational context certainly play key role in motivate anti-gay behavior and hate 
crimes, societal attitude and normative ideology be factor a well (Parrott and Peterson, 2008; Willis, 2004). This be not 
surprising, consider that individuals’ attitude be often ground in societal norm that stigmatize gay and lesbian in- 
dividuals and privilege heterosexual (Willis, 2004). Homophobia and institutionalize heterosexism can cultivate an envi- 
ronment inwhich anti-gay behavior and hate crime be accepted (Willis, 2004). In fact, research identifies the enforcement of 
societal gender norm a motivation for anti-gay behavior (Franklin, 1998, 2000; Jewell and Morrison, 2010) and broader 
approval of hate speech and hate crime (Cowan et al., 2005). Many perpetrator believe that violence and harassment be 
necessary form of punishment for those who do not adhere to societal gender norm (Franklin, 1998, 2000) and a way to 
accentuate their ownnormative identity (Franklin, 2000; Jewell andMorrison, 2010; Parrott andPeterson, 2008; Roxell, 2011). 

The inverse may be true a well; whereas heterosexist and homophobic societal norm can motivate hate crime and anti- 
gay behaviors, pro-equality norm may curb these behaviors. Individuals in Canada be less likely to engage in anti-gay 
behavior than those in the United States due to the difference in cultural norm and pressure (Jewell and Morrison, 
2010). Even individual identify a more homophobic be mindful of how others would perceive their attitude and 
behaviors, and be “motivated tomonitor their prejudicial expression to control how theywould be perceive by others” (p. 
2102). In sum, socialization and cultural norm may play a role in hate crime and anti-gay behaviors. 

1.4. Theories of hate crime 

Whereas extant research suggests a link between sociocultural context and hate crime base on sexual orientation, it have 
yet to offer a guide theory for why hate crime occur. In this regard, research on racially-motivated hate crime be relatively 
well-developed. Specifically, when legal conflict or discrimination become salient, they create discursive opportunity for 
racially-motivated bias crimes2 (Finkelman, 1992; Koopmans, 1996; Koopmans and Olzak, 2004). Joining the institutional 
heterosexism literature with research on racially-motivated hate crimes, we examine the law a a key social institution of bias 
motivate violence base on sexual orientation (Herek, 2009b). In fact, research show a moderate relationship between 
2 In Europe, for instance, political tension over immigration instigate anti-immigrant violence (Koopmans, 1996), and mass medium coverage of discord 
and violence raise the salience and further facilitates this process (Koopmans and Olzak, 2004). In the United States, historical examination of lynching 
implicate the explicit or implicit approval of public official who refuse to indict lynch participant a contributor to the racist mob violence 
(Finkelman, 1992). 



B.L. Levy, D.L. Levy / Social Science Research 61 (2017) 142e159 145 
negative stereotype and prejudice toward gay and lesbian individual (Simon, 1998), and “antigay violence can be see 
primarily a an extreme manifestation of pervasive cultural norm rather than a a manifestation of individual hatred” 
(Franklin, 1998, p. 20). Thus, we test the follow hypothesis: 

H1. Constitutional amendment ban same-sex marriage will increase the incidence of sexual orientation-motivated 
hate crime over several years. 

Inversely, legal policy that de-stigmatize homosexuality, such a hate crime law and well-publicized commitment by 
law enforcement to pursue anti-gay and lesbian crimes, can be expect to reduce individual bias and the incidence of 
hate crime base on sexual orientation (Hamner, 1992). 

H2. Pro-equality policy e those promote equality e will decrease the incidence of sexual orientation-motivated hate 
crime over several years. 

Along with the long-term impacts, it be important to consider short-term impact of policy changes. Contrary to the long- 
term prediction in H2, there be two reason why one might expect a short-term increase in hate crime follow pro- 
equality policies: 1) increase incidence due to perceive threat and 2) increase reporting. Research on racially- 
motivate hate crime informs our expectation regard short-term increase in incidence. The defend neighborhood 
model of racially-motivated hate crime posit that (primarily white) resident of racially homogenous neighborhood that 
experience great in-migration of racially diverse individual will commit more hate crime a they perceive an increase 
threat to their neighborhood (Grattet, 2009; Green et al., 1998; Lyons, 2007). Similarly, historical research on lynching find a 
positive relationship between the percentage of black resident in a location and the number of lynching (Beck and Tolnay, 
1990; Corzine et al., 1983; Reed, 1972; Soule, 1992; Tolnay et al., 1989). Blalock’s (1967) work develop a theory of majority/ 
minority relation highlight threat to power a a primary explanation for increase violence. Pro-equality policy represent 
a clear threat to institutional heterosexism and heterosexist power. In fact, homophobic individual might commit hate 
crime to defend their marriage or the institution of marriage (a defendedmarriagemodel). Although a short-term increase in 
hate crime could accompany any pro-equality policy, partnership recognition seem a especially likely candidate. Glaser 
et al. (2002) find that although employment competition and neighborhood in-migration of racial minority produce lit- 
tle change in violent discourse of white racist in internet chat rooms, interracial marriage prompt significant increase in 
support for racially-motivated violence. 

In addition to increase incidence due to perceive threat, pro-equality policy might lead victim of hate crime to report 
those crime at increase rate because they perceive great social acceptance ewithout any increase in actual hate crimes. 
In her study of sexual orientation-based hate crime on college campuses, Stotzer (2010) found that school with pro-equality 
policy at the state and campus level report high rate of hate crimes. However, when compare to the low number of 
crime report to the FBI in the same locales, Stotzer conclude that high rate of reporting on campus be due to the 
supportive environment rather than high incidence of crime. 

Some pro-equality policy victory be associate with an increase in social movement organization (Kane, 2010), 
themselves associate with great rate of reporting (McVeigh et al., 2003). Such change in reporting would yield a sta- 
tistical increase in incidence when an actual increase may not exist. We consider both increase incidence and increase 
reporting in our third hypothesis: 

H3. The introduction of pro-equality policies, especially partnership recognition, may produce a short-term increase in hate 
crime incidence via great violence or increase reporting. 
1.5. Impact of change public policy 

Existing research on other topic highlight the impact of policy and law by state. For instance, in Maurelli and Ronan’s 
(2013) analysis of sex offender notification law and sex crime data between 1960 and 2008, they found that 17 of 50 state 
have a significant reduction in forcible rape follow the passing of sex offender notification laws. On the other hand, 32 
other state have no significant change follow laws. In addition to sex offender notification laws, state regulation of 
firearm impact crime rates. Research on state firearm legislation found that stricter law be associate with few sui- 
cides, homicides, and non-fatal injury use firearm (Anestis et al., 2015; Irvin et al., 2014; Simonetti et al., 2015). 

Despite the number of study on state law and crime rates, there be scant research investigate the link between public 
policy and hate crimes. The effect of hate crime reform have not be evaluate (Shively, 2005), and in most states, part- 
nership recognition policy have not be in place long enough to allow for evaluation. Evidence fromMassachusetts, where 
the state’s Supreme Judicial Court legalize same-sex marriage, suggests that there may be a relationship between same-sex 
marriage legalization and reduction in hate crimes. In 2003, when the Court legalize same-sex marriage, report hate 
crime drop by roughly thirty percent (Bantley, 2008). Similarly, in 1996 when the Defense of Marriage Act be passed, 
hate crime in Massachusetts be rising. These statistic be hardly definitive, and additional investigation use more 
rigorous analysis be necessary. Still, the suggestion that “actions or inaction by the government have have a tremendous 
impact on this group of citizens” be worth explore (Bantley, 2008, p. 564). 

Among the most severe stressor that be prevalent in the gay and lesbian community be violence, harassment, and fear 
for safety (Berrill, 1992). Research suggests that roughly 20 percent of gay and lesbian adult experience crime base on their 



B.L. Levy, D.L. Levy / Social Science Research 61 (2017) 142e159146 
sexual orientation (Herek, 2009a), and over half experience some form of harassment or victimization e a rate that be 
moderately high than their heterosexual counterpart (Katz-Wise and Hyde, 2012). Moreover, 8 out of 10 gay, lesbian, 
bisexual, and transgender individual between the age of 13 and 20 experience harassment at school, include verbal 
harassment (81.9%) and physical harassment (38.3%) (Gay, Lesbian & Straight Education Network (GLSEN) 2011). Victimi- 
zation of gay and lesbian youth and adult tends to occur in public with perpetrator who be stranger (Herek et al., 2002) 
and be related to increase absenteeism, academic difficulties, problem functioning, depression, low self-esteem, stress, 
anger, and crime-related fear (Dunbar, 2006; GLSEN, 2011; Herek et al., 1999). Ultimately, the prevalence of violence and 
harassment against gay and lesbian individual couple with the observe impact of policy on other measure of well- 
be suggests that policy could affect hate crime incidence. 

2. Data and method 

This research estimate a Prais-Winsten autocorrelation-coefficient-weighted first difference panel regression model with 
state fix effect (specified later) to analyze the impact of public policy regard gay and lesbian right on the incidence of 
hate crime base on sexual orientation. We use annual data from 49 state (including Washington, DC)3 over 13 year 
(2000e2012) and rely on variation in timing of change to state policy to identify their relationship with hate crime inci- 
dence. This be a common strategy to analyze the impact of specific policies. For example, Hatzenbuehler et al. (2012) use the 
“quasi-natural experiment” (p. 286) of the 2003 Massachusetts court decision to gauge the impact of same-sex marriage on 
health care usage, and Dee (2008) us variation in the timing of same-sex partnership legalization in Europe to ass it 
impact on sexually transmit infections. 

2.1. Dependent variable 

State-level data on sexual orientation-motivated hate crime be available from the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s 
(FBI’s) Uniform Crime Reporting Program (Federal Bureau of Investigation, 2012).4 The Hate Crime Statistics Act of 1990 
mandate the collection of data on report crime which display manifest evidence of prejudice, include prejudice base 
on sexual orientation5 even though sexual orientation be not include in hate crime law in every state. The official report 
file with the FBI be regard a the “best source of national hate crime data” (McDevitt et al., 2000, p. 3), and they be use 
commonly by researcher analyze hate crime (e.g., Alden and Parker, 2005; Grattet, 2009; Medoff, 1999). Hate crime 
include murder, non-negligent manslaughter, rape, aggravate assault, simple assault, intimidation, robbery, burglary, 
larceny-theft, motor vehicle theft, arson, destruction, damage, vandalism, and crime against society (Federal Bureau of 
Investigation, 2012). 

The number of report hate crime base on sexual orientation have remain quite steady recently, decline only 
slightly from 1331 crime in 2000 to 1302 crime in 2012. By divide sexual orientation motivate hate crime by annual 
state population (U.S. Census Bureau, n.d.db), we analyze the incidence of report hate crime in a state. Due mostly to U.S. 
population growth, report crime decline by slightly more than one crime per two million individual over the period. A 
Dickey, Pantula (1987) test for first-, second-, and third-degree unit root in state-level report hate crime barely fails to 
reject the null hypothesis that a first-degree unit root may exist. Levin et al. (2002) and Harris, Tzavalis (1999) tests, however, 
confirm that the dependent variable be stationary. 

2.2. Focal independent variable 

We will be test the relationship between hate crime base on sexual orientation and four different policy measures. 
We operationalize state marriage policy a a series of dummy variables. Although data be available regard the type of 
same-sex partnership and benefit offer by a state (i.e., full marriage equality for same-sex couples, a marriage-like union 
that be not marriage for same-sex couples, or some spousal right for same-sex couples), these various policy sum to be 
present in a total of 90 observation e leave insufficient case to model the three type separately. As a result, we collapse 
these into a single partnership recognition dummy variable. Another dummy variable identifies state with a constitutional 
3 Hawaii be miss data for all observations, and Mississippi have miss or sporadic report prior to 2008. 
4 There be some potential limitation to use the FBI hate crime data. Like many administrative data, hate crime data be subject to underreporting and 

heterogeneity in reporting. Nevertheless, state fix effect and first-differencing both help to account for any bias in this study. Moreover, to the extent 
that pro-equality policy would be accompany by an increase in reporting e at both the individual and jurisdictional level e any bias in the data would 
operate in the opposite direction of the hypothesize long-term relationship between policy and hate crimes. Thus, our parameter estimate could be 
consider low bounds. This research proceeds cautiously while consider the possibility of underreporting. 

5 Included in this category of hate crime be crime against individual base on heterosexual orientations. This introduces some level of bias in the 
outcome measure, but it be likely to be minimal for two reasons. First, unlike attitude toward and hate crime against gay and lesbian individuals, attitude 
toward and hate crime against heterosexual would not seem to vary across states. Second, hate crime against heterosexual plausibly can be expect to 
be quite rare. 



B.L. Levy, D.L. Levy / Social Science Research 61 (2017) 142e159 147 
amendment ban same-sex marriage. These variable be mutually exclusive from each other and from the base category 
of a general statewide ban on same-sex marriage with no legal recognition of spousal rights.6 Data for these variable be 
available from the Human Rights Campaign’s (HRC’s) and National Gay and Lesbian Task Force’s (NFLTF’s) websites. 

State hate crime policy be a dummy variable indicate whether or not a state’s hate crime law include crime motivate 
by bias against sexual orientation. Although it be possible to further distinguish between state whose law address gender 
identity and those whose law do not, this research do not incorporate this variation because the outcome variable 
measure only hate crime base on sexual orientation and not those base on gender identity. Finally, we operationalize 
state nondiscrimination policy a a dummy variable indicate whether or not a state ban discrimination base on sexual 
orientation. Data for both variable be available from the HRC’s and NGLTF’s websites. Appendix A provide a table of state- 
level policy and when they be enacted. 

To ass how state policy might be causally related to report crime over time, we test several lag and lead 
variable specification of marriage, hate crime, and nondiscrimination policies. This follow the logic of a Granger causality 
test, which suggests that if one time series be useful in forecasting future value of another time series, the former can be 
consider predictively causal of the latter. The timing of these relationship be important give the possibility that increase 
public tolerance might be expect to cause a reduction in hate crime and then passage of pro-equality policy along the 
line of a dynamic representationmodel (Stimson et al., 1995). We determine the appropriate number of lag or lead for each 
variable by begin with two lag and leads, use a Wald test for group of lag or leads, and remove the long lag or 
lead one-by-one if insignificant. Appendix B present the progression of stepwise model use the Wald test to eliminate 
lag and leads. 

2.3. Control variable 

This analysis include several control variables: twomeasures of the incidence of general crime in states, threemeasures of 
incidence of other report hate crimes, citizen and state political ideology measures, two measure of state party gover- 
nance, state unemployment, and state fix effects. Crime incidence data be available from the FBI’s Uniform Crime 
Reporting Program and cover both violent crime and property crime, a well a report hate crime base on race/ethnicity, 
religion, and disability status. We calculate these general crime and hate crime incidencemeasures in the samemanner a the 
dependent variable. To the extent that report hate crime fluctuation be due to change in state-specific general crime 
trends, the general crime measure should capture that. If, on the other hand, any relationship between public policy and 
hate crime base on sexual orientation be spurious and capture broad social trend in hate crimes, our other hate crime 
measure should capture that. 

We include several measure of the sociopolitical climate of a state because cultural context can foster or discourage hate 
crime base on sexual orientation (Parrott and Peterson, 2008; Willis, 2004), and conservatism be associate with antigay 
behavior (Franklin, 2000; Herek, 2009b). Citizen political ideology be a measure of how liberal or conservative the state’s 
electorate be in term of it policy preferences; we use the revise 1960e2010 citizen ideology series7 first described by Berry 
et al. (1998). State government ideology8 measure how liberal/conservative elect official’s policy preference are; we use 
the nominate measure of government ideology, which us common-space congressional ideology preference (Poole, 1998) 
and have somewhat strong validity than a similar measure (Berry et al., 2010). Citizen and state government ideology 
measure range from 0 (most conservative) to 100 (most liberal). State party governance include a dummy variable capture 
whether or not the governor be a Democrat9 and a variable average the share of the state representative and senator that 
be Democrats10 (University of Kentucky Center for Poverty Research, n.d.). 

We also include the unemployment rate a a control for economic condition because although the literature be mixed, 
some research find a relationship between economic downturn and racially-motivated hate crime (e.g., Beck and Tolnay, 
1990; Hovland and Sears, 1940; Soule, 1992). The Bureau of Labor Statistics calculates state-level unemployment rate 
(University of Kentucky Center for Poverty Research, n.d.). Finally, state fix effects11 control for time-consistent omit 
variable cause across-state variation in hate crimes. For example, the share of a state’s population identify a gay, 
lesbian, bisexual, transgender, or queer might affect the incidence of hate crimes. Although there be no annual data available 
to quantify this for our study window, the within-state share of the population be plausibly time-invariant and control 
use state fix effects. Summary statistic for our variable appear in Table 1. 

After identify the appropriate number of lag or lead for the policy variables, we test several theoretically-informed 
interaction of our policy variable with social context control variables. Previous research suggests that the sociocultural 
climate of a state can affect how state implement policy regard gay, lesbian, and bisexual rights, a well a the

rights. In the few situation where this occurred, we cod the state a have the pro-equality policy and not the constitutional ban.

externality that result (Bernstein, 2003; Eskridge, 1999). For instance, Bernstein (2003) utilizes a multidimensional 
framework for understand political movement and activists. She explains that cultural factors, define a social norms, 
behaviors, and discourse, often impact the strategy of lesbian and gay activist and the outcome of their efforts. In the case 
of sodomy laws, cultural change often occur even without change in law. Further, cultural difference by state impact 
activism and policy implementation, with some effort prominently displayed via town meeting or judicial challenge and 
some occur behind the scene (Bernstein, 2003). 

The literature on racially-motivated hate crime also suggests economic downturn or resource deprivationmight increase 
lynching and bias crime due to increase competition for resource (Beck and Tolnay, 1990; Green et al., 2001b; Hepworth 
and West, 1988; Hovland and Sears, 1940; Soule, 1992). In other words, white frustrate by economic hardship and lack of 
resource blame and attack African Americans for their difficulties. Recent finding on racially-motivated hate crimes, 
however, do not necessarily show such clear connection with economics (Grattet, 2009; Green et al., 1998; Lyons, 2007; 
Medoff, 1999). We test interaction of unemployment with nondiscrimination law and citizen ideology with all policy 
variables, and they prove statistically and substantively insignificant. We do not discus the result here (available upon 
request). 

A robust Lagrange Multiplier test (Pisati, 2001) indicates spatial autocorrelation in the dependent variable across the 
states. We account for the spatial autocorrelation by include a spatial effect term. The spatial effect for a state in a give year 
be theweighted average of the dependent variable for all other state in that year, where state areweighted use the number 
of individual migrate to the state for which a lag be calculated. Migration data for create the spatial weight be average 
annual migration flow between state a measure by the pool 2005e2007 American Community Surveys (U.S. Census 
Bureau, n.d.da). Thus, the spatial lag capture the impact of population flows, include the attitude and ideology peo- 
ple carry with them, between states. 

In addition, test for serial correlation (Drukker, 2003) and heteroskedasticity indicate that both violation of linear 
regression assumption be present. Thus, we estimate a Prais-Winsten autocorrelation-coefficient-weighted first difference 
model (xtpcse in Stata) with heteroskedastic panel correct standard errors. Given the moderately large cross-sectional size, 
the cluster error be unlikely to be biased, and concern of finite sample property should not apply (Kezdi, 2004). The 
assumption of strict exogeneity of the regressors for feasible generalize least square should not be violate by the spatial 
effect term because it excludes hate crime incidence of the estimate observation (state). The model be reflect by the 
follow equations:

Hate crime incidence (Y) in state s during year t be explain by k lags/leads of state policy variable (P), a weight (w) 
spatial effect term (Y�s), several control (Z), state fix effect (d),12 and a heteroskedastic panel correct error (εst). We 
obtain the autocorrelation coefficient (brÞ by use OLS to estimate the model without weight differencing and regress 
the residual on the one-year lag residuals. By take an autocorrelation-coefficient-weighted first difference, we remove 
the portion of each year’s independent and dependent variable that be due to serial correlation. This be not the same a a 
complete first difference, which would subtract the full previous year value from the present year value for all variables. As a 
result, although the model be not estimate year-to-year changes, significant policy variable do have an impact both for the 
year that they take place13 and in the follow year(s) at a reduce rate (br). To account for miss data on the citizen and 
government ideology variables, the Democratic governorship and legislature variables, we use multiple imputation with 
chain equation (mi ice in Stata) and 50 impute data sets. We calculatemean coefficient and standard error use Rubin’s 
(1987) formula. Finally, we scale all coefficient e except the spatial lag e to represent the number of additional hate crime 
per one million individual per year that can be expect give a one-unit change in the independent variable. 

This model strategy departs from research on hate crime use negative binomial model for three reasons. First, 
although hate crime be relatively rare, there be not an overabundance of zero in the present data (less than 5 percent of 
observation be zero); Poisson and negative binomial model be especially superior to linear regression model when there 
be a substantial number of zeros. Second, in our base Prais-Winsten model, neither the dependent variable nor the residual 
be heavily skewed, though the residual do display significantly more kurtosis than a normal distribution. Third e and most 
importantly e we anticipate that the functional form of the relationship between public policies, citizen attitudes, and hate 
crime be linear a oppose to log-linear. For example, we expect similar impact when the liberalness of a citizenry increase 
from 5 to 10 and from 10 to 15. To test the sensitivity of our result to our choice of estimator, we estimate a fix effect 
negative binomial panel regression of our prefer model, and the result be largely consistent with the present findings.14 

3. Results and discussion 

We begin our analysis by plot national incidence of report hate crime motivate by sexual orientation against the 
share of the population cover by each of the four public policy we consider from 2000 to 2012. In this section, we will 
integrate these descriptive result with our multivariate model and proceed by consider each of our hypothesis in 
succession. 

3.1. Hypotheses 1 & 2 

Our initial two hypothesis posit that pro-equality policy will be associate with reduction in incidence of report hate 
crimes, whereas anti-equality policy will be related to increase report incidence. Fig. 1 present trend for the share of 
the American population living in state with employment nondiscrimination law (dashed line) and hate crime law that 
include crimesmotivated by sexual orientation (dotted line) from 2000 to 2012. These percentage change over time a state 
enact new laws. We compare the trend with the annual incidence of report hate crime (solid line) over the same period. 
The dramatic rise in the share of the population cover by hate crime law in the early 2000s slightly precedes an equally 
dramatic decline in hate crimes. In 2000, only one in six Americans live in a state with hate crime law include sexual 
orientation; in 2005, the number have risen to seven in ten Americans. In 2000, therewere 4.8 hate crimesmotivated by sexual 
orientation per million people; by 2005, that rate be cut by 27 percent to 3.5 hate crime per million people. The time 
order of this relationship be consistent with the implementation of hate crime law Granger cause a drop in hate crimes, 
though a definitive determination of causality would require more rigorous controls. 

Similarly, the substantive, yet less dramatic, increase of employment nondiscrimination policy that include sexual 
orientation in the early 2000s also coincides with the decline in report hate crimes. In 2000, one in four Americans live in 
state with employment nondiscrimination laws; in 2005, roughly four in ten Americans live in such a state. Rather than 
precede the drop in hate crime by a year like the hate crime law increase, the rise in nondiscrimination law seem to 
occur simultaneously with the decline. 

Fig. 2 be analogous to Fig. 1, except that it present trend for the share of people living in state with constitutional 
amendment ban same-sex marriage (dashed line) and partnership recognition policy that offer marriage, a marriage- 
like union, or some spousal right (dotted line). As thewave of state implement constitutional ban on same-sexmarriage 
begin in 2004, hate crimeswere in decline. The decline, however, reverse course after 2005 and rise to it post-2005 peak of 
4.3 hate crime per million people in 2008 e the same year that coverage of constitutional ban peaked in their coverage of

estimate the model. 
13 Or the follow year(s) in the case of a lag policy. 
14 The constitutional marriage ban be statistically insignificant. One partnership recognition variable be significant and positively related to report 
crimes, and one employment nondiscrimination variable be negatively and significantly associate with report crimes. Only the coefficient on lag hate 
crime law varies in it relationship, become statistically insignificant (but still negative) in the negative bimonial regression. The magnitude of the 
coefficient be not directly comparable because the negative binomial model take a log-linear form. Results be not present here but available upon 
request.

the population. It be plausible, though again hardly definitive, that the discriminatory nature of constitutional bans, a well a 
the heat political environment that they produce (Smith et al., 2006), broke the momentum of the decline and incite a 
new wave of anti-gay and lesbian violence. 

Of the four policy we examine, partnership right be by far the last to see substantial change. Marriage and partnership 
policy coverage hardly increase until 2007, and it saw only small growth until 2010. During the period of significant growth 
from 26 percent coverage in 2010 to 41 percent coverage in 2012, hate crime incidence remain flat (see Fig. 3). It be possible 
that the potential reduction in report hate crime achieve through pro-equality policy have already be realize 
through hate crime and nondiscrimination laws, and partnership recognition thus do not yield the same positive externality. 
Alternatively, this pattern may be confirmatory of H3 and a short-term increase in hate crime reporting that counteracts the 
reduction associate with pro-equality policies, and we discus this further in section 3.2. 

Although the bivariate relationship we observe suggest an impact of public policy regard gay and lesbian right on 
hate crime incidence, disentangle the unique effect of four policy change at different time across different state be a 
complex task. We turn to multivariate analysis to test these initial finding more rigorously. Table 2 present the result of 
Prais-Winsten fix effect panel regression model analyze hate crime incidence. Model 1 be our initial model, which 
include one-year lag of constitutional bans, partnership recognition laws, hate crime laws, and employment nondiscrim- 
ination laws. Additionally, we include present year partnership recognition and employment nondiscrimination laws, a well 
a a two-year lag of partnership recognition. Hate crime law that include sexual orientation be negatively related to hate 
crime incidence, whereas constitutional ban on same-sex marriage be positively associate with hate crimes. For example, 
state institute a constitutional ban on same-sex marriage be associate with one additional hate crime per million people 
than state that have neither a ban nor partnership recognition policy in the year follow enactment. These policy have 
significant one-year lags, which be consistent with policy change Granger cause change in report hate crimes. 
Employment discrimination policy also be negatively related to report hate crime incidence, but the parameter fail to 
meet traditional threshold for statistical significance use a joint Wald test. 

Model 2 add a spatial lag to the base model. The spatial lag miss significance thresholds, but the coefficient be positive, 
substantive, and suggestive of an increase of roughly one hate crime per every three hate crime in ‘nearby’ states. Moreover,

recall that a robust LagrangeMultiplier test indicate significant spatial autocorrelation in the dependent variable (p < 0.001). 
The potential influence of nearby state be not surprising give that individual tend to cluster geographically along di- 
mensions like political ideology and value (Bishop, 2009; Tam Cho et al., 2013), and thus state where the societal force be 
more conducive to hate crime base on sexual orientation be likely to ‘neighbor’ each other (or at least have resident that 
migrate between each other). The substantive importance of neighbor state suggests that there may be spillover effectse 
in the positive or negative direction depend on the policye of a state’s policy regard gay and lesbian rights. The policy 
variable significant in Model 1 remain significant at a substantively similar magnitude, indicate that the relationship 
between policy change and hate crime incidence be unlikely to be endogenous to sociopolitical change occur in nearby 
areas. 

Model 3 include control for general form of crime, report incidence of other type of hate crimes, economic condition, 
citizen ideology, and political structure and ideology. Among these, only the report incidence of hate crime base on race/ 
ethnicity be significant. In addition, the liberalness of a state’s citizen barely miss the p < 0.05 threshold for significance, but 
it be substantively and positively correlate with report hate crime incidence. Although such a relationship may seem 
counterintuitive, it be consistent with research reporting great reporting of hate crime with increase in gay movement 
organization (McVeigh et al., 2003); liberal citizenry also likely foster a social culture that encourages reporting of hate 
crimes. 

Hate crime law continue to be negatively related to report hate crime incidence, and employment nondiscrimination 
law be now significantly and negatively related to incidence. States institute a nondiscrimination law be associate with 
one few report hate crime per 900 thousand people during the year the policy be adopt and an additional one few 
report crime per 1.2 million people in the year follow enactment. Constitutional ban on same-sex marriage be no 
longer related to report hate crime incidence, indicate that the relationship between the two be correlational but not 
causal. Finally, partnership recognition policy be positively related to report hate crime incidence, and we discus this 
further in section 3.2. 

Over all, our finding thus far be generally supportive of H2. We predict that pro-equality policy will reduce report 
incidence of hate crime base on sexual orientation, and this seem to be the case with hate crime and employment 
nondiscrimination law include sexual orientation. Both policy Granger cause reduction in report hate crimes, 
indicative of potential positive externalities. In contrast, we reject H1 e at least in it causal form. Constitutional ban be 
positively correlate with report hate crimes, but this relationship be explain by the many control we include in our 
model. 

3.2. Hypothesis 3 

Our final hypothesis (H3) posit a short-term increase in hate crime incidence follow enactment of pro-equality pol- 
icies, especially partnership recognition, via great violence or increase reporting. Recall from Fig. 2 that we observe no 
change in report hate crime associate with the rise in partnership recognition policy nationwide. In our multivariate 
model in Table 2, however, we find that state partnership recognition law Granger increase report hate crimes. Specif- 
ically, a partnership recognition law be associate with one additional hate crime per 1.2 million people in both the imple- 
mentation year and the year follow implementation, a well a an additional hate crime per one million people two year 
follow implementation. 

This find be confirmatory of H3, but the cause of the increase remains unclear. We cannot determine definitively if the 
increase in report crime result from an actual increase in violence or an increase in reporting only. Given the particularly 
contest nature of marriage policy (Glaser et al., 2002), it be not inconceivable that partnership recognition might incite 
retaliatory violence. If the increase be due to retaliatory hate crimes, wewould expect the effect to be strong in conservative 
location give the relationship between an individual’s conservative ideology and propensity to commit a hate crime 
(Franklin, 2000; Jewell and Morrison, 2010; Roxell, 2011). When test interaction between citizen ideology and part- 
nership recognition policy (despite their statistical insignificance), however, there be little difference in themarginal effect of 
partnership recognition between liberal and conservative citizenries. Alternatively, because hate crime law and employment 
nondiscrimination law tend to be adopt before partnership recognition, the former policy may yield the bulk of the gain 
in hate crime reductions. Such a scenario could leave increase in reporting a the primary impact of the later-enacted 
partnership recognition policies. Thus, it be possible that the time order of policy implementation, a oppose to the 
specific type of policy, determines a policy’s impact. We address this possibility now. 

3.3. Policy order effect 

We re-estimate our model of hate crime incidence use timing variable and lag for pro-equality policy implementation 
instead of indicator variable for specific pro-equality policies. For example, if a state implement a hate crime law include 
sexual orientation in 2005 and an employment nondiscrimination law in 2008, the state would be cod a implement 
their first pro-equality policy in 2005 and their second in 2008. In this timing specification, this hypothetical state would look 
exactly like a state that implement an employment nondiscrimination law in 2005 and partnership right in 2008 (but have 
no hate crime law) from a model perspective. We again begin by test two year of lag and lead for each policy timing 
variable and eliminate lag or lead base on significance test and jointWald tests. Table 3 present the result of our policy

timing model, which include the present value of the first pro-equality policy, a one-year lag of the second pro-equality 
policy, and the present value, a one-year lag, and a two-year lag of the third pro-equality policy. 

Most of the benefit of pro-equality policy appear to arise from the second policy that be implemented. The second pro- 
equality policy reduces report hate crime incidence in the year follow implementation by one hate crime per 600 
thousand people, again indicate Granger causality. The first pro-equality policy have a muted, statistically insignificant 
negative relationshipwith hate crime incidence. It be worth note that we be unable to capture a sizeable share of the change 
in report hate crime that may be due to the first pro-equality policy because 12 state implement such a policy in 2000 
or beforeemeaning it impact would be capture entirely by the state fix effects.15 As a result, wemay simply be unable to 
estimate the impact of an initial policy with our data. 

The third pro-equality policy be associate with an increase in report hate crime in the implementation year and the 
two year follow implementation. This result be unsurprising as, with only one exception, when a state enacts a third pro- 
equality policy it be establish some type of partnership recognition, which also be associate with an increase in report 
hate crime incidence (see Table 2). Although the result be hardly definitive, we be inclined to interpret this increase a a rise 
in reporting rather than a spike in hate crime commit by individual retaliate against same-sex partnerships. Wewould 
15 An additional 19 state have yet to institute a pro-equality policy by 2012. Thus, 12 of the 30 state (40 percent) with pro-equality policy have their first 
pro-equality policy completely control with state fix effects. 



B.L. Levy, D.L. Levy / Social Science Research 61 (2017) 142e159154 
expect retaliatory violence to be strong when the policy discourse be at it peak e the period surround implementation. 
In contrast, the increase in report crime be strong in the two year follow implementation. 

Finally, we attempt to gauge the relative importance of policy type versus implementation order by pool both set of 
variable into a single Prais-Winsten model. Unfortunately, it be difficult to distinguish which be drive the change in hate 
crime due to the high degree of multicollinearity between the two type of variables. We then compare the explanatory 
power of the base model from Tables 2 and 3 that estimate the relationship of policy type and policy order with hate crime 
incidence. These model provide little evidence to adjudicate the issue a they have comparable explanatory power16 and 
similar parameter estimates. Although we cannot settle the debate, it be instructive that the implementation order model 
performs essentially a well a the policy type model. This indicates that at least some of the positive externality of pro- 
equality policy be due to their adoption in state that previously have one or no such policies. 

Ultimately, we find significant effect of most policy despite include a strong control for across-state variance with 
state fix effect and examine only within-state, over-time variation in policy and hate crime incidence. For at least the 
twelve state that have implement their first pro-equality policy by 2000, three of which also have implement their second 
by 2000, the fix effect completely absorb the (immediate) impact of these policies. Most likely, the fix effect also 
capture some of the additional observe variance in hate crime that might be attributable to policy change during the 
window of analysis. Thus, we consider our estimate potential low bound of the true relationships. 

4. Conclusion 

The substantial change in state policy on gay and lesbian right over the past 15 years, a well a the persistent het- 
erogeneity across states, have important consequence for the well-being of gay and lesbians. Already establish be the 
implication of public policy for mental and physical health, a well a a host of individual benefits. We examine the po- 
tential for policy externality in the form of hate crimes. Previous research on racially-motivated violence suggests perceive 
threat of integration (Grattet, 2009; Green et al., 1998; Lyons, 2007) and discursive opportunity (Koopmans, 1996; 
Koopmans and Olzak, 2004) be potential driver of hate crimes. The present finding provide the first rigorous quantita- 
tive evidence that public policy on gay and lesbian right affect the incidence of hate crime base on sexual orientation. Our 
result be consistent with institutional heterosexism theory, wherein the law provide or restricts discursive opportunity 
for bias-based violence. 

Employment nondiscrimination and hate crime law be associate with reduce report of hate crimes, provide evi- 
dence confirmatory of H2. Although it be unclear whether it be the implementation order or type of policy that drive change 
in incidence, these relationship be clear, in the expect direction, and consistent with policy change Granger cause 
change in incidence. Along with potential benefit for gay and lesbian in a state implement pro-equality policies, the 
positive spatial lag term that barely miss traditional significance threshold indicates that pro-equality policy in one state 
may yield spillover benefit for individual in other ‘nearby’ states. 

Consistent with H3, partnership recognition law yield increase in report hate crime incidence in the implementation 
year and two year following. Whether the increase be due to retaliatory violence or great reporting cannot be determine 
definitively with the present analyses, but the result be suggestive of increase in report crime a oppose to retaliatory 
violence. Under a defendedmarriage model, wewould expect a spike in hate crime coincident with implementation and the 
strong increase in conservative states; in contrast, we see the strong effect two year follow implementation and 
roughly equivalent increase by across level of citizen political ideology. This find in particular would benefit from 
additional exploration. 

These result build on exist argument that anti-gay and lesbian violence be an extreme manifestation of social stig- 
matization and cultural norm that be foster by social institutions, and future research should explore the potential 
mediate role of stigma in the production of hate crimes. According to both Goffman’s (1963) and Link and Phelan’s (2001) 
models, the process of stigmatization include status loss and discrimination that subsequently legitimize stigma. Laws and 
public policy can be key source of social stigmatization by codify and perpetuate difference in status and institu- 
tionalizing heterosexism (Herek 2009b, 2011). Public referendum and ballot initiative in particular may crystalize attitude and 
behavior towards gay and lesbian individual (VanHorn, 2008). It be through these individual attitude and behaviors, of 
course, that public policy and stigmatizationwould have an effect on hate crimes. Not only be individuals’ attitude related 
to their pro-gay and lesbian activism (Wilkinson and Sagarin, 2010), their attitude also be associate with behavior in case 
of hate crime (Parrott and Peterson, 2008). Accordingly, to good understand the impact of pro-equality policy on hate 
crime incidence, it will be important to examine the role of stigmatization and it impact on social attitudes. 

The present research also be not without it limitations. Hate crime be notoriously difficult to count accurately (Cramer, 
1999; Herek et al., 1999; Jenness and Grattet, 2005). Although the Uniform Crime Reports be commonly use (e.g., Alden and 
Parker, 2005; Grattet, 2009;Medoff,1999) and regard a the best available data source (McDevitt et al., 2000), our estimate 
of hate crime incidence still likely suffer from significant undercount. In the future, representative survey or experimentally 
test report of hate crime would be beneficial to good quantify the extent of the problem. Fortunately for the present 
16 The model R2 statistic be less than one percentage point different. The base model in Table 2 have an R2 of 0.2852, whereas the base model in Table 3 
have an R2 of 0.2926. 



B.L. Levy, D.L. Levy / Social Science Research 61 (2017) 142e159 155 
research, however, the various source of hate crime data tend to be in agreement regard how hate crime be distribute 
across community despite reporting different total (Green et al., 2001a). Thus, though count of incidence may be inac- 
curate, disparity and trend between state be plausibly correct. Moreover, give that underreporting be the primary 
challenge e and underreporting can be expect to decrease with the institution of pro-equality policy e the effect of 
reporting bias should run counter to the expect policy effect in H1 and H2. Based on this and Stotzer’s (2010) findings, 
the data challenge accompany hate crime research should suppress, rather than inflate, our estimate effects. 

These finding add to the newly form literature on the social production of hate crimes. The small body of quantitative 
research focus on racially-motivated bias crime and explores economic and neighborhood transition model of causation. 
We extend this literature to hate crime commit against gay and lesbians, individual for whom civil right advance be 
relatively recent and ongoing. Additionally, we test the applicability of the defend neighborhood and discursive oppor- 
tunity model to hate crime base on sexual orientation. We find evidence consistent with a discursive opportunity model 
(Koopmans, 1996; Koopmans and Olzak, 2004) in which the law be a key social institution that induces or discourages bias- 
motivate violence. 

This research also have implication for current social policy. In addition to the individual-level benefit that characterize 
current pro-equality argument in the gay and lesbian right debate, there be positive social externalities, such a a reduction 
in hate crimes, associatedwith pro-equality laws. Although public opinion onmarriage equality remains fairly closely divided, 
the general public is, for the most part, not divide in it opposition to hate crimes. Thus, the potential for state policy to 
influence, if not serve as, societal force in the production of hate crime will be an important consideration for legislature 
and court deliberate marriage equality, hate crime, and employment nondiscrimination laws.
