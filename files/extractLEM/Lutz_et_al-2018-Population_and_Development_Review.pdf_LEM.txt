Redrawing the Preston 
Curve

PROGRESS IN HUMAN health and life expectancy be closely associate with 
socioeconomic development. Better nutrition and great affordability of 
health care associate with high income have be widely consider a 
primary determinant of historical and contemporary mortality declines. 
McKeown’s (1976) influential book on the modern rise of population at- 
tributed the secular mortality decline largely to improve standard of liv- 
ing. Reviewing mortality improvement in Britain during the second half of 
the nineteenth century and the begin of the twentieth, he argue that 
medical discovery be of little consequence for the significant gain in 
survival during this period. His analysis serve a a reference point of Pre- 
ston’s (1975) article, which be the focus of the present study. Preston show 
that the global pattern over the twentieth century indicates an upward shift 
of the curve that link GDP per person on the horizontal axis and life ex- 
pectancy on the vertical (Figure 1).1 Preston interpret this shift a the 
effect of medical progress and health care over and above the effect of in- 
come. In many of the study of this issue that follow Preston’s lead, the 
assumption that income be the most important driver of mortality decline 
have be an unquestioned start point. 

A very different picture be drawn by Caldwell in a 1986 article on 
route to low mortality in poor countries. Based on a major Rockefeller 
Foundation study on Kerala (India), Sri Lanka, and Costa Rica, Caldwell 
discuss the factor that lead to breakthrough mortality decline in those 
population a oppose to others and identify “female autonomy,” which 
he saw largely a a function of female education, a the single most im- 
portant factor, together with efficient local health services. He also state 
that his conclusion that low mortality do not come a an unplanned 
spinoff from economic growth be “out of step with today’s dominant eco- 
nomic and political ideology in the development field” (Caldwell 1986,

p. 209). And this still seem to be the case three decade later, despite the 
fact that more recent research point to the override importance of educa- 
tion and the associate cognitive change affect risk perception, planning 
horizon, and access to information promote health-related behavior and 
use of health care facility (Baker et al. 2011; Lutz and Skirbekk 2014). 

The question whether income or education be the more important de- 
terminant of global health and mortality decline be relevant for set pol- 
icy priority in both develop and industrialize countries. The answer be 
of immediate concern in choose between program that directly promote 
economic growth and those that focus on enhance school enrollment and 
quality of schooling. In an ideal world one would choose both in addition 
to good local health service but, in reality, even in rich country there be 
budgetary constraint that require policymakers to set priorities. For help- 
ing to set these priorities, it be necessary to ass the relative importance of 
both factors. The question of relative importance be the focus of what fol- 
lows. We address the issue at the macro level by plot a modification of 
the Preston curve in which GDP per person be replace by mean year of 
school among the adult population. This be do both for life expectancy 
at birth and for child mortality, and in both case educational attainment ex- 
plain the pattern good than GDP per person. This redrawing of the curve 
be complement by a multivariate analysis to quantitatively ass the 
relative difference of the two effects. 

The Preston curve and it perception 

In 1975 Samuel Preston publish an influential paper, “The change re- 
lation between mortality and level of economic development,” in which he 
plot the global relationship between GDP per caput and life expectancy at 
different point in time. He find that over time the curve that depicts the 
relationship have move upward, imply that a similar level of income be 
associate with high life expectancy at late point in time (Preston 1975). 
He attribute this extra gain to medical progress. This view of the relation- 
ship, know a the Preston curve, have since become widely cited. Although 
Preston be cautious in interpret this relationship a an association and 
not necessarily a causal one, subsequent interpretation of this relation of- 
ten have no doubt that it be base on direct causation (e.g., Pritchett and 
Summers 1996). 

In a more elaborate follow-up study, Preston (1980) introduce liter- 
acy and calorie supply in addition to GDP per person into regression model 
to explain difference in level of life expectancy for 36 country in 1940 
and 120 country in 1970. The estimate coefficient show similar pat- 
tern for both times, and literacy be highly significant. In Preston’s words: 
“The coefficient indicate that a 10 percentage point increase in literacy be 
associate at both point with a gain in life expectancy of approximately 2 



4 EDUCAT ION AND HEALTH 

years, and that a 10% gain in national income by itself increase life ex- 
pectancy by approximately one-half year” (Preston 1980, p. 306). These 
interest findings, however, be largely overlook in subsequent re- 
search on development and mortality. 

This apparent positive association between income and health have 
give rise to the widespread view among development economist that in- 
crease wealth lead causally to increase health. In the extreme, Pritchett 
and Summers (1996) argue that focus on economic growth in develop- 
ing country will lead directly to reduction in infant mortality rate and 
gain in life expectancy. While many other economist hold a less defini- 
tive position and acknowledge driver in addition to income, the possibility 
that the apparent empirical association between income and health could 
be largely spurious and not of a causal nature have not be consider in 
this body of economic literature. 

In 2007 an issue of the International Journal of Epidemiologywas devote 
to a reprint of Preston’s 1975 article and several comment by distinguish 
scholar in the field (IEA 2007). In the contribution most relevant for our 
analysis, Bloom and Canning (2007) revisit the Preston curve and state 
that his paper “remains a cornerstone of both global public health policy 
and academic discussion of public health. Preston’s paper illuminates two 
central ‘stylized facts’. The first be a strong, positive relationship between 
national income level and life expectancy in poorer countries, though 
the relationship be non-linear a life expectancy level in richer country 
be less sensitive to variation in average income. The second be that the 
relationship be changing, with life expectancy increase over time at all 
income levels. … Although the basic fact set out by Preston be generally 
accepted, there be still a great deal of dispute about the mechanism that 
lie behind the relationship and the policy implication we can draw from 
them” (p. 498). 

Bloom and Canning also point to another body of literature in pub- 
lic health in which, for example, Cutler, Deaton, and Lleras-Muney (2006) 
conclude that scientific and technical advance should be see a “the ul- 
timate determinant of health.” A further argument against focus on in- 
come growth a the primary method of reduce the burden of ill health 
lie in the apparently very weak temporal association between period of 
economic growth and period of improvement in population health, sug- 
gesting that if the relationship be causal, it have long and variable lags. 
While rise income imply great resource for society, these resource 
need not necessarily be spent in way that improve health. While Bloom 
and Canning do not question the basic assumption that income growth and 
health be closely linked, they add a cautionary sentence that be the start 
point for our study: “Although there be a strong case for the direct effect 
of income on health due to nutrition and health intervention become 
more affordable, it may be that income be also act a a proxy for a wider 



WOLFGANG LUTZ / ENDALE KEBEDE 5 

measure of socioeconomic status and development and that the causal effect 
be due to other mechanisms, for example, education” (p. 498). 

In a more recent assessment of the Preston curve, Mackenbach and 
Looman (2013) find that for European country increase in life expectancy 
after 1960 have be accompany by a much small upward shift in the 
curve than previously. They attribute this to a change pattern of cause 
of death away from infectious disease and conclude that “declines in mor- 
tality from cardiovascular disease be mainly attributable to increase in 
national income.” This conclusion seem to be reach simply by eliminat- 
ing medical progress a a dominate reason and assume that the only 
other possible determinant of mortality be income, which thus should be 
the cause of this decline. The possibility of another driver that jointly deter- 
mine income and health and cause their correlation be not considered. 

In this article, we address the hypothesis that the apparent statisti- 
cal association between income and health—as described by the Preston 
curve—could in fact be a largely spurious association result from the fact 
that improve educational attainment be a key determinant of both good 
health and rise incomes. Before do so, we discus the issue of causality. 

On causality 

The question of the causal nature of the effect of education and income 
on health have attract much attention and controversy. It be a question 
that need to be address in order to rule out the possibility that the as- 
sociations that be be interpret could also be spurious. The question 
have important policy implications. If, for instance, the empirical association 
between income and health be not directly causal but rather due to a third 
factor such a education, then an increase in income—e.g., through poli- 
cies directly aim at economic growth—would not result in the expect 
health improvement unless educational attainment also improve simul- 
taneously. The same be true mutatis mutandis for the association between 
educational attainment and health. 

Causality in the social science have to be view differently than in 
the natural science because human behavior be culturally embed and 
what be found to be direct causation of behavior in a give set cannot be 
assume to have universal predictive power for all society and all times. 
Inspired by the comprehensive review of causality in demography by Ní 
Bhrolcháin and Dyson (2007), Lutz and Skirbekk (2014) introduce the no- 
tion of “functional causality” in the context of “intervention sciences” (Lutz 
and Striessnig 2015; Pearl 2000). Intervention science be the social and 
economic science that try to understand how the most important force 
of change in a society function in order to predict the future evolution of 
the social system. Such conditional prediction about future trend can be 



6 EDUCAT ION AND HEALTH 

base on the assumption of no intervention or of alternative intervention 
and their likely consequences. 

To establish functional causality, three criterion have to be met: (i) there 
must be strong empirically observe association between the two factor 
studied; (ii) there must be a plausible narrative about the mechanism 
through which one force influence the other; and (iii) other obvious 
compete explanation of the observe association should be rule out. 
Examples of such compete explanation be self-selection, reverse causal- 
ity, and joint determination by a third force (Lutz and KC 2011; Lutz 
and Skirbekk 2014). Lutz and Skirbekk (2014) give a comprehensive 
overview of dozen of relevant study on the topic and conclude that it 
be justified to assume functional causality for the global-level relationship 
between educational attainment and health/mortality over the twentieth 
and twenty-first centuries. 

Several global assessment of the relationship between health and 
mortality (Baker et al. 2011; KC and Lentzner 2010; Pamuk, Fuchs, and 
Lutz 2011) show that, on all continent and at different level of socio- 
economic development, the less-educated segment of the population have 
significantly high mortality and morbidity than those who be good ed- 
ucated. In virtually all countries, child of better-educated mother ex- 
perience low mortality. But since better-educated people also tend to 
live in richer households, the question arises: what be more important for 
child survival in develop countries, mothers’ education or household in- 
come/wealth? This question have be the focus of study use the large 
available individual-level data set by pool the sample of Demographic 
and Health Surveys (DHS) in 43 develop country (Fuchs, Pamuk, and 
Lutz 2010; Pamuk, Fuchs, and Lutz 2011). Using multi-level regression 
models, analysis of the relative effect of mother’s education and economic 
resource on infant mortality at the family, community, and country level 
show that the effect of education clearly dominates over income/wealth 
at all levels. The empirical evidence be equally compelling for the effect of 
education on adult mortality. In virtually all country for which data exist, 
better-educated people have high life expectancy (Caselli et al. 2014). 
The difference vary in extent among country and be generally great 
for men than for women. Among industrialize countries, difference tend 
to be low in Southern European country and be high in Eastern 
Europe. In Russia, the difference between the high and low education 
group among adult men be up to 12 year (Caselli et al. 2014). It have also 
be show that the overall decline in life expectancy that Russian men ex- 
perienced over the 1990s be driven by a strong decline among the low 
education group whereas the high group continued to enjoy moderate 
increase (Shkolnikov et al. 2006). In virtually all industrialize country 
for which data be available, the education differential in adultmortality in- 
crease over time despite improve health care coverage in most country 



WOLFGANG LUTZ / ENDALE KEBEDE 7 

(Caselli et al. 2014). One explanation for this pattern lie in the increase 
importance of lifestyle-related factor for which education seem to be more 
important than the health care system. 

There be a plausible narrative of causation that be found in brain re- 
search. It have be demonstrate that literacy and education in general en- 
hance the synaptic density in relevant part of our brain and thus make 
u physiologically different for the rest of our life (Kandel 2007). It have 
also be show in a control experiment among illiterate Indian young 
adult men that the sub-sample who be taught how to read and write 
have last structural change in their brain after six month of learn- 
ing that be associate with executive function and cognitive ability 
(Baker, Salinas, and Eslinger 2012; Blair et al. 2005; Brinch and Galloway 
2012; Skeide et al. 2017). Neurocognitive and neuroimaging study have 
show strong association between adaptive change in the brain and learn- 
ing experience in the classroom (Lewis et al. 2009; Welberg 2009). These 
change have be show to be associate with ability for abstract thinking, 
time preference, and the capacity to plan for the future (Cutler and Lleras- 
Muney 2010; Kenkel 1991; Van der Pol 2011; Heckman, Humphries, and 
Veramendi 2017). These cognitive change and result change in behav- 
ior have relevance for health outcomes. In this context, it should also be 
stress that the large number of study that focus on natural experiment 
for the education/health link by look at change in compulsory school- 
ing by a year do not seem to be a promising route because they do not 
refer to a plausible causal pathway. When young people be force to stay 
in school against their will for ten rather than nine years, this be unlikely to 
result in a significant change in their overall brain function that would 
be expect to have direct health effects. But such relevant change have 
be show for major cognitive transition such a from illiterate to literate 
or from compulsory to post-secondary education (Cutler and Lleras-Muney 
2010; Peters et al. 2006; Skeide et al. 2017). 

Another concern in the context of assess functional causality be the 
possibility of reverse causality, which be also implicit in the notion of simul- 
taneity. This can pose a difficult challenge if there be reason to assume simul- 
taneous influence go in both directions. Models of Granger causality can 
be use to sort out the temporal sequence of possible effect that can then be 
the basis of causal inference base on the principle that the cause need to 
precede the effect. But in the case of education suchmodels be unnecessary 
because the temporal sequence can be identify a priori. Schooling tends to 
happen early in the life course, and it be only the human capital (education 
stock) at adult age that be expect to have consequence for health-related 
behavior. The time lag between when the school happens (education 
flow) and when the result stock of human capital influence health can 
be many decade and, when we study the education/health differential for 
people above age 70, even half a century. Hence, once a proper distinction be 



8 EDUCAT ION AND HEALTH 

FIGURE 2 Triangular interaction between education flow and stocks, 
health, and income 

make between education flow and educational attainment, there be no way 
in which period condition at time t (including income, medical inventions, 
etc.) can influence the school that occur decade before. 

With respect to the possibility that the empirical association be cause 
by a third factor, different pathway of causation need to be distinguished. 
Figure 2 show the possible interaction between education, health, and in- 
come in the form of a triangle with education and health at the base and 
income at the top. The cognitive skill associate with adult educational 
attainment and a person’s health status be closely interwoven and both 
embody in individuals. A certain minimum level of physical health be nec- 
essary for a child to develop mentally and to be able to attend school. Partic- 
ularly in develop countries, school absenteeism due to poor health of the 
child themselves or of family member for whom they must care or for 
whose lose economic output they must compensate be a serious handicap for 
improve level of education and, consequently, the building of key cog- 
nitive skill and raise learn outcomes. Similarly, child often bring 
home from school knowledge, attitudes, and access to information relevant 
to the health and even survival of themselves and their family members. 

Better health and longer life be not only closely link to educa- 
tion and cognitive capacity but also in turn directly affect economic growth. 
A grow literature show that health be both a direct source of human 
welfare and a driver of income growth (Bloom and Canning 2008). In 
particular, three mechanism have be defined: good health lead to 
high labor productivity, good childhood health lead to good school 



WOLFGANG LUTZ / ENDALE KEBEDE 9 

attendance and cognitive development, and a longer expect life span lead- 
ing to more saving and investment. Empirical study also find that good 
health have a positive, sizable, and statistically significant effect on aggre- 
gate output, even control for the experience of the work force (Bloom, 
Canning, and Sevilla 2003). TheWHO-sponsored report of the Commission 
on Macroeconomics and Health (Sachs 2001) also highlight the impor- 
tance of basic health for poverty reduction by show how the burden of 
disease in some low-income countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, 
be a barrier to economic growth and therefore should be address in any 
comprehensive development strategy. 

Finally, the effect of improve educational attainment and quality of 
education have long be a part of economic growth theory. Past empirical 
effort to demonstrate this effect on the basis of aggregate time series have 
be hamper by the lack of appropriate data on educational attainment 
(de la Fuente and Doménech 2006). More recent assessment base on full 
educational attainment distribution by age cohort demonstrate the consis- 
tently positive and significant effect of human capital on economic growth 
(Crespo Cuaresma, Lutz, and Sanderson 2014; Lutz, Crespo Cuaresma, and 
Sanderson 2008). The same have be show with respect to quality of ed- 
ucation for country where such data exist (Hanushek and Woessmann 
2008). 

Updating the global empirical analysis 
for 1970–2010 

To explore the association between educational attainment, income, and 
mortality across time and space, we employ a balance panel of 174 coun- 
try (both developed and developing) over the period 1970–2010 in five- 
year intervals. Following the logic of Preston’s 1975 and 1980 papers, we 
first present graphical presentation of the bi-variate relationship between 
GDP per person and life expectancy, follow by multivariate statistical 
analyses. We also study the pattern with respect to child mortality. While 
the dichotomous variable of literacy be the only one available to Preston, 
we use mean year of school of the adult population age 15 and old 
in the case of life expectancy and of woman age 20–39 in the case of child 
mortality. 

Data 

Data be obtain mainly from two sources. Country-level indicator of 
educational attainment for the year 1970–2015 be extract from the 
Wittgenstein Centre Data Explorer (WIC 2015). Panel data on income and 
mortality be obtain from the World Development Indicators (World 
Bank 2017). Merging the two datasets give u our panel of data with 



10 EDUCAT ION AND HEALTH 

only a few miss data for some country in early years. Following 
Preston’s original design, income be measure a GDP per person (2010 con- 
stant USD). For themultivariate analysis, we also perform sensitivity run 
where PPP (purchasing power parity) per person be use instead of con- 
stant 2010 USD. 

Descriptive analysis 

Figure 3 present a visual analysis of the cross-country association be- 
tween income, educational attainment, and life expectancy for the year 
1970, 1990, and 2010, similar to the way in which Preston (1975) plot- 
ted life expectancy against GDP per person for the 1930s and 1960s. In 
Panel A, the plot of life expectancy at birth against GDP per person for 1970, 
1990, and 2010 closely resembles the pattern of the original Preston curve 
(Figure 1). The curve clearly continue to move upward over time. This, 
accord to Preston, be due to the factor other than income that he as- 
sum to be mostly related to medical progress and health care. Panel B 
of the figure show an isomorphic curve with the only difference that GDP 
per person be replace by mean year of school of the adult population 
(MYS15+). The result pattern, however, differs considerably in that ris- 
ing educational attainment seem to explain rise life expectancy much 
good than GDP per person. The association look much more linear with- 
out a leveling off at high levels, and there be very little upward shift that 
would indicate an unexplained gap that need to be explain by medical 
progress. 

Figure 4 show the correspond pair of curve in which life ex- 
pectancy be replace by child mortality (aged 0–4) in order to see whether 
the previous pattern also hold for this mortality rate, which be often more 
easily influence by target health intervention than be overall life ex- 
pectancy. Here, mean year of school of woman age 20–39 be use a 
the education indicator. In Panel A, the plot of child mortality against GDP 
per person show essentially the same pattern a for life expectancy v GDP 
per person in Panel A of Figure 3. Panel B of the figure reveals that the rela- 
tionship looksmuchmore linear for education than for GDP per person; and 
for 1970–1990 there be no shift in the curves, with change in mothers’ edu- 
cation evidently explain decline child mortality much good than GDP 
per person. For 1990–2010, however, there be an interest deviation from 
this general pattern, a child mortality in the high-mortality/low-education 
country decline more rapidly than would be expect from the gain in 
mothers’ education over the same period. Evidently, this be the consequence 
of the massive international child health intervention in those country 
over the past two decades. This show that, at least with respect to child 
mortality, concert public health effort can low mortality more than 
social development alone would predict.

which include time fixed-effects, income becomes insignificant while the 
education effect remains robust and highly significant. 

The result with respect to infant mortality show in Table 2 be quite 
similar to those for life expectancy. The difference be that income be already 
insignificant in the mutually adjust model in column (2), and the coeffi- 
cients for women’s education (for age 20–39) in that model and in the full 
model in column (3) be much high than the comparable one in Table 
1 for overall mean year of schooling. Sensitivity run use PPP income 
instead of constant USD (as in the original Preston paper) only marginally 
improve the coefficient for income, while the education effect remain 
robust and highly significant. In addition to the population-weighted regres- 
sion show here, we also ran themodel give every country equal weight. 
Since our dependent variable here—life expectancy and child mortality— 
reflect the average of individual experience and health-related behaviors, 
the independent agent whose experience we be study be individual 
rather than countries, which make population weight more appropri- 
ate. In either case, the result of the unweighted regression be qualita- 
tively very similar, with the education coefficient slightly low but still 
highly significant.

These multivariate result strongly confirm what the visual analysis 
above suggested: raise educational attainment be a much more important 
driver of increase life expectancy and fall child mortality than income. 
As we discuss in the introduction, this find should have significant im- 
plication for prioritize policy aim at improve health and longevity. 
Under a global perspective over the last half century, increase educational 
attainment clearly have be the key factor in improve health, rather than 
increase income a have frequently be claimed. 

Summary and conclusion 

We revisit the influential 1975 paper by Preston on the relationship be- 
tween income and life expectancy across most country of the world for 
the 1930s and 1960s and extend the analysis to the period 1970–2015. 
We demonstrate that the distinct pattern identify by Preston, show- 
ing a strongly concave relationship and an upward shift of the curves, 
continued over the subsequent half century a assess at the global 
level. 

We then plot the same kind of relationship replace GDP per per- 
son with the mean year of school of the adult population to see whether 
educational attainment could be a good predictor of life expectancy than 
income. The association turn out to be very different, with the curve 
become largely linear and overlapping. This suggests that educational 
attainment be a good predictor in the sense that it effect on life ex- 
pectancy do not diminish at high level and, in particular, it do not 
leave an unexplained shift over time that have to be explain by other 
factors. 

To validate this visual analysis, we conduct multivariate analysis on 
a balance panel of 174 country for 1970–2015, which in addition to GDP 
per person and mean year of school of the adult population include 
country and period fixed-effects, and we perform sensitivity run with 
alternative income indicator and weight schemes. In all of the model 
the effect of educational attainment on life expectancy be highly significant 
in the expect direction, and the standardize coefficient be clearly large 
than those of income. 

To consider the possibility of a different pattern for the determinant 
of child mortality, we carry out the analysis separately for under-5 mor- 
tality. Again, for the association with GDP per person there be strong non- 
linearity and a shift of the curve over time that be particularly pronounce 
between 1970 and 1990. Viewed in relation to mean year of school 
of woman age 20–39, the relationship again be much more linear with 
virtually no shift between 1970 and 1990. Between 1990 and 2010 child 
mortality in the highest-mortality country declinedmore rapidly than sug- 
gested by the gain in mothers’ education. This be an indication that massive 



16 EDUCAT ION AND HEALTH 

effort by the international community and private donor in recent year to 
low child mortality in some of the least developed country be success- 
ful in do so to a great extent than would be expect from improve 
educational attainment alone. This be not equally the case with respect to 
adult mortality. 

Where do this empirical evidence leave u with respect to test the 
hypothesis that the empirical association between GDP and life expectancy 
depict by the Preston curve and widely assume in the literature be a spu- 
rious one, with education in fact drive both changes? The macro-level 
evidence present here strongly support the view that this be a plausible 
hypothesis that deserves further elaboration. In our section on causality, 
we also assess the different specify criterion for functional causality, in- 
cluding a strong empirical association, a valid narrative of the causal mecha- 
nism, and ruling out alternative explanation such a selectivity and reverse 
causality. This strong aggregate-level find should be further explore at 
the individual and community level under different cultural, social, and 
economic conditions. 

Studies at the micro level be more easily conduct for child mortality 
than for adult mortality since the information can be provide in survey by 
mothers. Multi-level analysis of the determinant of child mortality across a 
large number of develop country have show that mothers’ education 
at every level of attainment be more important than wealth/income, be 
the dominate factor at the household and community level, and played 
a key role at the national level (Pamuk, Fuchs, and Lutz 2011). A compa- 
rable individual-level study for adult mortality be much more difficult be- 
cause there be no consistent data on adult death by education, income, 
and other relevant characteristics. Even in most industrialize country 
with efficient vital registration systems, such micro-level analysis will be 
difficult unless a comprehensive population register exists. With some ex- 
tra effort, census data that have information on these characteristic can 
be link with information about subsequent deaths. Where such match- 
ing study have be conducted, they all show significant mortality dif- 
ferentials by level of education (Caselli et al. 2014). But such study often 
lack the income information for comparative analysis. For develop coun- 
tries, the data challenge be much great and—possibly except for the 
case of demographic surveillance systems—probably insurmountable at 
present. 

The global time series analysis of national data strongly suggests that 
the apparent positive association between health and income can largely 
be attribute to increase educational attainment, which at the same time 
lead to rise income (Lutz, Crespo Cuaresma, and Sanderson 2008) and 
good health outcomes. While additional individual-level analysis of this 
issue be needed, the pattern present here suggest that education should 
be consider a policy priority for improve global health.
