1 INTRODUCTION 
3D shape acquisition and reconstruction method be base on opti- 
cal devices, most commonly laser scanners, that sample the visible 
shape surface. ese scanner yield point cloud which be oen 
noisy and incomplete. Many technique have be developed to 
amend such point clouds, denoise them, and complete their miss 
part use various prior [Berger et al. 2014]. All these surface- 
base reconstruction technique assume a reasonable sample rate 
of the surface. Notably, these technique fall short in case where 
the shape contain highly occlude part that be inaccessible to 
the scanner’s line-of-sight. us, complex shape such a the three- 
elephant statue in Figure 2(a) and Figure 2(b) cannot be properly 
acquire nor reconstruct base on conventional (optical) scan- 
ners. Moreover, some objects, like Figure 2(c), be make of glossy or 
transparent materials, which pose another challenge that common 
optic cannot deal with. 

In this work, we take a completely dierent approach to shape 
reconstruction. e idea be to cast surface reconstruction into a 
volumetric problem. Our technique be base on the ancient uid dis- 
placement discovery make by Archimedes, state that: the volume 
of uid displace be equal to the volume of the part that be submerged. 
By dip an object in liquid along an axis, we can measure the

displacement of the liquid volume displacement and transform it 
into a series of thin volume slice of the shape along the dip axis. 
By repeatedly dip the object in various orientation (see Figure 
1), we generate dierent volumetric displacement and transform 
them into what we call a “dip transform”. 

3D reconstruction proceeds by measure the volume of oblique 
thin slice of the shape. We refer to the volume of these slice a 
samples, and collect such sample along dierent angles. is, in 
turn, equips u with the ability to generate enough data to recover 
the geometry of the input shape. Since our technique be base on 
use volume sample that be generate by liquid access the 
object, we can acquire occlude and inaccessible part in a relatively 
straightforward fashion. 

Figure 3 illustrates the dip transform of 2D and 3D shapes. Input 
shape (top row) be rotate and dipped along dierent orientation 
to form the dip transform (boom row). In the dip transform 2D im- 
ages, each column represent measurement along one axis and the 
row represent volume displacement (or slices). We show that the 
dip transform be invertible and thus the shape can be reconstruct 
back from it. 

Our technique of reconstruct 3D shape with the dip trans- 
form be related to compute tomography (see Section 2). Common 
tomography method use optical system with penetrate wave 
to sample the absorption of the radiation along multiple parallel 
beams. We show that the dip transform be equivalent to the Radon 
transform for binary volumes. While tomography acquisition de- 
vice base on radiation system be expensive, bulky and must be 
use in a safe special environment, our dip-based tomography be 
inexpensive and safe, while capture hidden part and structures. 
As such, it provide an appeal alternative approach, generate 
a complete shape at a low computational cost, use a novel data 
acquisition technique. 

e inverse transform require solve an underdetermined prob- 
lem. e matrix involve be large and sparse and be nearly 
orthogonal. As such, they have nonzero paerns and structural 
property that can be exploit to accelerate the numerical com- 
putations. Given a set of sample of a give object, we use a pre- 
compute factorize matrix to compute the inverse dip transform 
in nearly linear time in the number of sample and obtain a stable 
numerical solution to the problem. When the dimension of the 
problem be small to medium size, we solve the problem by (implic- 
itly) compute the pseudo-inverse, give rise to a solution with 
minimum norm. For very large problem we apply LSQR or LSMR, 
which be decomposition-free and minimize the norm of the residual

cannot be fully reconstruct by conventional (optical) 3D scanners. 

or related quantity over a Krylov subspace, use matrix-vector 
products. 

e key advantage of the present approach be that it employ 
liquid a the sensor. Unlike optical sensors, the liquid have no line- 
of-sight requirements, it penetrates into cavity and hidden part 
of the subject, bypassing all visibility and optical limitation of 
conventional scan devices. We demonstrate the merit of our 
approach by present various result of reconstruct complex 
objects, which include large portion of hidden regions. 

2 RELATED WORK 
e problem of surface reconstruction from scan point have be 
research extensively in the last couple of decades. Nevertheless 
scan base acquisition and reconstruction be beyond the scope of 
this work, see e.g. [Berger et al. 2014] for a comprehensive survey. 

Computed tomography (CT) be the process of reconstruct an 
unknown volume from a collection of two-dimensional projection 
(shadow images) correspond to dierent position of the electro- 
magnetic radiation source and represent the integral of emission 
or absorption from a give view. A classical way of reconstruct 
volume density from line integral capture by the projection im- 
age be via the Fourier Slice eorem [Bracewell 1956; Kak and Slaney 
2001; Radon 1917], which state that the volume density can be 
recover from a number of 1D inverse Fourier transforms of line 
in the projection images. Alternatively, Algebraic Reconstruction 
Techniques (ART) iteratively solve a set of linear equation [Gordon 
et al. 1970; Kak and Slaney 2001] for the volume densities, use the 
Kaczmarz iterative scheme. 

CT play a central role in medical image a well a in many 
computer graphic related applications. Trifonov et al. [2006] use 
visible light tomography to acquire object make of glass and other 
transparent media. Specically, they measure the refraction of light 
through the transparent object and use tomographic reconstruction 
to reconstruct the object’s volume. 

Still, 3D reconstruction of transparent and specular object have 
be a challenge problem in computer vision and graphics. Trans- 
parent and specular objects, may have complex interior and exterior 
structure that can reect and refract light in complex ways. Since 
it be beyond the scope of this paper, we refer to the state-of-the-art 
survey of this eld [Ihrke et al. 2010]. 

Stochastic tomography have be introduce in [Gregson et al. 
2012] for the purpose of capture turbulent uid mix behavior. 
Instead of use the Radon transform (Fourier slice theorem) or al- 
gebraic reconstruction technique (ART), their method us random 
walk to reconstruct the volume from an array of cameras. Zhao et 
al. [2011] use an X-ray CT system to capture the inner structure of 
fabric and model their appearance. To accurately render a material, 
a CT scan be use to capture it inner volume which be then use 
to compute the material’s scaering properties. Recently, Ijiri et 
al. [2014] use an X-ray CT system to accurately capture the intri- 
cate internal structure of real-world 3D owers. ey segment the 
volume into ower organ and apply active contour to smoothly 
reconstruct their surface.

3 3D DIP TRANSFORM 
According to Archimedes equality, which couple buoyancy and 
volume, dip an object in a bath of water allows for measure 
the volume of slice along the dip orientation (perpendicular to 
the water surface) from the water displacement level. Based on this 
principle, let u dene a 3D dip transform of an object. 

3.1 Definition 
Suppose we be give an input object, represent a a volumetric 
binary function, 

F (x) = 
 
 

1 x ∈ Ω, 
0 otherwise, 

(1) 

where Ω ∈ R3 be the object’s interior domain. We dene the accu- 
mulated volume of F (x) over time t , with orientation θ , a the dip 
transform of the object, give by: 

F (t ;θ ) = 
∫ ∞ 
−∞ 

F (x)u 
( 
xT θ − t 

) 
dx, (2) 

where u (t ) be a step function that equal 1 if t ≥ 0 and 0 otherwise. 
e time derivative of the dip transform, G (t ;θ ) = ∂F∂t (t ;θ ), be 

equivalent to the Radon transform of a binary object [Herman 2009]: 

G (t ;θ ) = 
∫ ∞ 
−∞ 

F (x) δ 
( 
xTθ − t 

) 
dx, (3) 

where δ (t ) be the Dirac delta function. Relying on the Archimedes 
equality, we get ∫ 

G (t ;θ )dt = V , ∀θ , 

where V be the volume of the object.

column in the sinogram (le) show the change in the water level raise for 
a dierent angle for 0◦ ≤ θ < 180◦. The dierent profile (right) contribute 
to the shape reconstruction. The angle from le to right, top to boom, 
be θ = 20◦, θ = 50◦, θ = 90◦ and θ = 130◦. 

Analogously to the compute tomography (CT) eld, G (t ;θ ) can 
be visualize use a sinogram – a visual representation of the 
object’s projections. In our case, each column in the sinogram repre- 
sent a dip prole, which be acquire along a specic orientation, 
a illustrate in Figure 4. e dierent proles contribute to the 
shape reconstruction. Examples of 2D and 3D sinograms of dierent 
shape be show in Figure 3. 

In practice, the object be dipped in dierent orientation θ i ∈ Θ, 
the water elevation rate be sample in a constant rate, T , and a set 
of sample measurements, Gθ i [n] = G (nT ;θ i ), be extracted.

3.2 Reconstruction 
In order to reconstruct F (x), an inverse transform be applied. We 
rst dene a discrete version of the problem. Denoting the sample 
measurement by дθ ∈ RM , we recast the reconstruction model a 
a least-squares optimization problem: 

arg min 
F̃ 

∑ 
θ i ∈Θ 




дθ i − SRθ i F̃ 



2 , (4) 

where Θ be a set of dip orientations, Rθ i be a rotation operator which 
rotates the object by an angle of θ i around it center, and S be a 
summation operator that sum over the row of the rotate matrix, 
count the number of active voxels, and output an M-length vector. 
We note that дθ i be equivalent to a vector of volume of slices, where 
the height of the slice be uniform. e unknown degree of freedom 
that form F̃ be give a a matrix of dimension M × K × L. Our 
eventual goal be to nd a voxelized binary solution in {0, 1}M×K×L 
that approximates F (x); this solution represent the inversion. 

e matrix S and R be dened via 

S =

where R̄θ be the rotation operator in matrix notation which rotates a 
vectorized object, generate by use bi-linear interpolation, and S̄ 
be a row sum matrix, which be operate on a vectorized matrix 
and sum the row of the original matrix. In mathematical terms, 
S = I ⊗ v where I be an M ×M unit matrix and v be a column vector 
of one of size KL. 

For notational convenience we express (4) in vectorized form, a 
follows: 

arg min 
f 



д − Bf 

2 , (5) 

where f ∈ RN be the vectorized version of F̃ (column stack), д be a 
chain version of all the measure дθ , and B = SR ∈ RM×N be the 
chain “rotate and sum” matrix aer the vectorization procedure. 
Finally, we use clamp to convert f into a binary solution, namely 
a vector in {0, 1}N . 

3.3 Numerical Solution 
In this section we discus several technique for solve (5), which 
denes the inverse dip transform. 

In practice, acquire dip signal by measure water’s elevation 
rate be a time consume process. In addition, this mechanical oper- 
ation may limit the number of dip angles. us, a typical setup 
of a dip transform reconstruction constitutes an underdetermined 
problem, where the number of measurement do not uniquely 
dene the desire object. 

Conventional inverse Radon transform-based method assume 
a full representation of the data within the measurements, and 
therefore do not t our case. Instead, we aim at develop a compu- 
tationally inexpensive method that computes the inverse transform 
while exploit the structure of the dip matrices. 

Our underdetermined minimization problem (5) feature innitely 
many solutions, and one way to express them be by 

f = fp + z, 

where fp be a particular solution that satises Bfp = д, and z be a 
vector in the null-space of B, namely a vector that satises Bz = 0. 
A common way of select a specic f , be to compute the solution 
that minimizes ‖ f ‖2 – this be know a the min-norm solution. is 
method seek a solution in the active space of the operator, eliminat- 
ing the null space. Oen the null space contains high frequencies, 
and eliminate them may have a regularize eect. Computing it 
be typically do via the pseudo-inverse of B. We solve 

f = B†д, 

where 

B† = B (BBT )−1, 

and we assume that B have full row rank. In case where the reg- 
ularizing eect be not accomplished, Tikhonov or other type of 
regularization may be seamlessly incorporate into the solution 
procedure. In our case we could add a small diagonal shi to BBT 
before invert it to accomplish the desire eect. Cases of rank 
deciency can be dealt with by compute the QR factorization of 
B and eliminate linearly dependent rows. It be easy to show that 
the solution in this case have the small norm. 

In order to convert the solution back to a binary image we de- 
termine the value of the binary voxel use a threshold on the 
result image, use Otsu’s method [Otsu 1975]. e step in the 
reconstruction algorithm be demonstrate in Figure 6. 

Computing the pseudo inverse of B through it singular value 
decomposition (SVD) be the most numerically stable procedure, but 
it be unsuitable for the current problem, because the computation 
of the SVD do not respect sparsity. Instead, we compute the 
Cholesky factorization of BBT once and for all: we seek a square 
low triangular matrix G, such that BBT = GGT . We then store 
the factor G and use it repeatedly a we replace v throughout the 
computation. To form BBT , we exploit the block structure of B 
and construct the matrix product block by block. e solution of д 
require backward substitution and forward substitution forGT and 
G, respectively. Forming the decomposition take O (W 3) oating 
point operations, whereas the backward and forward substitution 
be O (W 2). us, if we repeat the calculation for dierent vector 
v , the overall computational cost be modest. 

Taking a close look at B = SR reveals that it be a sparse matrix 
with a unique structure. For Rθi , which rotates the object use a bi- 
linear interpolation, R typically have 4 nonzero entry per row in 2D 
reconstruction and 8 nonzero entry per row in 3D reconstruction. 
e matrix S also have a limited number of nonzero entries. e 
sparsity paern of SR for 2D reconstruction be show in Figure 5. 
Only 4% of the matrix entry be nonzero. 

In a huge-scale seing a direct decompositional approach may 
consume prohibitive storage resources. In such case we resort to 
iterative solver such a LSQR [Paige and Saunders 1982] or LSMR 
[Fong and Saunders 2011], with an appropriate precondition 
approach that exploit the special structure of S and R.

Only 4% of the matrix be non zero. Row wise there be approximately N 
non-zero entry (white), column-wise there be roughly K . 

4 DIPPING AND VOLUME SAMPLING 
Seing up the 3D dip device be challenge a it involves physi- 
cal measurement of water level, whose accuracy can be compro- 
mised by many factor such a ripples, tank’s cross-section, recorder 
sensitivity, etc. In addition, rotate and lower an object in the 
tank need to be perform in a mechanically-controlled manner, 
and be precisely calibrated. 

We consider three dierent physical setup to measure the dip 
transform in practice (see Figure 7): 

(1) Dipping – Object be lower at constant speed into a tank 
which be partially lled with water. e water elevation be 
recorded, thereby measure the slices’ volume. 

(2) Draining – Object be xed underwater in a tank. A tap at 
the boom of the tank be released, drain the water from 
the tank at a constant ow rate and the water lower be 
recorded. is rate be proportional to the volume of the 
slices. 

(3) Flooding – Similarly to Dipping, the object be lower at 
constant speed, however, here water fully lled tank. As the 
object be dipped, water overows into a second tank, where 
the water elevation rate be recorded. e second tank be 
thinner, enhance water elevation rate, which potentially 
lead to high accuracy. 

Each setup have it advantage and disadvantages; we provide a 
few detail below. 

e drain process involves an operation of a mechanical tap 
which introduces noise upon opening and closing it. Furthermore, 
the drain process may create whirlpool around the tap, result 
in noise in the water level measurement. 

e ooding installation involves water transfer from one 
tank to another. Water level reading in the second tank be error 
prone a water may not be transfer properly to the second tank. 
For example, the water surface tension may prevent the water from 
drip completely into the second tank even in an overow sce- 
nario. Also, such water transfer take time, thus it signicantly 
reduces the measure speed. We have select the dip setup 
to be use during our experiments. Although the object be lower 
at a constant step size into the water, the amount of water elevation 
be change within each step. When the body be lower d unit 
in the ith step and the water level rise δi units, the volume slice 
measurement corresponds to d + δi vertically along of the orient 

object. Since in our discrete seing in (4) the object’s voxels be 
accumulate within equally space slices, we have to preprocess the 
measurement so they t the algorithm input. us, we interpolate 
the acquire non-uniform slice into a continuous function and 
resample it uniformly. e new sample represent volume of slice 
with the same width. e number of slice be determine by the 
user. at said, the nest level of detail be bound by the original 
water elevation rate; the low the rate, the ner the level of detail 
of the reconstruct geometry. Figure 8 exhibit physical measure 
of a spherical ball, interpolate and resampled. 

It should be note that our dip scheme assumes that the 
object have no vertical cap in any orientation. A cap be a vertical 
cavity that form a vessel, in which water can be accumulate if 
the object be elevate vertically and air can be trapped, generate 
air pocket when the object be dipped in the opposite orientation. 
Most caps, if they exist, would be small and would have a minor 
eect akin to noise on the dip transform. Nevertheless, cap can be 
detect by dip and then liing back the object with the liquid 
trap in the cap, yield two dierent water levels. Flipping the 
object vertically allows detect air pocket a they become caps. 

5 EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS 
To test the feasibility of our technique we have construct both 
3D dip simulator, which virtually dip know models, and a 
physical 3D dip robot, show in Figure 9. We have test our 
technique both qualitatively and quantitatively. 

5.1 Dipping Simulator 
We have implement a 3D dip simulator to allow experiment 
use a wide range of 3D objects, a well a dierent dip scenar- 
io (varying number of dips, noise, etc.). To simulate our mechanism, 
a 3D model, represent a mesh surface, be rst convert into a 
volume representation, use standard voxelization method [Patil 
and Ravi 2005]. Dipping in a specic orientation be simulated by 
divide the object by equally space surface in the request ori- 
entation. e number of voxels in each slab be counted, result in 
a single dip measurement. By collect a set of dip measurements, 
we then apply our numerical solution to reconstruct the volume 
from the dip transform. It should be note that the number of dip- 
ping orientation inuences the quality of reconstruction. As the 
number of dip proles increases, more detail be visible. 

In order to demonstrate the evolution of a shape a a function of 
the number of dips, we perform the dip process on several 
objects, use an increase number of orientations. 

Figure 10 demonstrates the quality of our reconstruction, use 
the raw voxels representation, a a function of the number of dips. 
As can be observed, a the number of dip increase more geometric 
detail be reconstructed. Note specically the ne reconstruct 
detail of the octopus arms. 

In Figure 11 we show our reconstruction evolution of dierent 3D 
models, with a resolution of 2403. While low number of orientation 
capture the raw shape of the object, use 10% of the require dip 
(which be theoretically need for perfect reconstruction) result in 
high quality reconstructions. Table 1 summarizes several statistic 
for these model include a reconstruction error use the METRO 
method [Cignoni et al. 1998].

Our method require no line-of-sight between the sensor and the

can be understood from Figure 13. In 13(a) we have test the recon- 
struction error (using METRO [Cignoni et al. 1998]) for increase 
number of dips. We average over result from dierent object 
and dierent resolutions, thus, we present the reconstruction er- 
ror a a function of the percentage of dip orientation (from the 
number require for perfect reconstruction in each resolution). is

with a matrix structure regularization, it can handle noise, in the 
sense that the error correlate with the noise in a linear nature. e 
result in 13(b), which demonstrate false positive and false negative, 
show that the reconstruction error be considerable, even for low 
SNR. 

5.2 The Dipping Robot 
Following the discussion in Section 4 we construct a fully auto- 
matic system, which incorporates the dip method. e setup be 
rather simple, consist of a robot arm with one linear axis low- 
ering the object (moving perpendicular to the water surface) and 
two rotation arm responsible for seing the object’s orientation. 
e vertical step be set to 2[mm] and the rotational to 1◦. e 
water sensor use be non-contact absolute position transducer, plus 
a oating ball, with accuracy of 0.1[mm]. Figure 9, show our 3D 
dip robot in action. 

Reconstructing an object from real dip measurement be a chal- 
lenging task. System noise (due to jier and water ripples) should 
be consider and a practical number of dip orientation may 
not be suciently diverse. However, geometric prior on the re- 
construct body, such a smoothness and symmetry, may help to 
improve the quality of reconstruction. 

In order to reconstruct a 3D object we perform the follow 
stages: 

(1) Noise smooth - the measure signal be smoothed, 
use a normalize 5 sample gaussian kernel, in order 
to reduce noise which mainly lie in high frequency and 
do not degrade the object’s detail due to the smoothness 
assumption. 

(2) Symmetry exploitation - Orientations which yield the 
same dip signal be measure only once and the result- 
ing signal be duplicate to all of the appropriate locations. 

(3) Dipping signal interpolation - In order to generate dip- 
ping signal of miss orientation or to generate more 
sample between two consecutive measurements, interpo- 
lation between neighbor sample be performed. 

(4) Reconstruction - use the smooth duplicate interpo- 
lated samples, our reconstruction algorithm be generated. 

In the experiments, we dipped dierent object a show in the 
le column of Figure 15. ese object exhibit symmetry which 
enables signicant reduction in the number of require orientations. 
For example, the cat object (Figure 15 rst row) be dipped in 35 dif- 
ferent orientations, follow by noise removal smoothing. Figure 14 
compare between a real noisy dip measurement, it smooth ver- 
sion and the simulated ground truth dip. In order to extend the 
number of dips, we next exploit the unique geometry of the ob- 
ject which have symmetry of 120◦ around the z axis and an additional 
reection symmetry within each third. us, the number of real dip 
be duplicate into 210 virtual dips. ese dip be interpolated, 
result a total number of 420 dips. 

is number of dip enables resolution of 403, which can be 
upsampled and smoothed, due to the smoothness property of the 
object. e reconstruction of our dip algorithm on the real 
measurement be show in Figure 15(d). In addition, our dip 
reconstruction be compare qualitatively to a scan of a 3D struc- 
tured light scanner. As can be see in Figure 15(c), the structure 
light scanner can not reconstruct self occlude part of the objects. 
However, our dip reconstruction result in a complete object. 

6 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
e paper present a novel three-dimensional shape acquisition 
and reconstruction method base on the well-known Archimedes 
equality between uid displacement and the submerge volume. A 
strong feature of our method be that it relies on uid displacement 
a the fundamental shape sensor. e liquid have no line-of-sight 
requirements, which be advantageous compare to optical sensors. 
Furthermore, our technique allows for seamless penetration into 
cavity and hidden part of the object a well a transparent and 
glossy materials, thus bypassing all visibility and optical limitation 
of conventional scan devices. Our result demonstrate the

capability of acquisition and reconstruction for a wide range of 
shape with large occlusion and hidden regions. 

One obvious limitation of the propose method be it speed of 
acquisition. e mechanical arm dip the object vertically step by 
step, and it be necessary to read the liquid level in between steps, 
which introduces a temporal boleneck. We be currently explore 
way for improve this by develop a continuous dip and 
reading process, whereby we measure the ratio between the vertical 
dip speed and the liquid elevation. We be also investigate 
faster computational methods. Future work may include the devel- 
opment of sparse recovery technique base on compress sensing, 
which exploit the redundancy that exists in the binary representa- 
tion of the voxels, to signicantly reduce the number of dip 
orientations. is approach may lead to a much small optimiza- 
tion problem, which in turn will allow for further acceleration of the 
solution procedure, and the reduction of the overall computational 
time require to solve the inverse transform problem. 

Another limitation that we have discuss be “no-cap” assumption. 
e dip method assumes that the object have no signicant cap 
or vessel. is may introduce error once the liquid be spill into 
the cap and lls it up. We be consider deal with such cap by 
measure the level of liquid also during a vertical li of the object. 
e amount of liquid trap in the cap can be measure to ass 
the volume of the cap. Analyzing the proles of the liquid level 
measure on up and down movement may reveal some additional 
geometric feature of the shape of the cap. 

e success of this volumetric technique lead u to speculate that 
we may be able to consider a multi-modal acquisition setup where 
the reconstruction combine the information gain by the various 
modalities. For example, we may be able to utilize the strength 
of laser scanner for sample the shape-visible exterior and the 
volumetric and occlude information reconstruct from the dip 
transform.
