Several animal specie demonstrate remarkable locomotive capability on land, on water, 

and under water. A hybrid terrestrial-aquatic robot with similar capability require multi- 

modal locomotive strategy that reconcile the constraint impose by the different envir- 

onments. Here we report the development of a 1.6 g quadrupedal microrobot that can walk on 

land, swim on water, and transition between the two. This robot utilizes a combination of 

surface tension and buoyancy to support it weight and generates differential drag use 

passive flap to swim forward and turn. Electrowetting be use to break the water surface and 

transition into water by reduce the contact angle, and subsequently induce spontaneous 

wetting. Finally, several design modification help the robot overcome surface tension and 

climb a modest incline to transition back onto land. Our result show that microrobots can 

demonstrate unique locomotive capability by leverage their small size, mesoscale 

fabrication methods, and surface effects.

Many animal specie 
1–5 exhibit multimodal locomotive 

capability in terrestrial and aquatic environment to 
evade predator or search for prey. A few arachnids3 

and insects4 can move on the surface of water by exploit static 
surface tension. The surface tension force significantly exceeds 
(over 10 times) their body weight, enable rapid locomotion and 
even jumping without break the water surface6. Remarkably 
some insects, such a dive flies4 and dive beetles7,8, can also 
generate enough force to spontaneously break the water surface to 
swim, feed, and lay egg underwater. The ability to move on the 
water surface, controllably transition into water, and swim 
underwater enable these creature to live in complex environ- 
ments (e.g., high salinity environment such a the Mono Lake4) 
that most animal cannot survive. 

Robots that can traverse complex terrains, such a hybrid 
terrestrial-aquatic environments, be suitable for diverse 
application in environmental monitoring and the exploration 
of confine spaces. Taking inspiration from nature, many 
robotic prototypes9–12 have be developed for terrestrial-aquatic 
locomotion. Most of these amphibious robots, however, weigh 
over 100 g and cannot move on the water surface due to their 
large weight-to-size ratio9–12. Microrobots (mass<20 g, 
length<15 cm) have a small weight-to-size ratio, and they can 
leverage surface effects, such a electrostatics or surface tension, 
to perch on compliant surfaces13 or move on the surface of 
water14–19. This confers several potential advantages; for example, 
microrobots can avoid submerge obstacle by return to the 
water surface. Furthermore, microrobots experience small drag 
on the water surface due to reduce wet area, which lead to 
high locomotion speed compare to swim underwater. 
These hybrid locomotion capability could potentially allow 
microrobots to explore diverse environment that be inaccessible 
to large robots. 

Previous work14–20 on water strider-inspired microrobots 
leveraged insight from study of biological water striders21. 
These robot weigh 6–20 g, be 8–15 cm long, and use hydro- 
phobic wire for support on the water surface. These device be 
use to investigate the biomechanics of water striders22,23, study 
the associate fluid mechanics21, and enable microrobot loco- 
motion on the water surface. Actual water strider be ~1 cm long 
and weigh 4.5 mg, and they be over 10 time small and 
1000 time lighter than these microrobots. Since the surface 
tension force scale linearly with the leg contact length and mass 
scale with length cubed, these robot need to use support leg 
that be substantially longer than their bodies. These support 
leg create challenge for locomotion in other environments, such 
a on land or underwater. 

In this study, we develop a 1.6 g quadrupedal microrobot that 
be capable of walk on land, move on the surface of water, and 
transition between land, the water surface, and aquatic 
environment (Supplementary Movie 1). We address two chal- 
lenges that be unexamined in previous studies: gait design for 
multimodal locomotion24 in terrestrial and aquatic environments, 
and strategy for transition between these environments. First, 
we develop gait for locomotion on land and the water surface 
utilize a quadrupedal robot with two independently control 
degrees-of-freedom (DOFs) in each leg. Second, we design “feet” 
that utilize both surface tension and surface tension induced 
buoyancy to generate the necessary support force without 
inhibit terrestrial locomotion. The “feet” utilize electrowet- 
ting25–27 to break the water surface. Electrowetting refers to the 
change of the liquid to solid surface contact angle in response to 
an apply voltage, and it be commonly found in microfluidics 
or electronic paper display applications26. We further examine 
the influence of surface tension on the robot during underwater- 
to-land transitions. Design change to the robot’s leg and 

transmission (compared to a previous version28) allow it to 
overcome a force that be twice it body weight and break the water 
surface to transition back onto land. 

In summary, this work develops multimodal strategy for 
locomotion in terrestrial and aquatic environments, describes 
novel mesoscale device for water surface to underwater transi- 
tions, and analyzes the influence of surface tension on microrobot 
aquatic to terrestrial transitions. These study culminate in the 
first terrestrial-aquatic microrobot that adapts to complex 
environments, represent advance in mesoscale fabrication 
and microrobot locomotive capabilities. 

Results 
Robot design and demonstration. We base our robot design 
on the Harvard Ambulatory MicroRobot (HAMR), which be a 
1.43 g quadrupedal robot with eight independently actuate 
DOFs29. Two piezoelectric actuator control the swing (fore/aft) 
and lift (vertical) motion of each leg. The robot be fabricate base 
on the PC-MEMS process28,30 and the robot transmission be 
make of compliant 25 µm polyimide flexure (Kapton, Dupont). 
In previous studies28,29, a number of walk gait such a the 
trot, pronk, and jump be show to be capable of high speed 
locomotion on land. 

Several design modification be implement (Fig. 1a) to 
enable locomotion on the water surface, controllable sinking, and 
transition from underwater to land. The leg be equip with 
passive, unidirectional flap to facilitate swim (Fig. 1b), and 
with electrowetting pad (EWP-Fig. 1c) to generate surface 
tension and buoyant force to support the robot’s weight on 
the water surface. To break the water surface and transition into 
water, the EWPs utilize electrowetting to modify surface 
wettability. In addition, design modification be make to the 
robot’s chassis and circuit board to reduce the volume of air 
trap during sinking. To avoid short underwater, the 
circuitry be coat in ~10 µm of Parylene C. Finally, the robot 
transmission be manually stiffen approximately two time to 
improve vehicle payload, which allows a submerge robot to 
break the water surface and transition back to land. 

This robot can walk on level ground, transition from ground 
onto the water surface, swim on the water surface to evade 
underwater obstacles, sink into water by actuate it EWPs, 
walk underwater, and transition back onto land by climb an 
incline (Fig. 2a, and Supplementary Movie 1). Figure 2b show 
a correspond experimental demonstration of robot locomo- 
tion. The robot move at a speed of 7 cm s−1 use a 10 Hz trot 
gait on level ground. To walk from land onto the water surface 
(Fig. 2c, and Supplementary Movie 2), the robot walk down a 
7° incline use a trot gait with a 1 Hz stride frequency to avoid 
break the water surface in this process. Once the robot be 
afloat, it swim (Fig. 2d, and Supplementary Movie 3) at a 
speed of 2.8 cm s−1 use a 5 Hz swim gait. To dive into 
water, the actuator be switch off and a 600 V signal be 
apply to the EWPs. The locally induced electric field modifies 
the surface wettability, reduces the surface tension force, and 
cause the robot to sink into water (Supplementary Movie 4). 
Once the robot sink to the bottom, it can walk underwater 
(Fig. 2e, Supplementary Movie 5) use a trot gait at stride 
frequency up to 4 Hz. To transition back onto land, the robot 
climb an incline of up to 6° and gradually move through the 
water-air interface (Fig. 2f, g, and Supplementary Movie 6). 
Further, the robot can demonstrate turn on land, on the 
water surface, and underwater to avoid obstacles. In the 
follow sections, we describe detailed result on robot 
swim and transition between land, the water surface, and 
underwater environments.

Floating and controllable sinking through electrowetting. One 
of the major challenge in develop a robot capable of move 
on the water surface be to support the robot’s weight. Previously 
developed water strider-inspired robots5,16,18 be 10 time large 
and 100–1000 time heavier than natural water striders, and they 
rely on multiple, non-moving leg to support themselves on the 
water surface. Such a design limit these robots’ ability to move 
through clutter environment and to traverse other type of 
terrains. Here, we develop a novel design that substantially 
reduces leg length, enables controllable sinking through electro- 
wetting, and allows for multimodal locomotion on land, on the 
water surface, and underwater. 

An EWP (Fig. 3a) be instal on each leg of HAMR. The EWP 
be ~1 cm in diameter, and it be make of a fold 5 µm thick copper 
sheet coat by 15 µm Parylene (see Methods). This hydrophobic, 
dielectric coat insulates the copper from water. Unlike 
previous water surface support device that only utilize surface 
tension, our device relies on surface tension and surface tension 
induced buoyancy. The maximum net upward force generate by 
our device be give by: 

F ¼ �γL co θ þ ρwgAhw ð1Þ 

where γ be the water surface tension coefficient, L be the net 
contact length, θ be the contact angle between Parylene C and 
water, ρW be the water density, g be the gravity, A be the EWP’s flat 
area, and hw be the maximum deformation of the water surface 
before breaking. The value of hw relates to the contact 
angle between the EWP and the water surface, and consequently 
the buoyancy term be dependent on the surface tension. The 
dependence of hw on contact angle will be specify in equation 
(4), and the value of the constant be give in Supplementary 
Table 1. For our EWP design, equation (1) estimate that surface 
tension contributes ~25% of the net upward force, and surface 
tension induced buoyancy force account for the rest. 
We note that the buoyancy contribution becomes even more 
important than surface tension in heavier (>1 g) water stride 
robot because contact area grows faster than contact length a 
robot size increases. Our robot weighs 1.65 gram, and it can carry 
1.44 gram of additional payload on the water surface. This 
additional payload allows the robot to paddle it leg (up to 10 

Hz) without break the water surface (Supplementary Movie 4), 
which be crucial for robot locomotion. 

This device further enables controllable and repeatable 
transition through the water surface. We define transition 
controllability a the robot’s ability to dive into water at a desire 
location and time. This form of controllability be absent in a 
previous study24 that demonstrates transition by coat a 
microrobot with a surfactant. Furthermore, we be only 
concerned with sinking in shallow (<15 cm) and undisturbed 
water. Under these condition and without control of the robot’s 
pose during sinking, the robot always land on it foot because 
it center of mass be low than it geometric center. The EWPs 
initiate sinking with the electrowetting process—the modification 
of a surface’s wet property under an apply electric field. 
When a voltage be apply to a conductive surface coat with a 
dielectric layer, there be a reduction of the contact angle between 
an electrolyte and the solid surface. This reduction of contact 
angle lead to two effect that enable sinking: surface tension 
reduction and spontaneous wetting. 

First, the electrowetting process reduces surface tension by 
reduce the contact angle between the EWP’s vertical wall and 
the meniscus surface (Fig. 3b). When a 600 V signal be sent to the 
EWP, an electric field perpendicular to the meniscus surface 
(parallel to the free water surface) be generate and it lead to a 
change of the contact angle govern by: 

co θ ¼ co θN þ 
ϵ0ϵl 
2γdH 

V2: ð2Þ 

Here ϵ0 be the permittivity of free space, ϵl be the relative 
permittivity, dH be the dielectric coat thickness, θN be the 
nominal contact angle, and V be the apply voltage. This 
reduction of contact angle reduces the upward surface tension 
force govern by the first term of equation (1). According to 
equation (2), a hydrophobic coat (θN > 90°) can become 
hydrophilic (θ < 90°) under a large voltage input, which change 
the weight-bearing surface tension force to a downward pull 
force. 

The EWP’s vertical wall be important for reduce surface 
tension because they low the require operating voltage and 
mitigate the problem of dielectric breakdown. Without the

vertical walls, the fringe electric field generate by the EWP’s 
horizontal surface be much weaker. This require a high 
input voltage to achieve a similar reduction in contact angle, 
and can potentially cause dielectric breakdown of the insulate 
Parylene coating. Compared to a flat foot pad, the EWP’s 
vertical wall strengthen the electric field between the device 
and the water surface meniscus (Fig. 3b) under the same input 
voltage. The conflict relationship between contact angle 
reduction and dielectric breakdown be illustrate in Supple- 
mentary Figure 1a. The quadratic curve show the require 
voltage that achieves a 100° contact angle reduction a a 
function of coat thickness, and the straight line show the 
maximum EWP operating voltage before dielectric breakdown. 
The intersection of these line predicts the minimum require 
coat thickness. To account for coat inhomogeneity of the 
fabrication process and the contact angle saturation effect, 

we choose a coat thickness of 15 µm and an operating 
voltage of 600 V. 

The height of the EWP’s vertical sidewall can be determine 
by analyze the water meniscus profile31. The meniscus height 
(Fig. 3b) near the vertical sidewall relates to the local contact 
angle: 

hv ¼

2ð1� sin θÞ 

p 
k�1; ð3Þ 

where k�1 ¼ ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiγ=ρgp and it be define a the characteristic length. 
This formula predicts the meniscus height to be ~3 mm. To 
ensure the local electric field be approximately perpendicular to 
the water meniscus, we set the EWP’s sidewall to be 4 mm tall, 
which be slightly large than the meniscus height. 

Following the reduction of surface tension, the buoyancy force 
also decrease due to change of hw, which lead to spontaneous

wet on the EWP’s horizontal surface. Recall that hw be the 
maximum height difference between a static meniscus and a flat 
surface before the liquid spontaneously spread on the surface 
(Fig. 3c). The relationship between hw and the surface contact 
angle be give by: 

hw ¼ 2k�1 sin 
θ 

2 
: ð4Þ 

For the EWP design, hw reduces from 5mm to 2 mm when the 
input voltage increase from 0 V to 600 V, which implies that the 
surface tension induced buoyancy force be reduce (second term 
of equation 1). Consequently, both surface tension and buoyancy 
force reduce and cause the robot to sink into water (Fig. 3d). 
Supplementary Figure 1b and Supplementary Movie 4 illustrate 
the spontaneous wet process on a flat copper sheet coat 
with 15 µm of Parylene. In summary, charge the EWP’s 
sidewall reduces the surface tension force, and charge the 
EWP’s horizontal surface lower the buoyancy force. 

We characterize the EWP performance by measure the 
maximum surface tension force at different input voltage 

(see Methods for experimental setup). Figure 3e compare the 
experimental measurement with the predict value from 
equation (1), (2), and (4). The model show good agreement 
with experiment for input voltage small than 400 V. The 
model underestimate the net upward force for input voltage 
high than 400 V because it do not consider the contact angle 
saturation phenomenon25, which be an experimental observation 
that no material can become completely hydrophilic regardless of 
the input voltage amplitude. In future studies, this discrepancy 
between model and measurement may be reduce by use 
alternative dielectric coating that have small saturation angles. 

Our experiment show that the maximum upward force an 
EWP generates be 11.5 mN. This force reduces to 8.2 mN when a 
constant signal of 600 V be sent to the device. This measurement be 
an upper bound of the EWP’s performance a it be rigidly 
mount on a force sensor. When instal on the mircorobot, 
the EWP’s horizontal surface may not be parallel to the water 
surface due to fabrication imperfection, cause a reduction in 
contact area and maximum surface forces. As a result, we 
measure the maximum robot weight to be 3.09 g (65% of the 
maximum static measurement) before sinking.

Locomotion on the water surface. In addition to float on the 
water surface, the robot be capable of locomotion include 
swim forward and turning. Existing designs14–20 base on 
water strider cannot be apply to our robot because stationary, 
long support leg inhibit walk on the ground. Instead, we 
require the robot to use the same set of actuator and leg to move 
on the water surface. This requirement imposes two major 
challenges: symmetric walk gait for terrestrial locomotion 
cannot generate net propulsive force due to the time reversibility 
property of low Reynolds number flow, and the amplitude of the 
robot legs’ swing motion, and thus the induced drag force, be 
substantially less than that of biological example such a the 

dive beetle (Dytiscus marginalis) and the dive fly 
(Ephydra hians). 

Diving beetle swim underwater by paddle their hind 
leg asymmetrically (Fig. 4a) to generate unidirectional thrust7. 
During the power stroke, the hind leg tarsus and tibia flatten to 
maximize project area and increase forward thrust. During the 
recovery stroke, the hind leg tarsus and tibia retract to minimize 
the project area and reduce backward drag. Previous 
biomimetic study analyze the dive beetle’s paddle leg 
trajectory and show that they can be model by two serial 
link connect to each other and the body by two actuate 
rotational joints32,33.

and swim mechanics, we develop passive swim 
flaps34 that generate asymmetric gait for water surface locomo- 
tion. The robot leg and it flap constitute a two-serial link 
system: the leg motion be control and the flap rotation be 
passively mediate through an elastic joint. As show in Fig. 1c, 
the flap be fully submerge in water while the robot rest on the 
water surface. The flap be design to be passive device that 
retract in a single direction. During the fast downstroke (Fig. 4b), 
the flap remain fully open to generate forward thrust. During the 
slow upstroke (Fig. 4b), the flap collapse to reduce drag. The flap 
rotation be passively mediate by force from an elastic flexure, 
drag from the surround fluid, and the flap inertia. Conse- 
quently, develop an appropriate drive motion for the robot 
leg be crucial for achieve desire flap kinematics35. 

To design the swim kinematics and determine the flap 
area, inertia, and flexure stiffness, we conduct at-scale flap 
experiment and construct quasi-steady, dynamical simulation 
(see Supplementary Notes 1–3 and Supplementary Figure 2). The 
kinematic parameter of stroke angle (ψ) and pitch angle (α) be 
define in the Supplementary Note 1, and they be label in 
Fig. 4d and Supplementary Figure 2c. During swimming, the 
robot’s lift actuator be switch off and a piecewise sinusoidal 
drive signal be sent to the swing actuator (Fig. 4c). As show in 
Fig. 4c, the fast downstroke occupies 10% of the flap period, 
the slow upstroke take 50% of the flap period, and the 
actuator remains stationary for the remain 40% of the time to 
allow the flap to return it nominal orientation. 

Figure 4d show a single leg flap experiment use this 
drive signal at 5 Hz. The flap remains flatten during the fast 
downstroke (T= 0 to T= 0.1). At stroke reversal (T= 0.1), the 

flap begin to collapse while the leg slows down and revers 
direction. This collapse behavior be mainly due to the flap 
inertia and the force from the surround fluid. During the slow 
upstroke (T= 0.1 to T= 0.6), the flap remains collapse to 
reduce drag. During the recovery phase (T= 0.6 to T= 1), the 
actuator be held stationary and the flap slowly rotates back to it 
nominal position due to the restore torque from the flexure. 

Figure 4e show the tracked stroke angle (ψ) and the passive 
flap angle (α), and superimposes the simulated stroke and flap 
motion base on the input signal from Fig. 4c. We observe 
qualitative agreement between the quasi-steady simulation and 
the experimental measurement. The error of the maximum 
predict flap angle and phase offset be 4° and 6% period, 
respectively. As detailed in the supplemental material, this error 
arises primarily from ignore the add mass effect and the 
collision between the flap and the central strut during the 
downstroke. We further estimate the drag force profile use 
the quasi-steady model. As show in Fig. 4f, the thrust force be 
mainly generate during the downstroke, whereas the drag force 
during the upstroke and stroke recovery be small. Here the model 
estimate the time average force to be 0.13 mN from a single leg 
actuate at 5 Hz. 

Driving all four robot leg with the same signal from Fig. 4c, we 
demonstrate robot forward swim on the water surface. For 
the experiment show in Fig. 5a, the robot swim 32 cm in 
12 seconds, with an average speed of 2.7 cm s−1 (0.7 body length 
(BL) per second). Figure 5b show the instantaneous robot 
swim speed extract from a high-speed video of another 
swim experiment (Supplementary Movie 3). The maximum 
and mean swim speed be 8.1 (2.1 BL s−1) and 2.8 cm s−1 

(0.7 BL s−1), respectively. In addition to swim forward, the

Supplementary Table 2 list the robot cost of transport for 
locomotion on land, underwater, on the water surface, and on an 
incline. The cost of transport for move on the water surface be 
18% high than that of walk on land. 

Underwater to land transition. Our microrobot be capable of 
walk and avoid obstacle underwater (Supplementary 
Movie 5) and climb up an incline to transition back onto land 
(Supplementary Movie 6). When it be fully submerged, the robot 
us terrestrial walk gait to demonstrate turn and walking. 
We estimate that buoyancy force account for 40% of the robot 
weight, which enhances locomotion and improves payload 
capacity underwater. In the aquatic-to-terrestrial transition pro- 
cess, there be two major challenges: overcome the surface 
tension and climb an incline. 

As the robot move through the air-water interface, the water 
surface exerts an inhibiting, downward force whose magnitude be 
approximately equal to the robot’s weight. Although the robot 
can climb up an 11° incline underwater on surface cover by 
polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), it be unable to break the water 
surface of while climb up a 6° PDMS surface (Fig. 6a, and 
Supplementary Movie 7). Figure 6b show the tracked robot front 
and hind leg trajectories: when completely submerged, the robot’s 
front leg lift high than it hind leg (red color region in 
Fig. 6b) due to the rearward location of it center of mass. Surface 
tension force push down on the front of the robot a it move 
out of water, induce a clockwise torque with respect to the 
robot center of mass and cause the hind leg to lift high than 
the front leg (blue color region in Fig. 6b). As the robot 
continue to climb upward, the body torque induced by surface 
tension becomes counterclockwise, cause the front leg to lift 
high again (red color region in Fig. 6b). In this process, the 
downward surface tension force gradually increase and ulti- 
mately cause the robot hind leg to stick to the incline surface, 
prevent forward locomotion. 

To quantify the magnitude of water surface tension force 
during the transition process, we measure the net force on a robot 
a it be slowly pull out of water (Supplementary Fig. 3). As 
show in Fig. 6c, the surface tension force on the robot’s circuit 
board and EWPs be approximately 16 mN and 9.3 mN, 
respectively. Although these force be comparable to the robot’s 
weight, previous work have demonstrate that HAMR can carry 
2.9 g of additional payload36 on flat surfaces. 

These force measurement be conduct while mount the 
robot parallel to the water surface, and consequently they do not 
account for the influence of the torque induced by the surface 

tension force during the transition process. To quantify the 
influence of the surface tension torque, we pull the robot through 
the water surface on a 3° incline and quantify the deformation 
of the robot legs’ transmission. As show in the top view of 
Fig. 6d, the robot hind leg be splayed out further than the robot 
front legs, indicate that there be a large force push down on 
the back of the robot. In an unloaded configuration (Fig. 1a), the 
robot’s leg be approximately perpendicular with respect to the 
ground. In the configuration picture in Fig. 6d, the robot hind 
leg splay outward 19° compare to the nominal leg orientation. 
This cause the back of the robot body to sag down and it front 
to tilt up. The side view in Fig. 6d show that the robot body 
pitch increase to 14° (θB) on a 3° (θI) incline. This unfavorable 
body pitch θB exacerbates the adverse effect of climb an 
incline, cause the robot’s front leg to lift high and prevent 
the robot’s rear leg from lift off the ramp surface. 

We make two major modification to mitigate the adverse 
effect cause by surface tension during underwater-to-ground 
transitions. First, the leg and swim flap be redesign and 
fabricate monolithically use a 150 µm carbon fiber laminate, 
substantially reduce the deformation of the entire structure 
under load. In addition, we reduce the compliance of the legs’ lift 
DOF by manually biasing the leg downward during the assembly 
process a detailed in a previous study37. This preloads the 
flexure to create a force bias that opposes gravity, effectively 
alter the transmission ratio to increase stiffness and reduce 
sagging. Second, we attach PDMS-coated foot pad to the robot’s 
front leg to increase friction. The experiment illustrate in 
Fig. 6a, b show that the robot’s front and hind leg serve different 
function during the transition process. The surface tension 
induced torque inhibits hind leg liftoff and increase friction on 
the hind legs. In contrast, the front leg experience low normal 
and frictional force which result in slipping. Attaching PDMS 
foot pad to the robot front leg increase friction on the front 
leg and reduces slipping. 

Figure 6e show a composite image of the robot climb out of 
water on an acrylic, 3° incline at an average speed of 0.75 cm s−1. 
Compared to the side view in Fig. 6d, this image show that the 
modify robot do not pitch up noticeably during the transition 
process. Figure 6f further illustrates the correspond front and 
hind leg trajectories. The lift motion of both front and back leg 
reduce a the robot foot emerge from the water surface. Once the 
robot front leg completely exit the water surface, the front legs’ 
lift amplitude recover. Due to surface tension force and torque, 
the cost of transport for transition from underwater to land be 
approximately four time large than walk on level ground 
(Supplementary Table 2). 

Discussion 
Our presentation of a hybrid terrestrial-aquatic microrobot 
include a novel mesoscale device design that us electrowetting 
to control surface tension magnitude and achieve controllable and 
repeatable water surface to underwater transitions, a multimodal 
strategy for locomotion on terrestrial domain and the water 
surface, and a detailed analysis of the challenge impose 
by surface tension during a microrobot’s transition from under- 
water to land. Our design satisfies the various constraint 
impose by microrobot actuation, payload, and the different 
environments. Although many of these constraint lead to con- 
flicting design requirements, they can be reconcile by 
leverage physics, such a electrowetting or surface tension, 
unique to the millimeter scale. For instance, we design foot pad 
that rely on surface tension and surface tension induced buoyancy 
to reduce foot size. Furthermore, by leverage electrowetting 
principles, we design four 25 mg EWPs that can both statically

support 1.9 time the robot weight and sink the robot when 
actuated. Finally, whereas legged terrestrial locomotion involves 
discontinuous contact dynamic and friction, aquatic flap 
locomotion at the low Reynolds number regime be continuous 
and require asymmetric strokes. Using a combination of passive 
flap and asymmetric driving, we develop a swim strategy 
that have a similar cost of transport compare to robot terrestrial 
locomotion. 

Compared to hybrid terrestrial-aquatic insects, microrobots 
have shortcoming in actuation and power density but also 
posse advantage in use engineer material and electrostatic 
devices. To dive into water, a dive fly4 can exert a downward 
force large than 18 time it weight to overcome surface tension. 
Piezoelectric actuator cannot deliver such high force; however, a 
microrobot can utilize electrowetting to modify wettability 
−something that be unobserved among insects. In the case of 
swimming, the shortcoming in actuation can be compensate by 
exploit fluid-structure interaction in passive mechanisms. 

Whereas a dive beetle7 can paddle with asymmetric power 
stroke and recovery stroke by independently control the 
motion of it tibia and tarsus8, a microrobot can generate similar 
asymmetric paddle motion by merely control it leg (ana- 
logous to tarsus) swing. The flap (analogous to tibia) rotation be 
passively control through the couple between the fluid flow, 
the flap inertia, and the elastic hinge to achieve efficient loco- 
motion on the surface of water. 

Further, this be a demonstration of a microrobot capable 
of perform task that be difficult for large robots. To the 
best of our knowledge, no exist robot can walk on land, 
swim on the water surface, and transition between these envir- 
onments. By leverage surface effect that dominate at the mil- 
limeter scale, this work show a microrobot can outperform 
large one in specific applications. In search and rescue 
missions, our robot have the potential to move through clutter 
environment that be not accessible to large terrestrial or 
aquatic robots.

Future study can explore several topic to further improve 
microrobot locomotive capability in complex environments. Due 
to the lack of control during the sinking process, the current robot 
may flip over in presence of disturbance such a surface wave 
and dynamic flow underwater. Further, the robot cannot return to 
land without a modest ramp. These limitation can be address 
by enable underwater swim and improve climb cap- 
ability in hybrid terrestrial-aquatic microrobots. To demonstrate 
swimming, future research could involve design meso-scale 
device for buoyancy control24, develop leg structure and 
associate gait to generate lift force in addition to thrust, and 
conduct dynamical analysis to investigate underwater stability. 
To climb steeper incline or to return to land without a ramp, 
future research can incorporate electrostatic adhesion13, gecko- 
inspire adhesives38, or impulsive jumping mechanisms24. 

Methods 
EWP fabrication. The robot foot pad be fabricate from a 5 µm copper sheet. First, 
the copper sheet be cut into the desire pattern (Fig. 3a) use diode-pulsed solid 
state (DPSS) laser. Next, vertical wall around the foot pad base be manually 
fold by 90° under a microscope (Fig. 3a). Then we solder the foot pad use 
51-gauge quadruple insulate wire and coat the device use Parylene C. The 
coatingprocess take ~12 h to deposit a uniform layer of 15 µm Parylene C. Finally, 
the foot pad be attach to a 70 µm thick, circular fiber glass (FR4) piece (Fig. 3a). 
The fiber glass connection piece prevents the foot pad from short to the robot 
chassis. 

Experimental setup for measure surface tension on the EWP. An EWP be 
mount on a capacitive force sensor and slowly push into water at ~0.2 mm s−1 

(Supplementary Fig. 1c). The net instantaneous force be measure by the force 
sensor. The red arrow in Supplementary Figure 1d, e indicate the difference 
between the minimum force and the net force once the EWP be completely sub- 
merged. This value represent the maximum upward force an EWP can generate. 
As show in Supplementary Figure 1d, e, the net upward force reduces by 30% 
when a 600 V signal be sent to the EWP. 

Experimental setup for robot locomotion demonstration. We built a 45 cm × 
45 cm × 8 cm aquarium to conduct robot locomotion experiment in terrestrial and 
aquatic environment (Supplementary Fig. 4a). The aquarium be fill with deio- 
nized water at a depth of 4 cm. A 5 cm tall, 6° ramp be place in the aquarium 
for the robot to walk from land to the water surface. An ~3 cm tall underwater 
obstacle be place in the robot’s swim path. A 4 cm tall, 3° ramp be place 
in the aquarium for the robot to climb out of water. Two camera be place 
above and on the side of the aquarium to take top and side view videos. The 
water in the aquarium be connect to electrical ground. The robot end-to-end 
locomotion experiment be conduct four time to demonstrate robot 
robustness and repeatability, and these trajectory be overlaid in Supplementary 
Figure 4b.
