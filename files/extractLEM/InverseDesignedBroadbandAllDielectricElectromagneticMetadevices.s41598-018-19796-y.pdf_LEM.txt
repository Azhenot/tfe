This paper present a platform combine an inverse electromagnetic design computational method 
with additive manufacturing to design and fabricate all-dielectric metadevices. As oppose to 
conventional flat metasurface-based device that be compose of resonant building block result 
in narrow band operation, the propose design approach creates non-resonant, broadband (Δλ/λ up 
to >50%) metadevices base on low-index dielectric materials. High-efficiency (transmission >60%), 
thin (≤2λ) metadevices capable of polarization splitting, beam bending, and focus be proposed. 
Experimental demonstration be perform at millimeter-wave frequency use 3D-printed devices. 
The propose platform can be readily apply to the design and fabrication of electromagnetic and 
photonic metadevices span microwave to optical frequencies. 

Conventional optical element that control the polarization, phase and amplitude of electromagnetic (EM) radi- 
ation such a lenses, polarizers, beamsplitters, and mirror be typically engineer at a scale much large than 
the wavelength. Within the last two decades, significant amount of research have be devote to understand 
light-matter interaction and design novel material and electromagnetic device with subwavelength features. 
Metamaterials, and more generally material compose of nanostructures with subwavelength feature size, have 
emerge a a viable platform to manipulate electromagnetic radiation in unconventional manners1,2. In particu- 
lar, photonic crystals3 and negative-index materials4 have be use to achieve sub-diffraction lensing5–7. More 
recently, metasurfaces8–10 have gain substantial interest due to their ability to perform optical functionality 
such a lensing11, holograms12,13 and beam shaping14 within an extremely thin layer. Although the ability to con- 
trol phase, amplitude and polarization use subwavelength-thick metasurfaces be a promising route towards 
building miniature optical devices, they suffer from several drawback prohibit their potential in replace 
conventional bulk optical elements. Initial metasurface design utilized plasmonic metal that exhibit high opti- 
cal loss and thus be of relatively low efficiency15. Lossy metal have be replace with high-index dielectric 
material like amorphous silicon16, but such metasurfaces often rely on Mie-type resonance that result in a nar- 
row wavelength range of operation14,17. 

Typical metasurface design start with identification of an optical resonator with a well-defined geometrical 
shape, such a triangles18, rectangles12,19, ellipses14 or V-antennas8,15. Phase information be then calculate for 
various geometrical parameter such a radius, width, orientation, etc.16. The number of degree of freedom in 
the design of these shape be very limited, which make it difficult to optimize both efficiency and bandwidth of 
metadevices while achieve full control of the polarization. Here, we use an inverse electromagnetic method20–26 
to design high-efficiency (>60%), broadband (Δλ/λ > 25%), dielectric-based thin (≤2λ) electromagnetic meta- 
device overcome the aforementioned limitations. Inverse design open up the entire design space to enable 
metadevices with increase and enhance functionalities. In order to demonstrate the feasibility of our inverse 
design approach, we use additive manufacturing to print a low-loss polymer into a complex geometrical pattern. 
We demonstrate the design, fabrication and characterization of wavelength-scale metadevices for bending, polar- 
ization splitting and focus of EM radiation at millimeter-wave frequencies. 

Design method 
First, we design two meta-gratings to behave a polarization beamsplitters for normally incident free-space radi- 
ation. As illustrate in Fig. 1A, those device bend parallel and perpendicular polarization to opposite diffrac- 
tion orders. We also design a meta-grating that bend both polarization to the same diffraction order (Fig. 1B).

Finally, we propose a ~λ-thick flat metalens (Fig. 1C) that convert a normally incident plane-wave into a focus- 
ing cylindrical wave. 

We use the objective-first algorithm22,27,28 in which the electromagnetic wave equation: 

E w Emin (1)E, 
2ε∇ × ∇ × −ε 

be treat a an optimization problem. This nonlinear optimization be decompose in two subproblems, where 
each variable (ε and E) be fix while linear optimization be perform on the other variable, alternatively and iter- 
atively, and where boundary electromagnetic field distribution reprenting the desire behavior be constraint of 
the model. There be no general method to find the optimum solution of (1), but the propose method converges 
most of the time towards solution that satisfy desire functionality with acceptable performance. An on-chip 
wavelength splitter22 and an optical diode29 have be successfully demonstrate use such inverse electromag- 
netic design approach.

desire optical functionality be define by a set of input and output condition at the boundary of the design 
space. A polarization splitter (A) be a grate that convert normally incident plane wave of parallel and 
perpendicular polarization into two different diffraction orders. A bending device (B) convert a normally 
incident plane wave into the same diffraction order. A flat metalens (C) be a device that convert a plane wave 
into a cylindrical wave converge to a chosen focal point.

Bending and polarization splitting be achieve use meta-gratings that convert an input plane wave to an 
output plane wave with a different diffraction order than m = 0, with periodic boundary condition along the 
x-axis. For metalenses, we aim to focus an input plane wave at a desire focal distance; hence, the output be chosen 
to be the field of a cylindrical wave center in the desire focal point, follow the equation (approximation at 
large r): 

E r E r ikr( ) exp (2)z z0 
1 
2= − 

where r be the distance from the focal point. Metalenses do not perform like a grating; therefore, we set the bound- 
ary condition of a perfectly match layer (PML) along the x direction. The design be two-dimensional, which 
corresponds to metadevices with infinite height along z. In practice, the fabricate device be ≈10λ thick. 

Experimental Section 
Design and fabrication. Inverse-designed metadevices be fabricate use additive manufacturing, com- 
monly call 3D-printing. This bottom-up approach allows the fabrication of very complex device with a large 
aspect ratio. Furthermore, 3D-printing be an incredibly scalable method, with resolution range from 100 nm to 
1 mm30–32, allow the fabrication of electromagnetic device for application from the visible to the millimeter- 
wave and microwave regimes33–36. Here, we demonstrate the propose device in the millimeter-wave regime 
(f > 30 GHz) use high impact polystyrene (HIPS) and a consumer grade 3D-printer base on fuse deposition

model for the fabrication. The material be chosen for it low cost and very low attenuation in the microwave to 
millimeter-wave region, with a loss-tangent measure to be δ < .tan 0 003 over the 26–38 GHz band. In this band, 
the real part of the dielectric constant of HIPS n2 3( 1 52)ε′ ≈ . ≈ . , which be then use a a constraint in our algo- 
rithm to design binary device make of air (ε = 1) and HIPS (ε = 2.3). Because of the low index, the phase differ- 
ence between the input and output be approximately proportional to the effective thickness of the polymer. 
Therefore, in order to allow a 2π phase shift between a part full of polymer and a part full of air, the device thick- 
ness need to obey:

which mean that the minimum device thickness be around 2λ. 

Measurement setup. To test the electromagnetic property of the devices, a vector network analyzer 
(VNA) generates the input signal that be transmit through a high-gain horn antenna place far away from 
the sample (distance > 100λ) in order to produce a plane wave perpendicularly incident on the input surface. 
The device be surround by radar absorb material to prevent reflection from the surroundings. For the 
three meta-gratings, the transmit power be measure in the far-field (>100λ) with a low-gain horn antenna 
a a function of the angle between −40° and 40° in 2° step and a a function of the frequency between 26 GHz 
(11.5 mm) and 38 GHz (7.9 mm). For the lenses, the output power be mapped along the axial plane on the right 
side of the device use a probe antenna attach to a X-Y stage. The measurement start around 1 cm to the right 
of the device due to technical limitation of the setup, which be the reason why the experimental intensity map 
be truncate when compare to the simulated maps.

Results 
Meta-gratings. First, we demonstrate a free-space polarization splitter. The propose metadevice (Fig. 2A) 
deflects a normal incident plane-wave polarize along y (parallel) and z (perpendicular) direction into m = +1 
and m = −1 diffraction order respectively with high efficiency and over a broad bandwidth. The width be chosen 
to be ~2λ to reach desire phase change a explain in the experimental section. The periodicity, L along y be 
determine by the deflection angle θ of the desire diffraction order m (here m = ±1 for all devices), follow the 
grate equation L msinθ λ= . We design and optimize the metadevice for an operation frequency of 33 GHz 
(free space wavelength of λ = 9.1 mm) and a deflection angle of θ = ±30°, for which L = 1.8 cm. The inverse-de- 
sign algorithm generates a binary refractive-index distribution of dielectric and air that be then print with 
dimension of 2 cm × 7.2 cm × 8 cm. A photograph of the 3D-printed metadevice be show next to the comput- 
er-generated pattern in Fig. 2A, which show the high fidelity of the 3D-printing method. 

We measure the far-field angular transmission through the fabricate metadevice to verify the predict polariza- 
tion splitting behavior. Figure 2B plot the simulated and measure power distribution at 33 GHz. We observe that a 
plane wave with parallel polarization be bent at an angle θ = +30°, whereas the perpendicular polarization be deflect 
with an angle of θ = −30°. The total power transmit by the metadevice at 33 GHz be measure to be 76% for the 
parallel polarization and 54% for the perpendicular polarization, which be low than the simulated value of 90%. The 
discrepancy be likely due to structure imperfection in the fabricate devices, the finite number of period in the print 
structure a well a an imperfect plane-wave input. The rejection ratio, define a the ratio between the peak intensity 
and the maximum intensity outside the main peak, be experimentally found to be 5.2 dB and 7.0 dB for the parallel and 
perpendicular polarizations, respectively, which be close to the simulated value of 6.6 dB and 9.3 dB, respectively. 

We perform full-field electromagnetic simulation to calculate the electromagnetic property of the meta- 
device. We plot the vertical fields, i.e. Hz for parallel polarization (Fig. 2C) and Ez for perpendicular polarization 
(Fig. 2D), at 33 GHz. The spatial field distribution provide a clear picture of how the EM wave propagate inside 
the metadevice. In metasurfaces base on resonant geometric elements, the phase change be due to the interaction 
of the incoming plane-wave to a strong Mie resonance mode14, which typically result in a relatively narrowband 
operation. Here, the phase change do not stem from the interaction with a specific resonant mode, but rather 
due to light propagation inside the dielectric structure, with a large phase shift of 6π in a part fill with dielec- 
tric (ε = 2.3) than a 4π shift in a part mostly void (ε = 1.0). The polarization splitting be a result of the different 
phase-change response of the device to different polarization owe to it complex dielectric shape. 

Figure 4. Comparison between the performance of the inverse-designed device (A to C) and a blaze grate 
(D to F) optimize to bend electromagnetic radiation by 30° independently of the polarization. The simulated 
far-field intensity be represent for angle from −80° to 80° and for frequency from 26 GHz to 38 GHz for 
perpendicular (B,E) and parallel (C,F) polarizations. As can be seen, the inverse-designed metadevice transmits 
a much low power to undesired grate order (23% for perpendicular polarization and 18% for parallel 
polarization) than the blaze grate (47% for perpendicular polarization and 51% for parallel polarization). 
Simulated rejection ratio at 33 GHz be 10.1 dB and 12.4 dB for the inverse-designed bending device, compare 
to 6.6 dB and 3.8 dB for the triangular grate for perpendicular and parallel polarization respectively.

Although we choose 33 GHz to be the frequency to optimize for high efficiency in our inverse-design algorithm, 
we observe broad operation bandwidth that span a range of frequency from 27 to 38 GHz, for a relative bandwidth 
Δλ/λ ≈ 33%, which be enable by the inverse-design method favor non-resonant dielectric structures. Figure 2 plot 
simulated (E,F) and measure (G,H) power transmit in the far-field a a function of the angle and the frequency for 
parallel (E,G) and perpendicular (F,H) polarizations. The simulation and measurement agree relatively well. 

In order to demonstrate the versatility and flexibility of the inverse-design approach, we design and fabricate 
two additional metadevices that bend the millimeter-waves. The first one be a polarization splitter with a bending

angle of +/−15° (Fig. 3A). Similar to the 30° splitter, this device present a gradient of dielectric fill fraction along 
the y-direction with a large periodicity (L = 3.5 cm) in order to favor a small bending angle. The simulated and 
measure angular far-field transmit power be plot for both polarization at 33 GHz in Fig. 3B. The measure 
rejection ratio for the 15° splitter be 8.2 dB and 10.6 dB for parallel and perpendicular polarization respectively. 
The device have a dielectric fill fraction with a similar profile to that of a bending device towards the +15° dif- 
fraction order. The polarization splitting be due to the couple of perpendicular polarization to a resonant wave 
propagate along the y-direction inside the device, which revers the bending direction. This explains the low 
bandwidth of the device for perpendicular polarization, from 31 to 37 GHz (a relative bandwidth of 18%), compare 
to a very large bandwidth for the bending behavior of parallel polarization, from 22 to 44 GHz (data not shown). The 
designs, simulated field and broadband far-field data be show in Figure S1 in the supplementary information. 

In addition to polarization beam-splitter, we also design and realize a polarization-independent bending 
device (Fig. 3C) which bend both polarization to the same diffraction order. Simulations and experimental 
result of the far-field power at 33 GHz be show in Fig. 3D, show very good agreement between the theory 
and experiment. The designs, simulated field and broadband far-field data be show in Figure S2. Although 
polarization-independent bending of EM radiation can be achieve with a triangular blaze grate (Fig. 4D), 
such grating deflect significant amount of power to high diffraction orders, a show in Fig. 4E,F. On average 
from 26 to 38 GHz, the inverse-designed device reduces the amount of power sent into undesired diffraction 
order by a factor of 2.8 for parallel polarization and 2.0 for perpendicular polarization when compare to a 
blaze grate of similar thickness, which can be see on the far-field power in Fig. 4B,C. The bending to the first 
diffraction order extends to 44 GHz with high efficiency (data not shown), which corresponds to a relative band- 
width of 55%, but significant power be diffract to high order for large frequencies. 

Metalenses. Next, we propose and design flat metalenses use the inverse-design algorithm and boundary 
condition a illustrate in Fig. 1B. We design and fabricate two different metalenses with focal length of 
2λ and 15λ, respectively. Both lens be optimize and scale for operation around 38 GHz (λ = 7.9 mm). The 
first metalens be 1.5-cm wide, 10-cm long, the second be 2.5-cm wide and 15-cm long and both be 10-cm tall. A 
picture of each device be show with the computer-generated design in Fig. 5. 

The electromagnetic behavior of both device be simulated with a perpendicularly-polarized incoming plane 
wave. The electric-field intensity profile for the short-range and long-range metalenses be plot in Fig. 5A,B, 
respectively. We also perform a 2D scan of the transmit power behind the metalenses use a millimeter-wave 
probe antenna position at z = 5 cm. The measure spatial intensity distribution in the x-y plane for the short-range 
and long-range lens be provide in Fig. 5C,D, respectively. The simulated and measure spatial-intensity dis- 
tributions closely match. As expected, the first device focus EM radiation 1.5 cm (~2λ) away from the device 
whereas the second device’s focal point be locate 12 cm (~15λ) away. The full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) 
of the focus radiation for both device be 0.5 cm and 1.1 cm a show in Fig. 5E,F, respectively, correspond 
to practical numerical aperture (NAs) of 0.8 and 0.36 respectively, close to the theoretical value of 0.82 and 0.53, 
respectively. The propose device also show broadband focus behavior from 28 GHz to 40 GHz. We provide the 
measure and simulated intensity profile for operation at 30 GHz in Figure S3. 

Conclusion 
We have present a platform combine an inverse electromagnetic design algorithm with additive manufacturing 
for the design and fabrication of novel millimeter-wave metadevices. The propose methodology can be generalize 
to any photonic device where the desire electromagnetic behavior can be define in term of input and output field 
distributions. Although we design and demonstrate metadevices in the millimeter-wave region, due to the scalabil- 
ity of Maxwell’s equations, similar device can be design to operate in any wavelength from visible to microwave 
frequency provide that low-loss dielectric material can be additively fabricate with subwavelength feature sizes. 
The present platform address the need for rapid versatile design and prototyping of compact, low-cost, low-loss, 
and broadband component that can then be easily integrate into complex electromagnetic systems.
