Superconductivity in metallic nanowires be strongly influence by fluctuation of the superconducting order parameter1. Thermally activate phase slip (TAPS) be dominant2 near 
the superconducting transition temperature, Tc. Well below Tc the 
phase of a homogeneous superconducting wire can slip by 2π due 
to quantum tunnelling, a process analogous to Cooper-pair tun- 
nelling in Josephson junctions3. The notion of coherent phase slip 
in nanowires propose by Mooij and Nazarov4 be support by 
experiment by Astafiev et al.5 with wire make of nominally homo- 
geneous superconducting material. Such CQPS, carry by tun- 
nelling of magnetic fluxons across a superconducting wire, enable 
device base on quantum interference effects, opening a route 
towards a wide range of quantum device dual to those that can be 
implement with Josephson junctions4,6,7. 

Quantum interference of Cooper pair in flux-based supercon- 
ducting quantum interference device (SQUIDs) be demonstrate 
soon after the discovery of the Josephson effect8 and have since 
become a cornerstone of superconducting electronics. Another cor- 
nerstone be the lock of the phase across the Josephson junction 
to an external microwave field, result in Shapiro step at quan- 
tized voltages9. This effect be use in high-frequency amplifier and 
detectors, and a the basis for the quantum voltage standard, which 
today underpins the electronics industry10. The main motivation 
for study CQPS and dual superconducting device have so far 
be the promise of a robust quantum current standard base on 
so-called dual Shapiro steps4,11–13, complementary to the Josephson 
voltage standard. Although this particular goal have not yet be 
achieved, the experimental observation of CQPS in superconduct- 
ing nanowires5 have advanced the understand of one-dimensional 
superconductivity and coherence in disorder superconductors14,15 
to the level where dual superconducting electronics have now become 
a possibility. 

Conventional d.c. SQUIDs can be view a a specific imple- 
mentation of the Aharonov–Bohm (AB) effect16, where interference 
of the wavefunction of a move charge particle occurs when it 
encircles a flux (Fig. 1a). In contrast, the Aharonov–Casher (AC) 
effect, where the interference of fluxon trajectory occurs around a 
static charge17, be dual to the AB effect. The AC effect have previously 

be observe in a variety of particle and solid-state systems18–21 
and in Josephson junction arrays22–26. Here we demonstrate the 
AC effect in a nominally continuous superconductor. Our device 
comprises two series CQPS junction in which we achieve charge- 
control interference of fluxon tunnel in a device exactly dual 
to the SQUID. We call this device the charge quantum interference 
device (CQUID). This coherent charge-sensitive interferometer 
demonstrates the potential of CQPS device previously explore 
only through the approximate4 self-duality of Josephson junction 
circuits12,22,27–31. Such array of Josephson junction have be show 
to be a challenge complementary route towards a quantum cur- 
rent standard base on quantum phase slips32. 

In the CQUID, schematically show in Fig. 1b, flux coherently 
tunnel across two narrow constriction in a superconducting 
wire that we conclude be continuous in the superconducting order 
parameter (see evidence in Supplementary Information). The two 
constrictions, of size ~30nm × 50 nm, be connect in series and 
make out of a continuous ~3.3-nm-thick NbN film. These con- 
strictions provide well-defined point with an increase phase slip 
amplitude15. The wider, ~100 nm, region (‘island’) between the con- 
strictions be couple through the capacitance Cg to a gate electrode. 
The island be make large enough to prohibit phase slips, but small 
enough to minimize it self-capacitance shunt the CQUID. Such 
a shunt capacitance would reduce the impedance and renormalize 
the phase-slip amplitude of the device. 

The charge induced by the gate potential Vg control the interfer- 
ence of the phase-slip amplitudes, with a period of 2e, in much the 
same way a the effective Josephson energy in the SQUID be tune 
by an external magnetic flux, with a period of Φ0, the flux quantum. 
Each interferometer becomes indistinguishable from it dual coun- 
terpart by the dual single-particle exchange (Cooper pair or fluxon) 
with the follow additional substitutions: current (Cooper-pair 
flow) ↔ voltage (flux flow), charge ↔ magnetic flux, Josephson 
energy ↔ phase-slip energy and insulator ↔ superconductor4. This 
also implies that the lack of flux quantization in the SQUID trans- 
lates to the absence of charge quantization in the dual device, and 
the induced charge on the island (normalized to 2e) precisely fol- 
low q = CgVg/2e.

The demonstration of coherent quantum phase slip (CQPS) in disorder superconductors have open up a new route towards 
explore the fundamental charge–phase duality in superconductors, with the promise of device with new functionality and 
a robust quantum current standard base on CQPS. Here we demonstrate a device that integrates several CQPS junctions: the 
charge quantum interference device. The charge quantum interference device becomes the dual of the well-known supercon- 
ducting quantum interference device, and be a manifestation of the Aharonov–Casher effect in a continuous superconducting 
system devoid of dielectric barriers.

In much the same way a the insulator in a superconductor– 
insulator–superconductor (SIS) junction provide a tunnel barrier 
for Cooper pair (but not to fluxons), a continuous superconduc- 
tor provide a tunnel barrier for fluxons (but not for Cooper pairs). 
Observation of CQPS require a low barrier for flux tunnel 
across the superconductor, realize by a high kinetic inductance. 
This be achieve in highly disorder superconducting film close 
to the superconductor–insulator transition (SIT)14,15. The same 
magnitude of the phase-slip amplitude can be realize in a wider 
constriction for superconductors close to the SIT, ease fabrication 
requirement and increase reproducibility due to the exponen- 
tial dependence of phase-slip amplitude on constriction width14. 
By use atomic layer deposition (ALD)-grown NbN films33–35, we 
can now controllably make high-quality film that be very close to 
the SIT, enable fabrication of multiple very similar CQPS con- 
strictions in the same device use conventional nanofabrication 
techniques. We have verify the continuity of the superconduct- 
ing order parameter in our film in independent measurement 
on microbridges. For the CQUID device present here we also 
confirm that the phase-slip energy in the CQUID persists up to 
magnetic field much large than would be possible for a small- 
area Josephson junction, confirm that our CQPS junction be 
indeed constriction in a continuous film. We refer the reader to the 
Supplementary Information for further details. 

Direct current (d.c.) transport measurement be essential for the 
realization of a current standard base on CQPS4,13,31,36–38; however, 
these be often complicate by incoherent effect such a Coulomb 
blockade and dissipation. To demonstrate CQPS interference in the 
CQUID we instead follow the methodology of previous studies5,14,15 
and use microwave spectroscopy, which provide a tool for mea- 
suring the tunnel energy in quantum systems. In particular, the 
Cooper pair box connect to a reservoir via a SQUID allows one to 
control and measure the Cooper-pair tunnel energy (Josephson 
energy) of the SQUID39. We develop an exact dual measurement 
circuit: the CQUID be implement in a loop with a high but finite 
inductance. The result flux state provide a degree of freedom 
orthogonal to the energy spectrum of the CQUID and the fluxon 
flow due to CQPS. The circuit allows u to directly measure the 

tunnel energy of the CQUID (tunnelling energy of fluxons); see 
Supplementary Information for details. In addition, a high-imped- 
ance environment for flux tunnel be achieve by embed the 
loop in a λ/2 superconducting resonator, make from the same NbN 
film. The resonator allows for direct readout of the energy spectrum 
of the device by dispersive microwave spectroscopy5,14,15. 

The reduce Hamiltonian describe our device in the flux basis 
be H = − ELσz/2 − Esσx/2 (refs 6,40), where σi be the Pauli matrices, 

ν= ∣ ∣E h tot be the couple energy due to the phase-slip ampli- 
tude νtot and EL = 2IpδΦ be the inductive energy due to the persis- 
tent current Ip = Φ0/2Lk in the loop with kinetic inductance Lk and 
δΦ = Φext − (N + 1/2)Φ0. N be the number of magnetic flux quantum Φ0 
in the loop subject to a magnetic flux Φext tune by an external sole- 
noid. The energy difference between the ground and the first excite 
state of the diagonalize Hamiltonian be δΦΔ = + ∕E I E((2 ) )p

When introduce two discrete arbitrary phase-slip junction in

the ring becomes

where we use νtot = ν1 + ν2ei2πq (refs 22,30,41). ν1 and ν2 be the bare phase- 
slip amplitude for the two junctions, respectively. Importantly, the 
phase-slip rate depends only on the gate-induced charge. This be a 
direct result of the non-quantized charge, and Cooper pair be not 
localize on the island. The expect 2e-periodic oscillation due 
to the induced charge on the island be a result of the phase-slip 
amplitude interference across the two junctions. We note that equa- 
tion (1) applies to both CQPS and Josephson junction chains, and 
a distinction of the underlie physic could not be base solely on 
equation (1). We refer the reader to our Supplementary Information 
for a thorough discussion on the nature and homogeneity of our 
CQPS junctions. 

The case of symmetric phase slip amplitude (ν1 = ν2) reduces for 
δΦ = 0 to πΔ ∝ ∣ ∣E qcos , in exact duality to the flux-modulated criti- 
cal current of a magnetic SQUID with two identical Josephson junc- 
tions. For certain value of q we would thus expect the transition

energy to be suppress to zero. For largely dissimilar phase-slip 
amplitude (ν ν≫1 2), or in the presence of non-trivial flux bias 
δΦ ≠ nΦ0 (where n be an integer number), the variation in Δ E due 
to the induced charge instead resembles a sinusoidal dependence, 
a sketch in Fig. 1c. We now proceed to the measurement of our 
device, which be in very good agreement with these expectations. 

Figure 2a,b show the measure energy level spectroscopy data 
a a function of magnetic flux for two different apply gate voltages. 
From the asymptotically linear dependence of the energy level tran- 
sitions on magnetic flux, we extract Ip = 30 nA and Lk = 33 nH, corre- 
sponding to the inductance per square of the NbN film L◻ = 1.35 nH. 
Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer (BCS) theory underestimate Lk near 
the SIT42. From the normal state per square resistance R◻ = 2.3 kΩ 
measure above Tc, we get L◻ = ħR◻/(π Δ bcs) = 0.67 nH for Tc = 4.7 K, 
different by a factor of two. Figure 2c show the full response of 
the energy level due to the induced charge on the island at δΦ = 0. 
Notably, for each gate voltage we find two spectroscopic line that 
deviate in phase from each other in gate voltage. These line be 
shift in charge by exactly half-a-period, which be explain by 
charge interference (AC effect) and the presence of non-equilibrium 
quasiparticles. A change in the number of non-equilibrium quasi- 
particle (Nqp) present on the island will chan ge the overall island 
charge by 1e and the AC phase by π . Depending on the charge num- 
ber parity of the island43,44, we observe two different parity band 
accord to ν ν ν= + − π( 1) eN i qtot 1 2 

2qp . This be similar to what have be 
observe in charge qubits45. In the complex-amplitude representa- 
tion of the phase-slip amplitude of equation (1) show in Fig. 2e, 
such parity shift result in two phase-slip amplitude rotate by 
exactly π . The two band be maximally separate at an induced 
island charge of precisely q = ne, where n be an integer. 

The oscillation provide compelling evidence for flux interfer- 
ence, the fundamental mechanism on which the CQUID be based, 
and be a demonstration of the AC effect in a solid-state system 

without insulate tunnel barriers18,22. This be further show by 
Fig. 2d, show the fit of the data in Fig. 2c to equation (1). We 
extract the two phase-slip amplitude ν1 = 9.2 GHz and ν2 = 3.3 GHz. 
This strong similarity in phase-slip amplitude allows u to accu- 
rately compare the CQUID operation with theoretical predictions. 

We may express the phase-slip energy of a single constriction 
in term of the dimensionless conductance gξ = Rq/Rξ of a wire seg- 
ment of length ξ, where Rq = h/4e2 be the superconducting resistance 
quantum1: Es = (Δ gξ) exp(− agξ). Here the dimensionless parameter6,46 
a ≈ 0.3 be only weakly dependent on the environment of the phase- 
slip junction. For the measure phase-slip amplitude of 3.3 GHz and 
9.2 GHz and for junction dimension of 46 nm × 30 nm and 
39 nm × 30 nm, respectively, we obtain a ≈ 0.29, in excellent agree- 
ment with the observe dimension and the expect value for a. 

As we move the flux bias away from the degeneracy point we 
expect that the variation in transition energy with induced charge 
on the island be suppressed. In Fig. 3a we show the difference in tran- 
sition energy at the maximum and minimum of equation (1) with 
respect to the gate-induced charge q a a function of flux detuning 
δΦ0, and in Fig. 3b we show the measure and expect deviation 
of equation (1) from a pure sinusoidal dependence of Δ E on q. Both 
data set be in exceptionally good agreement with equation (1). The 
transition linewidth be δE/h = 200 MHz in the weak-drive limit for 
both the even and odd parity modes, and their occupation probabil- 
ities be the same (Fig. 3c). This linewidth be similar to that obtain 
in previous experiment where CQPS have be studied5,14,15. 

The origin of the parity fluctuation can be understood by con- 
sidering the nature of the junction in the device. We may intro- 
duce an arbitrary number of quasiparticle on the CQUID island 
without incur any additional electrostatic energy. Instead, the 
normal-state resistance determines the time that a non-equilibrium 
quasiparticle spends on the island (in the absence of recombina- 
tion, which be parity-conserving). We may estimate the shortest

quasiparticle residence time on the island a τqp ≈ e2R◻Vρ ≈ 2 ns, 
where ρ = 3.8 × 1047 J−1 m−3 (ref. 47) be the density of state in NbN 
at the Fermi energy and V ≈ 10−22 m3 be the volume of the island. 
Thus, in the presence of non-equilibrium quasiparticle in the 
leads, we expect to have a rapidly fluctuate number of quasipar- 
ticles Nqp on the CQUID island, lead to the observe behaviour 
of equal probability for the two parity over the much longer 
measurement timescale. 

The quasiparticle dwell time be comparable to the coherence time 
τ ≃ 5 n we observe in our time-averaged measurements, extract 
from the transition linewidth. 

In addition to parity fluctuations, we observe large fractional 
charge jump on a timescale of ~1 hour due to charge fluctuators 
in the surround dielectrics, a clear indication that offset charge 
fluctuation in long wire will affect the coherence and phase-slip 
amplitudes, analogous to what have be found for Josephson junc- 
tion chains32,48. 

We have demonstrate control of the interference of coherent 
quantum phase-slip amplitude in a charge quantum interference 
device comprise of two CQPS junctions. The excellent agreement 
with theory and large response due to the induced island charge 
be compelling evidence for the AC effect in a continuous highly 
disorder superconducting system. This demonstration of dual- 
ity and the CQUID be an important step towards a future quantum 
current standard base on CQPS; however, the observe strong 
quasiparticle poison may provide an additional obstacle towards 
it realization. Quasiparticle poison may lead to a spurious qua- 
siparticle current and perturbation to the phase lock of Bloch 
oscillations48. Quasiparticle poison be thus an engineering chal- 
lenge that need to be address use quasiparticle trap and 
elimination techniques. By place the coherent CQUID in a high- 

impedance environment for d.c. measurement it could be use a a 
route towards a CQPS-based current standard.

Fig. 3 | Fit to theory and parity state population. a, The measure 
maximum difference in transition frequency, obtain at induced gate 
charge of 0 and 1e, respectively, a a function of flux detuning from the 
degeneracy point δΦ = 0. Error bar be observe transition linewidths. 
The red solid line be a fit to equation (1). b, The deviation of the two low 
mode from a pure sinusoidal gate dependence of Es(q). The sharp kink be 
due to the couple to the second resonance mode. Error bar indicate 95% 
confidence bound to the fit of peak position in Fig. 2c. c, Two-tone phase 
response for two induced gate charge show equal population of the 
two parity states. Differences in high- and low-frequency peak amplitude 
be due to different couple strength to the resonator mode.

Methods 
Thin-film technology. The NbN thin film be deposit on undoped Si(100) 
by plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD). An OpAL ALD system 
from Oxford Instruments Plasma Technology upgraded with a remote plasma 
source (ICP) and a nitrogen glove box be used. The metal–organic compound 
(tertbutylimido)-tris (diethylamino)-niobium (TBTDEN) and an hydrogen plasma 
be apply a precursors. The NbN ALD process be base on a self-limiting 
surface reaction principle with a well-controlled layer growth of 0.46 Å per cycle. 
Thus, for the CQUID experiments, superconducting NbN layer of only 3.3 nm 
thickness be prepared within an ALD process of 72 cycles. The prepared 
layer have a granular film structure. More detail be give in ref 33,35 and the 
Supplementary Material. The precise adjustment of chemical composition, crystal 
structure and film thickness allows production of NbN layer with the above- 
report high value of Tc, R◻ and L◻, which be essential for realize the CQUID. 

Device fabrication. To pattern the CQUID device we use electron beam (e-beam) 
lithography. A 50 nm layer of the negative e-beam resist hydrogen silsesquioxane 
(HSQ) be expose to a 50 keV beam in a JEOL JBX-5500ZD e-beam lithography 
system. The resonator, the loop and the islands, a well a the gate electrodes, 
be expose to a dose of 900 μ C cm−2 while the constriction be define by dos 
between 8.6 mC cm−2 and 31.5 mC cm−2. This give constriction width in the 
range 50–70 nm. After the HSQ development (MicroChemicals AZ 726 MIF), 
the coplanar ground-planes and the microwave and bias gate pad be define by 
optical lithography use a standard lift-off technique. The ground plane and 
contact pad be make by thermal evaporation of a 5 nm titanium (Ti) adhesion 
layer and an 80 nm gold (Au) layer in a Plassys MEB 550 S evaporator. During this 
step, the resonator and the loop with constriction be protect by the optical 
resist. After lift-off, the resonator and the loop with constrictions, island and 
gate be define in the NbN film by reactive ion etch (RIE) use an Oxford 

Instruments Plasmalab 80 Plus. The HSQ act a a hard mask against the reactant 
fluorine (CF4:Ar, 10:1) in the RIE process, which etches the NbN much faster than 
the HSQ. All Au-covered area be protect since Au be inert against fluorine RIE. 
Test structure for d.c. measurement be co-fabricated on the same films, from 
which we extract value for Tc and R◻ measure just above Tc. 

Measurements. Samples be mount in a dilution refrigerator with a base 
temperature of 20 mK, essential for maximize the coherence of the device and 
minimize the effect of thermally activate phase slips. Samples be shield 
by both superconducting and Cryoperm shield to minimize noise in the flux 
thread the loops. Heavily attenuate coaxial line be use for microwave 
excitation and the transmit signal be pass through two cryogenic isolators 
before be amplify by a cryogenic high-electron-mobility transistor amplifier 
at 4 K. The gate voltage be apply through low-pass filter Thermocoax 
lines, with additional low-pass filter at the mix chamber stage. The 
measure gate period (2e) at the sample be 60.1 mV, give an effective 
gate capacitance of 5 aF, in good agreement with finite-element electrostatic 
calculation of the total capacitance a see by the island of 20 aF, which also 
include the contribution from the gate capacitance. The dispersive readout of 
the resonator be perform by apply a weak probe tone at the fundamental 
resonance frequency of 3.74 GHz that monitor the phase shift of the resonator 
(using a vector network analyser) in response to a strong tone that induces 
transition in the loop’s energy spectrum. The particular loop present in this 
manuscript be identify by it flux periodicity, match to the design loop 
area. This particular sample have six loop with work constrictions, allow 
for easy identification.
