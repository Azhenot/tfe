Abstract. We apply machine learn to data set from shear laboratory 

experiments, with the goal of identify hidden signal that precede earth- 

quakes. Here we show that by listen to the acoustic signal emit by a 

laboratory fault, machine learn can predict the time remain before it 

fails with great accuracy. These prediction be base solely on the instan- 

taneous physical characteristic of the acoustical signal, and do not make use 

of it history. Surprisingly, machine learn identifies a signal emit from 

the fault zone previously thought to be low-amplitude noise that enables fail- 

ure forecasting throughout the laboratory quake cycle. We infer that this sig- 

nal originates from continuous grain motion of the fault gouge a the fault 

block displace. We posit that apply this approach to continuous seismic 

data may lead to significant advance in identify currently unknown sig- 

nals, in provide new insight into fault physics, and in place bound on 

fault failure times. 

Keypoints: 

• Machine learn appear to discern the frictional state when apply to 

laboratory seismic data record during a shear experiment 

• Machine learn us statistical characteristic of the record seismic 

signal to accurately predict slip failure time 

• The work have import to identify new geophysical signal of all kind 

and potentially to earthquake forecasting, and be applicable to potentially

1. Introduction 

A classical approach to determine that an earthquake may be loom be base on 

the inter-event time (recurrence interval) for characteristic earthquakes, earthquake that 

repeat periodically [Schwartz and Coppersmith [1984]]. For instance, analysis of turbidite 

stratigraphy deposit during successive earthquake date back 10,000 year suggests 

the Cascadia subduction zone be ripe for a megaquake [Goldfinger et al. [2017]]. The idea 

behind characteristic, repeat earthquake be the basis of the well-known Parkfield 

prediction base strictly on seismic data. Similar earthquake occur between 1857 

and 1966 suggest a recurrence interval of 21.9±3.1 year and thus an earthquake be 

expect between 1988-1993 [Bakun and Lindh [1985]], but ultimately take place in 2004. 

With this approach, a earthquake recurrence be not constant for a give fault, event oc- 

currence can only be infer within large error bounds. Over the last 15 years, there have 

be renew hope that progress can be make regard forecasting owe to tremendous 

advance in instrumentation quality and density. These advance have lead to excite 

discovery of previously unidentified slip process that include slow slip [Melbourne and 

Webb [2003]], Low Frequency Earthquakes and Earth tremor [Shelly et al. [2007]; Obara 

[2002]; Brown et al. [2009]] that occur deep in faults. These discovery inform a new 

understand of fault slip and may well lead to advance in forecasting impend fault 

failure if the couple of deep fault to the seismogenic zone can be unraveled. The 

advance in instrumentation sensitivity and density also provide new mean to record 

small event that may be precursors. Acoustic/seismic precursor to failure appear to 

be a nearly universal phenomenon in materials. For instance, it be well establish that

failure in granular material [Michlmayr et al. [2013]] and in avalanche [Pradhan et al. 

[2006]] be frequently accompany by impulsive acoustic/seismic precursors, many of them 

very small. Precursors be also routinely observe in brittle failure of a spectrum of in- 

dustrial [Huang et al. [1998]] and Earth material [Schubnel et al. [2013]; Jaeger et al. 

[2007]]. Precursors be observe in laboratory fault [Johnson et al. [2013]; W. Goebel 

et al. [2013]] and be widely but not systematically observe precede earthquake [Bou- 

chon et al. [2013, 2016]; McGuire et al. [2015]; Mignan [2014]; Wyss and Booth [1997]; 

Geller [1997]]. Seismic swarm activity which exhibit very different statistical character- 

istics than classical impulsive precursor may or may not precede large earthquake but 

can mask classical precursor (e.g., Ishibashi [1988]). The International Commission on 

Earthquake Forecasting for Civil Protection conclude in 2011 there be “considerable 

room for methodological improvement in this type of [precursor-based failure forecast- 

ing] research” [International Commission on Earthquake Forecasting for Civil Protection, 

2011: Jordan et al. [2011]]. The commission also conclude that publish result may 

be bias toward positive observations. We hypothesize that precursor be a manifesta- 

tion of critical stress condition precede shear failure. We posit that seismic precursor 

magnitude can be very small and thus frequently go unrecorded or unidentified. As 

instrumentation improves, precursor may ultimately be found to exist for most or all 

earthquake [Delorey et al. [2017]]. Furthermore, it be plausible that other signal exist 

that presage failure. 

2. Materials and Methods 

Here we apply recent advance in machine learn to data from a well characterize 

laboratory system [Johnson et al. [2013]; Marone [1998]; Niemeijer et al. [2010]; Scuderi

et al. [2014]]. Our laboratory system be a two-fault configuration that contains fault 

gouge material submit to double direct shear (see text S1, Fig. S1). The drive 

piston displaces at a very constant velocity of 5 microns/sec during the inter-event time, 

and accelerates briefly during slip with a calibrate accuracy of 0.1 micron/sec. An 

accelerometer record the acoustic emission (AE) emanate from the shear layers. 

The shear stress impose by the drive block be also monitor (Figs. 1, 2a, S1), a well 

a other physical parameter such a the shear rate, gouge layer thickness, friction and 

the apply load [Johnson et al. [2013]; Marone [1998]; Niemeijer et al. [2010]]. The steel 

block be extremely stiff (order 160 GPa) so the deformation take place largely in the 

gouge. Following a stick-slip frictional failure (laboratory earthquake), the shear block 

displaces while the gouge material simultaneously dilates and strengthens, a manifest 

by increase shear stress (Figs. 1a, S1) and friction. As the material approach failure, 

it exhibit characteristic of a critical stress regime, include many small shear failure 

that emit impulsive AEs [Johnson et al. [2013]]. This unstable state concludes with a 

laboratory earthquake, in which the shear block rapidly displaces, the friction and 

shear stress decrease precipitously due to the gouge failure (Fig. S1, top), and the gouge 

layer simultaneously compact. Under a broad range of load and shear velocity conditions, 

the apparatus stick-slips quasi-periodically for hundred of stress cycle during a single 

experiment [Marone [1998]; Niemeijer et al. [2010]], and in general follow prediction from 

rate and state friction [e.g., Marone [1998]]. The rate of impulsive precursor accelerates a 

failure approach [Johnson et al. [2013]], suggest that upcoming laboratory earthquake 

timing could be predicted. In this work, we ask: can the failure time of an upcoming

laboratory earthquake be predict use characteristic of only the continuously record 

acoustic signal? 

Our goal be to predict the time remain before the next failure (Fig. 1a, bottom) 

use only local, move time window of the AE data (Fig. 1b, top). We apply a 

machine learn technique, the random forest (RF) [Breiman [2001]; Pedregosa et al. 

[2011]; Louppe et al. [2013]], to the continuous acoustic time series data record from 

the fault (see Fig. 1 and text S2, S3). The RF model be an average over a set of decision 

tree (Fig. 1c). Each decision tree predicts the time remain before the next failure 

use a sequence of decision base on statistical feature derive from the time windows. 

Figure 1a, top, show the laboratory shear stress exhibit multiple failure event during 

an experiment. 

From each time window, we compute a set of approximately 100 potentially relevant 

statistical feature (e.g. mean, variance, kurtosis, autocorrelation, etc.). The most useful 

feature be then select recursively [Gregorutti et al. [2017]]. The RF us these select 

feature to predict the time remain before the next failure (text S4). Fig. 1b show 

four of these feature on the same time scale a in Fig. 1a, through multiple failure 

cycles. Some feature be sensitive to change in signal characteristic early in time during 

the stress cycle, just follow a laboratory earthquake. All feature show be strongly 

sensitive to signal characteristic just precede failure, a the system approach shear- 

stress criticality. 

3. Results 

Fig. 1d and 2 show failure prediction on test data-the acoustic signal correspond 

to a sequence of slip event the model have never seen. We emphasize that there be no past

or future information consider when make a prediction (blue curve): each prediction 

us only the information within one single time window of the acoustic signal. Thus, 

by listen to the acoustic signal currently emit by the system, we predict the time 

remain before it fails-a ‘now’ prediction base on the instantaneous physical charac- 

teristics of the system that do not make use of it history. We quantify the accuracy of 

our model use R2, the coefficient of determination. 

A näıve model base exclusively on the periodicity of the event (average inter-event 

time) only achieves an R2 performance of 0.3 (See Fig. S2). In comparison, the time 

to failure prediction from the RF model be highly accurate, with an R2 value of 0.89. 

Surprisingly, the RF model accurately predicts failure not only when failure be imminent, 

but throughout the entire laboratory earthquake cycle, demonstrate that the system 

continuously progress towards failure. This be unexpected, a impulsive precursor be 

only observe while the system be in a critical stress state. We find that statistic quanti- 

fying the signal amplitude distribution (e.g. it variance and high order moments) be 

highly effective at forecasting failure. The variance, which characterizes overall signal am- 

plitude fluctuation, be the strong single feature early in time (Fig. 1b). As the system 

nears failure, other outlier statistic such a the kurtosis and threshold become predictive 

a well. These outlier statistic be respond to the impulsive precursor AE (Fig. 3c) 

typically observe a a material approach failure [Huang et al. [1998]], include those 

under shear condition in the laboratory [Johnson et al. [2013]] and in Earth [Bouchon 

et al. [2013, 2016]; Wyss and Booth [1997]]. These signal be due to small, observable 

shear failure within the gouge immediately precede the laboratory earthquake [Johnson 

et al. [2013]].

Our machine learn analysis provide new insight into the slip physics. Specifically, 

the AE signal occur long before failure be previously assume to be noise and thus 

overlooked, illustrate human bias that ML can overcome [Johnson et al. [2013]]. This 

signal bear resemblance to non-volcanic tremor [Shelly et al. [2007]; Obara [2002]; Brown 

et al. [2009]] associate with slow slip [Rogers and Dragert [2003]; Rubinstein et al. [2009]], 

that exhibit ring characteristic over long period of time. An important difference be 

that tremor be isolated in time. In the laboratory experiments, the central block (Fig. S1) 

slowly slip throughout the stress cycle, briefly accelerate at the time of failure. Fig. (3b) 

show a raw time series far from failure. The signal exhibit small modulation that be 

challenge to identify by eye and persist throughout the stress cycle. These modulation 

increase in amplitude a failure be approached, a measure by the increase in signal 

variance. This increase in signal variance show that the energy carry by the acoustic 

signal steadily increase throughout the stress cycle. We posit that these variation be 

due to systematic groaning, creak and chatter from continuous grain motion of the 

fault gouge due to slow slip of the block (Discrete Element Modeling of this system 

[Ferdowsi et al. [2014]; Dorostkar et al., 2017]] be ongoing to further investigate the origin 

of this new found signal). Our ML-driven analysis suggests that the system emits a 

small but progressively increase amount of energy throughout the stress cycle, before 

abruptly release the accumulate energy when a slip event take place (Figs. S3, S4). 

The prediction of our model generalize across experimental conditions. To demonstrate 

this, we train the system at one apply load level, and then test it on data from 

different load levels, exhibit different inter-event time between failures. We observe 

that the model prediction retain their accuracy across load level and correctly predicts

clear outlier (see Fig. S5). The fact that timing prediction can be make under condition 

the RF have never see suggests that the time series signal be capture fundamental physic 

that lead to the prediction. Further, when the stress-cycle periodicity be disrupt by a 

shorter recurrence time a show in the inset of Fig. 2, the RF still do an excellent 

job in predict failure time, show that the approach can be generalize to aperiodic 

fault cycles. The fact that timing prediction can be make under condition the RF have 

never see suggests that the time series signal be capture fundamental physic that 

lead to the prediction. Our physical interpretation be that the chatter signal variance 

and high order moment be a fingerprint of the instantaneous friction and shear-stress 

state, the variance and other feature of the time series carry quantitative frictional state 

information (see Figs. S3-S4), inform the RF of when the next slip event will occur. If 

true, this be a remarkable observation in itself. We be currently work on the relation 

between the signal variance and friction to determine if indeed there be a direct link. 

There be a number of issue to consider in apply what we have learn to Earth. 

The laboratory shear rate be order of magnitude large than Earth (5 microns/sec 

v mms-cms/year). The laboratory temperature condition in no way resemble those in 

Earth, while the pressure could be representative of in situ pressure when fluid pressure 

be large. While it be a significant leap link the laboratory study to Earth scale, we 

know from past work [Johnson et al. [2013]; W. Goebel et al. [2013]] that the fundamental 

scale relation in fault physics, the Gutenberg-Richter relation calculate from the labo- 

ratory precursor [Gutenberg and Richter [1949]], be within the bound observe in Earth 

[Johnson et al. [2013]; W. Goebel et al. [2013]]. This similarity implies that some of the 

important fault frictional physic scale. A laboratory experiment clearly cannot capture

all of the physic of a complex rupture in Earth. Nevertheless, the machine learn ex- 

pertise we be develop a we move from the laboratory to Earth will ultimately guide 

further work at large scale. 

4. Conclusion 

To summarize, we show that ML apply to this experiment provide accurate failure 

forecast base on the instantaneous analysis of the acoustic signal at any time in the 

slip cycle, and reveals a signal previously unidentified. These result should suffice to 

encourage ML analysis of seismic signal in Earth. To our knowledge, this be the first 

application of ML to continuous acoustic/seismic data with the goal of infer failure 

times. These result suggest that previous analysis base exclusively on earthquake cat- 

alogs [Keilis-Borok et al. [1988]; Liu et al. [2005]; Alves [2006]; Alexandridis et al. [2014]] 

may be incomplete. In particular, ML-based approach mitigate human bias by auto- 

matically search for pattern in a large space of potentially relevant variables. Our 

current approach be to progressively scale from the laboratory to the Earth by apply 

this approach to Earth problem that most resemble the laboratory system. An inter- 

esting analogy to the laboratory may be fault that exhibit small repeat earthquakes. 

For instance, fault patch locate on the San Andreas Fault near Parkfield [Nadeau and 

McEvilly [1999]; Zechar and Nadeau [2012]] exhibit such behavior. Repeaters at these 

fault patch may be emit chatter in analogy to the laboratory. If so, can this 

signal be record by borehole and surface instruments? We be currently study this 

problem. Whether ML approach apply to continuous seismic or other geophysical 

data succeed in provide information on timing of earthquake (not to mention the chal- 

lenge of predict earthquake magnitude), this approach may reveal unidentified signal

associate with undiscovered fault physics. Furthermore, this method may be useful for 

failure prediction in a broad spectrum of industrial and natural materials. Technology 

be at a confluence of dramatic advance in instrumentation, machine learning, the abil- 

ity to handle massive data set and faster computers. Thus, the stage have be set for 

potentially marked advance in earthquake science.

Figure 1. Random Forest (RF) approach for predict time remain before failure. 
(a) Shear stress (black curve) exhibit sharp drops, indicate failure event (laboratory earthquakes). 
We wish to predict the time remain before the next failure derive from the shear stress drop (red 
curve), use only the acoustic emission (dynamic strain) data (b). The dash rectangle represent a 
move time window; each window generates a single point on each feature curve below (e.g., variance, 
kurtosis, etc.). (c) The RF model predicts the time remain before the next failure by average the 
prediction of 1000 decision tree for each time window. Each tree make it prediction (white leaf 
node), follow a series of decision (colored nodes) base on feature of the acoustic signal during 
the current window (see Supplementary Materials). (d) The RF prediction (blue line) on data it have 
never see (testing data) with 90% confidence interval (blue shade region). The prediction agree 
remarkably well with the actual remain time before failure (red curve). We emphasize that the 
test data be entirely independent of the training data, and be not use to construct the model. Data 
from experiment number p2394.

Figure 2. Time remain before the next failure predict by the Random Forest. 
As in Fig. 1a, the red line show the actual time before failure (Y-axis) versus experimental run time 
(X-axis). The red dash line show the time remain before the next failure (derived from the shear 
stress data), and the blue line show the correspond prediction of the RF regression model (derived 
exclusively from the ‘instantaneous’ acoustic data). The blue shade region indicates the 5th and 95th 
percentile of the forecast-that is, 90 percent of the tree that comprise the forest make a forecast within 
these bounds. The inset emphasizes prediction on aperiodic slip behavior. The RF do a remarkable 
job of forecasting slip time even with aperiodic data. The RF be train on ≈150 second of data 
(≈10 slip events), and test on the follow ≈150 seconds, show here. We stress that the prediction 
from each time be entirely independent of past and future history-each blue point be a ‘now’ prediction. 
The data point can be scramble in time and the prediction remain the same. Data from experiment 
number p2394.

Figure 3. The physic of failure. The RF identifies two class of signal and us them to 

predict failure. (a) Shear stress and dynamic strain encompass two failure events. (b) Zoom 

of dynamic strain when failure be in the distant future. This newly identify signal, term 

‘laboratory tremor’ offer precise predictive capability of the next failure time. (c) Zoom of a 

classic, impulsive acoustic emission observe in the critically stress region just precede failure 

(note vertical scale be different for two signals). Such signal be routinely identify precede 

failure in the shear apparatus, in brittle failure in most material and in some earthquakes. Data 

from experiment number p2394.
