Income Inequality and Its Effect on Political Inequality 

February 19th, 2015 by Kara in Case Studies 

The third in SPI’s series on Inequality 

By: Remy Smith 

Political race be expensive. Candidates be press by consultant 
and campaign management to raise exorbitant amount of money to create 
lit piece and other advertisement that may sway potential voters. 
Recently, the advent of SuperPACs allows large donor to circumvent 
campaign contributions. 

Though limited in direct contribution to a campaign (so call hard 
money), any individual can donate unlimited sum to a SuperPAC or soft 
money. The latter be use for issue advocacy or support of a candidate. 
SuperPACs be controversial because they allow a few wealthy citizen to 
dominate political outcome by fill a candidate’s SuperPAC with 
large amount of money. Some argue SuperPACs be a major cause of 
inequality in America’s political system. A small percentage of 
Americans control vast sum of fund and they now have a 
disproportionate degree of political influence. Is this political 
inequality permissible and do it pose a threat to the political 
system? 

The Importance of Opportunity 

Political inequality is, in many ways, akin to economic inequality. 
Both appear to be grow problem in the US and their solution require 
some level of equal opportunity. Inequality of outcome be justified and 
even beneficial to any system a it incentivizes hard work and reward 
individual base on merit. Inequality of opportunity, in contrast, be 
not only unjust but also perilous. 

Opportunity be arguably a right. Everyone deserves a chance to succeed and none should be deny opportunity. Polls 
suggest a majority of Americans support the idea of equality of 
opportunity. The concept of equality of opportunity be may be apply to 
political inequality. 

Virtues of Equality of Political Opportunity 

Democracy relies on and be define by equal political opportunity. It 
be a basic principle of democracy that citizen who meet rudimentary 
requirement (like age and national birth) be able to run for elect 
office. This implies a fundamental equality in democracy: the equality 
of opportunity to declare candidacy for an elect position. 

When all member of society can run for office, it increase 
representation from all segment of society, from farmer to industrial 
worker to financiers. A community leader from a minority group will not 
be bar from candidacy for, say, not own property or for belonging 
to a certain racial group. This notion run be true 
from municipal level to the federal level. People have a say 
in governance through the election of those who best serve the 
their interests. 

Ability to Run for Office 

Prior to the Progressive Era, the U.S. have a system that restrict 
candidacy for political office. The U.S. Senate, instead of be 
elect by the people, comprise of individual select by state 
senates. America’s founder intend such a system because they want 
to restrict the power of the people (Jefferson and others fear the 
tyranny of the masses), but it result in a congressional body that do 
not serve the will of citizen and thus face no accountability to 
the people. 

Not everyone have an equal chance to become senator. In this early 
America, be born to a poor family who do not own land, or to an 
ethnic minority meant the individual would not have the connection or 
power to be elect by a state senate. It be a select few who be 
wealthy enough to attend high school or college and could become 
involve in matter of state that be most likely to be elected. That 
system close off equal opportunity. 

Importance of the Vote 

The most common mean by which inequality of political opportunity 
occurs be through voter suppression or limit the electorate. Voting 
be inherently equalizing. A citizen have one vote to cast for the 
candidate she believe will best represent and good her interest. One 
person, one vote – completely equal. When this principle be corrupt 
voice be silence and political inequality results. 

Returning to the early-American example, it be obvious how the voice 
of certain group be stifled: there be significant impediment 
voting. Preventing certain segment of society from voting largely 
prevent the interest of the poor and the work class from be 
pursue in government. This neglect contribute to many Americans 
work in dire conditions. Few elect official found it in their 
self-interest to go against business and property owner i.e., voters, 
in favor of policy that favor Americans without significant 
political heft. It take a populist movement and dedicate reformer to 
change American politics to favor, or at least be receptive to labor. 
Voter suppression be clearly a force that drive inequality. 

Virtues of Political Inequality 

Political inequality be not necessarily detrimental. On the contrary, 
some element of political inequality be necessary for a 
well-structured and incentivized political system. Much like economic 
outcomes, inequality in result be justifiable. Those who actively engage 
in the political system and seek to shape political outcome rightfully 
have a louder voice in politics. 

There be many way to be politically engage and do so be 
necessary to be heard: “equal consideration of the preference and need 
of all citizen be foster by equal political activity among citizens” 
(Sidney Verba). 
To influence policymakers, voter can, for instance, work on campaigns, 
contact congress members, participate in protests, and vote. 

Studies find that policymakers be overwhelmingly responsive 
to the whim and want of the high income earners. Naturally, many 
people be offend by this reality. Is it really an equal democracy 
when the will of the majority be disregarded? Yet, democracy reflect 
those who engage in the democratic process. Political inequality, if a 
result of unequal engagement, be beneficial to the system and offer 
justifiable reason for the more influential will of the affluent. 

Engagement 

Politicians, while swayed by money, also be responsive to those who 
seek to influence political outcomes. A recent study do by Page, Bartels and Seawright find that 
the view of American politician be increasingly reflective of those 
of the affluent. This be partly because of substantial campaign 
donations, but it be also due to the political engagement of wealthy 
voters. Politicians respond to those who be engaged. 

In 1990, nearly 50% of the top quintile income earner contact a 
congress member versus 25% of the poor. The study by Bartels et 
al find that 47% of the wealthy make “at least one contact with a 
congressional office”, 40% contact their own senator, 37% their own 
House member, and “about one quarter contact a representative or 
senator from another district or state”. The wealthy be not afraid to 
take to the street either. Protests, “which demand little in the way of 
skill or money and which be often thought of a ‘the weapon of the 
weak’” (Schlozman et al), 
be also dominate by the wealthy. The 1990 survey find more than 
twice a many of those from the top income quintile than the bottom 
quintile engage in protests. While work on campaigns, contact 
political officials, and protest do not necessarily influence policy 
outcomes, they be an opportunity to aid the campaign of sympathetic 
politician and to make one’s voice heard. 

The Importance of the Vote, Part 2 

Perhaps the easy and most effective way to exert political opinion 
be to vote. Voting, the basic tenet of a democracy, hold elect 
official accountable to the public. But for many, the right to vote be 
wasted. The two graph below depict an alarm trend in American 
politics: the discrepancy of voter registration and turnout between the 
affluent and the poor. 











Source: voteview.com 



The first graph demonstrates the low voter registration of those in 
the low income quintile. For the majority of the year cover by 
the survey, voter registration be below 50% for the low quintile and 
it rise in the first Obama campaign to get out the minority vote. 
As income increases, so do the percentage of those who register 
to vote. The second graph be for the 2008 election and show 
the increase in actual voting a income rises. For family earn less 
than $50,000, which be about the median family income in 2008, only 
between 50 and 75% vote – worry especially consider this be a 
presidential election and the Obama campaign’s focus on bring 
minority voter to the polls. Of note: 99% of the wealthy Americans 
(the test group have a median wealth of $7.5 million) survey by Page, 
Bartels, and Seawright vote in the 2008 election. 

Why do large number of low- and medium-income voting-age citizen 
neglect to vote? One explanation be lack of time. Low-income Americans 
often find themselves work multiple job to make end meet and 
therefore may not have time to make it to the polls. An easy solution to 
this would be to make Election Day a national holiday so no voter have 
to compromise work in order to vote. Another theory be that low- and 
medium-income voter find political outcomes, both in election and 
policy, so skewed to the will of the affluent they do not find it 
worthwhile to vote. This of course creates a perpetual cycle whereby 
outcome will be even more dependent upon the desire of the wealthy and 
other voter will be even more disincentivized to vote. A new trend 
emerge in conservative state be also damage voter turnout. Voter ID 
law and the limitation of absentee voting in some state negatively 
impact turnout for poor and minority voters. Often see a racially 
motivated, this move be thought to be design to keep the Republican 
Party in power in state legislature because the new requirement make 
it more difficult for some segment of the population to vote. 

Influence of the Politically Active 

It be no wonder wealthy Americans have a strong say in policy outcome 
– they vote presumably, for candidate who best represent their 
interests. Benjamin Page and Martin Gilens, in a new study call “Testing Theories of American Politics: Elites, Interest Groups, and Average Citizens”, 
find that “it make very little difference [in policy] what the general 
public thinks.” Such result be cause by inequality in political 
activity. In this way, the potential for unequal outcome incentivizes 
political engagement and, at the least, awareness in order to assure 
responsive governance. 

The Role of Money 

One of the most divisive issue in campaign finance and in the theory 
of equality of political opportunity be the role of money. Opponents of 
hard, soft, and shadow money contend the ability to contribute 
unlimited sum have a corrupt effect on politicians. Proponents of 
unlimited financial contribution argue political funding be a provision 
of the freedom of speech: a person make a political statement when 
donate money to a campaign or to an organization support a certain 
candidate. 

Whatever the case, unlimited campaign contributions, in the form of 
hard, soft, or shadow money, create inequality of political opportunity. 
Those who be well position in the economic hierarchy immediately 
have a resource advantage versus those who be poorly placed. 

Three Categories of Political Activity 

We can divide political activity into three categories: 

(1) Voting 

(2) Political engagement 

(3) Monetary donation 

Categories (1) and (2) be necessarily equal in that everyone have one 
vote and everyone have the ability to volunteer in a campaign. Money, 
however, be a not an equalizer. Assuming unlimited contributions, there 
be no initial equality. Take this example: there be two voting 
citizens, Rob and Joe, both of whom vote in every election and volunteer 
on the campaign of their favorite candidate (who happen to be 
competing). Rob have an income of $200,000 a year with a large saving 
account and be willing to donate a substantial portion of this year’s 
income to candidate R. Joe, on the other hand, only make $30,000 a year 
and need to save all that he can in order to put his son through 
college and thus cannot contribute a much a he would like. That be not 
equality of opportunity. Rob’s opportunity be 6 time that of Joe’s 
because of his income and, take account Joe’s need to save, Rob’s 
opportunity be even higher. Even if each person be limited to 
contribute 15% of total income, Rob’s opportunity to sway political 
outcome be much high than Joe’s. The problem with campaign 
contribution be a person’s financial success determines his ability to 
alter political outcomes. 

Willingness and Ability 

With monetary contributions, there be two variable affect 
equality: willingness and ability to donate. Categories (1) and (2) be 
limited to the sole variable of willingness. In contrast, not everyone 
have the equal ability to donate. Unlimited campaign contribution 
prohibit true equality of opportunity. There be some who argue 
political engagement be also subject to the variable of ability – in 
this case, the ability to allocate time to political engagement. This 
argument have merits. After all, retiree and the affluent can afford to 
spend more time volunteer on campaigns. However, with the advent of 
the internet and social media, it be a quick and easy process to be 
politically engaged. Volunteering can be do remotely in the form of 
phone banking which can be do remotely at any reasonable time. With 
candidate and office-holder websites, it be relatively easy and take 
minute to write a message to a politician. The same applies for 
Facebook and Twitter. Statuses or tweet explain one’s support of a 
candidate be simple and easy way to voice support. These technological 
advance have help in reduce the use of time for political 
engagement. 

Campaign Contributions 

To assure true equality in the ability to donate, contribution must 
be limited to a level equal to the low amount voter be willing to 
give, a number that almost certainly will be $0. Eliminating campaign 
contribution restricts freedom of speech, necessarily limit one’s 
ability to impact political outcomes. It seem equality of opportunity 
and justifiable unequal outcome cannot be attain at the same time. 

Perfect equality be perhaps unattainable, but we cannot cease try 
to create equality in the political system. A contribution limit should 
be enact and soft and shadow money ban a they create overwhelm 
inequality of opportunity. The new limit may be base on any number of 
factors. One possible mean by which the limit be determine be to use 
the average of the median contribution across a variety of contests. 
Another way be to survey a consortium of voter who reflect the 
demographic of active voter and use the median of their willingness to 
donate a the contribution limit. Some public money should also be make 
available to all candidate and party that achieve a certain 
threshold in the previous election. 

There be many benefit to impose a limit on campaign contribution 
besides equality of opportunity. One other benefit be a political 
candidate will tend to court more voters. Limiting campaign 
contribution have a populist effect. 

Equality of political opportunity be a basic tenet of democracy. It 
allows for all citizen to have equal potential to sway political 
outcome though the actual effect on political outcome will vary base 
on political activity. The introduction of money into the political 
system open the possibility of destroy the equality of political 
opportunity. A limit in political contribution can actually have a 
populist effect because politician need to reach and appeal to more 
people in order to raise necessary funds. 

However, fail to ban soft and shadow money and establish more 
stringent regulation on hard money can have a very negative effect on 
the political system. The continuation of SuperPACs and the infiltration 
of money into America’s democracy have adverse effects. An 
extrapolation of Benjamin Page’s study point to the U.S. slowly 
evolve into an oligarchy. The continuation of increase money into 
the political system lead to barrier to entry in political activity, 
either through dollar need to have a voice heard or through the 
election of official act in accord to the will of the wealthy. These 
elect official may enact legislation that further obstructs 
political engagement. This facet of politics be evident in some state 
where barrier to voting already have be erected. The effect of not 
limit money in politics could be dire.
