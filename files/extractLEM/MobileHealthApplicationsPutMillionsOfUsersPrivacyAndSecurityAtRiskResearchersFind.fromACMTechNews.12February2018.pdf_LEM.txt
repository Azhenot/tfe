put million of users’ privacy and security at risk 

80% of the health apps evaluate in a European study 

transmit health-related data to third-party companies, 

with only half do so over secure (HTTPS) connections. 

Most of the apps do not meet legal requirement or 

standard meant to prevent users’ inappropriate and 

uncontrolled data usage and disclosure to third-party 

companies.

In this innovative study, researcher evaluate 20 popular, free mobile 

health apps available on Google Play, and look at how app developer 

react to the findings. 

With 100.000 to 10 million downloads each and a minimum rating of 

3.5/5, the chosen apps managed, store and monitor users’ 

biomedical data such a health conditions, disease or medical 

agendas. 

In the first part of the study, researcher from the University of Pireus, 

Greece and Rovira I Virgili University, Spain analyse the way in which 

users’ personal data be handled. Only 20% of the apps store data on

users’ smartphones, and one in two apps request and manage users’ 

login password without use a secure connection. 

The team also stress that half of the apps share personal data – both 

text data and multimedia such a X-ray image - with third parties. 

What be more, over half of the apps transmit users’ health data 

through URL links, thus make data accessible to anyone with access 

to those links. 

In 20% of the cases, the apps either do not refer user to a privacy 

policy, or the policy content be not available in English, the language 

of the app. Some apps require access to users’ geolocation, 

microphones, camera, contact list, external storage card or bluetooth, 

although the apps’ proper functionality do not depend on it. 

“ We strongly support the use of mobile health apps, but user must 

know that apps’ popularity do not ensure privacy and security ”, 

say Dr Agusti Solanas of Rovira I Virgili University in Spain, involve 

in the study. 

After inform app developer about their findings, researcher 

notice some issue have be fix – for instance, unsafe health data 

transfer or the possibility of identify user because of unsafe data 

transfer to third parties. However, other issues, such a app usage data 

leaks, have not be address at all. 

“ People need to become more aware of the risk they be face ”, Dr 

Constantinos Patsakis of University of Piraeus added. 

The study be run by a team of researcher part of COST-funded 

European network CRYPTACUS , whose aim be to come up with good 

solution for European citizens’ online privacy. The study be partly 

fund by EU-funded project OPERANDO .
