All-optical operation hold promise a the future of compute technology, and key com- 

ponents include miniaturize waveguide (WGs) and coupler that control narrow band- 

widths. Nanowires (NWs) offer an ideal platform for nanoscale WGs, but their utility have 

be limited by the lack of a comprehensive couple scheme with band selectivity. Here, we 

introduce a NW geometric superlattice (GSL) that allows narrow-band guide in Si NWs 

through couple of a Mie resonance with a bound-guided state (BGS). Periodic diameter 

modulation creates a Mie-BGS-coupled excitation that manifest a a scatter dark state 

with a pronounce scatter dip in the Mie resonance. The frequency of the couple mode, 

tunable from the visible to near-infrared, be determine by the pitch of the GSL. Using a 

combine GSL-WG system, we demonstrate spectrally selective guide and optical 

switch and sense at telecommunication wavelengths, highlight the potential to use 

NW GSLs for the design of on-chip optical components.

Optical interconnects and logic element operating on thenanometer scale could enable the leap into all-opticalcomputing technology, which would alleviate the band- 
width and energy consumption limitation of current technolo- 
gies1. For instance, dielectric waveguide (WGs) make on silicon- 
on-insulator (SOI) platform have be widely explore for car- 
rying and modulate optical signals2; however, they be confine 
to a planar geometry, and couple light into and out of these 
structure relies on conventional grate coupler that be often 
order of magnitude large in size than the WGs3,4. Nanowires 
(NWs)5 offer an alternate platform on which to design dielectric 
WGs at exactly the diffraction limit in an optimal cylindrical 
geometry6–9. NWs enable the guide of light in flexible, non- 
planar, three-dimensional geometries, and permit the addition of 
conformal cladding material include dielectric and metals10. 
Despite these advantages, in-coupling of light to NW WGs 
remains problematic and have rely on scatter at NW end 
facets6,7 or end-on parallel couple to the NWs8,9 because there 
be no comprehensive light couple scheme for a NW geometry. 
Moreover, exist method be not spectrally selective, limit 
their utility for application where mode-selection be important. 
Given that NWs be also well know to exhibit strong Mie 
resonances11,12, there have be effort to explore the connection 
between Mie resonance and guide modes13. However, because 
of momentum mismatch, guide mode be by their nature 
inaccessible optical bound states14 under normal incidence light, 
leave the opportunity for interplay between a Mie and guide 
mode a yet obscure. 

Nanoscale system often exhibit unique light-matter interac- 
tions15 when the geometric and compositional design of a system 
cause complex wave interference effects, which can include Fano 
resonances16, electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT)17, 
and scatter dark states18,19. A Fano resonance arises from 
weak couple between two resonance with different damp 

rates, create an abrupt spectral feature in the optical response. 
EIT and scatter dark state originate from oppositely-oriented 
radiative resonance that destructively interfere with each other in 
the far field17–21. The same optical effect can occur in system 
with a near-field interaction between a super-radiant, bright 
mode and a sub-radiant, dark mode22,23. In this case, an exchange 
of energy between the mode result in a couple excitation of the 
bright and dark state, cause an abrupt Fano-like or EIT-like 
feature in the optical response. Far-field and near-field interac- 
tions be usually interchangeable framework that can describe 
the same phenomenon with a different basis set18,24. These spectral 
feature be often generate through geometric perturbation of a 
nanostructure to break spatial symmetry, cause a previously 
dark state to be accessed17,22,25,26. 

Here, we show that a NW geometric superlattice (GSL), which 
break the infinite translational symmetry of a NW, can couple a 
Mie resonance with a bound-guided state (BGS) of the NW. 
Complementary to report on bound state in the continuum 
(BIC)14, which describe the appearance of bound state above the 
light cone, we selectively access one normally inaccessible BGS 
from a continuum of conventional bound state below the light 
cone by precisely modulate the NW geometry. As a result, a 
sharp, Fano-like feature that can be assign a a scatter dark 
state appear in the Mie scatter spectrum at the wavelength of 
the BGS. The geometric dependence of both the Mie resonance 
and BGS provide broadband tune of the effect from visible 
through near-infrared wavelengths. We experimentally demon- 
strate the appearance of scatter dark state from NW GSLs and 
show selective guide of light up to telecommunication wave- 
length with a Fourier-transform-limited bandwidth. This report 
be the first demonstration of Mie-BGS couple and selective 
narrow-band guide in a NW WG system. In addition, we show 
that the couple wavelength be highly sensitive to the local

optical switch. 

Results 
Mie-BGS couple in a NW GSL. The geometry of a NW GSL, 
illustrate in Fig. 1a, be uniquely define by three geometrical 
parameters, the pitch (p), outer diameter (d), and etch diameter 
(e), and be compose of equally space cylindrical segment of 
modulate diameter (δ= d− e), where each segment have an axial 
length of p/2. We consider this structure illuminate at normal 
incidence under TM polarization with the magnetic (H) and 
electric (E) field perpendicular and parallel, respectively, to the 
NW axis. Figure 1b schematically illustrates couple between the 
two eigenmodes in a NW geometry, a Mie resonance that 
strongly couple with a free-space plane wave and a BGS select 
from the continuum. Here, we consider the criterion for an ideal 
bound state to be absence of loss, absence of external coupling, 
and time invariance of energy within the structure. Thus, for a 
NW system, the ideal BGS refers to a stand wave with 
amplitude Ag form by the superposition of two counter- 
propagate guide modes, Ag= [Ar(x,z)B(y)exp(ikg,L(y- 
y0) − iωgt)+ Al(x,z)B(y)exp(−ikg,L(y− y0)− iωgt)], with the 
same angular frequency (ωg) and longitudinal wavevector (kg,L), 
where y be spatial position along the NW axis, y0 be the spatial 
origin chosen to coincide with the center of a GSL segment, Ar(x, 
z) and Al(x,z) be the cross-sectional amplitude of right- and left- 
propagate guide modes, respectively, (with Ar=Al, for an 
ideal BGS), B(y) be the longitudinal envelope function (with B(y) 
= constant, for an ideal BGS), i be the imaginary unit (i2=−1), 
and t be time. Note that this expression will also describe a con- 
ventional guide mode if either Ar or Al be zero. For a perfect 
cylinder (δ= 0), the Mie and BGS mode be orthogonal and 
incapable of couple to one another. For a GSL (δ > 0), we 
consider a non-zero couple frequency, ωc, between a Mie 
resonance center at ωm and a BGS center at ωg. For normal 
incidence illumination, the couple be non-zero only for the ωg 
with a kg,L that match the geometrically define p (i.e., kg,L= 
2πm/p, where m= 1, 3, 5, …) because these frequency experi- 
ence coherent amplification whereas mismatch one vanish. 
Thus, the structure behaves a a Fourier selector in which only the 
spatial frequency components, include high mth order odd 
harmonic (Supplementary Fig. 1), match to the structure be 
couple to a BGS. 

Figure 1c show numerically calculate scatter efficiency 
(Qsca, see Methods for details) spectrum (solid lines) and 
analytically calculate spectrum (dashed lines) derive from 
temporal coupled-mode theory (TCMT)18,27 for a uniform NW 
(labeled p∞) and three NW GSLs of vary p. The dominant 
peak in the uniform NW spectrum corresponds to the 
fundamental TM11 magnetic dipolar Mie resonance (directly 
related to the HE11 guide mode13) center at ωm. For the GSL, 
in contrast, a sharp and pronounce scatter dip (labeled ωg for 
p420) be observe within the Mie resonance. The calculate field 
profile at ωg (Fig. 1f) exhibit a stand wave with antinode 
center on each cylindrical segment (see also a time-lapsed 
animation in Supplementary Movie 1). This stand wave profile 
corresponds to the BGS. For shorter (p360) and longer (p500) 
value of p, the scatter dip shift to the blue or red of ωm, 
respectively; nevertheless, the same stand wave profile be 
observe at the scatter dip for all value of p (Supplementary 
Fig. 2). The peak to the blue and red of the scatter dip in 
Fig. 1c (labeled ω+ and ω−, respectively, for p420) exhibit mode 
profile (Fig. 1d, e) with antinode center only on the small or 
large diameter segments, respectively, and these profile be also 
preserve for every value of p (Supplementary Fig. 2). 

Substantially large value of p shift ωg off the Mie resonance 
envelope, cause the scatter dip to disappear and no power to 
be transfer to the BGS (Supplementary Fig. 3). In addition, a 
tilt of the incoming plane wave provide a non-zero momentum 
along the NW axis, cause the BGS scatter dip to split into 
two separate dip dominate by a right- and left-propagating BGS 
state (Supplementary Fig. 4); however, we focus only on normal 
incidence illumination in this study. 

The feature of the Mie–BGS couple can be account for 
use TCMT18,27. The dynamic state of the resonance amplitude 
can be express as:

where Am be the Mie resonance amplitude, γm and γg be radiative 
decay rate for the Mie resonance and BGS, S+ be the incoming 
wave, and km be the couple coefficient to the incoming wave. 
Here, we have neglect absorptive contribution and neglect 
an off-diagonal radiative couple term, γc. The outgo wave, 
S−, can be express a S−= S++ dmAm, where dm be the 
couple coefficient to the outgo wave. The couple 
coefficient of the BGS to the incoming and outgo wave be 
set to zero under normal incidence illumination, which assumes 
that γg be small compare to γm. In a perfectly cylindrical NW 
geometry (δ= 0), couple between the Mie resonance and BGS 
do not occur, and ωc and γg be both zero, leave both 
resonance unaffected and the BGS completely dark. However, in 
the case of a NW GSL, both parameter be non-zero, and 
scatter cross-sections calculate use Eq. (1) be plot in 
Fig. 1c a dot lines. Analytical parameter be summarize in 
Supplementary Table 1 and be determine by a fit to the 
numerical simulation consider energy conservation and time 
reversal symmetry18, reproduce the spectral feature in the 
numerical results. Note that the scatter dip do not go to zero 
because of the introduction of loss in the guide mode (γg > 0; see 
Supplementary Fig. 5). The good agreement of numerical and 
TCMT result validates the assignment of the scatter dip a a 
scatter dark state result from couple between a Mie 
resonance and BGS. Similar calculation with different geome- 
trical parameter (Supplementary Fig. 6) show that the effect be 
fully tunable from visible through infrared wavelength by 
change d and p with a fix δ. 

Diagonalization of the energy matrix in Eq. (1) yield 
eigenfrequencies, ω+ and ω−, and the eigenmodes, Α+ and Α−. 
If the scatter dip appear at the center of the Mie resonance 
(ωm= ωg; red curve in Fig. 1c), the eigenmodes be A± = Am ± Ag, 
where Am corresponds to a dipolar Mie resonance uniformly 
distribute across the axial length of the NW, and Ag be the 
standing-wave mode profile of the BGS. The eigenmodes Α+ and 
Α− thus represent interference between the Mie resonance and 
BGS, in which the axially uniform amplitude of the Mie 
resonance overpowers the oscillate amplitude of the BGS with 
a relative phase shift of π for the two eigenmodes. This result 
corresponds to the numerically calculate mode profile in 
Fig. 1d, e for the adjacent peak on the blue (ω+) and red (ω−) 
side of the scatter dip. This eigenmode analysis can also 
justify the assignment of the scatter dip a a Fano resonance 
arise from the interaction between a sharp BGS and a broad 
Mie background resonance. 

The bound character of the BGS be apparent if we consider the 
effect of the modulation depth, δ. Numerical simulation 
(Supplementary Fig. 7) with δ range from 20 to 2 nm show a

marked narrow of the scatter dark state linewidth and 
increase of the quality factor, extrapolate to infinity a δ 
approach zero. Moreover, ωc decrease a δ decrease in 
magnitude (Supplementary Table 2) because access to the bound 
state vanishes. In contrast, a δ increase in magnitude, the 
linewidth significantly broadens and eventually bifurcates into 
two distinct peak that align with the position of ω+ and ω−. 
This transition occurs because the Mie resonance and BGS be no 
longer weakly coupled, and instead two qualitatively new mode 
arise that be more representative of scatter from Si NW 
segment of distinct diameters. 

To experimentally verify the predict optical property of 
NW GSLs, a process term ENGRAVE (Encoded Nanowire 
GRowth and Appearance through VLS and Etching)28–30 be 
use to fabricate Si NW GSL nanostructures from the bottom-up 
use a gold (Au) nanoparticle catalyze vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) 
growth process. VLS growth produce single-crystalline NWs and 
be capable of precise size control and on-demand modification of 
morphology28,29,31–33, chemical composition34, and crystal 
phase35. Of the geometric parameters, p be determine by the 
dopant switch frequency during the growth, and d and e be 
determine by the size of Au catalyst and post-growth etch 
duration, respectively. Optimized growth condition without Au 
loss from the catalyst36 yield NWs exceed 500 μm in length 
with no undesired diameter variation (Supplementary Fig. 8). 
Figure 2a–c show scan electron microscope (SEM) image of 
three distinct NW GSLs with increase diameter d prepared by 
the ENGRAVE process use etch depth of δ= 10–25 nm. 
Geometrical parameter of each GSL be determine by 
quantitative image analysis30. For optical characterization, a 
home-built laser microscope (Supplementary Fig. 9) capable of 
polarization-resolved bright-field extinction measurement use 
a supercontinuum laser source and balance detection be 
employed. 

Experimental extinction spectra, plot a (1− T) × 100%, 
where T be the measure transmittance (see Methods), be show 

in Fig. 2d–i for GSLs (Fig. 2d–f) and uniform NWs of the same 
diameter (Fig. 2g–i). Each spectrum show a broad Mie 
resonance that shift to longer wavelength with increase 
diameter. For the GSLs, sharp spectral feature deviate from the 
background Mie resonance be observed. Numerical simulation 
(black solid lines) of the extinction efficiency (Qext) that use 
geometrical parameter obtain from the SEM image and 
include the focus laser beam (see Methods) agree well with the 
experimental measurements, confirm the presence of Mie-BGS 
couple and a scatter dark state in these nanostructures. 
However, the simulation also reveal several difference between 
focus excitation and the plane wave excitation model in 
Fig. 1. First, the simulation predict a scatter dip with a 
substantially large linewidth, which can be attribute to the 
localize excitation cause a broader distribution of Fourier 
spatial component to couple to the BGS. Second, the simulation 
predict an extinction peak within the dip, which can be attribute 
to mode distortion cause by the finite number of GSL period 
excite by the focus beam. Mode degradation in truncate 
array be a common phenomenon observe in planar metamater- 
ials due to loss of coherence37,38. In our case, the finite beam 
prevents the Bloch condition along the GSL from be satisfied, 
cause incomplete formation of the BGS and an increase in 
scatter loss, manifest a a peak within the scatter dip 
(Supplementary Fig. 10). 

Tunable guide in a GSL-WG NW. The geometric dependence 
of Mie-BGS coupling, a observe in Fig. 2, can be predict from 
the dispersion relation for the WG mode of a uniform diameter 
Si NW (Fig. 3a) and the diameter dependence of the TM11 Mie 
resonance. For a fix longitudinal wavevector kg,L, which cor- 
responds to a GSL satisfy p= 2πm/kg,L, the frequency of the 
guide mode decrease with increase diameter, and the Mie 
resonance frequency similarly decrease with increase diameter. 
However, because the frequency of the Mie resonance and BGS

change with diameter at different rates, the pitch p require to 
center the BGS on the Mie resonance shift to large value a the 
diameter of the NW increase and the frequency decreases. In 
Fig. 3a, this shift can be visualize a the intersection of the solid 
line (BGS dispersion relation) with the magenta dash line (Mie 
resonance position), which represent the degenerate point 
where ωm= ωg and provide a guideline for the geometric design 
of a GSL to enable optimal Mie-BGS couple at a give free- 
space wavelength. Magenta diamond and black circle represent 
data point where the mode be and be not degenerate, 
respectively, a determine from numerical simulation of NW 
GSL spectrum in Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 6. The good 
alignment of these data point with the dispersion relation 
confirms the geometric relationship between d and p for Mie-BGS 
coupling. 

To take advantage of the WG characteristics, we design a 
GSL-WG NW, illustrate in Fig. 3b, compose of a truncate 
GSL adjacent to a long, uniform cylindrical segment that can act 
a a lossless WG. The geometric parameter of the GSL be 
design to support Mie-BGS couple in the near-infrared 
spectral region to avoid absorptive loss in Si. Numerical 
simulation for a GSL (d= 330 nm; e= 310 nm; p= 900 nm) 
with 10 period of the pitch illuminate by a focus laser beam 
(Fig. 3c) yield an extinction spectrum (Fig. 3d) with a broad Mie 
resonance center at ~1500 nm and an extinction dip center at 
~1504 nm. A Mie-BGS couple excitation occurs at the dip, and 
the numerical simulation show energy propagation into the 
guide mode of the WG segment adjacent to the GSL, a show 
by the magnetic field profile in Fig. 3c and Supplementary 
Movie 2. Integration of the energy flux in the WG portion of the 
NW yield the guide spectrum show in Fig. 3e. As expected, the 
spectral region guide in the NW corresponds to the spectral 
region of the dip in the extinction spectrum. The guide 
bandwidth of ~46 nm be in good agreement with the expect 
Fourier-transform-limited bandwidth of 48 nm for a Gaussian 
beam with a full-width at half maximum of 7 μm. Moreover, 
we calculate a maximum guide efficiency (Qguided) of 0.82 
for couple into the WG base on the ratio of the power 
measure at the end of the WG to the power incident on 
the project area of the GSL. Thus, the near-unity Qguided 

highlight the high efficiency with which the Mie-BGS couple 
mechanism can funnel the energy associate with the strong 
light-matter interaction of the Mie resonance into the guide 
mode of a NW. 

To experimentally validate the expect guide characteristic 
of a GSL-WG NW, we synthesize NWs with a GSL adjacent to a 
50 μm WG segment, a illustrate in Fig. 4a. Geometric 
parameter of the NW be chosen to support lossless guide 
at frequency below the bandgap of Si. Because of infrared free 
carrier absorption loss in heavily-doped n-type Si NWs39, we 
adopt the doping-inverted ENGRAVE process29,36 in which n- 
type rather than intrinsic segment be etch (see Methods), 
allow the WG segment to be compose of intrinsic Si. To 
experimentally measure guide in the GSL-WG structure, an 
excitation beam be focus on the GSL segment, and optical 
image be collect to observe any light emission from the end

traverse the 50 μmWG. Figure 4c–e display optical image of a 
GSL-WG structure illuminate at three excitation wavelengths. 
As apparent from these images, WG light emission be observe 
from the end of the WG segment for an excitation wavelength of 
1455 nm but be not observe at wavelength of 1400 and 1550 nm. 

Extinction spectrum be collect from both GSL and WG 
segment of NWs with three distinct geometric parameter 
(Fig. 4i–n) design to tune the Mie-BGS couple from ~1300 to 
~1500 nm. As expected, the uniform-diameter WG segment 
show one Mie resonance whereas the GSL segment show a 
scatter dark state within the Mie resonance. WG emission 
spectra, a show in Fig. 4o–q, be also experimentally 
measure by integrate the signal from the end of the WGs 
(e.g., from the region denote by a dash circle in Fig. 4b). The 
WG emission spectrum show that guide occurs over a select 
wavelength range that corresponds to the spectral position of the 
scatter dip in the extinction spectra. The WG spectrum in 
Fig. 4o be collect from the same NW image in Fig. 4b, and 
the spectrum show maximal WG intensity in the 1450–1500 nm 
range, in agreement with the image in Fig. 4c–e. Simulations of 
Qext and Qguided spectrum be show a solid black line in Fig. 4i–q 
and agree well with experimental measurements, confirm the

Interestingly, the guide spectrum exhibit a high frequency

value correspond to round-trip reflectance value of 3% and 
1.2% for WG1 and WG2, respectively. The appearance of this 
Fabry-Perot pattern confirms the high-quality and low loss of the 
GSL-WG system, and suggests a potential route for further 
spectral filter of the guide light. 

Sensing and switch with a GSL-WG NW. The guide 
characteristic of the GSL-WG system be sensitive not only to 
geometric parameter but also to the refractive index, n, of the 
surround medium, a show schematically in Fig. 5a. A 
change in n from 1 to 1.5 in step of 0.1 refractive index unit 
(RIUs) result in a shift of the maximal guide power by 142 nm, 

a show by the simulation in Fig. 5b, c. This large spectral shift 
corresponds to a sensitivity of 270 nm RIU−1, which be compar- 
able to the sensitivity of planar dielectric metasurface sensors37 

and suggests potential application of the GSL system in both 
sensing37 and optical switching40. Figure 5d show the pro- 
gressive change in guide power a a function of n at three select 
wavelengths, exemplify the sense and on/off switch 
characteristic that can be achieve at each wavelength by rela- 
tively small change in n. However, in comparison to typical 
microresonators and planar metasurfaces, the finite length and 
nanoscale dimension of the NW GSL cause a relatively low 
quality factor and wide bandwidth for the guide light. This 
difference highlight an inherent but common tradeoff in the 
design of optical component in the nanoscale regime; never- 
theless, several index-changing strategies, such a the electro- 
optic effect41,42 and photoisomerization43, offer sufficiently large 
index modulation to enable switch in the NW GSL-WG 
system. 

We experimentally demonstrate reversible, passive sensing, and 
optical switch by sequentially add up to 4 poly(methyl 
methacrylate) (PMMA) layer over a NW GSL-WG on a SiO2 
glass substrate. Each successive PMMA layer increase the 
effective index of the environment. As show by the guide 
spectrum in Fig. 5e, the PMMA layer induce up to a 78 nm spectral 
shift of the maximum guide power, from 1286 to 1364 nm. This 
shift corresponds to a change of the effective refractive index (neff) 
of ~0.29 RIU, from ~1.21 to ~1.50, which be approximately the 
expect change consider the fix n of the substrate. 
Moreover, the spectrum reverts to it original position upon 
removal of all PMMA layers, thus demonstrate that the process 
be reversible. Figure 5f show the relative guide power measure 
at wavelength of 1286 and 1364 nm a a function of neff. The 
data exemplifies the expect sense and optical switch 
behavior of the GSL-WG system, allow the guide of a 
specific wavelength to be modulate and even turn on and off 
by the choice of neff. 

In conclusion, we have demonstrate that periodic geometric 
perturbation of a NW allows couple of a Mie resonance and a 
BGS. The couple creates a pronounce dip in scatter spectrum 
a predict by both numerical finite-element model and 
analytical model use TCMT. The periodic GSL structure act 
a a Fourier frequency selector to determine the wavelength of the 
BGS to be couple with the Mie resonance. The effect can be 
readily tune from visible through near-infrared wavelength by 
control geometric parameters, a proven by experimental 
measurement of extinction of individual GSL NWs. We 
demonstrate selective, Fourier-transform-limited guide of light 
up to telecommunication wavelength with near-unity couple 
efficiency, highlight the unique ability of the Mie-BGS 
couple mechanism to direct energy from the strong Mie 
resonance light-matter interaction into a NW WG. We also 
demonstrate a simple optical switch that take advantage of the 
spectral sensitivity of the couple wavelength to the surround 
medium. The Mie-BGS light couple mechanism thus offer a 
new platform for control light management when design 
optical circuits. 

Methods 
Numerical modeling. Finite-element optical simulation be perform use 
COMSOL Multiphysics software by run scatter field calculation with a TM- 
polarize plane wave or a focus Gaussian wave define over three-dimensional 
NW GSL structures. For plane wave simulations, a periodic boundary condition 
be apply in the axial direction at each side of a GSL repeat unit, and domain 
to the side of the NW GSL be surround by air and perfectly match layer 
(PMLs). For simulation with a focus Gaussian beam, NW waveguide segment 
on each side of the GSL be place in PMLs. Qsca and Qguided be calculate by 
integrate Poynting vector across the outer surface of a NW in all direction and

NW GSL synthesis. Si NWs be grown in a home-built, hot-wall chemical vapor 
deposition system with silane (SiH4; Voltaix), phosphine (PH3; dilute to 1000 ppm 
in H2, Voltaix), hydrogen chloride (HCl anhydrous; Matheson TriGas; 5 N research 
purity grade), hydrogen (H2; Matheson TriGas; 5 N semiconductor grade), and with 
Au nanoparticle catalyst (150–300 nm; Sigma-Aldrich) of various diameter in a 1- 
inch quartz-tube furnace (Lindberg Blue M). All NWs be nucleate at 480 °C with 
2.00 standard cubic centimeter per minute (sccm) of SiH4, 4.00 sccm of HCl, and 
194.0 sccm of H2 at 40 Torr total reactor pressure for 30min, which yield an 
average growth rate of 600 nm/min. A long section of n-type Si be grown for a 
desire length after nucleation by turn on the PH3 flow at a fix flow-rate ratio 
of 1:10 SiH4:PH3, and the same gas phase ratio be use throughout the study. 
Doping modulation for GSL profile be perform by abruptly turn on and off 
the PH3 flow at a constant time interval, follow by grow a long section of n- 
type again until growth termination. For doping-inverted GSLs, the PH3 flow profile 
be inverted, and the final intrinsic NW section be grown for desire WG 
lengths. NW GSLs be then subject to etch in aqueous KOH solution (20 
weight%) for standard dope or in buffer hydrofluoric acid (BHF, Transene BHF 
Improved, 2 volume%) for invert dope a described elsewhere36. For optical and 
electron microscopy characterization, NWs be transfer after etch onto 
standard glass microscopy slide (Fisher Scientific) coat with ~3 nm of ITO by 
sputter (Kurt Lesker PVD 75) to facilitate SEM imaging. For optical switch 
experiments, sequential layer of PMMA (MicroChem 950PMMA.A4) be spun 
cast (Laurell WS-650MZ-23NPP) at 4000 rpm and bake at 150 °C. 

Optical and microscopy characterization. A broadband laser from a super- 
continuum source (NKT Photonics; SuperK Extreme EXB-6) be direct into a 
monochromator (Princeton Instruments; Acton SP2300) to output a single 
wavelength with <2 nm bandwidth. The laser be collimate into a beam size of 1 
mm, polarize by a Glan-Thompson polarizer, and split evenly into reference and a 
probe arm for balance detection by Nirvana balance photoreceivers (Newport; 
Nirvana Auto-Balanced Photoreceiver 2007 or 2017, depend on the require 
wavelength). The reference beam be directly fiber-coupled to the photoreceiver, 
and the probe beam be direct to one side of the back aperture of a reflective 
objective (Thorlabs; LMM-40×-P01) to deeply under-fill the aperture and achieve 
quasi-plane wave illumination with a low numerical aperture (see Supplementary 
Fig. 9). The transmit probe beam be re-collimated by a match objective and 
fiber-coupled to the photoreceiver. The optical power be collect with the probe 
beam place on and off the NW by modulate the substrate position use a piezo 
positioner (Mad City Labs; Nano-LP 200). Measured extinction (%) be calculate 
a (1− T) × 100 with T= I/I0, where I and I0 be transmit power collect with 
the beam on and off the NW, respectively. The position modulation-extinction 
collection cycle be repeat twice and average at every wavelength. Optical 
image be perform by a visible-short wave infrared (Vis-SWIR) camera 
(Raptor Photonics; Ninox Vis-SWIR 640) with a halogen lamp illuminate in a 
dark-field configuration for locate sample or with a laser beam for collection of 
guide spectra. The guide spectrum be collect by take optical image at every 
wavelength and integrate the signal within the NW tip region. SEM image be 
collect with an FEI Helios 600 Nanolab Dual Beam System, and geometrical 
parameter of each GSL be determine use our home-written image analysis 
software30. Duty cycle for NW GSLs use in panel a–c in Fig. 2 be calculate to 
be 50 ± 2%, 50 ± 2%, 49 ± 2%, respectively, indicate that the length of segment in 
each GSL be p/2 within ~1%.
