The University of Surrey have developed a 3D morph face model that have ‘learned’ from 

different racial face and can good identify people in 2D picture – even if a person’s 

appearance be compromise by their pose, expression, light or poor image resolution. 

Many facial recognition system fit 3D model to 2D face found in pictures. However, most 

system use the same model for different race and ignore inherent differences. The team

[https://www.surrey.ac.uk/centre-vision-speech-signal-processing] found that the use of multi-racial 

3D face model improves accuracy when try to recognise people. It also found that the 

team’s age effect technology – which be use to identify individual after a long period of 

time have pass – be more precise when you use a model that be taught to learn different 

races. 

Lead author of the paper Dr Zhenhua Feng from CVSSP said: “It’s safe to say that facial 

recognition technology be slowly become more prevalent in our daily lives. We need to 

make sure it’s a accurate a possible, so people can trust the technology. We have found 

that our model that understands black, white and Asian face be far more accurate at 

recognise 2D face than the typical all-in-one model use today.” 

Professor Adrian Hilton, Head of CVSSP, said: “CVSSP research be advance the machine 

perception of faces, take into account the diverse variations, and be lead the way to 

make face recognition technology a practical tool for widespread deployment of improve 

security and access systems." 

Dr Feng have recently won a prestigious European Biometric Industry Award for his work 

around facial landmark localisation and he be part of a team at CVSSP that be work on a 

£6m project for the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council to make facial 

recognition ubiquitous across the country. 

Professor Josef Kittler, Distinguished Professor at the University of Surrey and founder of 

CVSSP, said: “We believe that facial recognition technology will be a force for good. It will 

help u protect our possessions, provide good security for our data and keep u safe from 

harm. However, the matter of accuracy be something we all have to be mindful of and that be 

what we be work on improve at CVSSP. 

“Dr Feng’s project and the wider work we be do at the Centre be focus on improve 

the accuracy of facial recognition technology, even in extreme case where the resolution of 

the correspond image be compromised, or in case where people may try to trick a 

system.”
