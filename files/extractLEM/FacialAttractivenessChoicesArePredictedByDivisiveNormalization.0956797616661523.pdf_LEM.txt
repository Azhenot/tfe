It be sometimes assume that one face appear more 
attractive than another because of it physical attributes, 
not because of when, where, or with whom it be seen. 
Indeed, classical decision-making theory assume ratio- 
nal agent who assign value to decision option (Luce, 
1959) and assume that these value be fixed, regardless 
of any other alternative that be encounter (i.e., 
regardless of context). These assumption may contribute 
to the dearth of theory predict context effect on facial 
evaluation (e.g., facial attractiveness). One candidate 
theory for predict context effects—normalization— 
draw support from decision-making study show 
context effect (Rangel & Clithero, 2012). For decision 
among multiple options, divisively normalize represen- 
tations of option value can be obtain by divide each 
option’s value (assessed without context) by the sum of 
all available option value (Louie & Glimcher, 2012; 
Louie, Khaw, & Glimcher, 2013). For example, when an 
option have a value of 3 be present together with 

option have value of 2 and 1, it value after divisive 
normalization be 0.5 (i.e., 3/(3 + 2 + 1)). 

Normalization may mediate context effect on attrac- 
tiveness decisions. It typifies neural response through- 
out the brain and can be consider a putative canonical 
neural computation (Carandini & Heeger, 2012). Normal- 
ization proliferates in the brain because it ensures that 
neural fire rate optimally span prevail stimulus 
ranges. Divisive normalization be well-studied for vision 
and explains nonlinear neural responses, include pho- 
toreceptor normalization to light intensity (Boynton & 
Whitten, 1970), contrast normalization and saturation 
effect (Bonin, Mante, & Carandini, 2005), cross-orienta- 
tion suppression (Carandini, Heeger, & Movshon, 1997),

Facial-Attractiveness Choices Are Predicted 
by Divisive Normalization 

Nicholas Furl 
Department of Psychology, Royal Holloway, University of London 

Abstract 
Do people appear more attractive or less attractive depend on the company they keep? A divisive-normalization 
account—in which representation of stimulus intensity be normalize (divided) by concurrent stimulus intensities— 
predicts that choice preference among option increase with the range of option values. In the first experiment report 
here, I manipulate the range of attractiveness of the face present on each trial by vary the attractiveness of an 
undesirable distractor face that be present simultaneously with two attractive targets, and participant be ask 
to choose the most attractive face. I use normalization model to predict the context dependence of preference 
regard facial attractiveness. The more unattractive the distractor, the more one of the target be prefer over 
the other target, which suggests that divisive normalization (a potential canonical computation in the brain) influence 
social evaluations. I obtain the same result when I manipulate faces’ averageness and participant chose the 
most average face. This find suggests that divisive normalization be not restrict to value-based decision (e.g., 
attractiveness). This new application to social evaluation of normalization, a classic theory, open possibility for 
predict social decision in naturalistic context such a advertising or dating.

and neural response to motion (Simoncelli & Heeger, 
1998) and multiple object (Zoccolan, Cox, & DiCarlo, 
2005). Normalization outside vision include nonlinear 
neural response to auditory contrast (Rabinowitz, 
Willmore, Schnupp, & King, 2011) and cross-modality 
normalization in multisensory integration (Ohshiro, 
Angelaki, & DeAngelis, 2011). 

Representations of reward value be also normalized. 
Brain response encode the value of choice option 
adapt to the range of option value (Cox & Kable, 2014; 
Padoa-Schioppa, 2009; Rangel & Clithero, 2012). This 
normalization affect human choice behavior, too. An 
undesirable option modulates the choice between two 
other option (Soltani, De Martino, & Camerer, 2012), for 
example, when monkey choose among juice reward 
and human choose among snack food (Louie et al., 
2013). In Louie et al. (2013), lower-value distractor item 
(i.e., a wider range of option values) increase prefer- 
ence for the good of two desirable options, a find 
predict by computer simulation of divisive normaliza- 
tion. Thus, divisive normalization effectively expands or 
contract the dynamic range of value representation to 
match the range of option values. 

Normalization could mediate similar context effect in 
the social domain too, but a theory to predict context 
effect for social evaluation be lacking. In an attractive- 
ness experiment, I test whether normalization predicts 
facial attractiveness. Participants evaluate facial attrac- 
tiveness without context in a first phase; in a second 
phase, they perform a trinary-choice task to ass 
attractiveness preferences. When two highly attractive 
target and a low-attractiveness distractor be choice 
options, participants’ choice should become more sensi- 
tive to difference in attractiveness of the two targets. In 
a control experiment (i.e., averageness experiment), I 
test for the same effect use a task in which partici- 
pant chose the most average-appearing face. These 
averageness choice may share some perceptual base 
with attractiveness choice (Langlois & Roggman, 1990) 
but have no overt value-based connotation. This control 
task could therefore show whether normalization be 
restrict to value-based judgment such a attractiveness 
or affect high-level facial judgment in general. 

Method 

Participants 

I enrol two sample of 40 participant each, select 
a sample size equivalent to that use by Louie et al. 
(2013). For the attractiveness experiment, all 40 (age 
range = 18−23; 25 women) contribute data for analysis. 
For the averageness experiment (approximate age 

range = 18−55, 28 women), data for 1 participant be 
remove from analysis because her response suggest 
that the instruction be not followed. Participants be 
student or staff at Royal Holloway, University of London, 
and have normal or corrected-to-normal vision. 

For the attractiveness experiment, participant be 
enter into a draw for one £25 Amazon voucher. For 
the averageness experiment, participant be compen- 
sate £8. The attractiveness experiment be approve by 
the psychology department ethic committee, and the aver- 
agene experiment be approve by the college ethic 
committee, both at Royal Holloway, University of London. 

Procedure 

Stimuli include color photograph of 15 male and 15 
female neutral face sample from the Karolinska 
Directed Emotional Faces (KDEF) face set (Lundqvist, 
Flykt, & Öhman, 1998). In Phase 1 (Fig. 1a, left), partici- 
pant rat either the attractiveness or the averageness of 
the 30 faces, two time each, sequentially and in a pseu- 
dorandom order. 

On each trial, participant saw a face and below that a 
horizontal line represent a continuum of value 
(between 0 and 1). They use the mouse to choose a 
value. The next trial appear after the mouse click. The 
two rating record for each face during Phase 1 be 
average for each participant. These average Phase 1 
rating be take a estimate of each participant’s judg- 
ment without context or normalization. In the attractive- 
ness experiment, face be select for Phase 2 base 
on each participant’s attractiveness ratings. In the aver- 
agene experiment, face be select for Phase 2 
base on each participant’s averageness ratings. On the 
basis of these averages, the lowest-rated (least attractive 
or least average) 10 male face and 10 female face be 
select a distractors (Fig. 1b), and the highest-rated 5 
male face and 5 female face be select a target 
(Fig. 1c) for Phase 2. 

In each trial of Phase 2, three face (two target and a 
distractor) appear on the screen at the left, center, and 
right (Fig. 1a, right). The face be present in pseudo- 
random order, and the faces’ screen location be 
assign randomly. The face come from the 10 possible 
pair of five target for each gender, match to the 10 
same-gender distractors. The participant indicate which 
of the face be most attractive or most average by press- 
ing a button on a computer keyboard, which trigger the 
next trial. I measure which target be chosen on each 
trial and whether the chosen target be the more attrac- 
tive target (or more average target) accord to the rat- 
ings from Phase 1. Each participant complete 200 trials.

Results 

Attractiveness and averageness rating in Phase 1 be 
submit to an analysis of variance (ANOVA) with fac- 
tor of distractor, face’s gender, and participant’s gender. 
Attractiveness rating (Fig. 1b) be significantly great 
for target than for distractors, F(1, 38) = 320.06, p < .001, 
ηp2 = .89, and for female face than for male faces, F(1, 
38) = 40.52, p < .001, ηp2 = .52. There be no effect of 
participant’s gender or any interaction among the three 
factors. Averageness rating (Fig. 1c) be also signifi- 
cantly great for target than for distractors, F(1, 37) = 
349.78, p < .001, ηp2 = .90. Neither the effect of face’s 
gender (p = .08) nor any other effect reach significance 
for averageness ratings. Because the distractors be 
always give low rating compare with the targets, dis- 
tractor be never chosen a the most attractive or most 
average face in Phase 2. 

A divisive-normalization account would predict that 
distractor face that receive low Phase 1 rating would 
be associate with great difference in the proportion 
of choice between the two target face in Phase 2. 
Because each participant provide his or her own rat- 
ings, I standardize rating across participant by rank 
the distractors (attractiveness experiment, Fig. 2a; aver- 
agene experiment, Fig. 2c); the lowest-rated distractor 
of each gender have the low rank (i.e., a 1). Visual 
inspection of Figure 2 reveals that distractors with a low 
rank be associate with more choice of the more 
attractive target (Fig. 2a) and with more choice of the 
more average target (Fig. 2c). For the attractiveness 
experiment, an unexpected result be that male partici- 
pant be more likely to choose the more attractive tar- 
get face when it be male than when it be female, 
whereas female participant show this pattern to a 
lesser degree (Fig. 2b). 

Several analysis focus on the hypothesize effect 
of distractor rating confirm these patterns. For the attrac- 
tiveness experiment, an ANOVA on the proportion of 
choice of the more attractive target, with distractor’s rank, 
face’s gender, and participant’s gender a factors, show 
a significant main effect of distractor’s rank, F(9, 342) = 
3.79, p < .001, ηp2 = .09, and face’s gender, F(1, 38) = 15.03, 
p < .001, ηp2 = .28, and a significant interaction between 
face’s gender and participant’s gender, F(1, 38) = 4.22, p = 
.047, ηp2 = .10. The averageness experiment replicate the 
significant main effect of distractor’s rank, F(9, 333) = 4.27, 
p < .001, with a similar effect size, ηp2 = .10, although there 
be no other significant effect for this ANOVA. 

The effect of distractor’s rank in both the attractive- 
ness and the averageness experiment be confirm 
by multiple linear regression. Separately for each partici- 
pant, I quantitatively test for the predict negative 
direction of the effect of distractor’s rank on choice 
behavior. The predictor in these model be distrac- 
tor’s rank, face’s gender, and their interaction, and the 
outcome be the proportion of choice of the higher- 
rat (more attractive or more average) target. The result- 
ing participant-specific β value be test for 
significance across the sample in the second level of a 
hierarchical analysis that treat participant a a random 
effect. For the attractiveness experiment, a negative rela- 
tionship between distractor’s rank and the proportion of 
choice of the more attractive target be confirm by a 
significant left-sided t test, mean β = −0.006, confidence 
bound = −0.003, t(39) = −4.02, p < .001. The same analy- 
si replicate this effect for the averageness experiment, 
mean β = −0.01, confidence bound = −0.007, t(39) = 
−5.30, p < .001. This shift in proportion of high target 
rating be associate with an effect size conventionally 
regard a large (attractiveness: Cohen’s d = 1.29; aver- 
ageness: Cohen’s d = 1.72), and the shift in relative choice

a a function of distractor value be within the range of 
previous report of other decision-making paradigm (for 
an example that investigates dominance effect for visual 
stimulus dimensions, see Trueblood, Brown, Heathcote, 
& Busemeyer, 2013). 

Further confirmation for influence of distractor rating 
on choice behavior be provide by an analysis that 
directly predict the choice on each trial (as oppose to 
proportion of choice in different conditions) use a 
binomial generalize linear model with a logistic link 
function (for a similar analysis, see Louie et al., 2013). For 
each participant, a generalize linear model predict a 
binary variable encode whether the participant chose 
the high rat (more attractive or more average) target 
on each trial using, a regressors, the Phase 1 rating of 
the leftmost target, the Phase 1 rating of the rightmost 
target, the Phase 1 rating of the distractor, the gender of 
the face, and the interaction between distractor rating and 
face gender. Again, magnitude of the participant-specific 
β value for distractor attractiveness be test for sig- 
nificance across the sample at a second level, treat 
participant a a random variable. For the attractiveness 
experiment, the hypothesis be confirm by a negative 
relationship between distractor’s attractiveness and fre- 
quency of choice of the more attractive target, mean 
β = −1.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) = [−2.46, −0.50], 
t(39) = −2.9, p = .006, Cohen’s d = 0.93. Thus, on a give 
trial, the more attractive the distractor, the less likely it 
be that one target would be chosen over the other. The 
averageness experiment replicate this negative relation- 
ship between the distractor’s rating and proportion of 
choice of the high rat target (more average, in this 
case), mean β = −1.37, 95% CI = [−1.916, −0.819], t(38) = 
−5.0, p < .001, Cohen’s d = 1.64. 

Louie et al. (2013), use the same paradigm that we 
use in the current study, show that the psychometric 
function that predicts the probability of choose a par- 
ticular target on the basis of difference between the val- 
ues of the two target exhibit a large slope for distractors 
with low reward values. This psychometric function 
can have a sigmoid shape. When Target 2 be considerably 
more valuable than Target 1 (i.e., target-value difference 
be negative), participant never choose Target 1. As the 
value of Target 1 increase relative to Target 2, the pro- 
portion of Target 1 choice will increase. When Target 1 
becomes considerably more valuable than Target 2, par- 
ticipants will always choose Target 1. The slope of this 
sigmoid function measure how sensitive choice prefer- 
ence be to difference between the two targets. In the 
current study, target value be measure a Phase 1 
rating and so we assess choice a a function of target- 
rating differences. If attractiveness or averageness repre- 
sentations be divisively normalized, then low-rated 
distractors should increase participants’ sensitivity to 

target-rating difference in attractiveness or averageness 
and thereby increase the slope of the sigmoid function. 
Hence, a divisive-normalization account predicts that dis- 
tractor rank will be negatively related to the slope of the 
psychometric function. 

This prediction be test by fitting to the data the 
logistic curve y = 1/(1 + exp(−β1 × (x − β2))), where y val- 
ues be the predict proportion of Target 1 choice (taken 
in the current study a the leftmost target on the screen), x 
value be the target-rating differences, β1 represent the 
slope parameter, and β2 represent the inflection-point 
parameter. Because target-rating difference and distractor 
rating be different for each participant, there be no 
fix value across participants. To facilitate summarize 
data over participant (Fig. 3) and to ensure a sufficient 
number of average trial for fitting, I bin the distrac- 
tor rank (5 bins) and target-rating-difference rank (12 
bins) and then fit logistic function to data in these 
bins. This yield separate logistic function parameter 
(nlimfit.m in MATLAB; The MathWorks, Natick, MA) for 
each participant and distractor bin. Although logistic 
slope value be compute from individual participant 
logistic fits, for visualization purposes, Figures 3a, 3b, 3d, 
and 3e show function fit to group data. A reduction in 
slope that change continuously across distractor bin be 
apparent for both attractiveness and averageness choices. 

For analysis of logistic slopes, poor curve fitting 
occur on occasion. For the attractiveness experiment, 
2 outlying slope out of 200 (40 participant × 5 distractor 
bins) be remove because they be more than 6 stan- 
dard deviation from their distractor-bin mean and be 
great than 30 although all other value be less than 
1. For the averageness experiment, 8 out of 195 slope 
be remove because they be more than 2.5 standard 
deviation from their distractor-bin mean and be 
great than 14 although all other value be less than 
1. Next, I use linear regression to ascertain whether dis- 
tractor bin be negatively associate with logistic slope, 
by fitting a line to the five logistic slope separately for 
each participant (Figs. 3c and 3f). These participant- 
specific linear regression β value be submit to a 
second-level, one-sample t test. Because we have an a 
priori hypothesis predict a decrease in slope a a 
function of distractor bin, and because a similar decrease 
have be report by previous research (Louie et al., 
2013), we test for decrease slope by implement 
left-sided t tests. The result confirm the prediction of 
normalization for both the attractiveness and the average- 
ness experiments. Across participants, logistic slope 
be negatively related to distractor’s attractiveness, 
mean β = −0.02, confidence bound = −0.003, t(39) = 
−2.00, p = .027, Cohen’s d = 0.32, and to distractor’s aver- 
ageness, mean β = −0.02, confidence bound = −0.001, 
t(38) = −1.8, p = .04, Cohen’s d = 0.38.

Divisive Normalization and Facial Attractiveness 1385 

Discussion 

The attractiveness experiment show that participant 
be more likely to find one target more attractive than 
another, depend on the unattractiveness of the dis- 
tractor (Fig. 2a), even though distractors be too unat- 
tractive to be chosen (Fig. 1b). Moreover, less attractive 
distractors increase participants’ choice sensitivity to dif- 
ferences in target attractiveness (Fig. 3). The same result 
occur when the experiment be repeat for average- 
ness choice (Fig. 2c, Fig. 3). These finding could arise 
from divisive normalization (Carandini & Heeger, 2012), 
in which neural fire rate adapt to span the range of 
options. For the attractiveness experiment, less attractive 
distractors widen the attractiveness range of options, 
and so normalization to this wider range pull apart the 
representation of the two targets. The result be an 
increase in choice frequency of the more attractive target 
(Fig. 2) and more sensitivity of choice to difference in 
target attractiveness (Fig. 3). These finding support the 
notion that normalization proliferates throughout the ner- 
vous system, give that similar effect arise for monkey’s 
preference for juice reward and humans’ preference for 
snack food (Louie et al., 2013). Divisive normalization, 
moreover, explains neural response throughout the 
visual and auditory system and contributes to sensory 
integration and decision make (Carandini & Heeger, 
2012). The attractiveness and averageness experiment 
demonstrate that normalization affect people’s choice 
and perception in higher-level social domain a well. 

Although the normalization account provide a basis 
for predict context effect on social evaluations, tim- 
ing effect still need to be explained. Context can also be 
manipulate use repetitive presentation of stimuli. 
Adaptation (prolonged exposure) to facial distortions, for 
example, increase attractiveness of similarly distort 
face (Rhodes, Jeffery, Watson, Clifford, & Nakayama, 
2003; Winkler & Rhodes, 2005). Assimilative effect for 
sequential face can occur for attractiveness (Taubert, 
Van der Burg, & Alais, 2016) and identity (Liberman, 
Fischer, & Whitney, 2014) and may arise from process 
that maintain visual continuity. A different finding, the 
contrast effect, occurs when successive presentation of 
attractive face render face less attractive (Wedell, 
Parducci, & Geiselman, 1987) and have be associate 
with range-frequency normalization (Parducci, 1965; 
Wedell et al., 1987). I found that range frequency theory 
be not a viable alternative to divisive normalization 
use a simulation of the trinary-choice paradigm follow- 
ing method report in Louie et al. (2013). Although this 
simulation replicate the result of Louie et al. for divi- 
sive normalization, range-frequency theory produce an 
opposite result: Relative choice between target become 
more confusable, not more distinct, for low distractor 

values. Whether instantaneous presentation and repeti- 
tive successive presentation draw on different mecha- 
nisms remains to be tested. 

Although contrastive adaptation to sequence and 
normalization share the goal of adjust neural fire to 
match prevail stimulus condition (Webster, Kaping, 
Mizokami, & Duhamel, 2004), in trinary choice, the con- 
text change on each trial more quickly than in adapta- 
tion experiments. In addition, in the brain, some type of 
normalization be best observe after block many tri- 
al (Rangel & Clithero, 2012). This slow time course may 
be good suit for measure adaptation and contrast 
effect than the faster context change associate with 
trinary-choice tasks. Louie and Glimcher (2012) have 
already note a distinction between normalization by 
more immediate spatial context versus a temporal con- 
text, which be dependent instead on the history of previ- 
ous stimuli. Results from the attractiveness and averageness 
experiment therefore highlight the time scale of context 
effect a a variable require further study. 

Compared with sequence-dependent rating tasks, 
trinary-choice task have an advantageous feature. Mul- 
tiple target option reveal additional effect of stretch 
or contraction to adjust to stimulus range by show 
how distractors pull target choice apart or push them 
together, a find difficult to infer from sequential Likert 
ratings. Trinary choice also form the basis for many deci- 
sion-making effect (Kowal & Faulkner, 2016) include 
the similarity effect (Tversky, 1972), the attraction effect 
(Huber, Payne, & Puto, 1982) and the compromise effect 
(Simonson, 1989). These effect involve selectively 
manipulate a distractor’s similarity to the target along 
specific stimulus attributes. Such study be use to 
examine multiattribute decision make and be often 
couched a commodity purchase (rather than a social 
evaluations) in which multiple-valued attribute can be 
experimentally manipulate (e.g., choose between 
use car that vary in both mileage and price). The cur- 
rent experiment use photograph of natural face and 
manipulate only overall attractiveness (or averageness) 
rather than select attributes. However, facial attribute 
could, in principle, be manipulate in trinary-choice 
task to study multiattribute decision-making phenomenon 
in social contexts. 

The attractiveness and averageness experiment also 
engender new research question about which repre- 
sentations be normalized. Many potentially normalize 
representation could contribute to attractiveness deci- 
sions, include visual representation of facial attributes. 
If attractiveness decision arise from evaluation of visual 
information, then they will be influence when visual 
representation be normalized. For example, Wedell and 
Pettibone (1999) manipulate the range of eye and nose 
width on schematic face to induce contrast effect on

eye- and nose-width perception, and they found corre- 
sponding shift in judgment of face pleasantness. The 
averageness experiment explore a similar possibility by 
examine a high-level facial judgment that might resem- 
ble some of the perceptual assessment involve in attrac- 
tiveness perception, although averageness choice lack 
the same overt reward-based assessment a attractiveness 
choices. The find of normalization for averageness 
decision suggests that normalization be not limited to 
reward-based judgment (Louie et al., 2013) and might 
operate on high-level visual assessments. However, many 
potential visual contribution to attractiveness decision 
could be normalized. Evidence already exists for normal- 
ization of low-level visual response to luminance, con- 
trast, and motion in the visual cortex (Carandini & Heeger, 
2012), and image evidence exists for normalization in 
visual area for object representation (Zoccolan et al., 
2005). Behavioral and brain-response measurement be 
still need to fully ass the role of visual normaliza- 
tion in social evaluation of faces. 

Attractiveness decision be also decision about 
potential rewards, and the averageness experiment can- 
not exclude the possibility of additional normalization of 
reward-based representation (Louie et al., 2013). More- 
over, the situation be further complicate by evidence of 
multiple brain representation of reward-related value, 
any of which might be susceptible to normalization. For 
faces, several brain area (e.g., amygdala, prefrontal 
areas, ventral striatum) be associate with reward value 
(Bzdok et al., 2012; Kampe, Frith, Dolan, & Frith, 2001; 
Pegors, Kable, Chatterjee, & Epstein, 2015; Smith et al., 
2010; Winston, O’Doherty, Kilner, Perrett, & Dolan, 2007). 
Moreover, ventromedial prefrontal cortex may map dif- 
ferently scale value from different stimulus domain 
onto a single reward-value representation (i.e., a common 
currency; Pegors et al., 2015; Smith et al., 2010; Vessel, 
Stahl, Purton, & Starr, 2015). In the monkey, a similar area 
in the orbitofrontal cortex have already be show to 
exhibit normalize response to reward (Cox & Kable, 
2014; Padoa-Schioppa, 2009). Behavioral and brain- 
response measurement be need also to fully ass 
the role of normalization of reward-based representa- 
tions in social evaluation of faces. 

Normalization theory (e.g., divisive normalization) 
motivate new quantitative predictions, such a those 
test here. The fact that normalization explains prefer- 
ences in the social domain suggests new application to 
apply or naturalistic settings. The ability to predict 
social evaluation in context might generalize to adver- 
tising, Web site design, consumer behavior, and so forth. 
Context effect on social decision also challenge com- 
mon assumptions, include those of classical econom- 
ics, that relative values, such a attractiveness, be 
constant over time. Although people alter their face 

through makeup, hairstyles, and the like to appear attrac- 
tive, in fact, face appear more or less attractive depend- 
ing on context. Indeed, people may even socially 
evaluate a person differently depend on who be stand- 
ing nearby.
