Since it first observation in the nineteenth century, the 
photovoltaic (PV) effect have be study intensively for 
scientific interest and a a sustainable energy source to 
replace fossil fuel and reduce carbon emission (1–3). In 
1954, the first high-power modern silicon solar cell be 
invent in which the photoexcited carrier be separate 
by a built-in electrical field developed at a p-n junction (4). 
By virtue of the appropriate bandgap energy of the 
semiconductor in a p-n junction solar cell, sunlight be 
efficiently absorbed, result in considerable power 
conversion efficiency. Nowadays, silicon PV cell be the 
mainstay of the modern solar industry, contribute more 
than 1% of global electricity supply. Nevertheless, PV cell 
base on p-n junction have a photovoltage limited by the 
bandgap energy of the constituent semiconductor and an 
ultimate efficiency constrain by the Shockley-Queisser (S- 
Q) limit (5). 

The ferroelectric material exhibit a photovoltaic effect 
distinct from that of p-n junctions, call the bulk photovol- 
taic (BPV) effect (6, 7). Under uniform illumination, a homo- 
geneous ferroelectric material give rise to a current under 
zero bias (short-circuit current; ISC) that depends on the po- 
larization state of the incident light and produce an anoma- 
lously large photovoltage well exceed it bandgap energy. 
This peculiar PV effect originates from the asymmetric distri- 
bution of photoexcited nonequilibrium carrier in k-space 
cause by the absence of centrosymmetry in the material (7). 
Owing to it distinctive charge separation mechanism, solar 
cell base on the BPV effect can in principle exceed the S-Q 
limit (8). However, a substantial BPV effect be generally found 
in wide-bandgap noncentrosymmetric materials, such a fer- 
roelectric BaTiO3 (8) and BiFeO3 (9), lead to an overall ex- 
tremely low device efficiency under solar illumination. 

Hence, one way to enhance the efficiency may be to realize 
the BPV effect in semiconductor with more favorable 
bandgaps, regardless of their crystalline symmetry. 

Flexoelectricity be an electromechanical property that re- 
flects a couple between an electric polarization and a strain 
gradient (10, 11). In centrosymmetric materials, a strain gra- 
dient break it inversion symmetry, result in a polariza- 
tion with a prefer direction and enable a piezoelectric 
composite contain no piezoelectric element (11, 12). Like- 
wise, one can hypothesize that a strain gradient allows the 
manifestation of the BPV effect in material that be origi- 
nally centrosymmetric. Here, we propose and demonstrate 
that the BPV effect can be induced in any semiconductor by 
mediation of the flexoelectric effect. Given that flexoelectric- 
ity be a universal property of all materials, range from bio- 
material (13) to semiconductor and dielectric (14) to 2D 
material such a graphene (15), this strain-gradient-induced 
BPV effect, term here the flexo-photovoltaic (FPV) effect, be 
allow for all symmetry classes. Thus, the device base on 
the FPV effect can be fabricate with silicon or any other sem- 
iconductors. 

To demonstrate our idea, we explore the PV effect in- 
duced by a point force exert onto the surface of centrosym- 
metric material include a SrTiO3 single crystal and a rutile 
TiO2 single crystal (see section S1 of (16)). The point force be 
exert by the tip of an atomic force microscope (AFM), in- 
ducing local inhomogeneous strain at the tip/surface contact 
area and, therefore, a local break of centrosymmetry (17, 
18). In our experiments, we use a custom-made photoelec- 
tric atomic force microscope (Ph-AFM) consist of an AFM- 
base system equip with a customize current ampli- 
fier/filter system and an optical system (19). The optical sys- 
tem allows u to illuminate a sample surface with a 405-nm

It be highly desirable to discover photovoltaic mechanism that enable a high efficiency of solar cells. 
Here, we report that the bulk photovoltaic effect, which be free from the thermodynamic Shockley- 
Queisser limit but usually manifest only in noncentrosymmetric (piezoelectric or ferroelectric) 
materials, can be realize in any semiconductor, include silicon, by mediation of flexoelectric effect. We 
introduce strain gradient use either an atomic force microscope or a micron-scale indentation system, 
create giant photovoltaic current from centrosymmetric single crystal of SrTiO3, TiO2, and Si. This 
strain-gradient-induced bulk photovoltaic effect, which we call the flexo-photovoltaic effect, function in 
the absence of a p-n junction. This find may extend present solar cell technology by boost the 
solar energy conversion efficiency from a wide pool of establish semiconductors.

laser properly polarize by a half-wavelength plate. A conduc- 
tive AFM tip applies a local force on a sample surface and 
simultaneously collect the resultant PV current. A brief sche- 
matic of the Ph-AFM setup be show in Fig. 1, A and B. 

SrTiO3 single crystal be one of the ideal system to study 
the flexoelectric effect thanks to it simple cubic centrosym- 
metric lattice and large dielectric permittivity (14, 20). Unlike 
it sister material BaTiO3, ordinary SrTiO3 crystal do not ex- 
hibit the BPV effect because they have a center of inversion 
symmetry. But, with illumination around the contact area on 
a (001)-face of SrTiO3 crystal, we observe that ISC exhibit a 
large transient peak a the load force be increase from 1 
μN to 18 μN (Fig. 1C), which be reproducible, proven by re- 
peated exertion/withdrawal of the load force. 

To show that the giant enhancement of ISC by the point 
force be not confine to SrTiO3 crystal or a cubic structure, 
we investigate the force-induced PV current in a single crys- 
tal of rutile TiO2, which be well-known for it photoelectric 
application such a dye-sensitized photovoltaic cell and 
photocatalysis. As in the case of SrTiO3, large negative ISC ap- 
pear once a large force be exert on a TiO2 (100) face. Figure 
1D show a stable current under the 15 μN force, confirm 
that the force-induced PV effect be not a transient effect in 
this material. Although it depends on contact condition and 
locations, the point force exert by the AFM tip give rise to 
a substantial current density up to about 1 A/cm2 at the na- 
noscale contact area. This be over three order of magnitude 
high than ISC (0.3 mA/cm2) obtain from a Schottky junc- 
tion between TiO2 and Pt under the same illumination condi- 
tion (see section S6 of (16)). 

The current density increase more than 100 time by 
simply increase the load force from 1 to 15 μN (Fig. 1E). 
This cannot be explain with an increase of the contact area 
with the load force because a contact area increase at 
most ~6 time with a 15 time large contact force in a simple 
elastic sphere contact model (see section S2 of (16)). Moreo- 
ver, a 100 time increase of the contact area with an AFM tip 
be unphysical. It should be note that ISC turn to a positive 
value when load the conductive AFM tip on a (001)-face of 
the TiO2 crystal in contrast to the negative value of ISC on it 
(100)-face (Fig. 1F). The fact that the direction of the PV cur- 
rent depends on the crystallographic orientation of the TiO2 
crystal indicates that the observe PV effect cannot be merely 
attribute to a probable Schottky contact form by the TiO2 
surface and the Pt-coating of the AFM tip. 

A potential origin of this PV current enhancement be the 
BPV effect. As hypothesized, it be likely that a point force ex- 
erted on a crystal surface generates a local strain gradient, 
result in local centrosymmetry break and, thus, a local 
BPV current under illumination, i.e., the FPV effect, in the 
absence of a p-n junction and an appropriate band alignment. 
Given that both the flexoelectric response and the BPV effect 

depend on the crystallographic orientation (19–21), our re- 
sults suggest a predominant role of the strain gradient and 
the resultant FPV effect in the enhance local PV current. 

The strain gradient induced by a sphere contact have a 
complex spatial distribution with giant strain gradient value 
in an elastic material, a described in section S2 of (16). An 
AFM tip apex can be approximate a a hemisphere and the 
distribution of strain gradient induced by the AFM tip can be 
calculate analytically with the Hertzian model and the Bous- 
sinesq’s calculation (22). Figure 2 show the spatial distribu- 
tions of the z-component of the calculate strain and it 
derivative with respect to z under ~15.7 μN force with a 10- 
nm-radius contact area at the origin. The strain gradient be a 
large a 107 m−1. Interestingly, we found that the ISC density 
and the volume beneath the AFM tip be subject to a strain 
gradient large than 1 × 106 m−1 show similar dependence on 
the exert force (Fig. 1E); the detailed process to obtain the 
relative volume can be found in fig. S9 of (16)). It be expect 
that the giant strain gradient induced by the AFM tip break 
local symmetry, lead to the manifestation of the BPV effect 
locally under illumination. However, a relationship between 
the complex distribution of the strain gradient and the BPV 
property should be quite intricate and deep theoretical con- 
siderations be required. 

The main characteristic of the BPV effect be a periodic de- 
pendence on the angle between the PV current and the light 
polarization, stem from it tensorial nature (21). For the 
present case, this dependence be predict to be 

( )0 22FPV z zI I A B co 
π α= + (1) 

Where IFPV be the PV current, I0 be a light intensity, AZ and 
BZ be effective BPV coefficient of the locally deform crys- 
tal, and α be the polarization angle of the incident light with 
respect to the top surface edge a described in section S3 of 
(16). The FPV effect should inherit the distinctive feature of 
the BPV effect and exhibit a sinusoidal dependence on the 
incident light polarization angle with a period of 180°. In- 
deed, ISC measure by a conductive AFM tip in the configura- 
tion illustrate in Fig. 1B on the SrTiO3 (010) and TiO2 (001) 
surface exhibit a light polarization dependence in accord 
with Eq. 1, a see in Fig. 3. The sinusoidal behavior upon 
rotate the light polarization provide strong evidence that 
the underlie mechanism of the force-induced PV effect be 
the BPV effect generate by local symmetry break due to 
inhomogeneous strain, namely the FPV effect. 

The FPV effect should be neither confine to ionic crystal 
nor restrict to nanoscale geometries. First, we perform 
the same experiment (as in Fig. 1) on an HF-passivated sur- 
face of a commercial p-type Si (001) crystal. Similarly, ISC in- 
crease two order of magnitude from ~5 pA with the 1 μN 
load force to ~0.5 nA with the 15 μN load force (Fig. 4A 
and section S7 of (16)). Secondly, the FPV effect could also be

demonstrate use a home-built indentation system that de- 
form a semiconductor use a conductive tungsten probe 
needle with a radius of about 10 μm (fig. S1 of (16)). Figure 
4B show crystallographic orientation dependent photocur- 
rent-voltage (I-V) characteristic of the SrTiO3 crystal ac- 
quired under 4 N mechanical force exert by the probe 
needle and 405 nm laser illumination directly to the probe 
contact area a in Fig. 1A. These linear I-V characteristic be 
similar to those of ferroelectrics under illumination (23). The 
oscillate PV current with the rotate light polarization, 
which be well fit with Eq. 1 (Fig. 4C), demonstrates the FPV 
effect under the indentation force in the micrometer scale. 
The crystallographic orientation dependent PV current be also 
observe on the TiO2 crystal by the indentation system (fig. 
S2 of (16)). The persistence of the FPV effect from the na- 
noscale (AFM) to the micrometer level be promising for future 
device design and potential applications. The FPV effect be 
not related to a plasmonic effect found in the tip-enhanced 
Raman scatter because only an atomically sharp tip 
coat with Ag or Au show the plasmonic enhancement in 
the visible range (24), whereas we use platinum or tungsten 
probe range from the nanoscale to the micrometer scale. 
Likewise, a potential cubic-to-tetragonal phase transition in- 
duced in a SrTiO3 single crystal under a large hydrostatic 
pressure (>6 GPa) should not play a large role here because 
of the centrosymmetric nature of the induced tetragonal 
phase (25). 

We emphasize here four main feature of the FPV effect. 
First, the separation of the photoexcited carrier in the FPV 
effect be control by the local symmetry and the resultant 
local BPV effect, in which the power conversion efficiency can 
in principle exceed the S-Q limit (8). Second, to obtain a high 
photocurrent from any semiconductor, only a strain gradient 
generator, such a a sharp probe with a sufficient load 
force be necessary. This should be distinguish from the pre- 
vious report that a strain gradient modifies a bandgap, but 
the charge separation in the photoelectric process still re- 
quire a proper band alignment (26) or a nanostructure (27, 
28). Third, whereas the BPV effect be allow only in non-cen- 
trosymmetric materials, the FPV effect be universal. It be al- 
low by symmetry in all material thanks to the universal 
nature of the strain-gradient-induced centrosymmetry break- 
ing. The FPV effect can be realize not only in ionic crystal 
(SrTiO3 and TiO2) and covalent crystal (Si), but be also rele- 
vant to any semiconductor range from organic-inorganic 
hybrid perovskites to semiconducting polymer and even top- 
ological insulators. For instance, the topological insulator 
Bi2Te3 with a centrosymmetric structure exhibit the BPV ef- 
fect by mean of the flexoelectric effect (29). Finally, give 
that the BPV effect consists of asymmetric quantum mechan- 
ical process such a photoexcitation, relaxation, recombina- 
tion, and scattering, we demonstrate that one can readily 

control the quantum mechanical process by macroscopic 
tool such a an AFM tip and a probe needle. 

The configuration of our photovoltaic indentation system 
be very simple and the FPV effect can be increasingly signifi- 
cant with material dimension decrease into the nanoscale 
where flexoelectricity be more important (11). Thus, an im- 
portant strain engineering route for improve the final per- 
formance of solar cell and optoelectronic device be now 
open. For example, a tandem solar cell can be easily fabri- 
cat by combine an array of indenters and a conventional 
p-n junction, enable a high efficiency because the FPV ef- 
fect can be design to add to the exist PV current gener- 
ated by the bury p-n junction. Given that the lattice 
mismatch at the interface and crystallographic disorder in 
epitaxial and polycrystalline thin film solar cell give rise to 
substantial strain gradient (30–32), the associate FPV effect 
would dramatically impact the performance of these solar 
cells, which however remains largely unexplored. In addition 
to inorganic solar cells, the FPV effect be also likely to play an 
important role in flexible and stretchable electronics base 
on organic and polymeric semiconductors. Not only the bend- 
ing of flexible organic device at a macroscopic level (33) but 
also the fold and entanglement of the polymeric chain in 
a nanoscale level would generate sizable strain gradient (34), 
which redistribute the electron cloud of π-molecular orbits, 
modify the electronic transport and induce the FPV ef- 
fect under illumination (15, 35). The detailed effect of strain 
gradient and FPV effect on the nanoscale electronic proper- 
tie remain an open question.

Fig. 1. Force-induced photovoltaic effect in centrosymmetric SrTiO3 and 
TiO2 single crystals. (A) Setup for illumination around the contact area. The 
tip load force be control by the feedback loop of atomic force 
microscope. (B) Setup for illumination on the side surface. The sidewise 
illumination geometry have be chosen to avoid the effect of Fresnel 
reflection and have light absorption be independent of the light 
polarization. Evolution of the photocurrent induced and collect by a 
conductive AFM tip with a high load force on (C) SrTiO3 (001) face and 
(D) TiO2 (100) face. (E) The load force dependence of the induced 
photocurrent density and the relative volume subject to the strain gradient 
high than 1 × 106 m−1 (see fig. S9 of (16)). (F) Positive photocurrent 
measure on TiO2 (001) face with a 15 μN force apply by the AFM tip.

Fig. 4. Flexo-photovoltaic effect extend to covalent crystal and to the 
micrometer scale. (A) Force-induced photocurrent on (001) Si crystal measure by 
Ph-AFM under illumination of the top intend surface. (B) Current-voltage 
characteristic measure on (001) and (111) face of a SrTiO3 crystal by the micro-

light polarization dependence of the photocurrent on a SrTiO3 (010) face measure 
by the micro-indenter under illumination on the side surface. The red line be the fitting 
of experimental data with Eq. 1. Because the polarization angle origin of the micro- 
indenter be not coincident with the Ph-AFM setup, the oscillate ISC have a phase shift 
compare with Fig. 3B.
