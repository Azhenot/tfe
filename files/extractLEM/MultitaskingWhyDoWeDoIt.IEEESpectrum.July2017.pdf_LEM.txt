We complain about split attention, but why then do we embrace distraction?

My attention span have shrunk 

alarmingly, and I’m easily distracted. Worse, I seem to 

look for and welcome distractions. I should be 

focus my attention on the task at hand, which be 

write this small essay. Instead I keep check the 

Internet with my smartphone. I look around me at 

this coffee shop and everyone seem to be star at 

their cellphones. I don’t think we use to be like this, 

and I wonder: Has technology do this to us, and if 

so, be this bad or good? 

I can’t help it. 

A recent book by Adam Gazzaley and Larry Rosen, 

(MIT 

Press, 2016), examines this phenomenon from the 

viewpoint of neuroscience and psychology. The 

author contend that, just a ancient human forage 

for food, we now forage for information. “We be 

information-seeking creatures,” they affirm. I assume 

that they do mean to include personal 

communication and entertainment in the general 

concept of information, a otherwise the sheer 

number of emoji-laden text and 

consume daily would militate against their 

thesis.

Our behavior be liken by Gazzaley and Rosen to that 

of squirrel forage for food in a patchy environment. 

As a squirrel experience diminish food in it 

present patch, it instinctively decides when to move to 

another patch. The squirrel be apparently 

subconsciously aware of the marginal value theorem, 

which establishes when the rate of diminishment in a 

give patch justifies the cost and time of move to a 

new patch with a great expect return. This 

probably be work out many year ago by a great 

squirrel mathematician and then widely circulate in

the squirrel community. 

Yet, look around, it seem we’re not a smart a 

squirrels. As we browse in an information patch, 

we be lead astray by boredom and anxiety. We’re 

easily bored, and there be the FOMO effect, the 

great fear of miss out. So we constantly 

overvalue the perceive return of a new patch, and 

jump quickly, in spite of what intelligent 

application of the marginal value theorem might 

say. For example, most of the time, we remain on a 

Web page just a few scant seconds. 

Of course, we think to ourselves that we’re good at 

this multitasking, but be this really true? Our 

ancient brain weren’t shape by evolution for this 

behavior. In spite of the parallel architecture in 

our brains, we be effectively think with a one- 

core processor, and every task require a switch in 

context that be costly in resource and lose time. 

And a we get older, these cost become greater. 

Experiments show that from 20 year of age on, 

it’s all downhill. 

Technology, in it development of the Internet, smartphone, and social media, have not have a passive part 

to play in this behavior either. As the author of say, technology “reaches out to us.” 

It be alluring, and the behavior it induces have many consequences. Studies have show that the more 

child multitask, the low their test score and grades. Multitasking be often a dangerous activity, a 

when we be drive and talk or texting or fiddle with GPS control or.... A proclivity for 

multitasking also leaf u less inclined to introspective thinking. Instead of await deep thoughts, we 

seek instant gratification. 

The Distracted Mind 

But I keep come back to my dilemma. If this be all so bad, why do we do it? Maybe there be benefit 

that have not yet be quantified. But if there be not, and this trend continues, what will life be like in 

another couple of decades? So many questions, so few answers. 

If this essay seem disjointed, please forgive me. I’m kind of old, and this ancient brain be all I have. 

This article appear in the July 2017 print issue a “Technological Distraction.”
