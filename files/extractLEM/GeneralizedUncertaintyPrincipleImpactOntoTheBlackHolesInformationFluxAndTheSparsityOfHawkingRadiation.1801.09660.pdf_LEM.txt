We investigate the generalize uncertainty principle (GUP) correction to the entropy content 
and the information flux of black holes, a well a the correction to the sparsity of the Hawking 
radiation at the late stage of evaporation. We find that due to these quantum gravity motivate 
corrections, the entropy flow per particle reduces it value on the approach to the Planck scale due 
to a good accuracy in counting the number of microstates. We also show that the radiation flow 
be no longer sparse when the mass of a black hole approach Planck mass which be not the case for 
non-GUP calculations. 

I. INTRODUCTION 

Since the 1970s it be know that it be possible to apply 
thermodynamic tool to black holes. The fact that black 
hole not only absorb but also emit radiation when quan- 
tum mechanic be take into account be first propose 
by Hawking [1, 2]. This mechanism of black hole evapo- 
ration relies on the semiclassical approach, so applies the 
method of quantum field theory. Hawking calculate the 
emission from black holes, be thermal (called Hawking 
radiation), and the associate temperature from which 
the correspond thermodynamic entropy be obtain 
[3]. The importance of this result lie in the issue that 
consider an initial pure state black hole, when it evap- 
orates (thermally), the final state be a mixed state [4]. 
Such evolution implies a nonunitary process which be not 
allow in the standard quantum mechanics. This im- 
ply loss of information during the evolution and be com- 
monly call the black hole information puzzle. This 
problem have be one of the first point of discussion con- 
cerning black hole during decade and be still unsolved. 
There exist many different proposal that try to solve it. 
Some of them consider that we should forget about a uni- 
tary process, others, assume unitary, try to find where 
the information of the process be lose and how to recover 
it. For more details, see Refs. [5–15]. 

The thermodynamic entropy be associate with the lack 
of information. In this sense, we be interested in what be 
the entropy flux in the Hawking radiation and what we 
can learn about hidden information in the correlation 
that we decide not to see because of the coarse-graining 
we consider [16]. Specifically, in this paper, we be in-

teresting in how this radiation be modify when we take 
into account effect come from pure quantum gravity. 

Recently in [17–20], one of the author of this paper, 
quantify the information budget in black hole evapora- 
tion. The start point be the calculation of the bud- 
get of entropy for a black body, where the entropy flux be 
compensate by hidden information in the correlations, 
due to the emission process be unitary. This argument 
be extend for black holes, demonstrate that the as- 
sumption of unitarity can lead to a perfectly reasonable 
entropy/information budget. It be show that during 
the evaporation process Bekenstein entropy of a black 
hole be adiabatically transfer into the Clausius entropy 
of the Hawking radiation field, hold during the whole 
evaporation process that the initial Bekenstein entropy 
be equal to the increase Clausius entropy of the radi- 
ation field and the decrease Bekenstein entropy. This 
study be do consider classical and quantum en- 
tropies and directly provide also that the total number 
of particle be proportional to the initial entropy of a black 
hole. 

Another interest aspect to note, be the (extreme) 
sparsity of the Hawking radiation during the evaporation 
process [21–25]. The average time between emission of 
successive Hawking quanta, be many time large than 
the natural timescale set by the energy of the emit 
quantum themselves. 

At the late stage of the Hawking evaporation pro- 
cess, one should take into account the strong effect com- 
ing from the underlie theory of quantum gravity that 
can modify Hawking temperature [1] and Bekenstein en- 
tropy [3]. These modification express in term of gen- 
eralized uncertainty principle (GUP) have be investi- 
gate in the context of string theory [26–30], loop quan- 
tum gravity [31, 32], modify dispersion relation and 
from black hole physic [34, 36–45]. As a consequence of 
these modifications, black hole do not evaporate com- 
pletely and be left with a remnant of order of Planck size

with finite entropy. It be suggest that these Planck 
size remnant store information [14, 33–35] which give a 
possible solution to the information puzzle. 

It be possible to have two different kind of correction 
of the entropy. First of them come from the quan- 
tum correction in counting microstates, keep fix 
the horizon area (microcanonical corrections) [41]. These 
correction will reduce the entropy a a consequence of 
the reduction of the uncertainty over the underlie mi- 
crostates. The second kind of a correction be not related 
to the fundamental degree of freedom, but corrects the 
entropy by consider thermal fluctuation on the hori- 
zon area (canonical corrections) [42]. Contrary to the 
former one, in this latter case, the entropy increases, a 
one add uncertainty to the system. In this paper we 
be interested in the quantum correction when the black 
hole reach the Planck scale, so we will consider only the 
microcanonical correction (that can also be understood 
a more fundamental). We investigate how these cor- 
rections modify the information flow and sparsity of the 
Hawking radiation. These correction be express by 
the GUP and first of all they influence the Bekenstein 
entropy and the Hawking temperature, then extend 
onto other related quantities. 

In Sec. II we review the key result about the informa- 
tion content of black hole a give in Refs. ([17–20]). In 
Sec. III we discus the GUP correction to the flow of in- 
formation in black hole when they approach the Planck 
mass. In Sec. IV we study the GUP modification to the 
frequency of emission of Hawking quanta. The summary 
of our result be give in Sec. V. 

II. ENTROPY OF BLACK HOLES PER 
EMITTED QUANTA 

In Ref. [17] the average entropy release during the 
standard thermodynamic process of burning a lump of 
coal in a blackbody furnace be calculated. It be useful to 
present this entropy in a dimensionless fashion, express 
in unit of nats or bits. Henceforth, the entropy in nats 
be Ŝ = S/kB , and the entropy in bit be just define a 

Ŝ2 = S/(kB ln 2), where kB be the Boltzmann constant 
and S the original (dimensionfull) entropy. The explicit 
result for an average entropy flow in black body radiation 
be obtain to be 

〈Ŝ2〉 = 
π4 

30ζ(3)ln2 
bits/photon ≈ 3.90 bits/photon. (1) 

The standard deviation of Eq. (1) be

)2 
bits/photon 

≈ 2.52 bits/photon, (2) 

where ζ(n) be the Riemann zeta function. 

This reason be then extend to the black 
hole evaporation process, determine the flux of en- 
tropy/information emit in the form of radiation (as- 
sum an exact Planck spectrum a first approxima- 
tion) [18, 19]. For the case of a Schwarzschild black 
hole with mass M , the Bekenstein entropy loss per emit- 
ted massless boson be found to be equal to the entropy 
content per photon in black body radiation. In addition, 
after calculate the gain of entropy in the Hawking flux, 
one find that all the information emit by a black hole 
be perfectly compensate by the entropy gain of the radi- 
ation, so that the information be completely transmit 
from the hole to the external radiation [18, 19]. 

One can also estimate the total number of emit 
quantum in term of the original Bekenstein entropy a 
be equal to [18, 19] 

N = 
30ζ(3) 

π4 
Ŝ2 ≈ 0.26 Ŝ2. (3) 

According to these results, it be shown, semiclassi- 
cally, how it be possible to describe the evaporation 
process of a black hole with an explicit and continuous 
flux of entropy (from the hole into the radiation), where 
each photon carry an amount of entropy that should be 
compensate by information hidden in correlation (as- 
sum that the evaporation be a unitary process). 

III. GUP CORRECTIONS TO THE ENTROPY 
OF BLACK HOLES 

The calculation involve Hawking radiation be usu- 
ally perform use semiclassical methods, but when the 
size of a system approach the Planck scale, they cease 
to be valid and it be the full theory of quantum gravity 
which should be applied. As still there be no complete 
theory of quantum gravity, what one usually considers 
be some correction to the classical theory come from 
the quantum nature of spacetime. In our case of interest, 
we will investigate the correction in the Hawking tem- 
perature and the Bekenstein entropy. These correction 
be first suggest in string theory [28, 29] and in loop 
quantum gravity [31, 32]. In fact, it be possible to di- 
rectly apply the generalize uncertainty principle (GUP) 
to describe such correction [34, 41]. They be apply in 
order to accurately count the number of microstates that 
describe a black hole, and this translates into quantum 
correction to microcanonical entropy. 

The GUP modifies the Heisenberg principle, in pres- 
ence of a gravitational field, at the Planck energy 
into [34–44]

where x be the position, p the momentum, and

with α0 a dimensionless constant, lpl the Planck length, 
~ the Planck constant, and α a constant with the dimen- 
sion of inverse momentum i.e. kg−1m−1s. The value 
of α0 have be largely discuss in the literature and it 
depends on the correction we want to apply to our sys- 
tem [34, 40–42, 46–48]. In the case that concern u it 
have a negative value due to the microcanonical correc- 
tions we consider (as it be detailed in the introduction) 
and be of order unity on the theoretical basis (showing 
only our ignorance of the exact correction to the uncer- 
tainty principle from quantum gravity) [34, 41]. Recently, 
some investigation be discuss observational bound 
over the value of α0 [46–49]. There have even be also 
claim that α0 be not a pure number, but depends on the 
ratio mp/M where M be the black hole mass and mp be 
the Planck mass [47]. The GUP correction should be 
apply to a black hole evaporation process at it final 
stage (when the size of a black hole be of the magnitude 
of the Planck scale) and so they imply a modification of 
the information/entropy carry by the emit particle 
a it be explain below. 

Following [34], we can write Hawking temperature of a 
black hole by use the uncertainty relation ∆p∆x ≈ ~; 
and near the horizon of a black hole, the position uncer- 
tainty have a minimum value of ∆x = 2lp, where for the 
case of a Schwarzschild black hole, lp = 2GM/c

lead to an energy uncertainty

where, m2p = ~c/G, G be the Newton’s gravitational con- 
stant and c be the speed of light. Similarly, use GUP, 
we can derive TGUP . For this purpose, one can express 
∆p in term of ∆x from Eq. (4) and it give

Again by the same argument above and use ∆x = 2lp =

Using this modify Hawking temperature, TGUP , we ob- 
tain a generalize formula for Bekenstein entropy that 
take into account the GUP corrections. For this pur- 
pose, we use dSGUP = c

and we have assume that the integration constant S0 =

expressions, we be now able to calculate the GUP modi-

procedure developed in Ref. [18]), so

From now on we will use only the first two term in Eq.

carry per escape particle it be not always the same

decrease it size on the approach to the Planck length. 
This result make sense together with the fact that some

correction we have introduced, reduces it entropy. By

that result in decrease the total of emit particles. 
Such a correction make sense consider that the final 
state of evaporation be a remnant of the Planck size. 

IV. SPARSITY OF HAWKING RADIATION 
MODIFIED BY GUP 

An interest characteristic of the Hawking flux be 
that it be very sparse during the whole evaporation pro- 
cess. In order to probe this, one can use several dimen- 
sionless quantity that give the ratio between an average 
time between the emission of two consecutive quantum and 
the natural time scale [21]. 

In the first approximation one assumes the exact 
Planck spectrum and it result in a general expression 
for the Minkowski spacetime, that should be specify de- 
pending on a dimensionless parameter η (for a detailed 
discussion, see Ref. [21]) give by 

η = C 
λ2thermal 
gA 

, (22) 

where the constant C be dimensionless and depends on 
the specific parameter (η) we be choosing, g be the spin 
degeneracy factor, A be the area and 

λthermal = 2π~c/(kBT ) (23) 

be the “thermal wavelength.” 
For a Schwarzschild black hole the temperature in the 

thermal wavelength be give by the Hawking tempera- 
ture and the area should be replace by an effective area 
(that corresponds to the universal cross section at high 
frequencies) give by Aeff = 27/4A, where A be a horizon 
area of a black hole. In this case, the relevant factor in 
any dimensionless parameter result in 

λ2thermal 
Aeff 

= 
64π3 

27 
∼ 73.5...� 1, (24) 

for massless bosons. Consequently, any of the dimen- 
sionless parameter be much large than unity (contrary 
that emitter under normal laboratory conditions, where 
η � 1). This implies that the gap between successive 
Hawking quantum be on average much large than the nat- 
ural timescale associate with each individual emit 
quantum, so the flux be very sparse. It be interest to 
note that the mass M of a black hole drop out during 
the calculations. 

What be relevant here be that both the area and the 
“thermal wavelength” be GUP-modified when the sys- 
tem approach the Planck scale. This result in modi- 
fying the frequency of emit quantum from a black hole. 

We obtain that the new generalize by GUP effective 
area be

be consistent with the original calculation [21]. 

It be worth emphasize again that the dimensionless 

parameter 
λ2thermal 
Aeff 

|GUP depends on the initial mass of 
the black hole M and the GUP parameter α. At early 
stage of the Hawking evaporation process, this be not 
relevant (due to the huge mass of a black hole) and 
this dimensionless parameter be much great than one. 
However, when a black hole approach the Planck mass 
at the late evaporation time, the parameter approach 
unity and finally becomes less than one. Note that for 
high value of α, this dimensionless parameter start 
decrease for small value of mass, that be for early 
phase of an evaporation process. This result indicates 
that the Hawking flux be no longer sparse when the black 
hole approach the Planck mass, and that this regime 
depends of the specific GUP parameter, although the 
qualitative result be the same for all value of α. In [50] 
a similar result from calculate the sparsity of Hawking 
flux close to the Planck scale, use correction come 
from backreaction effect have be studied. It be in- 
teresting to note that how different approach for that 
scale lead to qualitative similar results, which reassert 
the behavior of the Hawking flux at the final stage of 
evaporation. 

V. SUMMARY 

We have investigate quantum gravity modification 
to the entropy and temperature of an evaporate black 
hole express by the generalize uncertainty principle 
(GUP), that will be relevant when it approach the 
Planck size. In this process, GUP prevents complete 
evaporation leave a final remnant of the Planck size. 
We have show that these modification change the flow 
of information from black hole when they approach the 
Planck mass, and also influence amount of the sparsity 
of the Hawking radiation. 

We have consider microcanonical correction that 
be take into account in order to more accurately count 
the microstates that describe a black hole. This proper 
count of microstates allows to reduce the uncertainty, so 
the entropy be diminish in comparison to the semiclas- 
sical calculation. 

The first important result we have obtain be that 
the radiation flux, although continuous, do not always 
carry the same amount of information. Once the evap- 
oration reach it final stage (that is, the black hole 
size approach the Planck length), the entropy budget 
carry by escape particle reduces drastically, there- 
fore the hidden information in the system also reduces. 
In addition be also interest to note how also the total 
number of emit particle be reduced, what be consistent 
with the presence of a final remnant. 

The second important result be that although the 
Hawking radiation flux be extremely sparse during the 
evaporation once the semiclassical regime be considered, 
when we take into account the GUP modification this be 
no longer the case and the radiation cease to be sparse 
when the process reach it last stage which be close 
to the Planck scale. 

These result help to understand the behaviour of the 
flux of Hawking particle and the information loss from 
the black holes. They show how modification com- 
ing from quantum gravity (here- the GUP corrections) 
change the semiclassical picture of the entropy flux, when 
a black hole approach last stage of their evaporation 
processes.
