Topological data analysis offer a robust way to extract useful information from noisy, unstructured data by 
identify it underlie structure. Recently, an efficient quantum algorithm be propose [Lloyd, Garnerone, 
Zanardi, Nat. Commun. 7, 10138 (2016)] for calculate Betti number of data point – topological feature 
that count the number of topological hole of various dimension in a scatterplot. Here, we implement a proof- 
of-principle demonstration of this quantum algorithm by employ a six-photon quantum processor to success- 
fully analyze the topological feature of Betti number of a network include three data points, provide new 
insight into data analysis in the era of quantum computing. 

In exploratory data analysis and data mining, our data often 
encodes extremely valuable information, but be typically large, 
unstructured, noisy, and incomplete, such that extract use- 
ful information from the data be an important yet challenge 
task. Topological data analysis (TDA) [1] provide a general 
framework for study such data in a manner that be insensi- 
tive to the particular metric and robust against noise. In partic- 
ular, persistent homology [2, 3] have be well establish a 
a technique for extract useful information by identify 
topological feature of data. One essential feature be the num- 
ber of k-dimensional hole and void in datasets, that is, the 
k-th Betti number βk (a topological invariant). For instance, 
the first three Betti numbers, β0, β1 and β2, represent respec- 
tively the number of connect components, one-dimensional 
holes, and two-dimensional voids. The Betti number abstract 
away the actual data, reduce it to a purely topological repre- 
sentation, which be valuable for understand the underlie 
structure of datasets. The field of use topological data anal- 
ysis to analyze Betti number of data have be grow rapidly 
in recent years, yield application in image recognition [4], 
signal processing [5], network science [6, 7], sensor analysis 
[8–11], brain connectomics [12, 13], and fMRI data analysis 
[14, 15], just to name a few. 

Practically however, when face the issue of compu- 
tational complexity, classical topological method pose a 
formidable task: a set of n data point posse 2n potential 
subset that could contribute to the topology, quickly over- 
whelm even the most powerful classical computers, even 
for not-so-large datasets. So far the best classical algorithm 
for estimate Betti number to all order with accuracy δ 
take time O(2nlog(1/δ)) [16–21]. Moreover, exact calcula- 
tion of Betti number be know to be PSPACE-hard for some 
class of topology [22]. 

Recently, Lloyd et al. [23, 24] extend method from 
quantum machine learn to TDA for efficiently estimate 
Betti number to all orders. Indeed, if the proportion of k- 
simplices generate from a dataset be large enough, the quan- 

tum algorithm for calculate Betti number to all order with 
accuracy δ have runtime O(n5/δ) – exponentially faster than 
the best know classical algorithms. Furthermore, the algo- 
rithm do not require a large-scale quantum random access 
memory (qRAM) [25] – just O(n2) bit be sufficient for the 
algorithm to store the information of all pairwise distance be- 
tween the n data points. The potential computational speedup 
and it practicality will likely make quantum TDA a promis- 
ing application for future quantum computers, in addition to 
Shor’s algorithm [26–29], quantum simulation [30–33], solv- 
ing linear system [34, 35], and classification of linear vector 
[36–38]. 

Here we report a proof-of-principle demonstration of the 
quantum TDA algorithm on a small-scale photonic quantum 
processor for the first time. The topological feature of Betti 
number of three data point be reveal and monitor at 
two different topological scale in our experiment. Our exper- 
iment successfully demonstrates the viability of the algorithm 
and suggests that data analytics may be an important future 
application for quantum computing, with widespread applica- 
tions in our increasingly data-centric world. 

To calculate Betti numbers, we first represent data topolog- 
ically in term of relationship between data points. Using 
a cutoff distance �, we group data point into simplices (see 
Fig. 1(a))– fully-connected subset of data points. The set of 
simplices form a simplicial complex, the topological struc- 
ture from which feature such a Betti number can be ex- 
tracted. This topological construction be show in Fig. 1(b-d). 

By determine the complete set of Betti number over 
the full range of �, we can then construct the barcode (see 
Fig. 1(e)) [39], a parameterized version of Betti number in 
a distance-dependent manner. Each bar in the region of Hk 
represent a k-dimensional hole, and the length of the bar in- 
dicates it persistence in the parameter �. With the barcode, we 
can qualitatively filter out the short bar a topological noise 
and capture the long bar a significant features, since the 
length of bar be indicative of their persistence against change

in distance �. In Fig. 1(e), a bar in the region of H1 persists 
for a long range, lead u to determine that the underlie 
topological feature of the unstructured data (Fig. 1(b)) be a cir- 
cle. 

In general, the quantum TDA algorithm have two main step 
(see Fig. 2(a)). First, one access the data to construct the 
uniform mixture of the k-simplices that encode the desire 
topological structure. The time of this step be in the bad 
case exponential and in fact depends on the proportion of k- 
simplices. In case where this fraction be large enough, this 
step can be implement efficiently either classically, or us- 
ing Grover’s algorithm, yield a further quadratic algorith- 
mic enhancement. In the quantum algorithm, this step could 
be realize via two small steps, namely: (1a) simplicial com- 
plex state preparation; (1b) uniform mixed state construction. 
Second, one implement step (2) to reveal the topological 
invariant of the structure. This step be realize use the 
phase-estimation algorithm [40], which provide an exponen- 
tial speedup over know classical procedure on a quantum 
computer, in fact [23, 24] show that this can execute in 
time O(n5/δ), with accuracy δ. The step of the quantum 
algorithm be now described in more detail. 

Implementing step (1a) construct the simplicial complex.

FIG. 2. Quantum circuit for quantum TDA. (a) Outline of 
the original quantum circuit. (b) A scatterplot include three 
data points. (c) Graph representation of the 1-simplices state 
|ϕ〉�11 = |110〉 for 3 < �1 < 4. The first and second data point be

|ϕ〉�21 = (|110〉+ |101〉)/ 

√ 
2 for 4 < �2 < 5. The first data point be 

connect to the second and third point by two edges. (e) Optimized 
circuit with 5 qubits. The block with different color represent the 
four basic stages. 

For a scatterplot include n data points, a k-simplex sk con- 
sists of k+1 point Vj0 , Vj1 , . . . , Vjk , together with k(k+1)/2 
edges, create a fully connect subset of the data. We can 
encode a k-simplex a an n-qubit quantum state |sk〉 with 
k + 1 1 at position j0, j1, ..., jk and 0 at the other remain- 
ing positions. 

The Vietoris-Rips simplicial complex S�k be the set of k- 
simplices where all point be within distance � of each other. 
In the quantum implementation, we can construct the simpli- 
cial complex state |ψ〉�k a the uniform superposition of k- 
simplices in the complex 

|ψ〉�k = 
1√ 
|S�k| 

∑ 
sk∈S�k 

|sk〉. (1) 

Classically verify whether all point in each of the sk be 
within distance � of each other could help u construct the 
simplicial complex state. Besides, we can also implement a 
multi-target Grover’s algorithm [41] with a membership or- 
acle function {f �k(sk) = 1 if sk ∈ S�k} to verify whether 
sk ∈ S�k, yield a quadratic speedup. Let H�k be the Hilbert 
space span by |sk〉 where sk ∈ S�k. The construction of 



3 

|ψ〉�k also reveals the number of k-simplices, |S�k| = dimH�k, 
and take time O(n2(ζ�k) 

−1/2), where ζ�k = |S�k|/ 
( 
n 
k+1 

) 
be the 

proportion of k-simplices that be actually in this complex at 
scale �, and (ζ�k) 

−1/2 = (|S�k|/ 
( 
n 
k+1 

) 
)−1/2 be the number of 

iteration of the multi-target Grover’s algorithm. When the 
proportion be too small, the quantum search procedure will 
fail to find the simplices [23, 24]. 

In step (1b), we construct the mixed state, 

ρ�k = 
1 

|S�k| 
∑ 
sk∈S�k 

|sk〉〈sk|, (2) 

the uniform mixture over the set of simplices in the complex. 
This procedure can be easily realize by add an n-qubit 
ancillary register, perform controlled-NOT (CNOT) oper- 
ations to copy |ψ〉�k to construct 1√|S�k| 

∑ 
sk∈S�k 

|sk〉 ⊗ |sk〉, and 

finally trace out the ancillary register to obtain ρ�k. 
Step (2) acta on the simplicial complex to reveal topological 

feature – the core of exponential speedup in the algorithm. 
Define the boundary map ∂�k that operates from H 

� 
k to H 

� 
k−1 

by, 

∂�k|sk〉 = 
∑ 
l 

(−1)l|sk−1(l)〉, (3) 

where |sk−1(l)〉 be obtain from sk with vertex j0...jl...jk 
by omit the l-th point jl from sk. The k-th Betti number 
be define a [17–20], 

β�k = dim(Ker ∂ 
� 
k/Im ∂ 

� 
k+1). (4) 

Classical algorithm for calculate Betti number to all or- 
ders with accuracy δ require time O(2nlog(1/δ)) [16–21]. In 
quantum TDA, an exponential speedup be achieve by em- 
ploying the phase-estimation algorithm. For this purpose, the 
boundary map be embed into a Hermitian matrix, 

B�k = 

( 
0 ∂�k 
∂�k 
† 0 

) 
. (5) 

Now apply phase-estimation to decompose ρ�k in term 
of the eigenvectors and eigenvalue of B�k, one obtains the 
probability η�k of project onto the kernel by measure the 
eigenvalue register. Then the dimension of the kernel of ∂�k 
can be calculate a dim(Ker ∂�k) = η 

� 
k · |S�k|. When both 

dim(Ker ∂�k) and dim(Ker ∂ 
� 
k+1) be determined, we can re- 

construct the k-th Betti number by, 

β�k =dim(Ker ∂ 
� 
k)− dim(Im ∂�k+1) 

=dim(Ker ∂�k) + dim(Ker ∂ 
� 
k+1)− |S�k+1|. (6) 

We note that for some special case for ∂�k, it be trivial to 
calculate dim(Ker ∂�k). For example, if a k-simplex do not 
exist, dim(Ker ∂�k) = |S�k| = 0, while dim(Ker ∂0) be always 
equal to the number of points. 

Careful evaluation indicates that step (2) can estimate Betti 
number to all order with accuracy δ in time O(n5/δ) 
[23, 24]. Hence, while in the bad case that their proportion 

be too small, step (1) will fail to find the k-simplices, since 
both the classical and quantum algorithm will take exponen- 
tial time. There be specific cases, in particular where step 
(1) can be implement efficiently, where the overall quan- 
tum algorithm can provide exponential savings. In fact we 
have test a particular case use data-points with random 
distance between them and show that indeed step (1) can 
be implement efficiently (see Supplement 1 for details), ei- 
ther by a classical algorithm or further improve the time by 
a square root factor through Grover’s algorithm. 

To experimentally demonstrate the quantum TDA algo- 
rithm, we choose the simplest meaningful instance: estimat- 
ing the Betti number for three data point at two different 
scales. Assume the distance between the three point be 3, 
4 and 5 (see Fig. 2(b)). For scale in the range 3 < �1 < 4 
and 4 < �2 < 5, the correspond state for 1-simplices (the 
k-simplex for k > 1 doesn’t exist since not all three data 
point can be connect at �1 and �2) be |ϕ〉�11 = |110〉 
(Fig. 2(c)) and |ϕ〉�21 = (|110〉+ |101〉)/ 

√ 
2 (Fig. 2(d)) re- 

spectively, which mean |S�11 | = 1 and |S 
�2 
1 | = 2. A simple 

quantum circuit be design to prepare |ϕ〉�11 (|ϕ〉 
�2 
1 ) directly 

by remove (adding) a Hadamard gate marked by dash 
line at step (1) in Fig. 2(e). 

To construct the correspond uniform mixed states, we 
don’t actually need to generate a complete copy of |ϕ〉�11 
(|ϕ〉�21 ). Instead, we need only perform a CNOT operation be- 
tween the auxiliary qubit |0〉A and the second qubit of |ϕ〉�11 
(|ϕ〉�21 ) to partially copy the state of simplices. After trace 
out the ancillary qubit, the uniform mixed state ρ�1 and ρ�2 
be obtained. 

Next, apply quantum phase-estimation to reveal informa- 
tion related to Betti numbers. Since there be only three data 
points, k-dimensional hole for k > 1 can not exist. There- 
fore, only the 0-th and 1-st Betti number need to be calcu- 
lated. We note that the algorithm care not about the exact 
eigenvalue spectrum, but the probability of detect |0〉 in the 
eigenvalue register. We can exploit this property to reduce the 
number of qubits require in the eigenvalue register. A par- 
ticular treatment for boundary matrix be utilized to greatly 
simplify the complex circuit (see Supplement 1 for details) 
– a single CNOT operation between the eigenvalue register 
comprise only one qubit |0〉B and the first bit of ρ�1 (ρ�2 ) 
be sufficient for realize phase-estimation. Finally, the infor- 
mation related to Betti number will be read out by measure 
the eigenvalue register. Note that since the quantum TDA al- 
gorithm only depends on how the point be connected, not 
the precise distance between points, our circuit work for all 
nontrivial case of three point (where one, or two edge be 
present). The case where zero or three edge be present be 
trivial, since we could clearly know the Betti number in the 
case that the N point be all disconnect (β0 = N , and 
βk = 0 for k > 0) or all connect (β0 = 1, and βk = 0 for 
k > 0) for N point without calculating. 

Fig. 3 show the setup of our experiment. We use single 
photon a qubits, where the logical qubits |0〉 and |1〉 be en- 
cod into horizontal (H) and vertical (V ) polarization, re- 
spectively. With these settings, the step of simplices state 
preparation becomes straightforward. |ϕ〉�11 = |V 〉3|V 〉2|H〉1

be both disentangle by polarizers into |H〉, and then pho- 
ton 3 and 6 (trigger) immediately collapse into |V 〉. Note 
that the CNOT gate can be simulated use combination of 
a polarize beam splitter (PBS) and a half-wave plate (HWP) 
[27], since the target qubits be fix at |H〉. This setup, in 
principle, suffices to demonstrate the underlie conceptual 
principle of quantum TDA. 

Before run the algorithm, we first characterize 
the performance of the optical quantum circuit. In 
the case of 4 < �2 < 5, a three-photon entangle state 
|φ〉 = (|H〉1|V 〉2|V 〉4 + |V 〉1|H〉2|H〉4)/ 

√ 
2 be generate af- 

ter implement the CNOT gate in step (1a). We mea- 
sured the fidelity of the experimentally prepared state (see 
Supplement 1 for details) a F = 0.954(6), which exceeds 
the threshold of 0.5 for the entanglement witness to confirm 
genuine multi-partite entanglement [43]. To the best of our 
knowledge, such a high fidelity for three photon entanglement 
have never be achieve before [44]. 

After trace out the ancilla in the Pauli-Z basis, the uni- 
form mixed states, 

ρ�1 = |V 〉3|V 〉2|H〉1〈V |3〈V |2〈H|1, 
ρ�2 = (|V 〉3|V 〉2|H〉1〈V |3〈V |2〈H|1 

+ |V 〉3|H〉2|V 〉1〈V |3〈H|2〈V |1)/2, (7) 

be create at the scale of 3 < �1 < 4 and 4 < �2 < 5, re- 
spectively. We characterize these state use quantum state 
tomography to reconstruct the density matrices. (See Supple- 
ment 1 for details). The fidelity Fp = (Tr

and trace distance D(ρ, ρexp) = Tr|ρ− ρexp|/2 between 

the reconstruct (ρexp) and ideal (ρ) matrix be

ρ�2 
p = 0.9819(10) and 

Dρ�1 = 0.0183(5), Dρ�2 = 0.0181(5) respectively. Further- 
more, The fidelity Fp and trace distance D be related by 
the inequality 1− 

√ 
Fp ≤ D ≤ 

√ 
1− Fp [40]. In our ex- 

periment, both Dρ�1 and Dρ�2 be locate in the range of 
0.009 ≤ D ≤ 0.135, and close to the low bound. 

The final result be read out via 6-fold coincidence 
events. Figures. 4(a,b) show the measurement result of 
the eigenvalue register at the scale of 3 < �1 < 4 and 
4 < �2 < 5, respectively. In the case of 3 < �1 < 4, with a 
probability of η�11 = 0.045(14) we measure |0〉 in the eigen- 
value register, from which we calculate the dimension of 
the kernel space a dim(Ker ∂�11 ) = η 

�1 
1 · |S 

�1 
1 | = 0.045(14). 

Since dim(Ker ∂�0) = 3 and dim(Ker ∂ 
� 
2) = |S�2| = 0 for 

� = �1 (or �2), we finally obtain the 0-th Betti number 
β�10 = 2.045(14) and 1-st Betti number β 

�1 
1 = 0.045(14), fol- 

low Eq. 4, which can be round to β�10 = 2 and β 
�1 
1 = 0. 

In the case of 4 < �2 < 5, the probability of measure |0〉 
in the eigenvalue register be 0.038(9). Using the same ap- 
proach, we calculate the 0-th and 1-st Betti number a 
β�20 = 1.076(18) and β 

�2 
1 = 0.038(9), respectively, which can 

be round to β�20 = 1 and β 
�2 
1 = 0. That be to say, we have 

reveal and tracked the topological feature of the dataset 
in Fig. 2(b) at two different scales: the number of connect 
component at scale of �1 and �2 be 2 and 1, respectively, 
and no k-dimensional hole for k > 1 exist. From these re- 
sults, the barcode be construct a show in Fig. 4(c).

acterize the overlap between experimental and theoretical

data in Fig. 4 show the result a γ�1 = 0.955(3) and 
γ�2 = 0.962(2), indicate near perfect experimental accu- 
racy, confirm that the algorithm be successful. 

We note that for the quantum TDA algorithm, the result be 
read out by measure the eigenvalues. In general, the eigen- 
value register require only a few qubits for the quantum TDA 
algorithm (1 qubit in the current work), since we only care 
about the proportion of |0〉 in the eigenvalue register, rather 
than the exact value of all eigenvalues. Thus, a small amount 
of measurement be sufficient for obtain reliable results, 
an important feature for the scalability of the algorithm. 

In addition, theoretically, for the quantum TDA algorithm, 
only the qubits in the eigenvalue register need to be measured, 
rather than have to measure all qubits. In our experiment, 
since the photon generate by spontaneous parametric down 
conversion be probabilistic, to ensure that all qubits in the cir- 
cuit have be generated, and the quantum circuit have be 
fully implemented, we need to measure 6-fold coincidence 
events. In fact, this be a common problem encounter in the 
current linear optical quantum computing. Fortunately, with 
the development of deterministic quantum dot single photon 
source [46], and other technique [47], we believe this prob- 

lem can eventually be overcome. We anticipate that with more 
qubits (more photon [42, 48] or high dimensional state 
[49, 50]), our proposal could be extend to the analysis of 
much large datasets in the future. 

In summary, we have present the first proof-of-principle 
demonstration of quantum TDA on a small-scale photonic 
quantum processor. The topological feature of a dataset com- 
prise three data point be reveal and tracked at two differ- 
ent topological scales, fully reproduce the Betti number as- 
sociated with the topology of the data. Future advance in the 
field could open up new frontier in data analysis for quantum 
computing, include signal and image analysis, astronomy, 
network and social medium analysis, behavioral dynamics, bio- 
physics, oncology and neuroscience.

FIG. 5. Several example for the explanation of Betti numbers, 
demonstrate their ability to capture structural information even in 
the presence of local deformations. 

Betti number be a way to describe the connectivity within 
a topological space. In simplest terms, the k-th Betti number 
βk count the the number of k-dimensional hole in a topo- 
logical space, for example, 

- β0 be the number of connect components; 
- β1 be the number of planar hole (1-dimensional holes); 
- β2 be the number of two-dimensional void (2-dimensional 

holes); 
- ... 
Betti number be topological invariants. If two Betti num- 

bers be the same for two different space then the space be 
homotopy equivalent [1]. To demonstrate Betti number more 



6 

vividly, some example be show in Fig. 5. We can see that 
a circle have a connect component, a 1-dimensional holes, 
thus β0 = 1, β1 = 1. The Betti number of circle be the 
same a a triangle, so they be be homotopy equivalent (see 
Fig. 5(a)); Similarly, the two-dimensional hollow sphere be 
homotopy equivalent to a hollow tetrahedron (see Fig. 5(b)). 
Thus, Betti number can record significant topological fea- 
tures of a shape, which could be directly use in pattern recog- 
nition [51], anomaly detection [52], computational linguistics 
[53]. For instance, consider a simple shape recognition 
task, namely the recognition of print letters, by use the 
Betti numbers, we could identify and distinguish the letter 
“A” and “B” in Fig. 5(c), even in the presence of some defor- 
mation. 

Now, we briefly introduce some mathematical background 
for Betti numbers. For more details, one can refer to [54]. 

We first describe how to use a simplicial complex to for- 
mally describe a topological structure. 

Simplex: A k-simplex σk = [Vj0 , · · · , Vjk ] be a fully con- 
nected set of k + 1 affine geometric point Vj0 , · · · , Vjk , to- 
gether with k(k+1)/2 edge (see Fig 1(a) for some example). 
where k be the dimension of the simplex. 

Simplicial complex: Roughly speaking, a simplicial com- 
plex K be a finite set simplices (see Fig. 1(d) for an example) 
such that: 
i) any face of a simplex of K be a simplex of K, 
ii) the intersection of any two simplices of K be either 

empty or a common face of both. 
Next, we will introduce the chain group, boundary operator, 

cycle group and boundary group, and then how to calculate the 
Betti numbers. 
k-chain group: A k-chain be a formal sum of k-simplices 

with integer coefficients, which can be write a c = 
p∑ 
i=1 

εiσi 

with εi ∈ Z2, where {σ1, · · · , σp} be the set of k-simplices of 
K. The set of all k-chains form an Abelian group Ck(K). 
k-boundary operator: For a k-simplex σk = 

[Vj0 , · · · , Vjk ], the boundary map ∂k : Ck(K) → Ck−1(K) 
be give by 

∂k(σ) = 
k∑ 
i=0 

(−1)i[Vj0 , · · · , V̂ji , · · · , Vjk ] 

where V̂ji indicates that Vji be removed, and 
[Vj0 , · · · , V̂ji , · · · , Vjk ] be the k − 1-simplex span by 
all the vertex except Vji . 
k-boundary group and k-cycle group: The k-boundary 

group be define a Bk(K) = Im ∂k+1 = {c ∈ Ck(K)|∃c′ ∈ 
Ck+1(K), ∂k+1(c 

′) = c}, contain element that be 
boundary of k + 1-dimensional objects; The k-cycle group 
be define a Zk(K) = Ker ∂k = {c ∈ Ck(K)|∂kc = 0}, the 
element in the cycle group can be understood a ‘loops’. It 
can be prove that Bk(K) ⊆ Zk(K) ⊆ Ck(K). 

Homology group: Let K be an k-dimensional simplicial 
complex. The kth homology group Hk(K) associate with 
K be define by Hk(K) ≡ Zk(K)/Bk(K), which represent 
those element of Zk(K) (loops) that be not boundaries. 

Betti numbers: The k-th Betti number βk be define by 
βk(K) ≡ dim Hk(K) = dim(Ker ∂k/Im ∂k+1). 

Using Betti numbers, we can detect invisible geometric fea- 
tures of high-dimensional objects. Applying Betti number to 
data analysis could help u analyze and exploit the complex 
topological and geometric structure underlie data. Next, 
we will introduce how to use persist homology, a sophisticated 
topological data analysis method, to extract useful informa- 
tion by identify the topological feature (Betti numbers) of 
data. 

From point to simplicial complex: In data analysis, data be 
usually represent a an unordered sequence of point (see 
Fig. 1(b)), to analyze the Betti number of data, require a 
method to construct a simplicial complex. 

To define a simplicial complex, the most obvious way be to 
use the point a the vertex of a combinatorial graph whose 
edge be determine by proximity. Using a cutoff distance �, 
and connect point within distance � (see Fig 1. (b-d) for 
the procedure), we can construct the simplicial complex (see 
Fig 1. (d)), call a Vietoris-Rips simplicial complex. 

Computing Betti numbers: Having construct the simpli- 
cial complex of data points, we use the method above to cal- 
culate Betti numbers, find the topological structure of the 
data points. 

Barcode: Converting data point into a simplicial complex 
require a choice of parameter – cutoff distance �. However, 
if � be too small, almost all point be separated, and no over- 
all structure be apparent; if � be too large, all the point may 
be connect with each other, the complex be a single high di- 
mensional simplex, and no topological hole exist. It be chal- 
lenging to select an appropriate scale for a give dataset. To 
address this problem, we observe the evolution of topologi- 
cal feature for the full range of �, rather than focus on a 
particular numeric value, yield the barcode (see Fig. 1(e)). 
Each bar in the region of Hk of the barcode represent a k- 
dimensional hole, the length of which indicates it persistence 
in the parameter �. With the barcode, we can qualitatively fil- 
ter out the short bar a topological noise and capture the long 
bar a significant, persistent topological features, since the 
length of bar be indicative of their persistence against change 
in distance �. For further details, refer to [55]. 

There be many interest and useful application of topo- 
logical data analysis. For instance, in the field of image recog- 
nition, Carlsson et al. found that high-contrast 3×3 pixel 
patch from grayscale digital image concentrate near the 
surface of a Klein bottle in a higher-dimensional space [4]; 
in the field of signal processing, Perea and Harer found that 
persistent homology can detect periodicity in time-series data 
prevent noise [5], which be very stable and accurate espe- 
cially in the presence of damping; in unsupervised machine 
learning, persistent homology also provide a powerful tool 
for the analysis of musical data, explore common feature 
of classical score [56].

II. NUMERICAL SIMULATION OF THE PROPORTION 
OF k-SIMPLICES IN SOME CASES 

As mention in the main text, the efficiency of step (1) de- 
pends on the proportion of k-simplices. Here, we study the 
relationship among the proportion of k-simplices, the number 
of data point n, the dimension k of the k-simplices, and cutoff 
distance � by numerical simulation (see Fig. 6). 

In our simulations, without loss of generality, we randomly 
set the distance between different point in the range of [0,1]. 
In Fig. 6(a), we take k = 4 a an example to simulate the rela- 
tionship among the proportion of k-simplices, the number of 
data point n and cutoff distance �. Since the computational 
complexity of step (1) in quantum TDA be O(n2(ζ�k) 

−1/2), 
and the computational complexity of step (2) be O(n5/δ), 
where δ be the accuracy, we could regard step (1) a efficient 
in quantum TDA if n2(ζ�k) 

−1/2 ≤ n5/δ, that be ζ�k ≥ n−6. In 
Fig. 6(a), the blue area represent ζ�k < n 

−6, and the green 
area represent ζ�k ≥ n−6. We can see that, a n increases, 
the the green area becomes large and the blue area becomes 
smaller. Thus, with the increase of n, the step (1) be efficient 
at a wider range of cutoff distance �. 

In Fig. 6(b), we take n = 25 a an example to simulate 
the relationship between the proportion of k-simplices, their 
dimension k, and the cutoff distance �. It be clear that the 
proportion of k-simplices becomes small gradually at each 
cutoff distance � a k becomes larger. Similar to Fig. 6(a), 
we let the blue area represent ζ�k < n 

−6, and the green area 
represent ζ�k ≥ n−6, yield Fig. 6(c). We can see that even 
when k = 12 and 

( 
n 
k+1 

) 
reach the maximum 

( 
25 
12 

) 
, the green 

area can still encompass over 50% of the region. Obviously, 
by analyze all three figure in Fig. 6, the regime of step (1) 
that can be regard a efficient be much large than than that 
regard a inefficient. That is, step (1) can be implement 
efficiently in the case of our numerical simulations. 

III. EXPERIMENTAL ERRORS ANALYSIS 

In this section, we will analyze error introduce by exper- 
imental noise and provide an error threshold analysis. 

The imperfection in our experiment can be attribute to 
two major causes: higher-order photon emissions, and par- 
tial distinguishability of independent photons. In order to 
suppress the influence of higher-order photon emissions, we 
place two single-photon detector at each measurement port. 
This dual-channel setup can partially suppress higher-order 
event where both detector trigger simultaneously at one 
measurement port, indicate the presence of multiple pho- 
tons. To ensure the high level of indistinguishability between 
independent photons, all photon be spectrally filter by 3- 
nm narrow-band filters. 

The final result of the quantum TDA algorithm be decide 
by the probability of the zero eigenvalue measure in the 
eigenvalue register. Assume the ideal probability of measur- 
ing the zero eigenvalue be ηi, then the dimension of the kernel 
of ∂�k could be calculate a dim(Ker∂ 

� 
k) = ηi · |Sk|. To 

obtain the correct dimension in the experiment, we need to

ensure that |dim(Ker∂�k)ideal − dim(Ker∂�k)experiment| < 
0.5, that be |ηe − ηi| · |Sk| < 0.5 if we use the round 
principle, where ηe be the probability of the experimentally 
measure zero eigenvalue. To quantify the experimental error 
threshold, we define the error a Et = |ηe−ηi|, and then sim- 
ulate the error threshold that satisfies the constraint condition 
|ηe−ηi| · |Sk| < 0.5. The relationship between the number of 
k-simplices |Sk| (x axis) and error threshold (y axis) be show 
in Fig. 7. Obviously, a |Sk| increases, the error threshold de- 
creases. Thus, appropriate fault-tolerance mechanism should 
be employ when we deal with large-scale dataset. 

Note that unlike the the previous quantum algorithm, the 
quantum TDA algorithm only care about the probability of 
the zero eigenvalue, not all the individual value in the eigen- 
value register. Thus, the quantum TDA algorithm, in princi- 
ple, could be more robust to noise than other algorithms, such 
a Shor’s algorithm [26] and the HHL algorithm[34], which 
require an exact quantum state a output.

IV. NECESSITY OF CONSTRUCTING THE MIXED STATE 

In the quantum TDA algorithm, step (1) be use to construct 
the uniform mixture of the k-simplices, which be realize by: 
(1a) simplicial complex state preparation; (1b) uniform mixed 
state construction. In fact, the purpose of step (1) be to sample 
a uniform k-simplex, which be the essential reason for con- 
structing mixed state. 

Next, we will provide the reason why the quantum TDA al- 
gorithm can not directly use the pure state generate in step 
(1a) a the input of step (2). In step (2), we use quantum 
phase-estimation algorithm to decompose a mixed state in 
term of the eigenvectors of the Hermitian matrix Bk, which 
act on the space H�k−1 ⊕H�k, and find the probability of the 
zero eigenvalue to compute the dimension of the kernel of ∂�k. 

The mixed state be 

ρ�k = 
1 

|S�k| 
∑ 
sk∈S�k 

|sk〉〈sk|. 

where each k-simplices |sk〉 be the basis, and ρ�k be a maxi- 
mally mixed state. According to quantum mechanics, even 
use another complete basis set, the maximally mixed state 
ρ�k be still of the above form. Thus, ρ 

� 
k could be rewritteb a 

the eigenstate set {|nk〉} of ∂�k 

ρ�k = 
1 

|S�k|

|λi〉|ni〉〈ni|〈λi|. 

For each eigenstate |ni〉, the eigenvalue register will output 
it correspond eigenvalue |λi〉. Thus, The probability of 
measure the zero eigenvalue in the register be N �k(0)/|S�k|, 
where N �k(0) be the number of eigenstates in {|nk〉} whose 
eigenvalue be zero, that is, the dimension of the kernel of ∂�k. 
However, if we directly use the pure state generate in step 
(1a) a the input to step (2), after we decompose the pure state 
in term of the eigenvectors of the Hermitian matrix Bk, the 
probability of the zero eigenvalue in the register will be mean- 
ingless due to interference effects. For ease of understanding, 
we will give an example to show that use the pure state a 
the input of step (2) will output wrong results. 

For the topological structure in Fig. 8, the 1-simplices be 
|110000〉, |011000〉, |001100〉, |100100〉, |100010〉, |000011〉, 
|010001〉, which be denote a |a〉, |b〉, |c〉, |d〉, |e〉, |f〉, |g〉 
respectively. The 0-simplices be |100000〉, |010000〉, 
|001000〉, |000100〉, |000010〉, |000001〉, which be denote 
a |1〉, |2〉, |3〉, |4〉, |5〉, |6〉 respectively. The Hermitian 
operator B1 be 

B1 = 

( 
O ∂1

) 
. (8) 

where 

∂1 = 

 

|a〉 |b〉 |c〉 |d〉 |e〉 |f〉 |g〉

|5〉 0 0 0 0 −1 1 0 
|6〉 0 0 0 0 0 −1 1 

, (9) 

There be only two eigenstates of the Hermitian matrix B1 
whose eigenvalue be zero: 
|n1〉 = 1/2 (|a〉 − |e〉 − |f〉 − |g〉), 

|n2〉 = 1/ 
√ 
60 (3|a〉+ 4|b〉+ 4|c〉+ 4|d〉+ |e〉+ |f〉+ |g〉). 



9 

Therefore, after the phase-estimation algorithm, the proba- 
bility of measure the eigenvalue of zero in eigenvalue regis- 
ter should be 2/7. However, if we use the the pure state, 

|ψ〉 = 1/

input to step (2).

V. CIRCUIT DETAILS 

To implement the algorithm with a limited number of 
qubits, our design circuit differs from the original algo- 
rithm via several modifications, some of which have already 
be mention in the main text. Here we show the detail 
of the modification to phase-estimation, the core of the quan- 
tum TDA algorithm. Before introduce the modification, we 
provide two preliminaries: 

(i) Let U be an arbitrary unitary operator, the eigenvec- 
tor and eigenvalue set of which be {|u1〉, |u2〉, ..., |un〉} and 
{λ1, λ2, ..., λn}, respectively. If we transform the unitary op- 
erator U into αU2, where α 6= 0 be a constant, then the eigen- 
value set of αU2 become {αλ12, αλ22, ..., αλn2}, and the 
eigenvector set will not change. We note that if λi 6= 0, then 
αλi 

2 6= 0, else if λi = 0, then αλi2 = 0. 
(ii) Suppose |0〉⊗t|u〉 be the input of the phase-estimation 

algorithm, where |0〉⊗t be an eigenvalue register with t qubits, 
and |u〉 be an eigenvector of unitary operator U with eigen- 
value e2πiφ (φ ≈ 0.φ1...φt with binary representation). The 
phase-estimation algorithm be design to output |φ1...φt〉|u〉, 
where |φ1...φt〉 be an approximation to the phase φ with a pre- 
cision of t bits. 

Specifically, the Hermitian boundary matrix at scale 
3 < �1 < 4 and 4 < �2 < 5 be 

B�1 = 



(12) 

To reduce the number of qubits require in the eigenvalue 
register, we set B1 = (B�1)2/2, then the eigenvalue spectrum 
becomes {λ�11 , λ

the eigenvector set. We note that the algorithm care not about 
the full spectrum but the probability of |0〉 be detect in 
the register, so this special treatment be justified. Then trans- 
formingB1 into the unitary operator eiπB1 allows u to imple- 
ment phase-estimation use an eigenvalue register with only 
one qubit |0〉B . For the input |0〉B |ϕ〉�11 , we apply the trans- 
formation, 

|0〉B |ϕ〉�11 = |0〉B |110〉 =

Similarly, at the scale of �2, we set B2 = (B�2)2 and trans- 
form B2 into the unitary operator eiπB2 to meet experimen- 
tal requirements. For the input |0〉〈0|B ⊗ ρ�2 , the phase- 
estimation procedure output the state |1〉〈1|B ⊗ ρ�2 , where 
ρ�2 = (|110〉〈110|+ |101〉〈101|)/2. Thus, in our experiment, 
only a single CNOT operation between the eigenvalue register 
comprise only one qubit |0〉B and the first bit of ρ�1 (ρ�2 ) be 
sufficient for u to compile the phase-estimation algorithm. 

VI. EXPERIMENTAL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE 
CIRCUIT 

In the experiment, we use single photon a qubits, where 
the logical qubits |0〉 and |1〉 be encode into horizontal (H) 



10 

and vertical (V ) polarization, respectively. The setup of our 
experiment be show in Fig. 3. Photons in path 1, 2, and 3 
be use to construct simplex states. Photons 4 (ancilla) and 5 
(eigenvalue register) be both disentangle by polarizers into 
|H〉, and then photon 3 and 6 (trigger) immediately collapse 
into |V 〉. Here we describe detail of how to experimentally 
implement the circuit in Fig. 2(b).

ment setup. BBO: β-barium borate, POL: polarizer, HWP: half-wave 
plate, QWP: quarter-wave plate, PBS: polarize beam splitter. 

In the initialization stage, the photon in our experiment 
be generate by spontaneous parametric down-conversion 
use β-barium borate (BBO). Ultraviolet laser pulse 
pas through a BBO crystal to produce entangle state 
1/ 
√ 
2(|0〉|1〉+|1〉|0〉) (see Fig. 9(a)). If we do not want the 

entangle state, we could use a polarizer (POL) to disentangle 
the entangle state to |0〉 or |1〉 (see Fig. 9(b)). 

In the quantum gate operation stage, we need to implement 
a H gate, X gate, and CNOT gate. The single-qubit quantum 
gatesH andX can beexperimentally realize use half-wave 
plate (HWP) of 22.5◦ (see Fig. 9(c)) and 45◦ (see Fig. 9(d)), 
respectively. Since the target qubit of the CNOT gate in our 
circuit be |0〉, it can be realize use a combination of a polar- 
izing beam splitter (PBS) and a HWP, and post-selecting the 
event where there be exactly one photon exit each output 
of the PBS [27] (see Fig. 9(e)). 

In the measurement stage, each photon pass through a 
quarter-wave plate (QWP), a HWP, a PBS, and be finally read 
out by use a single-photon detector (see Fig. 9(f)). By ad- 
justing the angle of the QWP and HWP, we can measure the 
photonic qubit in arbitrary bases.

VII. PHOTON SOURCE 

We developed a high-performance source of polariza- 
tion entangle photon generate via spontaneous paramet- 
ric down-conversion (SPDC) use a sandwich-like bulk [42], 
which consists of two identically cut 2mm-thick beam-like 
type-II β-barium borate (BBO) crystal with one half-wave 
plate (HWP) insert between them. The source simultane- 
ously exhibit high brightness (∼850Hz/mW), high efficiency 
(∼45% collection efficiency with 3nm bandwidth filters, and 
∼88% collection efficiency without narrowband filtering) and 
high fidelity (∼0.98) at a pump power of 240mW. These 
three essential feature be crucial for future scalable photonic 
quantum technologies.

VIII. CHARACTERIZING THE THREE-PHOTON 
ENTANGLED STATE 

Here we show the detail for determine the fidelity of the 
three-photon entangle state |φ〉 = (|HV V 〉+ |V HH〉)/ 

√ 
2 

and verify genuine multipartite entanglement [57] use an 
entanglement witness. The fidelity be the overlap of the exper- 
imentally produce state ρexp with the desire state ρideal, 

F|φ〉 = 〈φ|ρexp|φ〉 (14) 

For the three-photon entangle state 
ρideal = |φ〉〈φ| = (|HV V 〉〈HV V |+ |V HH〉〈V HH| 
+(XXX + Y XY −XY Y + Y Y X)/4)/2 where X , 
Y and Z be the Pauli matrix σx, σy , σz respectively. 
Fig. 10 show the experimental data. The expecta- 
tion value of |HV V 〉〈HV V |+ |V HH〉〈V HH| and 
(XXX + Y XY −XY Y + Y Y X)/4 be 0.987(1) and 
0.921(12) respectively. Thus, the state fidelity of |φ〉 can be 
calculate a F|φ〉 = 0.954(6), which exceeds the threshold 
of 0.5 require for the entanglement witness. With high 
statistical significance (∼76 standard deviations), genuine 
three-photon entanglement be confirmed.
