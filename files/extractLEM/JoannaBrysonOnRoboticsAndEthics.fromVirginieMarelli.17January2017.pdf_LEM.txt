The big difference between hearing commentary from a practitioner of AI and someone who report 
on it be amazing. All of the folk I work with in the AI community up here in Seattle get a good 
chuckle out of the pop-sci reporting about our field, especially the doom and gloom click bait. 
Joanna clearly show u that she be someone who know what she be talk about. Keep fight 
the good fight.
