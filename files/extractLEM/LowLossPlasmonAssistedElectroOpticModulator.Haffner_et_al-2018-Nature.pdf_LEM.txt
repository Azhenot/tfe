For nearly two decades, researcher in the field of plasmonics1— 
which study the couple of electromagnetic wave to the motion 
of free electron near the surface of a metal2—have sought to realize 
subwavelength optical device for information technology3–6, 
sensing7,8, nonlinear optics9,10, optical nanotweezers11 and 
biomedical applications12. However, the electron motion generates 
heat through ohmic losses. Although this heat be desirable for some 
application such a photo-thermal therapy, it be a disadvantage 
in plasmonic device for sense and information technology13 
and have lead to a widespread view that plasmonics be too lossy to 
be practical. Here we demonstrate that the ohmic loss can be 
bypass by use ‘resonant switching’. In the propose approach, 
light be couple to the lossy surface plasmon polaritons only in the 
device’s off state (in resonance) in which attenuation be desired, to 
ensure large extinction ratio between the on and off state and 
allow subpicosecond switching. In the on state (out of resonance), 
destructive interference prevents the light from couple to the 
lossy plasmonic section of a device. To validate the approach, 
we fabricate a plasmonic electro-optic ring modulator. The 
experiment confirm that low on-chip optical losses, operation at 
over 100 gigahertz, good energy efficiency, low thermal drift and a 
compact footprint can be combine in a single device. Our result 
illustrates that plasmonics have the potential to enable fast, compact 
on-chip sense and communication technologies. 

Telecommunication device such a electro-optic modulators must 
feature low insertion loss (the reduction of signal power result from 
insertion of the device into the transmission line) while provide a 
large change in phase (Δn) or amplitude (Δα) accumulate over a 
short device length14. Beyond that, modulators should offer low drive 
voltage and high-speed operation. 

In recent years, silicon photonics have emerge that have low propaga- 
tion loss (of the order of dB cm−1) but have struggle to achieve large 
modulation depth (that is, Δn and Δα) for submillimetre devices15. 
State-of-the-art device maximize their modulation through the use 
of resonant structures16, enable compact (few square micrometres) 
and energy-efficient components17,18. And although large quality 
factor (Q-factors, large value indicate low energy losses), of the order 
of several thousand, allow considerable reduction of the drive voltage, 
they limit the speed and increase the sensitivity of device to temper- 
ature and fabrication fluctuations19. More recently, surface plasmonic 
polariton (SPP) device have exploit the extreme confinement of 
light to achieve exceptional modulation of phase and amplitude within 
a few micrometres3,20. However, the metal that give plasmonics such 
promise be also the large hindrance, a such device suffer from large 
on-state loss (of the order of dB μm−1). To combat plasmonic losses, 
some device use hybrid plasmonic–photonic modes4,6,21 whereas 
others minimize the length of the active section5,22. Still, typical inser- 
tion loss of 10 dB due to plasmonic propagation and photonic-to- 
plasmonic mode conversion remain a concern for high-speed state- 
of-the-art devices5,6. Thus, plasmonic on-chip technology have be 
unable to replace the exist photonic or electronic solutions. 

We propose an approach in which loss in plasmonic waveguide 
can be selectively use or bypass to achieve low insertion loss, 
strong modulation, compact footprint and high speed, simultane- 
ously. Previously, the goal have be to reduce the ohmic loss a much 
a possible to minimize the device’s loss in the on state. Instead, we 
show that plasmonic loss can be tolerate by design the device 
geometry such that light pass through the lossy section when require 
(in the off state). To achieve this, we use a plasmonic ring resonator 
couple to a bury low-loss silicon photonic waveguide (see Fig. 1).

Unlike previous approaches, which aim to reduce the resonator loss to 
realize high-Q cavity or lasing7,23–26, our resonator exhibit typical 
propagation loss within the plasmonic cavity and mostly bypass 
this lossy section in the on state through destructive interference. Using 
this design, we demonstrate a plasmonic modulator that can meet the 
key performance metric of modern optical communication links. 

Figure 1 show the propose device geometry, which comprises a 
gold metal–insulator–metal (MIM) slot waveguide ring couple to a 
bury silicon bus waveguide, form a notch filter with a resonant 
wavelength of λres (see section II of the Supplementary Information). 
The slot waveguide be fill with an organic electro-optic (OEO) mate- 
rial which alters the device’s resonance condition through the Pockels 
effect (ΔnSPP)27. This permit fast and selective use of the resonator’s 
ohmic loss to attenuate the signal (Δα) in the bus waveguide by apply- 
ing a voltage. 

Figure 1c show the measure transmittance over the wavelength 
of two representative device that differ slightly in radius. The dif- 
ference in radius do not affect their optical property (insertion 
loss, extinction ratio, Q-factor), but result in a distinct off-resonance 
(λ0 ≠ λres) and on-resonance (λ0 = λres) behaviour at the telecom- 
munication wavelength of 1.54 μm. The off-resonance ring reveals an 
insertion loss of about 2.5 dB, the on-resonance ring show a Q-factor 
of about 30, and their difference in transmittance indicates an extinc- 
tion ratio of about 10 dB. We note that non-resonant device base on 

similar-length MIM waveguide feature an insertion loss range from 
8 dB to 10 dB (refs. 5,6,22). 

The reduce insertion loss can be understood by compare the 
exemplary operating principle of a non-resonant Mach–Zehnder 
modulator (MZ)5 (Fig. 2, left inset; white solid arrow indicates the plas- 
monic section) and a resonant ring (Fig. 2, right inset). The insertion 
loss of the device be a function of it couple efficiency, geometry and 
accumulate ohmic loss. In both concepts, light couple to and from 
the plasmonic structure with a couple efficiency C. A transmission 
modulation be then induced by the Pockels effect over an active plas- 
monic section of length or circumference l. The modulation depth ΔΤ, 
where T be transmittance, and also the loss LSPP scale with the length 
of the active plasmonic section6. Figure 2 show the overall insertion 
loss over the LSPP in the active plasmonic area for a MZ (red curve) and 
for a critically couple resonator (blue curve). The arrow in the plot 
indicate the performance of device with an equal ΔΤ. 

The follow point arise from Fig. 2. First, the resonator’s total loss 
be always small than that of a MZ modulator (blue curve < red curve), 
owe to the bypassing mechanism28. The insertion loss increase with 
LSPP (that is, inverse to the cavity’s Q-factor) a the critical couple 
condition require that more light couple to the plasmonic section. 
Second, the resonator have an insertion loss 1 dB low than that of the 
MZ at LSPP ≈ 0 dB. This be because the non-resonant device require 
two photonic–SPP converter a both the on state and the off state 
propagate through the plasmonic section. Ohmic loss in the convert- 
er limit the conversion efficiency to about 1 dB (refs. 22,29). In contrast, 
the selection mechanism of the resonator (on state: bus waveguide; 
off state: ring) require a converter which couple only a fraction of 
the light to the ring. Third, in the ring we take advantage of the reso- 
nantly enhance ΔΤ to reduce the device length (see section VII of 
the Supplementary Information). For our resonant structures, we have 
calculate an enhancement of about 1.5. Consequently, our ring with a 
circumference of l = 6 μm (LSPP ≈ 4 dB) offer the same transmittance 
change a a MZ of l = 9 μm (LSPP ≈ 6 dB). In total, the ring device offer 
an advantage of 6 dB insertion loss over the MZ modulator. Losses can 
be further reduce by under-coupling the resonator, a limited extinc- 
tion ratio of 10 dB be sufficient for many practical applications30. 

To illustrate the modulation performance (ΔΤ) of the plasmonic 
resonator, the effective refractive index for SPPs (ΔnSPP) be alter by 
apply a bias between the inner and outer rings27. Figure 3a show 
the transmit power versus apply voltage for a probe wavelength 
of approximately 1.52 μm. We observe an insertion loss < 3 dB, an 
extinction ratio of about 10 dB and a linear response (dashed green line) 
for a peak voltage of 3.5 V with an extinction ratio of about 6 dB. This 
performance in term of insertion loss and extinction ratio be similar 
to that of well-developed complementary metal oxide semiconductor 
(CMOS) photonic resonators19. We estimate that operation under a 
digital peak-to-peak drive voltage (1 V)19 will soon be achievable 
by use other plasmonic material such a silver or copper, use the 
new OEO material and improve fabrication (see Methods: Future

over non-resonant push–pull MZ device. The insertion loss be plot 
against the active plasmonic loss (LSPP) in the slot waveguide of the MZ 
modulator (left inset, red) and resonator (right inset, blue). Losses can 
be reduce by more than 6 dB. This be for the follow reasons: (i) the 
bypassing mechanism: only a fraction of light experience plasmonic 
losses; (ii) resonant enhancement: the resonator achieve the same 
modulation depth (ΔT) for shorter active plasmonic section than their 
non-resonant counterpart (indicated by the horizontal shift of the 
arrows); and (iii) couple scheme: non-resonant approach require two 
photonic/SPP converter whereas resonant approach require only one.

improvements). To highlight the mechanism of the modulation, the 
transmission of the device be measure under a positive and negative 
bias ( ± 3.75 V) a a function of wavelength (see Fig. 3b). This result 
in a normalize sensitivity, Sλ/ΔFWHM = Δλres/(ΔFWHMΔn), where 
ΔFWHM be the full-width at half-maximum, of about 17 RIU−1 (RIU be 
refractive index unit), assume a relative change in the OEO refractive 
index of about 0.03. This can be compare to commercial SPR sensor 
that achieve value of 50 RIU−1 by use a free-space Kretschmann 
configuration31. Therefore, our approach be already close to the non-in- 
tegrated free-space approaches. 

The moderate Q-factor guarantee a high operational speed and 
provide good thermal stability. For example, the measure resonance 
frequency be plot in Fig. 3c over a temperature range from 20 °C 
up to 90 °C. In this case, the resonant frequency be found to follow a 
linear trend line with a slope of about 0.4% K−1. The insensitivity of 
the low-Q plasmonic resonator to temperature fluctuation be in strong 
contrast to high-Q photonic resonators, which be two order of magni- 
tude more sensitive to temperature fluctuation (approximately 100% 
K−1)18. This be extremely beneficial for application in which strong 
temperature fluctuation occur. For example, a low-Q plasmonic reso- 
nant sensor or modulator would be immune to thermal fluctuation 
of ± 5 °C which normally occur in CPUs, whereas high-Q photonic 
resonator require power-consuming temperature control to main- 
tain operation19. Furthermore, the moderate Q factor be beneficial 
for high-speed operation, a desire in electro-optic modulators. As a 
result, we be able to push the bandwidth of a resonant electro-optic 
modulator well beyond 100 GHz (see Methods section ‘Speed limita- 
tions’). In comparison, photonic resonator be more likely to be limited 
to bandwidth of about 20 GHz and below18,19. 

Subsequently, we perform high-speed data experiment to demon- 
strate the robustness, high speed and low power switch capability. 
Although the ‘resonant switching’ principle can also be use to 
optimize sensors, we focus on high-speed application because their 
sensitivity and stability requirement be stricter. 

In the experiment of Fig. 4a, the peak drive voltage be approxi- 
mately 3.3 V, and the laser wavelength be varied to capture the 
response of the modulator. Low device loss of 2.5 dB and fibre-to- 
silicon waveguide loss of about 7 dB result in fibre-to-fibre couple 
loss of 16.5 dB, enable successful operation with low laser power 
of 4 dBm and below. The result bit-error ratio (BER) versus wave- 
length for a 72 Gbit s−1 signal be show in Fig. 4b, where a peak in the 
BER be observe at λres (dashed line). The BER show a peak because 
the change of transmittance (ΔT) have a symmetric response to voltage 
when the probe wavelength λ equal λres. Consequently, we con- 
firm that the operating mechanism relies on amplitude modulation. 
Off-resonance, the BER quickly drop to about 1 × 10−3, which be 

below the hard-decision forward error correction (HD-FEC) limit and 
allows for successful data modulation and detection32. No thermal 
heater be require for stabilization. Additionally, we reduce the data 
rate to 36 Gbit s−1 and 18 Gbit s−1 and found BERs of about 2 × 10−6 
and < 1 × 10−6, respectively, indicate that the BER at 72 Gbit s−1 be 
mainly limited by the electrical equipment (see Methods: Data experi- 
ments). We estimate the energy consumption of the modulator to be 
about 12 fJ bit−1 at 72 Gbit s−1 (ref. 14) for a device capacitance of 1.1 fF. 

We have demonstrate that low-Q resonant design use highly 
confine SPPs can enable low-loss active plasmonic device with a good 
modulation depth. We believe that our approach—unlike conventional 
resonant photonics—breaks the trade-off between sensitivity (high-Q) 
on the one hand and speed and temperature stability (low-Q) on the 
other. Our work can be see a a step towards practical plasmonics that 
ultimately serf a a compact and fast gateway between electronics 
(local signal processing) and photonics (broad bandwidth and low- 
loss data stream). The propose slot waveguide approach could be of 
interest for sensing, because the resonant response could be exploit 
for many other material system range from low-index material such 
a aqueous solution to high-index material such a silicon.

MEthodS 
Future improvements. The plasmonic material strongly influence the perfor- 
mance of the ring resonator in term of loss and resonant enhancement. In this 
section, we discus the influence of various plasmonic material and we show that 
the modulator performance improves when replace gold with copper (CMOS- 
compatible) or silver (lowest loss). 

In a first step, we investigate the unloaded Q-factor for different plasmonic 
metals. Extended Data Fig. 1 show the unloaded quality factor Q a a function of 
the slot width and the radius for Au (panel a), Cu (b) and Ag (c). 

Both Cu and Ag feature high Q-factors than Au. When change the plas- 
monic metal from Au to Ag, the Q-factor be more than double for geometry 
dominate by propagation loss (140 for Ag versus 60 for Au). Each material show 
the trade-off between propagation loss and bending loss result in the characte- 
ristic triangular contour line (see section III of the Supplementary Information). 
Furthermore, use low-loss material such a Ag will increase not only the intrin- 
sic Q-factor but also the couple efficiency C. Three-dimensional simulation 
indicate that C increase from 0.8 to 0.9. 

Besides the plasmonic material, the OEO material provide an additional path 
for further improvement. Recent experiment have show that electro-optic coef- 
ficients over 300 pm V−1 be achievable by operating in close vicinity of the OEO 
material resonance (λ ≈ 1,250 nm)33. Additionally, other OEO material such a 
JRD1 show electro-optic coefficient over 300 pm V−1 (refs. 34–36). 

To evaluate the influence of these improvement on the modulator performance, 
Extended Data Fig. 1 show the wavelength-dependent transmittance of a MIM- 
ring resonator obtain by the analytic model (equation (2) in the Supplementary 
Information). Extended Data Fig. 1d show the transmittance for Au while 
Extended Data Fig. 1e include the possible improvement with Ag and JRD1 
(electro-optic coefficient of 300 pm V−1). The radius be 1 μm, the slot width be 80 nm 
and the outer electrode height be 350 nm. The solid line correspond to positive 
(blue) and negative (red) biasing of 2 V. 

Such improve configuration offer through-port insertion loss a small a 
0.5 dB (Ag) compare with 1.5 dB (Au). Furthermore, the switch sensitivity 
be increase because of the high nonlinearity (sensitivity increase by 3 × ) and 
the large Q-factor (2 × ). Thus, the absolute insertion loss reduces from 4.3 dB to 
1.2 dB, and the extinction ratio increase from 2 dB to 18 dB when driven with ± 2 V 
at the chosen probe wavelength (vertical green line, Extended Data Fig. 1d,e). 
Thus, low-power CMOS transistor may drive the plasmonic resonator without 
the help of electrical amplification. This would reduce the total energy consump- 
tion of the modulators to below 1 fJ per bit. 
Alternative active material for modulation and sensing. Here, we discus the 
influence of the refractive index of the slot material on the unloaded Q-factor of 
plasmonic ring resonators. The active material could be either an OEO material for 
modulation or a biosensitive material for sense purposes. Extended Data Fig. 2 
show the simulated Q-factors for different slot width and radii. The simulated 
refractive index range from 1.33 up to 3.48 a show in subplots in Extended 
Data Fig. 2a to h. 

All material system achieve Q-factors above 30. The refractive index of the 
active material strongly influence the bending and propagation losses. In the case 
of low nslot, for Extended Data Fig. 2a and b, the Q-factor be mainly limited by 
bending loss for all slot width a indicate by the diagonal contour line (dashed 
lines). This behaviour change when nslot increase to 1.75 (Extended Data Figs. 2c) 
or 2 (Extended Data Fig. 2d) and typical triangular contour line can be observe 
highlight the trade-off between bending loss and propagation loss (see sec- 
tion IV of the Supplementary Information). A further increase of the refractive 
index result in dominate propagation losses. The triangular shape of the contour 
line change to contour line parallel to the bottom axis (radius). In this region (see 
subplots in Extended Data Fig. 2e to h), the Q-factor drop for the same geometrical 
parameter a propagation loss increase with the refractive index37. 

The subplots show in Extended Data Fig. 2a, c, e and h be of most interest a 
they represent material that can be use for sensing: (a) nslot = 1.33 (H2O); or for 
electro-optic modulation: (c) nslot = 1.75 (OEO)35; (e) nslot = 2.25 (barium titanate, 
BTO)38; and (h) nslot = 3.48 (Si)22. 
Sample fabrication. All report device be process on silicon-on-insulator 
wafer with a 220-nm-thick Si device layer and 3-μm-thick bury oxide. Electron 
beam lithography (Vistec EBPG5200) in combination with ICP-RIE (Oxford 
Plasmalab System 100) be apply to pattern the Si photonic components. A 
positive tone resist (poly(methyl methacrylate), PMMA) and a negative tone resist 
(hydrogen silsesquioxane, HSQ) be use a mask to define the partially (70 nm) 
and fully (220 nm) etch Si structures, respectively39. Planarization of the pat- 
terned Si structure be realize by spin-coating the sample with a 1-μm-thick 
HSQ layer follow by rapid thermal anneal to convert HSQ to SiO2 (ref. 40). We 
observe thickness variation of ± 10 nm with a periodicity of 50 μm throughout 
the chip. This do not affect device performance, a the footprint of the resonator 

be much small than the periodicity. We control the couple between the ring 
and bus waveguide by use the follow protocol, which enable u to adjust 
the average vertical space between the gold ring and silicon bus (dAu–Si) to 
within 5 nm of the target value. First, we use an electron-beam-patterned PMMA 
resist mask to open silicon etch mark place next to the device to measure the 
HSQ thickness during the follow wet etch process. Afterwards, we use a 
second e-beam pattern PMMA resist to locally etch down the SiO2 over the 
bus waveguide to the desire space dAu,Si = 70 ± 10 nm by use a buffer HF 
(7:1) solution. The slow etch-rate of 1.2 nm s–1 enables good process control. Note 
that the spin-coating process rather than the wet etch process introduces the 
uncertainty of ± 10 nm. Contact pads, outer ring (height h = 350 nm), inner ring 
(h = 150 nm) and bridge (h = 350 nm) be produce with a sequence of e-beam 
lithography, e-beam evaporation of Au and lift-off process a report in ref. 5. 
Extended Data Fig. 3 show a tilt top view of the fabricate ring resonator before 
the bridge fabrication step. The height of the outer electrode be 350 nm, whereas 
the inner electrode be only 150 nm, enable a reduction of the bending loss (see 
section IV of the Supplementary Information). 

We characterize the geometry of all device use SEM for good comparison 
to simulations. This allows u to estimate parameter such a the electro-optic 
coefficient, r33. Finally, the binary OEO material (75%HD-BB-OH/25%YLD124)41 
be spin-coated then pole at it glass transition temperature (115 °C) by apply 
electric field of approximately 130 V μm−1. It have be shown33 that this OEO 
material allows operation up to 80 °C. 

We chose the follow design parameter sets: slot width of 80 nm and 100 nm 
with radius range from 900 nm to 1,200 m and 1,400 nm to 1600 nm. 
Passive characterization. We determine the transmittance of the resonator by 
subtract back-to-back measurement of structure that comprise the same grat- 
ing coupler and photonic waveguide but lack the plasmonic section. The standard 
deviation of the back-to-back measurement be below ± 0.5 dB over the whole 
wavelength range of the tunable laser (1,465 nm to 1,635 nm). We measure the 
passive spectrum for various input power up to 10 dBm and do not observe any 
drift of the resonance wavelength due to self-heating. To prevent any self-heating, 
we set the laser power to 0 dBm for the passive characterization. 

Extended Data Fig. 4 show two histogram of the measure insertion loss 
(Extended Data Fig. 4a) and extinction ratio (Extended Data Fig. 4b) of 23 ring 
resonator with target slot width of 80 nm. The average insertion loss be about 
2.5 dB and the mean extinction ratio be about 9.7 dB. 

We design ring with vary radius to account for fabrication variations. 
Extended Data Fig. 4c show the passive spectrum of ring resonator with radius 
range from 940 nm up to 990 nm. The resonance wavelength shift with increas- 
ing radius by δλres/δR ≈ 1.1. 
Sensitivity experiments. We use the same optical set-up a the passive characte- 
rization measurement to estimate the d.c./low-frequency electro-optic response of 
six devices. In a first experiment, we apply a 100 Hz triangular shape electrical 
signal with a peak voltage amplitude of 10 V. We measure the modulation of the 
optical signal when operating the resonator around it 3 dB point. In a second 
experiment, we apply a d.c. bias and measure the resonators’ wavelength shift 
a a function of the voltage. Extended Data Table 1 provide an overview of the 
insertion loss, extinction ratio and sensitivity of the resonance wavelength (Δλres 
per volt) a extract from these two experiments. The extinction ratio (6–10 dB) 
and insertion loss (2–3 dB) during active switch match the value obtain from 
passive characterization. This show that the modulators can be driven from 
minimum to maximum output power before dielectric breakdown occurs. Three- 
dimensional simulation of device 79 reveal a Δλres/V ≈ 3.1 nm V−1 for an electro- 
optic coefficient of 100 pm V−1. Thus, we estimate an in-device electro-optic 
coefficient of about 90 pm V−1 and a Δn ≈ 0.03 when biasing with ± 3.75 V base 
on the Pockels effect. Device 79 (last row) be show in Fig. 3a and b of the main text. 
Speed limitations. The electro-optic bandwidth of resonant electro-optic modu- 
lators be often determine by the photon lifetime of the resonant cavity. In the case 
of a ring-based electro-optic modulator with a Q-factor of 6,000, this equates to an 
electro-optic bandwidth of a few ten of gigahertz42. In the case of resonant plas- 
monic structures, the photon lifetime do not limit the electro-optic bandwidth, 
a these structure feature Q-factors that be two order of magnitude small than 
the Q-factors of photonic approaches. 

In general, the slowest of the follow effect limit the electro-optic bandwidth 
of an electro-optic-modulator: (i) the RC time constant; (ii) the timescale of the 
nonlinear effect (here the Pockels effect); and (iii) the cavity lifetime. In the case 
of the plasmonic MIM ring modulator present in this work, these contribution 
can be approximate a follows: 

• τRC: The calculate capacitance of the MIM ring be approximately 1.1 fF (electro- 
static 3D simulation), and it resistance be a few ohm with the nanometre-scale 
bridge be the main contributor5. This result in an RC bandwidth much great 
than 1 THz.

• τPockels: The Pockels effect be base on the reorganization of π-electrons within 
a nanometre-long molecule and be estimate to be on the timescale of femto- or 
attoseconds27. This result in a Pockels bandwidth much great than 1 THz. 

• τcavity: The SPP lifetime be give by the quality factor divide by the angular 
frequency (τres ≈ Q/ωphoton). The resonant structure present in this work fea- 
ture Q-factors of 50, while future implementation may reach value of up to 150. 
Thus, the cavity lifetime of SPPs be about 100 f or less, result in a cavity lifetime 
bandwidth limit of more than 1 THz. 

Based on these approximations, we expect, at worst, a terahertz bandwidth for 
a plasmonic MIM resonator use the Pockels effect. To confirm that bandwidth 
limitation be not an issue for resonant plasmonic modulators we perform 
electro-optic bandwidth measurement with a plasmonic resonator of radius 
1.5 μm and a design slot width of 100 nm. These design parameter be chosen 
because they feature the large Q-factors and therefore the long cavity life- 
times. Extended Data Fig. 5a show the wavelength-dependent transmittance of 
the plasmonic resonator and Extended Data Fig. 5b show the normalize modu- 
lation efficiency a a function of the modulation frequency. The ratio between the 
unmodulated carrier and the modulate sidebands be the modulation efficiency 
which be measure with an optical spectrum analyser and normalize with 
respect to the low apply frequency43. 

The different colour correspond to three characteristic probe wavelengths. 
Red, yellow and purple be the off-resonance, 3 dB point and on-resonance probe 
wavelengths, respectively. For all three curves, a similar behaviour be observed, 
and electro-optic bandwidth beyond 100 GHz be found. This indicates that 
the cavity lifetime be not yet limit the bandwidth. Otherwise, a discrepancy 
in bandwidth between on-resonance (purple) and off-resonance (red) operation 
should be observed. The kink at about 110 GHz be attribute to limitation in the 
electrical test set-up. 

Two different measurement set-ups be require to cover the broad electrical 
spectrum range from 20 GHz up to 115 GHz in step of 2.5 GHz. The first set-up 
(20 GHz to 70 GHz) use a tunable radiofrequency (RF) signal generator (100 kHz 
to 70 GHz) to generate a sinusoidal RF signal. The electrical output power of the 
source be adjust for each frequency such that a constant power of 0 dBm be 
apply to the ring resonator via ground–signal–ground probes. The second set-up 
be use to cover the frequency range from 70 GHz to 115 GHz with a step size 
of 2.5 GHz. We use the sixth harmonic of a Schottky diode to generate these 
frequencies. The electrical input power to the Schottky diode be kept constant. 
We compensate the variation in the diode’s output power by measure the 
power with a broadband power meter. The measure power value be use in 
a post-processing step to subtract the influence of the vary power. The power 
level of the harmonic term other than the sixth harmonic be negligible. 

Note that the signal be apply via 100 μm × 100 μm contact pads. The reso- 
nator itself (approximately 1.1 fF) do not determine the total capacitance a the 
large contact pad interact with the substrate result in a capacitance of several 
ten of femtofarads44. The modulator behaves like an open circuit element owe 
to the small capacitance. 
Data experiments. This section provide detail about the experimental set-up 
show in Fig. 4 of the main text. A tunable, external cavity laser (1,465 nm to 
1,575 nm) be use a a light source with output power range from 6 dBm up 
to 13 dBm. The laser light be fed to an attenuator to enable a flexible adjustment 
of the optical power. Light be couple to and from the chip via grate couplers, 
which have an efficiency (CGC) of −7 dB each at 1550 nm. 

All non-return-to-zero (NRZ) electrical data stream be random binary 
sequence of length 218 generate by a 72 gigasample s−1, six-bit digital-to- 
analogue converter (f3dB ≈ 20 GHz). An RF amplifier (f3dB ≈ 50–55 GHz) then 
amplify the electrical signal to a certain peak-to-peak drive voltage (Vpp,50Ω) 
measure over a 50 Ω resistor. Finally, the electrical signal be apply by 
ground-signal RF-probes (f3dB > 67 GHz) to the device via 100 μm × 100 μm 
contact pads. Two 25-cm-long RF cable (1.85-mm connectors) connect the 
generator, amplifier and RF probe. The modulate light be detect coher- 
ently. We use a second laser for heterodyne detection. The 3 dB bandwidth of 
the coherent detector’s photodiode be 70 GHz. An erbium-doped fibre amplifier 
amplify the optical signal after the modulator to power level of about 8 dBm 
to enable best performance. The electrical oscilloscope (electrical bandwidth 
63 GHz and sample rate 160 GSa s−1) sample and digitize the waveform. 
Offline digital signal-processing be perform to account for timing errors45, 
carrier frequency and phase offset and the linear frequency response of the 
system by feedforward equalization with adaptive least mean square (LMS)-based 
filter updates. Extended Data Table 2 show the result in term of BER obtain 
from six different device under various drive voltage (Vpeak), data rate (R), 
and optical input power at the grate coupler. Similar BERs be obtain for 
different device under equal conditions. For instance, low BERs be obtain at 
18 Gbit s−1 for small drive voltage of Vpeak ≈ 3.3 V and low input powers. At 
72 Gbit s−1, the BER drop to 10−3 under similar conditions. We increase the 

drive voltage twofold and the input power fourfold and measure only a mod- 
erate reduction of the BER to 10−4. We attribute this to the limited bandwidth 
of the electrical components. Device 34 be show in the Fig. 4 of the main text. 
Comparison with state-of-the-art electro-optic modulators. In the following, we 
compare the plasmonic ring resonator with prior art. Electro-optic-modulators 
be expect to help replace electrical communication link with their optical 
counterpart for short-range applications. Potential candidate must be compact 
(footprint of a few square micrometres) to enable a dense co-integration of elec- 
tronics and photonics. Furthermore, electro-optic modulators must be optimize 
for high speed ( > 100 GHz) and low insertion loss ( < 3 dB) to enable multi-gi- 
gabit operation. Extended Data Fig. 6 show the characteristic of state-of-the-art 
device (photonic, crosses; plasmonic, circles) in term of insertion loss and elec- 
tro-optic-bandwidth5,6,18,22,43,44,46–50. The different abbreviation represent various 
electro-optic materials. Ideally, modulators should occupy the bluish area at the 
bottom right of the figure. However, large bandwidth correlate with large insertion 
loss. This be because the plasmonic waveguide also serve a highly conductive elec- 
trodes, enable a low RC time constant, but ohmic loss in the metal prevent low 
insertion losses. Conversely, the resonant switch of photonic modulators enables 
low loss but these suffer from limited bandwidths. Combining plasmonics and 
the resonant switch concept break the trade-off and enables high-speed and 
low-loss modulators. 

For the convenience of the reader, we provide a detailed summary of key metric 
in Extended Data Table 3 (demonstrated plasmonic modulators) and in Extended 
Data Table 4 (photonic electro-optic modulators). The performance of the plas- 
monic ring resonator (last column) serf a reference in both tables. Extended 
Data Table 3 compare our modulator with four non-resonant modulators base 
on various nonlinear effect and material system such a χ(2) in OEO materials, 
free-carrier dispersion (FCD) in silicon, FCD in transparent conductive oxide 
(TCO) and χ(2) in BTO. 

• The resonant approach (last column) outperforms it direct non-resonant 
counterpart (first column). 

• Plasmonic resonator require moderate drive voltages, and only the TCO- 
base modulator be driven with Vpeak = 1 V a require to enable integration with 
electronics. However, different data rate of 72 Gbit s−1 and 2.5 Gbit s−1 make a 
comparison between our modulator and the TCO modulator challenging. 

• Finally, we note that apply the resonant plasmonic approach to other mate- 
rial system would enable a further boost in performance for each individual tech- 
nology. For instance, one can imagine TCO-based plasmonic resonator operating 
with millivolt drive voltages. 

Extended Data Table 4 show six photonic modulators base on FCD in sil- 
icon18,46, the Franz–Keldysh effect (FKE) in SiGe (ref. 48), χ(2) in BTO47, χ(2) in 
lithium niobate (LiNbO3)50 and Pauli block in graphene51.

a–h, The material differ in their refractive index, and one can observe 
that low-n material be limited by bending loss (diagonal lines) whereas 
high-n material be limited by propagation loss (parallel lines). These 

simulation be perform with 150 nm height of the outer and inner 
electrode to account for limitation in fabrication process different from 
ours.
