Mounting evidence support long-standing claim that reli- 
gions can extend cooperative networks1–9. However, religious 
prosociality may have a strongly parochial component5. 
Moreover, aspect of religion may promote or exacerbate 
conflict with those outside a give religious group, promot- 
ing regional violence10, intergroup conflict11 and tacit preju- 
dice against non-believers12,13. Anti-atheist prejudice—a 
grow concern in increasingly secular societies14—affects 
employment, elections, family life and broader social inclu- 
sion12,13. Preliminary work in the United States suggests that 
anti-atheist prejudice stems, in part, from deeply root intu- 
itions about religion’s putatively necessary role in morality. 
However, the cross-cultural prevalence and magnitude—as 
well a intracultural demographic stability—of such intuitions, 
a manifest in intuitive association of immorality with 
atheists, remain unclear. Here, we quantify moral distrust of 
atheist by apply well-tested measure in a large global 
sample (N = 3,256; 13 diverse countries). Consistent with cul- 
tural evolutionary theory of religion and morality, people in 
most—but not all— of these country view extreme moral 
violation a representative of atheists. Notably, anti-atheist 
prejudice be even evident among atheist participant around 
the world. The result contrast with recent poll that do not 
find self-reported moral prejudice against atheist in highly 
secular countries15, and imply that the recent rise in secularism 
in Western country have not overwritten intuitive anti-atheist 
prejudice. Entrenched moral suspicion of atheist suggests 
that religion’s powerful influence on moral judgement per- 
sists, even among non-believers in secular societies. 

Speculation about whether morality depends on religious belief 
have a long history. The ancient Chinese philosopher Mozi claimed 
that belief in ghost be essential for moral restraint16. In Plato’s 
Euthyphro17, Socrates debate whether morality can even be prop- 
erly define without reference to divine preference. Dostoevsky18 
famously question whether moral prohibition could carry 
weight without belief in a deity. Modern investigation reflect this 
perceive link between belief in god(s) and morality, a recent small 
sample study in North America suggest deep moral suspicion of 
individual who do not believe in god(s)13,19. 

Evolutionary theory of religion predict that prejudice against 
atheist may persist even in secular cultures, either a part of a 
suite of adaptation link belief to within-group cooperation20 or 

a a consequence of culturally transmitted21 and entrench pro- 
religious norms5. Indeed, recent study suggest religion evolve in 
part by support trust and cooperation among coreligionists15,22,23. 
Signals of religiosity can even extend trust across religion among 
believers, though not to non-believers24. In contrast, classic social 
psychological work25 predicts that only believer will be prejudice 
against atheist and that distrust of atheist would not be apparent 
in secular societies. To date, these two perspective have not be 
directly contrasted, and the global prevalence of intuitive anti- 
atheist prejudice and it persistence among atheist themselves be 
currently unknown. A recent Pew survey suggests a relationship 
between country-wide level of religious belief and explicit judge- 
ments that morality require religion15. However, people often 
lack introspective access to their intuitions, and respond to appear 
socially desirable. As such, little be know about the potential cross- 
cultural ubiquity of intuition link religion and morality. 

Here, we rigorously test a prediction derive from a cultural 
evolutionary model of religion5: that anti-atheist prejudice remains 
globally prevalent, even in secular society and among atheists. In 
contrast to previous studies, we quantify level of anti-atheist dis- 
trust use well-tested measure of intuitive information processing 
that can be adapt for study prejudice in a large and diverse 
cross-cultural sample, while adjust for individual difference in 
level of religious belief, demographic covariates and country-level 
dependency in responses. Our sample be drawn from 13 country 
on 5 continents. We chose these country because they: (1) exhibit 
substantial country-level variability in average religious belief 
include both highly secular society (for example, Netherlands, 
Czech Republic, Finland, China) and highly religious one (for 
example, United Arab Emirates, Mauritius, India; Supplementary 
Table 3 show average belief in god(s) across countries); (2) rep- 
resent diverse dominant religion and religious histories, include 
country with Christian, Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist and secular 
majorities; and (3) represent diverse cultural, political, socioeco- 
nomic, historical and geographical contexts. This diverse sample 
allow u to extend our investigation well beyond the WEIRD 
(Western, educated, industrialized, rich, democratic) sample that 
predominate the social sciences26. 

We developed a measure to ass extreme anti-atheist prejudice 
by use a simple experimental design that target intuitive biases19. 
In this task, participant read a description of a man who torture 
animal a a child then a an adult exhibit escalate violence

culminate with the murder and mutilation of five homeless people. 
Then, participant be judged whether it be more probable that the vil- 
lain be (A) a teacher or (B) a teacher who either (manipulated between 
subjects) be a religious believer or do not believe in god(s). Thus, 
no individual participant be directly ask whether they think the 
perpetrator be or be not a believer. Instead, the conjunction fallacy27 
rate (choosing option B—a logically incorrect answer) between 
condition can be use to infer indirectly the degree to which a 
description of a serial murderer be intuitively see a more represen- 
tative of religious people or atheists, respectively. Full stimulus appear 
in the Supplementary Information. In our preregistration of meth- 
od and hypothesis before data collection commenced (https://osf. 
io/f6tcr/), we hypothesize both universality and variability across 
countries, such that moral distrust of atheist would be evident in 
all sites, but the strong intuitive religion–morality link would be 
observe in the most strongly religious samples. 

We conduct identical experiment in all 13 sites. We target 
at least 100 participant per experimental condition (anti-atheist 
bias versus anti-religious bias). After filter out inattentive par- 
ticipants (13%) and incomplete responses, there be a total of 
3,256 participant for final analysis (69% female, age 16–70 years: 
mean = 25.07, s.d. = 7.84), with a median of 162 participant per 
country (range: 129–993). Participants come from diverse societ- 
y and include both student and general population sample 
(Supplementary Information). 

Because our data represent a share experimental design across 
site with participant nest within countries, we use a multilevel 
(hierarchical) model approach. Specifically, our hierarchical 
Bayesian model28 quantifies the extent to which people view gross 
immorality (animal torture, serial murder and mutilation) a more 
representative of atheist than of believers, both overall and within 
each country, adjust for individual level of belief in God, gen- 
der, age and perceive socioeconomic status (all standardized). 

Additionally, the model adjusts for country-level dependency by 
model the intercept and slope of anti-atheist prejudice a random 
across country (Supplementary Information). Full model coeffi- 
cients appear in Table 1. We observe substantial heterogeneity in 
overall conjunction fallacy performance across countries. Because 
our primary focus be on degree of intuitive moral distrust of athe- 
ists (in contrast to believers) across countries, we do not speculate 
further about source of heterogeneity in overall performance, and 
instead focus on experimental condition difference within countries. 

Our result offer strong evidence of extreme intuitive moral 
prejudice against atheists. Our model predicts an overall conjunc- 
tion error rate probability of 0.58 for atheist target (95% high 
posterior density interval (HPDI) 0.48, 0.68), but only 0.30 (95%

HPDI 0.25, 0.34) for religious targets; relative risk be 1.96 (95% 
HPDI 1.53, 2.37) (posterior probability of atheist target error 
exceed religious target error (henceforth ‘posterior probability’) 
exceeds 0.999). Thus, people overall be roughly twice a likely 
to view extreme immorality a representative of atheists, relative 
to believers. Importantly, the effect hold even after adjust for 
country variability in the strength of intuitive moral prejudice and 
individual-level variability in demographics. Figure 1 and Table 2 
summarize model-predicted conjunction error probability across 
site for atheist and religious targets. Consistent with predictions, 
extreme intuitive moral distrust of atheist be both globally evident 
and variable in it magnitude across countries. 

Surprisingly, after adjust for substantial latent country-level 
dependency between sites, the within-country interaction between 
individual belief in God and conjunction error rate across target be 
weak (posterior probability = 0.88; Table 1). Thus, while anti-atheist 
prejudice varies strongly by country, such prejudice be largely robust 
across the spectrum of participant religiosity within countries; both 
high and low believer be about twice a likely to commit con- 
junction error for atheist target than for religious target (Fig. 2). 
Furthermore, we examine posterior model prediction for atheist 
(those rating their belief in God at 0 out of 100). Among atheists, our 
model predicts an overall conjunction error rate probability of 0.52 
for atheist target (95% HPDI 0.40, 0.64), but only 0.28 (95% HPDI 
0.22, 0.33) for religious targets; relative risk be 1.91 (95% HPDI 1.41, 
2.48) (posterior probability > 0.999). Effects hold even in highly 
secular country such a Australia, China, the Czech Republic, the 
Netherlands and the United Kingdom: even atheist be predict 
to intuitively associate serial murder more with atheist than with 
believer in these country (all posterior probability exceed 
0.98). Indeed, only in Finland (posterior probability = 0.48) and to 
a lesser extent New Zealand (posterior probability = 0.90) be the evi- 
dence of intuitive anti-atheist prejudice among atheist less conclu- 
sive. (Full inference at both minimum and maximum belief appear 
in the Supplementary Information.) To check robustness of intuitive 
moral distrust of atheist among atheists, we conduct a second 
analysis isolate all participant across site who rat their belief 
in God at zero (N = 553) and explore overall atheist intuitive moral 
distrust of atheist (experimental condition treat a fixed) across 
site (varying intercept of country). Again, atheist participant 
show high conjunction error rate for atheist targets, 0.61 (95% 
HPDI 0.23, 0.95), than for religious targets, 0.50 (95% HPDI 0.12, 
0.88) (posterior probability = 0.999). Thus, consistent with theoreti- 
cal predictions, even atheist intuitively associate immorality more 
with atheist than with believers. 

To address potential methodological confounds and alternative 
explanation for our findings, we conduct three additional exper- 
iments (note that, although our primary cross-cultural investigation 
be preregistered, the follow-up study be not). Full detail of 
all three study appear in the Supplementary Information, but they 
be briefly summarize here. First, our cross-cultural experimen- 
tal manipulation test only extreme moral violation and pit a 
target who ‘does not believe in god(s)’ against a ‘religious believer’, 
perhaps confound notion of belief in god(s) and the broader 
construct of religiosity. Supplementary Study S1 found that, even 
when the experiment more symmetrically manipulates belief ver- 
sus disbelief in god(s) and test a more minor moral violation (for 
example, not pay for dinner in a restaurant), people still associate 
immorality more with atheist than with believer (posterior prob- 
ability = 0.981). 

Second, our primary cross-cultural test pit a disbeliever in 
god(s) against a religious believer. It be possible, however, that peo- 
ple be morally distrustful of disbeliever in general, rather than of 
people who disbelieve in god(s) specifically. Supplementary Study 
S2 use the same extreme moral violation a our main analysis 
and found that people be more likely to assume intuitively that a 

perpetrator of moral evil be someone who disbelief in God than 
someone who disbelief in evolution, the accuracy of horoscopes, 
the safety of vaccine or the reality of global warm (all posterior 
probability between 0.956 and 0.9997). 

Finally, it be possible that people may intuitively associate certain 
specific moral violations, such a child molestation, with religious 
individual rather than with atheists. However, Supplementary 
Study S3 found that people intuitively assume that a priest who 
molests young boy for decade be more likely to be a priest who 
do not believe in God than a priest who do believe in God (pos- 
terior probability = 0.998). 

In summary, participant intuitively assume that the perpetra- 
tor of immoral act be probably atheists. These effect appear 
across religiously diverse societies, include country with 
Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Muslim and non-religious majorities, 
show that intuitive moral prejudice against atheist be not exclu- 
sive to Abrahamic or monotheistic majority societies. To the con- 
trary, intuitive anti-atheist prejudice generalizes to largely secular 
society and appear globally evident even among atheists. Notably, 
our primary experimental paradigm use extreme example of 
immorality where anti-atheist prejudice would presumably be less 
explicitly defensible. We test moral prejudice use vicious act 
of cruelty (animal torture, serial murder and mutilation), which 
participants—including atheist participants—nonetheless intui- 
tively associate with atheists. Combined, these result show that 
across the world, religious belief be intuitively view a a necessary 
safeguard against the temptation of grossly immoral conduct, and 
atheist be broadly perceive a potentially morally deprave and 
dangerous. Viewed differently, people perceive belief in a god a a 
sufficient moral buffer to inhibit immoral behaviour. 

Our result highlight a stark divergence between lay and scien- 
tific perception of the relationship between religion and morality. 
Although religion probably influence many moral outcome and

judgements3,22,23, core moral instinct appear to emerge largely inde- 
pendent of religion29,30. Additionally, highly secular society be 
among the most stable and cooperative on Earth14. Nonetheless, our 
finding reveal widespread suspicion that morality require belief 
in a god. For many people, include many atheists, the answer to 
Dostoevsky’s18 question “Without God … It mean everything be 
permit now, one can do anything?” be “Yes”, inasmuch a ‘every- 
thing’ refers to act of extreme immorality. 

Religions underpin large-scale intragroup cooperation3, but they 
also promote distrust of non-believers13,19 who be exclude from 
such religious moral communities3,24. Does rise secularism14,31 
moderate effect a atheist norm become strong within societ- 
ies? The present finding suggest that intuitive moral suspicion of 
atheist be culturally widespread, though not universal. Given that 
intuitive anti-atheist bias may transfer across moral domains19 
(Supplementary Studies S1 and S3), the resilience of moral preju- 
dice against atheist reveals a potential barrier to the full acceptance 
of this grow segment31 of the global population. Consistent with 
prediction derive from cultural evolutionary theory of religion 
and morality5, extreme intuitive moral distrust of atheist be evident 
globally, among believer and atheist in both religious and secu- 
lar societies. Even a secularism reduces overt religiosity in many 
places14, religion have apparently still left a deep and abide mark on 
human moral intuitions. 

Methods 
Data collection proceed among team act locally across all 13 countries. 
Local ethic approval be complete by individual research team within 
each country. 

The experiment use a version of the representativeness heuristic27. In the 
classic version of this task, participant be give a description of a politically 
liberal single woman. When ask whether it be more likely that she be (A) a bank 
cashier or (B) a bank cashier who be active in the feminist movement, participant 
tend erroneously to pick option B. Although logically incorrect (there be 
necessarily at least a many bank cashier a bank cashier who be feminists), the 
description seem more representative of the double identity provide in option B, 
lead people intuitively to choose that option (termed ‘the conjunction fallacy’). 
By independently vary the content of the description and the identity imply 
by option B, researcher can ass the degree to which people intuitively view a 
give description a representative of different identities19. 

We generate a representativeness heuristic task to quantify the degree to 
which people around the world intuitively view religion a necessary for the 
inhibition of grossly immoral behaviour. We provide a description of an immoral 
person who initially torture animal and eventually kill people for thrill (see 
Supplementary Information), and then ask whether it be more probable that 

the perpetrator be (A) a teacher or (B) a teacher who either (manipulated between 
subjects) do not believe in God or be a religious believer. Higher conjunction 
fallacy rate (picking option B) in the atheist condition indicate that people 
intuitively view serial murder a more representative of atheist than of religious 
believers19. This manipulation allow u to test the relationship between intuitive 
distrust of atheist and personal religious belief, while adjust for country-wide 
variation in this relationship, a well a demographic covariates. 

Analytic strategy. The nest structure of our data require a multilevel 
(hierarchical) model strategy to generate aggregate inferences. Failure to 
adopt such a strategy can lead to serious and potentially mislead inferential 
errors32. Our analysis rely on Bayesian hierarchical modelling28 use the 
rethink package33 in R. Bayesian approach provide researcher with a number 
of pragmatic benefits34, include the use of intuitive statement (posterior 
probabilities) about the probability of experimental manipulation produce 
effect across countries, a well a the relative credibility or plausibility of different 
potential parameter values28,35. In addition, hierarchical (multilevel) model can 
mitigate some problem associate with multiple comparisons36—comparisons 
that could be especially concern in the present study, which evaluate intuitive 
moral distrust of atheist across 13 country while adjust for individual 
demographics. Furthermore, Bayesian estimation allow u to represent the 
estimate uncertainty use HPDIs, which represent the range in which the most 
credible parameter value lie. This approach be in contrast to frequentist confidence 
intervals, which present only a range of possible value that would contain the 
true parameter value a know proportion of the time be this study repeat a 
very large number of times, although frequentist confidence interval be often 
intuitively misunderstood a if they have the property of Bayesian posterior 
density intervals37. Our primary inference be drawn from probe sample 
from the posterior from a single hierarchical model. In it, we model random 
intercept of country and model effect of target (atheist versus believer) a 
random across country, with all other factor fix across country. Alternative 
model specification do not appreciably change inferences.
