So why can’t a robot be more like a rat? 

The answer is, it can. At the , in 

Brisbane, Australia, and his 

collaborator have spent the last 14 year hone a robot navigation system model on the brain of rats. 

This biologically inspire approach, they hope, could help robot navigate dynamic environment 

without require advanced, costly sensor and computationally intensive algorithms.

Michael Milford (https://wiki.qut.edu.au/display/cyphy/Michael+Milford) 

An early version of their system allow an indoor package-delivery bot to operate autonomously for 

two week in a lab. During that period, it make more than 1,100 mock deliveries, travel a total of 40 

kilometers, and recharge itself 23 times. Another version successfully mapped an entire suburb of 

Brisbane, use only the imagery capture by the camera on a MacBook. Now Milford’s group be

At the time, one of the big push in robotics be the “ 

” 

: If you take a robot and move it somewhere else, can it figure out 

where it is? One way to solve the problem be SLAM, which stand for 

. While run a 

SLAM algorithm, a robot can explore strange terrain, building a map of it surroundings while at the 

same time positioning, or localizing, itself within that map.

Wyeth have long be interested in brain-inspired computing, start with work on neural network in 

the late 1980s. And so he and Milford decide to work on a version of SLAM that take it cue from the 

rat’s neural circuitry. They call it RatSLAM. 

There already be numerous flavor of SLAM, and today they number in the dozens, each with it own 

advantage and drawbacks. What they all have in common be that they rely on two separate stream of

In a two-week-long experiment, an experimental 

package-delivery robot run the RatSLAM algorithm, which 

mimic how a rat navigates, make more than 1,100 mock 

delivery and travel 40 kilometers. 

Deliverance: 

data. One relates to what the environment look 

like, and robot gather this kind of data use 

sensor a varied a sonars, cameras, and laser 

scanners. The second stream concern the robot 

itself, or more specifically, it speed and 

orientation; robot derive that data from sensor 

like rotary encoders on their wheel or an inertial 

measurement unit (IMU) on their bodies. A SLAM 

algorithm look at the environmental data and 

try to identify notable landmarks, add these to 

it map. As the robot moves, it monitor it speed 

and direction and look for those landmarks; if the 

robot recognizes a landmark, it us the 

landmark’s position to refine it own location on 

the map. 

But whereas most implementation of SLAM aim 

for highly detailed, static maps, Milford and Wyeth 

be more interested in how to navigate through an environment that’s in constant flux. Their aim wasn’t 

to create map built with costly lidar and high-powered computers—they want their system to make 

sense of space the way animal do.

“Rats don’t build maps,” Wyeth says. “They have other way of remember where they are.” Those way 

include neuron call place cell and head-direction cells, which respectively let the rat identify 

landmark and gauge it direction. Like other neurons, these cell be densely interconnect and work 

by adjust their spike pattern in response to different stimuli. To mimic this structure and behavior 

in software, Milford adopt a type of artificial neural network call an attractor network. These neural 

net consist of hundred to thousand of interconnect node that, like group of neurons, respond to an 

input by produce a specific spike pattern, know a an attractor state. Computational neuroscientist 

use attractor network to study neuron associate with memory and motor behavior. Milford and Wyeth 

want to use them to power RatSLAM. 

They spent month work on the software, and then they load it into a Pioneer robot, a mobile 

platform popular among roboticists. Their rat-brained bot be alive. 

But it be a failure. When they let it run in a 2-by-2-meter arena, Milford says, “it get lose even in that 

simple environment.” 

that RatSLAM didn’t have enough information with which to reduce 

error a it make it decisions. Like other SLAM algorithms, it doesn’t try to make exact, definite 

calculation about where thing be on the map it’s generating; instead, it relies on approximation and 

probability a a way of incorporate uncertainties—conflicting sensor readings, for example—that 

inevitably crop up. If you don’t take that into account, your robot end up lost. 

Milford and Wyeth realize 

That seem to be the problem with RatSLAM. In some cases, the robot would recognize a landmark and 

be able to refine it position, but other time the data be too ambiguous. After not too long, the accrue 

error be big than 2 meters—the robot thought it be outside the arena! 

In other words, their rat-brain model be too crude. It need good neural circuitry to be able to 

abstract more information about the world. 

“So we engineer a new type of neuron, which we call a ‘pose’ cell,” Milford says. The pose cell didn’t 

just tell the robot it location or it orientation, it do both at the same time. Now, when the robot 

identify a landmark it have see before, it could more precisely encode it place on the map and keep 

error in check. 

Again, Milford place the robot inside the 2-by-2-meter arena. “Suddenly, our robot could navigate quite 

well,” he recalls. 

Interestingly, not long after the researcher devise these artificial cells, neuroscientist in Norway 

announce the discovery of grid cells, which be neuron whose spike activity form regular geometric 

pattern and tell the animal it relative position within a certain area. [For more on the neuroscience of 

rats, see “ 

.”] 

AI Designers Find Inspiration in Rat Brains (/biomedical/imaging/ai-designers-find- 

inspiration-in-rat-brains) 

“Our pose cell weren’t exactly grid cells, but they have similar features,” Milford says. “That be rather 

gratifying.”

Rat Race: 

The robot test move to big arena with great complexity. “We do a whole floor, then multiple 

floor in the building,” Wyeth recalls. “Then I told Michael, ‘Let’s do a whole suburb.’ I thought he would 

kill me.” 

Milford load the RatSLAM software into a MacBook and taped it on the roof of his red 1994 Mazda 

Astina. To get a stream of data about the environment, he use the laptop’s camera, set it to snap a 

photo of the street ahead of the car several time per second. To get a stream of the data about the robot 

itself—in this case, his car—he found a creative solution. Instead of attach encoders to the wheel or 

use an IMU or GPS, he use simple image-processing techniques. By track and compare pixel on 

sequence of photo from the MacBook, his SLAM algorithm could calculate the vehicle’s speed a well a 

direction changes.

kilometers. The result wasn’t a precise, to-scale map, but it accurately represent the topology of the 

road and could pinpoint exactly where the car be at any give moment. RatSLAM worked.

But though RatSLAM create a stir, it didn’t set off a wave of research base on those same principles. 

And when Milford and Wyeth approach company about commercialize their system, they found 

many keen to hear their pitch but ultimately no takers. “A colleague told me we should have call it 

‘NeuroSLAM,’ ” Wyeth says. “People have bad association with rats.” 

That’s why Milford be excite about the two-year project with Caterpillar, which begin in March. “I’ve 

always want to create system that have real-world uses,” he says. “It take a lot longer than I expect 

for that to happen.”

Underground mine be among the harshest man-

dusty, and due to the possibility of a sudden 

collapse or explosion, they’re also extremely 

dangerous. For company operating in such an 

extreme environment, improve their ability to

In a surface mine, you’d simply use high-precision 

differential GPS, but that obviously doesn’t work 

below ground. Existing indoor navigation systems, 

such a laser mapping and RF networks, be 

expensive and often require infrastructure that’s 

difficult to deploy and maintain in the severe 

condition of a mine. For instance, when 

Caterpillar engineer consider 3D lidar, like the 

one use on self-driving cars, they conclude that 

“none of them can survive underground,” Smith 

says. 

One big reason that mine operator need to track 

their vehicle be to plan how they excavate. Each 

day start with a “dig plan” that specifies the 

amount of ore that will be mine in various 

tunnels. At the end of the day, the operator 

compare the dig plan to what be actually mined, to come up with the next day’s dig plan. “If you’re 

feed in inaccurate information, your plan be not go to be very good. You may start mining dirt 

instead of ore, or the whole tunnel could cave in,” Smith explains. “It’s really important to know what 

you’ve done.” 

The traditional method be for the miner to jot down his movement throughout the day, but that mean

he have to stop what he’s do to fill out paperwork, and he’s often guess what actually occurred. The 

QUT navigation system will more accurately measure where and how far each vehicle travels, a well a 

provide a reading of where the vehicle be at any give time. The first vehicle will drive into the mine and 

map the environment use the rat-brain-inspired navigation algorithm, while also gathering image of 

each tunnel with a low-cost 720p camera. The only unusual feature of the camera be it extreme 

ruggedization, which Smith say go well beyond military specifications. 

Subsequent vehicle will use those result to localize themselves within the mine, compare footage from 

their own camera with previously gather images. The vehicle won’t be autonomous, Milford notes, 

but that capability could eventually be achieve by combine the camera data with data from IMUs and 

other sensors. This would add more precision to the trucks’ positioning, allow them to drive 

themselves. 

The QUT team have start collect data within actual mines, which will be merge with another large 

data set from Caterpillar contain about a thousand hour of underground camera imagery. They will 

then devise a preliminary algorithm, to be test in an abandon mine somewhere in Queensland, with 

the help of Mining3, an Australian mining R&D company; the Queensland government be also a partner 

on the project. The system could be useful for deep open-pit mines, where GPS tends not to work reliably. 

If all go well, Caterpillar plan to commercialize the system quickly. “We need these solutions,” Smith 

says. 

relies on standard compute hardware to run it algorithms, although they 

keep tab on the late research in neuromorphic computing. “It’s still a bit early for u to dive in,” 

Milford says. Eventually, though, he expect his brain-inspired system will map well to neuromorphic 

chip architecture like and

Will brain-inspired navigation ever go mainstream? Many developer of self-driving cars, for instance, 

invest heavily in create detailed map of the road where their vehicle will drive. The vehicle then use 

their cameras, lidars, GPS, and other sensor to locate themselves on the maps, rather than have to 

build their own. 

Still, autonomous vehicle need to prove they can drive in condition like heavy rain, snow, fog, and 

darkness. They also need to good handle uncertainty in the data; image with glare, for instance, might 

have contribute to a

which rely on artificial neural networks, but it’s possible that 

more brain-inspired approach like RatSLAM could complement those systems, improve performance 

in difficult or unexpected scenarios.

Carnegie Mellon’s Wettergreen offer a more tantalize possibility: give car the ability to navigate to 

specific location without have to explicitly plan a trajectory on a city map. Future robots, he notes, will 

have everything model down to the millimeter. “But I don’t,” he says, “and yet I can still find my way

around. The human brain us different type of model and maps—some be metric, some be more 

topological, and some be semantic.” 

A human, he continues, can start with an idea like “Somewhere on the south side of the city, there’s a 

good Mexican restaurant.” Arriving in that general area, the person can then look for clue a to where 

the restaurant may be. “Even the most capable self-driving car wouldn’t know what to do with that kind 

of task, but a more brain-inspired system just might.” 

Some roboticists, however, be skeptical that such unconventional approach to SLAM be go to pay 

off. As sensor like lidar, IMUs, and GPS get good and cheaper, traditional SLAM algorithm will be able 

to produce increasingly accurate result by combine data from multiple sources. People tend to ignore 

the fact that “SLAM be really a sensor fusion problem and that we be get good and good at do 

SLAM with lower-cost sensors,” say , CEO of 

, a company base in San Jose, Calif., that sell 

. “I 

think this disregard cause people to fixate on try to solve SLAM with one sensor, like a camera, but in 

today’s low-cost sensor world that’s not really necessary.”

Even if RatSLAM doesn’t become practical for most applications, develop such brainlike algorithm 

offer u a window into our own intelligence, say 

, a computer scientist at the who 

collaborates with Milford. He note that standard computing’s von Neumann architecture, where the 

processor be separate from memory and data be shuttle between them, be very inefficient. 

Peter Stratton (http://researchers.uq.edu.au 

/researcher/730) Queensland Brain Institute (https://qbi.uq.edu.au/) 

“The brain doesn’t work anything like that. Memory and processing be both happen in the neuron. 

It’s ‘computing with memories,’ ” Stratton says. A good understand of brain activity, not only a it 

relates to response to stimulus but also in term of it deeper internal processes—memory retrieval, 

problem solving, daydreaming—is “what’s be miss from past AI attempts,” he says. 

Milford note that a lot of type of intelligence aren’t easy to study use only animals. But when you 

observe how rat and robot perform the same tasks, like navigate a new environment, you can test 

your theory about how the brain works. You can replay scenario repeatedly. You can tinker and 

manipulate your model and algorithms. “And unlike with an animal or an insect brain,” he says, “we can 

see everything in a robot’s ‘brain.’ ”
