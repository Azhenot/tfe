This Colloquium be concerned with the superconducting state of new high-Tc compound contain 
hydrogen ion (hydrides). Recently superconductivity with the record-setting transition temperature 
of Tc ¼ 203 K be report for sulfur hydride under high pressure. In general, high pressure serf 
a a path find tool toward novel structures, include those with very high Tc. The field have a rich 
and interest history. Currently, it be broadly recognize that superconductivity in sulfur hydride 
owes it origin to the phonon mechanism. However, the picture differs from the conventional one in 
important ways. The phonon spectrum in sulfur hydride be both broad and have a complex structure. 
Superconductivity arises mainly due to strong couple to the high-frequency optical modes, although 
the acoustic phonons also make a noticeable contribution. A new approach be described, which 
generalizes the standard treatment of the phonon mechanism and make it possible to obtain an 
analytical expression for Tc in this phase. It turn out that, unlike in the conventional case, the value of 
the isotope coefficient (for the deuterium-hydrogen substitution) varies with the pressure and reflect 
the impact of the optical modes. The phase diagram, that be the pressure dependence of Tc, be rather 
peculiar. A crucial feature be that increase pressure result in a series of structural transitions, 
include the one which yield the superconducting phase with the record Tc of 203 K. In a narrow 
region near P ≈ 150 GPa the critical temperature rise sharply from Tc ≈ 120 to ≈ 200 K. It seem 
that the sharp structural transition, which produce the high-Tc phase, be a first-order phase transition 
cause by interaction between the order parameter and lattice deformations. A remarkable feature of 
the electronic spectrum in the high-Tc phase be the appearance of small pocket at the Fermi level. 
Their presence lead to a two-gap spectrum, which can, in principle, be observe with the future use 
of tunnel spectroscopy. This feature lead to nonmonotonic and strongly asymmetric pressure 
dependence of Tc. Other hydrides, e.g., CaH6 and MgH6, can be expect to display even high 
value of Tc up to room temperature. The fundamental challenge lie in the creation of a structure 
capable of display high Tc at ambient pressure.

I. INTRODUCTION 

In a recent development, superconductivity with a critical 
temperature Tc ¼ 203 Kwas observe in sulfur hydride under 
high pressure (Drozdov et al., 2015). This development be the 
most significant breakthrough since the discovery of the high- 
Tc oxide (Bednorz and Mueller, 1986). There be every reason 
to anticipate even high value of Tc for other hydrides, 
which mean that achieve superconductivity at room tem- 
perature now appear perfectly realistic.

We focus here on theoretical aspects, which can provide a 
clue to understand the specific of the new superconduct- 
ing state. It should be emphasize that in many respect the 
system be quite unusual. As will be discussed, the observe 
phenomenon can be explain by the phonon mechanism. 
Nevertheless, a number of key feature reveal that the picture 
differs from the conventional one. In this Colloquium we 
devote particular attention to these features. One of them be the 
peculiar pressure dependence of the critical temperature. Not 
only do external pressure result in metallization and the 
appearance of superconductivity, but also the value of Tc 
grows dramatically with a further rise in pressure. Moreover, 
this variation turn out to be nonmonotonic. It should also be 
note that while Cooper pair formation be mediate by 
phonons, the complex structure of the phonon spectrum 
and it broad range (all the way up to Ω ≈ 2000 K, where 
Ω be the phonon frequency) make it necessary to modify the 
conventional treatment. While the strong isotope effect affirms 
the action of the phonon mechanism, the value of the isotope 
coefficient turn out to vary with pressure. Next we discus 
all these interest aspect of the new development in 
superconductivity. 
Despite it rich and interest prehistory, the discovery 

come a a surprise, especially for those who accept the notion 
that electron-phonon interaction cannot give rise to such a 
high Tc. The background of this notion will be discuss 
late (Sec. III.A). One also should not lose track of the fact that 
this impressive discovery come about thanks to the remarkable 
progress in high-pressure technique and to experimental 
innovation by the M. Eremets group (Max Planck 
Institute, Mainz, Germany). Note that the study of the 
hydride have attract the attention of many theoretical 
group (see Sec. III). And special credit should be give to 
the group of Y. Ma and also to D. Duan, T. Cui, and their 
collaborator (Julin University, Changchun, China) (see 
Secs. III and VII). Their remarkable study brought special 
attention to the sulfur hydride and motivate the key 
experimental studies. 
A few remark on the historical perspective be in order. 

The phenomenon of superconductivity be discover more 
than 100 year ago by Onnes (1911). While measure the 
temperature dependence of the electrical resistance RðTÞ of 
mercury he observe that at the temperature of 4.2 K the 
resistivity suddenly vanishes. The dissipationless (R ¼ 0) 
state which emerge be name the superconducting state. 
Subsequently superconductivity be discover in many other 
materials. Moreover, it be soon realize that the loss of 
resistance be only one facet of the superconducting state; 
hence, the latter correspond to a qualitatively new state of 
matter. Its most fundamental feature, the so-called Meissner 
effect (Meissner and Ochsenfeld, 1933), be manifest in the 
expulsion of the magnetic field from the bulk of the sample 
(anomalous diamagnetism). 
The microscopic theory of superconductivity be create 

by Bardeen, Cooper, and Schrieffer (1957), almost 50 year 
after the experimental discovery. According to the BCS 
theory, the key microscopic factor behind the phenomenon 
be the attraction between electron mediate by the exchange 
of phonons, such that below Tc within the electronic system 

there form a macroscopic manifold of bound electron pair 
(known a the Cooper pairs). Thus the attraction have it 
origin in the ionic system; qualitatively the effect may be 
related to the dielectric function change it sign at low 
frequencies. 
The well-known expression for the critical temperature be 

Tc ≈ ~Ω exp 
� 
− 1 
λ − μ� 

� 
. ð1:1Þ 

Here ~Ω be the characteristic phonon frequency (typically on 
the order of the Debye temperature), λ be the electron-phonon 
couple constant, and μ� be the so-called Coulomb pseudo- 
potential which characterizes the direct electron-electron 
repulsion (usually μ� ≈ 0.1–0.15). Equation (1.1) be valid in 
the weak couple approximation (λ ≪ 1). Note that the 
specific value of the preexponential factor be determine by 
the renormalization effect (see Sec. III.A). 
The search for superconducting material with high 

critical temperature have be ongoing. Figure 1 show 
how the maximum transition temperature within different 
superconductor family have grown with time. In the first 
75 year progress be rather modest (from Tc ¼ 4.2 K for 
mercury up to Tc ≈ 23 K in Nb3Ge). A breakthrough come in 
1986 when Bednorz and Mueller discover a new family of 
superconducting materials, the copper oxide (cuprates), and 
observe a Tc close to 40 K in the La-Sr-Cu-O compound. 
Subsequent research on cuprates raise their Tc all the way up 
to 130 K in the HgBaCaCuO compound (Schilling et al., 
1993). For what follows, it be noteworthy that under pressure 
Tc be raise up to ≈160 K (Gao et al., 1994). Until recently, 
this remain the high critical temperature ever observed. 

FIG. 1. Increase in Tc;max with time. During the next 75 year 
since the discovery the increase be ΔTc ≈ 18 K; the main focus 
be on the Nb-based materials. The high Tc for the cuprates at 
ambient pressure (Tc ≈ 130 K) be raise under pressure up to 
Tc ≈ 160 K. At present, the curve be extend up to Tc;max ¼ 
203 K observe for sulfur hydride under high pressure.

II. HYDRIDES 

A. Metallic hydrogen 

As note in the Introduction, recent work on sulfur hydride 
under high pressure lead to the observation of a superconduct- 
ing state with the record value of Tc ¼ 203 K. This achieve- 
ment be precede by developments, which start almost 50 
year ago (Ashcroft, 1968). According to the BCS theory, Tc 
be proportional to the characteristic phonon frequency ~Ω ∝ 
1= 

ffiffiffiffiffi 
M 

p 
[see Eq. (1.1)]. One may expect, therefore, that 

metallic hydrogen should have a high value of Tc: for such 
a light metal the characteristic phonon frequency in the 
prefactor of Eq. (1.1) be high and (ignoring for the moment 
the magnitude of the exponential factor) Tc may also turn out 
to be rather high. However, this prediction can be verify only 
under very high pressure. Indeed, hydrogen first must become 
metallic, but the transition from the molecular phase into the 
metallic state be know to require high pressure (Wigner and 
Huntington, 1935). This be the dissociative transition to an 
atomic lattice, which occurs through compression of solid 
molecular hydrogen. 
A conductive (probably, semimetalic) state of hydrogen 

be observe by Eremets and Troyan (2011) at room temper- 
ature under the pressure of 260–270 GPa (recall that 100 GPa 
corresponds to 1 × 106 atmospheres). 
The phase diagram for hydrogen be rather complicate 

(Fig. 2), and the determination of this diagram be a nontrivial 
task. The main complication derives from the fact that the usual 
technique for structure determination, which underlies the phase 
diagram of materials, namely, x-ray diffraction (XRD), be not 
conclusive because scatter by hydrogen be very weak. The 
diagram in Fig. 2 be base on Raman and infrared measurement 
along with resistivity data. The low temperature phase I–III 
be observe at relatively low pressure (≤150 GPa); see the 
review by Mao and Hemley (1994). 

Recently Eremets, Troyan, andDrozdov (2016) and Eremets 
et al. (2017) observe a new phase (phase VI in Fig. 2) at 
pressure ≳360 GPa and temperature <200 K. This phase 
display a drastic drop in resistivity, characteristic featureless 
Raman spectra, and the absence of a photoconductive response. 
These property be characteristic of the metallic state. 
Concerning the superconducting state of metallic hydrogen, 

theoretical calculation (McMahon et al., 2012) show that a 
high Tc state of pure metallic hydrogen require pressure on 
the order of ≈500 GPa. Hopefully, this phenomenon will be 
observe in the near future. 

B. Hydrides: High-Tc superconductivity 

The reason for an elevate value of Tc applies not only to 
pure hydrogen but also to hydrides, that is, to material 
contain hydrogen a one of their component (Ashcroft, 
2004;Wang andMa, 2014). The presence of hydrogen result in 
the appearance of high-frequency optical-phonon modes, 
whereas heavy ion provide additional acoustic modes, which 
also contribute to the pairing.At the same time, themetallization 
of such compound do not require extraordinarily high 
pressures. In fact, hydride be even more promising material 
than pure metallic hydrogen. Indeed, the presence of more than 
one ion in the unit cell, in this case an additional hydrogen ion, 
lead to an appearance of high-frequency optical mode which, 
in addition to high frequency, be characterize by a high density 
of states. The latter be beneficial for superconductivity. 
A number of density-functional theory study support the 

high promise of hydride compounds. For example, calculation 
(Gao et al., 2008) suggest that GaH3 at P ≈ 160 GPa would 
display Tc ≈ 140 K and Si2H6 at ≈275 GPa would display 
Tc ≈ 73–86 K (Jin et al., 2010). The most thermodynamically 
stable structure be establish by calculate the enthalpy- 
difference curves. Among others, the minimum hop method 
be employ (Goedecker, 2004). 
Initial experiment on SiH4 (Eremets et al., 2008) demon- 

strated that hydride can indeed support a superconducting 
state, although the critical temperature be a relatively modest 
≈17 K. Later, follow the discovery of the record high Tc in 
sulfur hydrides, a high-Tc state (≈100 K) in covalent hydride 
phosphine (P-H) be also observe (Drozdov, Eremets, and 
Troyan,2015).Theoreticalanalysis (Flores-Livas,Amsleretal., 
2016) suggest that the PH1;2;3 system indeed have a rather 
high Tc, but the material be probably in a metastable state. 
Li et al. (2014) make the prediction that metallic sulfur 

hydride would become superconducting with Tc ≈ 80 K 
under the relatively low pressure P ≈ 100 GPa. Following 
the first experimental observation of such a superconducting 
state, Eremets and collaborator continued increase the 
pressure and discover that Tc go up significantly all 
the way to Tc ≈ 203 K (Drozdov, Eremets, and Troyan, 2014; 
Drozdov et al., 2015); see also the review by Eremets and 
Drozdov (2016). Such a remarkable observation be 
explain by a mixed valence of S and the formation of 
sulfur hydride with a high hydrogen content. This 
assumption be in agreement with an interest independent 
theoretical study by Duan et al. (2014) More specifically, an 
increase in pressure be accompany by the formation of H3S 
structural unit [Fig. 3(a)] via the follow transformation: 

FIG. 2. The phase diagram of hydrogen. Letters I–VI indicate 
domain for different phases. Phases I–III correspond to a 
molecular state of pure hydrogen. Their boundary can be 
determine from Raman and infrared measurements. Phase IV 
be a mixed atomic-molecular phase, phase V be an atomic liquid 
phase. Recently observe phase VI corresponds to the metallic 
state. From Eremets, Troyan, and Drozdov, 2016.

3H2S → 2H3Sþ S. ð2:1Þ 

The transformation H2S → H3S have also be confirm by 
detailed calculation of Bernstein et al. (2015) and Errea 
et al. (2015). 
Sulfur hydride at the pressure P ≈ 90 GPa have Tc ≈ 90 K. 

As mentioned, the subsequent increase in pressure lead to a 
large increase in the value of the critical temperature up to 
Tc ≈ 200 K. This pressure dependence implies that the 
presence of hydrogen be necessary but not sufficient by itself 
for reach the high Tc values. Indeed, the sample at 
90 GPa contains hydrogen and consequently high-frequency 
modes. The Tc of 90 K be very high and be sensational 
30 year ago, but it be much below the 203 K that be achieve 
under high pressure. Therefore the pressure increase brings 
in some additional factors. As mentioned, Drozdov, Eremets, 
and Troyan (2014) and Drozdov et al. (2015) suggest that 
the rise in Tc be due to the formation of new compound with 
high valence state of sulfur. 
As will be described, the pressure increase change the 

crystal structure of sulfur hydride, thereby signify a 
structural phase transition. The structural transformation play 
the crucial role in the observe behavior. 
Next we focus on the two phase with the high value of 

Tc (Fig. 3). One of them [Figs. 3(a) and 3(b)] have the crystal 
structure, which corresponds to R3m symmetry (Massa, 2004). 
Increasing the pressure further leads, at P ≈ 150 GPa, to the 
appearance of a different phase [Fig. 3(c)]. It be this new 
structure that display the record-high Tc. The symmetry group 

of the lattice be cubic Oh ðIm-3mÞ. The theoretically predict 
structure be in agreement with x-ray data (Einaga et al., 2016; 
Goncharov et al., 2016, 2017). 
The usual x-ray spectroscopy do not allow one to 

determine the structure of the hydride with a high accuracy, 
because the light H ion do not provide strong scattering. In 
addition, the multiphase nature of the study sample 
(Goncharov et al., 2016) also represent a serious complica- 
tion. Recently, advance spectroscopy have be employ to 
monitor how the structure evolves with pressure (Goncharov 
et al., 2017). More specifically, the synthesis perform out of 
S and molecular hydrogen along with the cyclotron XRD 
technique and Raman spectroscopy do allow the researcher 
to study all structure form with an increase in pressure. It 
turn out that the transformation (2.1) occurs at pressure 
P > 40 GPa. It have also be demonstrate that the phase at 
P≲ 110 GPa (Tc ≈ 120 K) have R3m symmetry [Figs. 3(a) 
and 3(b)]. As for the most interest high-Tc phase, it 
structure [Fig. 3(c)], indeed, be characterize by the Im-3m 
symmetry. 
The transformation (2.1) support the suggestion by 

Drozdov et al. (2015); see the previous discussion on the 
mixed valence state of sulfur. The latter factor turn out to be 
essential (see Sec. IV.C). 

C. Superconductivity in hydrides: Main property 

Experimentally, the onset of the high-Tc superconducting 
state in sulfur hydride (Drozdov et al., 2015) be detect by 
the drastic resistance drop near Tc. A sharp transition be 
observe in anneal samples. The measure resistance be at 
least 2 order of magnitude below that of pure copper. 
The critical temperature shift downward in the presence of 

an external magnetic field. Magnetic susceptibility measure- 
ments reveal an abrupt transition into the diamagnetic state 
(the Meissner effect). This key result be also confirm by a 
direct observation (Troyan et al., 2016) of magnetic field 
expulsion a detect by the response of a thin Sn film place 
inside the bulk sample. The Meissner effect be also observe 
late by Huang et al. (2016) by mean of ac magnetic 
susceptibility measurements. 
Next we concentrate on the two phase with the high Tc. 

One of them (R3m) [Figs. 3(a) and 3(b)] have Tc ≈ 120 K, and 
the other (Im-3m [Fig. 3(c)] have the high Tc of ≈200 K.We 
refer to the former structure a the “low-Tc phase” (although 
this name sound ironic for Tc ≈ 120 K), and to the second 
structure a the “high-Tc phase.” 
The question of the mechanism of superconductivity with 

such a record Tc be of fundamental interest. The strong isotope 
effect indicates that pair be provide by phonon exchange. 
The main contribution come from the high-frequency optical 
modes. Nevertheless, a stress in the Introduction, the 
picture be far from conventional. 
The phase diagram, that is, the pressure dependence of Tc, 

be very peculiar. Indeed, Fig. 4 demonstrates that Tc be strongly 
dependent on the apply pressure (Einaga et al., 2016). It 
increase from ≈100–120 K up to the record ≈200 K over the 
relatively narrow pressure interval 125–150 GPa. We argue 
that such a rapid Tc change be a fingerprint of a first-order 
structural transition.

Note that once Tc reach it maximum value, it decrease 
upon further rise in apply pressure. The decline be rather 
slow, so that the Tc dependence be strongly asymmetric 
relative to Tc;max. Such a dependence be unusual and require 
an explanation. We interpret this feature (see Sec. VII.D) a 
derive from the impact of the superconducting order 
parameter on the main Fermi surface and on small pockets, 
with the latter appear in the electronic spectrum of the 
high-Tc phase in the course of a first-order phase transition. 
Note also that because of the complex structure and the 

width of the phonon spectrum evaluation of Tc and of the 
isotope coefficient (whose value turn out to be pressure 
dependent) must be carry out with considerable care. 
The next section contains a general description of the 

phonon mechanism with emphasis on the strong couple 
case. Subsequent section focus on the challenge previously 
described. 

III. ELECTRON-PHONON INTERACTION: 
CRITICAL TEMPERATURE 

A. Main equations: Coupling constant and Tc 

Our main goal be to evaluate the value of the critical 
temperature for the hydrides. The usual BCS model be 
not applicable here, because it have be developed in a 
weak couple approximation (λ ≪ 1 and correspondingly, 
2πTc ≪ ~Ω). The equation describe strong-coupled super- 
conductor (Migdal, 1958; Eliashberg, 1960) contain the so- 
call phonon propagator [see Eq. (3.1)], and therefore the 
phonon frequency Ω. 
The equation for the pair order parameter ΔðωnÞ have the 

follow form (at T ¼ Tc): 

ΔðωnÞZ ¼ πTc

Here 

D ¼ Ω

Ω2 þ ðωn − ωmÞ2 ð3:2Þ 

be the phonon propagator, Ω be the phonon frequency, and 
ωn ¼ ð2nþ 1ÞπTc (the method of thermodynamic Green’s 
function be employed) [see, e.g., Abrikosov, Gor’kov, and 
Dzyaloshinski (1975)]; one should also add the Coulomb 
pseudopotential μ�. The factor Z be the renormalization 
function determine by 

Z¼ 1þðπTc=ωnÞ 
X 
m 

Z 
dΩ 

α2ðΩÞFðΩÞ 
Ω 

DðΩ;ωn−ωmÞ ωmjωmj . 
ð3:3Þ 

The renormalization function describes the “dressing” of 
electron move through the ionic lattice. 
Equations (3.1) and (3.3) contain the important quantity, the 

function α2ðΩÞFðΩÞ. Here FðΩÞ be the phonon density of 
states, α2ðΩÞ describes the electron-phonon interaction and 
contains the correspond matrix element (Scalapino, 1969; 
Grimvall, 1981; Wolf, 2012). 
In addition, one can introduce an important parameter, the 

so-called couple constant λ, define by 

λ ¼ 
Z 

dΩ 
α2ðΩÞFðΩÞ 

Ω 
. ð3:4Þ 

Note that Eqs. (3.1) and (3.3) do not explicitly contain the 
couple constant λ. Indeed, generally speaking, this constant 
cannot be factor out, because the phonon frequency enters 
not only in the factor α2ðΩÞFðΩÞ but also in the phonon 
propagator DðΩ;ωn − ωmÞ, which, in addition, depends on 
ωn − ωm [see Eq. (3.2)]. It be apparent from Eq. (3.1) or (3.3) 
that the couple constant can be factor out, if Eq. (3.1) do 
not contain a phonon propagator function (e.g., D ≈ 1 for the 
weak couple case) or if the phonon propagator D slowly 
depends on the frequencyΩ, so that Ω inD can be replace by 
it average value. 
When the function α2ðΩÞFðΩÞ be known, the value of 

the critical temperature can be evaluate from the nonlinear 
equation similar to Eq. (3.1) with the replacement jωnj → 
½ω2n þ Δ2ðωnÞ�1=2 in the denominator of the integrand 
(Gor’kov, 1958). Such an equation describes the order 
parameter at any temperature [then ωn ¼ ð2nþ 1ÞπT]. The 
calculation can be perform numerically, without invoke 
the couple constant concept. We discus the correspond 
method in Sec. IV.A while focus on the sulfur hydrides. 
At the same time the possibility to introduce the couple 

constant λ be beneficial for the analysis. The concept of 
a couple constant be commonly use to study usual 
superconductors. It allows one to deduce the analytical expres- 
sion for Tc and interpret it dependence on other para- 
meter in the problem. Such an approach be justified, because 
usually the function α2ðΩÞFðΩÞ be characterize by the peak 
structure in phonon density of state FðΩÞ [see, e.g., Wolf 
(2012), and also Fig. 5(b)]. The latter structure corresponds 
to the short-wavelength part of the spectrum where the 

FIG. 4. Pressure dependence of Tc. The data for anneal 
sample be presented. One can see a large increase in the value 
of Tc in the region near P ¼ 140 GPa. Adapted from Einaga 
et al., 2016.

mode dispersion be weak. The phonon propagator change 
slowly on the scale correspond to the peak structure, 
and this permit the replacement of Ω in the phonon 
propagator by it average value ~Ω; the latter can be take 
either a ~Ω ¼ hΩ2i1=2 [see, e.g., Louie and Cohen (1977), and 
the review by Grimvall (1981) and Kresin and Wolf (2009)], 
or a ~Ω ¼ hΩlogi which be close to ~Ω ¼ hΩ2i1=2 (Allen and 
Dynes, 1975; Carbotte, 1990). The average hfi be define by 
hfðΩÞi ¼ ð2=λÞ R dΩfðΩÞα2ðΩÞFðΩÞΩ−1. If ~Ω ¼ hΩlogi, 
then f ¼ logΩ. We have chosen ~Ω ¼ hΩ2i1=2, so that 
hΩ2i ¼ ð2=λÞ R dΩΩα2ðΩÞFðΩÞ; λ be define by Eq. (3.4). 
As a result, Eqs. (3.1) and (3.3) can be write in the form 

ΔðωnÞZ ¼ πTcλ

Dð ~Ω;ωn − ωmÞΔðωmÞjωmj ; ð3:5Þ 

Z ¼ 1þ ðπTc=ωnÞλ

Here 

Dð ~Ω;ωn −ωmÞ ¼ ~Ω2=½ðωn −ωmÞ2 þ ~Ω2�; ~Ω¼ hΩ2i1=2. 
ð3:7Þ 

As be known, the solution of Eq. (3.5) can be write in 
analytical form and the explicit expression depends on the 
strength of the electron-phonon interaction [see the review by 
Kresin, Morawitz, and Wolf (2014)]. For the weak couple 
case (λ ≪ 1; then 2πTc ≪ ~Ω), D ≈ 1, Z ≈ 1, and we obtain a 
well-known BCS expression, Eq. (1.1). For the intermediate 
couple one should take into account the renormalization of 
the couple constant, since Z ≈ 1þ λ, and Tc be described by 
the correspond equation (Nakajima and Watabe, 1963; 
Grimvall, 1981). Note that even in the weak couple case the 
renormalization function affect the value of the preexponen- 
tial factor (Karakozov, Maksimov, and Mashkov, 1976; Wang 
and Chubukov, 2013), which appear to be approximately 
a ≈ 0.25 ~Ω; see Eqs. (4.5) and (7.1). Awell-known McMillan- 
Dynes expression (McMillan, 1968; Dynes, 1972) be widely 
use in the literature: 

Tc ¼ ð ~Ω=1.2Þ exp 
� 
− 1.04ð1þ λÞ 
λ − μ�ð1þ 0.62λÞ 

� 
. ð3:8Þ 

This expression be valid for λ≲ 1.5. Note that for small λ 
Eq. (3.8) can be write in a form similar to Eq. (1.1) with 
a ≈ 0.3 ~Ω, which be close to the value already mentioned. For 
large value of λ one should use a different expression, which 
be obtain by numerical modification of Eq. (3.8) (Allen 
and Dynes, 1975); see Sec. IV.A. One can also use the 
expression valid for any λ (Kresin, 1987); see Eq. (7.1). Note 
that for the case of very strong couple (λ≳ 5; then πTc ≳ ~Ω) 
the dependence of Tc on λ be entirely different from Eqs. (1.1) 
and (3.8) (we omit μ� for simplicity) and have the follow 
form: 

Tc ¼ 0.18λ1=2 ~Ω ð3:9Þ 

[see Allen and Dynes (1975) and Kresin, Gutfreund, and 
Little (1984)]. 
In addition, one can introduce the follow important 

relation (McMillan, 1968): 

λ ¼ hIi2ν=M ~Ω2 ð3:10Þ 

(I describes the electron-phonon scattering, and ν be the 
electronic density of states). 
The important question be whether there exists an upper 

limit of the value of Tc. A “myth,” which persists even today, 
claim that the phonon mechanism be unable to provide the 
value of the critical temperature high than ∼30 K. For some 
scientist the argumentation be base on Eqs. (3.8) and (3.10). 
Indeed, neglect μ� for simplicity and calculate ∂Tc=∂ ~Ω, 
one can easily find the maximum value of Tc; this value 
corresponds to λ ≈ 2. However, the McMillan equation be 
valid only for λ≲ 1.5. This limitation be mention below 
Eq. (3.8). In connection with this, note that the MacMillan- 
Dynes equation (3.8) be obtain by take into consid- 
eration the renormalization function Z ≈ 1þ λ [see Eqs. (3.1) 
and (3.3)] and by fitting the coefficient to describe the data on 
Nb. The same limitation be obtain by Geilikman, Kresin, 
and Masharov (1975), who analytically derive the equation 
similar to (3.8) [see Eq. (4.6)]; the derivation be valid for

λ≲ 1.5 [then ðπTc= ~ΩÞ2 ≪ 1]. Therefore, the value λ ≈ 2 be 
outside the range of the applicability of the MacMillan-Dynes 
equation. One can see from Eq. (3.9) that the mention upper 
limit for Tc do not exist. 
Another erroneous restriction be impose not on the 

dependence of Tc on λ (see above), but on the limit value 
of the couple constant λ itself. In the framework of the so- 
call Froelich Hamiltonian Ĥ ¼ Ĥel þ Ĥph þ Ĥint, where 
Ĥph contains the phonon frequency Ω0ðqÞ and Ĥint describes 
the electron-phonon interaction, one obtains for the frequency 
~Ω, renormalize by the electron-phonon interaction, that 
~Ω ¼ Ω0ð1 − 2λÞ1=2. One concludes that the lattice becomes 
unstable at a value of the couple constant λ ¼ 0.5, and 
therefore the value Tc ≤ 0.1 ~Ω [see Eq. (1.1), ~Ω ≈ ΩD] 
provide the upper limit of the critical temperature. At the 
same time, there exist many superconductors with λ > 0.5 
(e.g., Sn, Pb, Hg). To clarify this point, an analysis base on 
rigorous adiabatic theory be carry out (Browman and 
Kagan, 1967; Geilikman, 1971). It be show that the use 
of the experimentally observable acoustic law for Ω0ðqÞ be not 
self-consistent. The electron-ion interaction participates in the 
formation of the phonon spectrum in the system, so that one be 
deal with a double counting. 
Starting from the adiabatic theory with the Hamiltonian 

Ĥ ¼ T̂r⃗ þ T̂R⃗ þ Vðr⃗; R⃗Þ [T̂r⃗ and T̂R⃗ be kinetic energy oper- 
ators for electron and ions, and Vðr⃗; R⃗Þ be the sum of the 
Coulomb interactions] one can evaluate the electron-phonon 
interaction and the phonon spectrum rigorously. The electron- 
phonon interaction, indeed, lead to the formation of the 
experimentally observe phonon spectrum, and the afore- 
mention limitation on the value of the couple constant be 
absent. 
There be superconductors with large value of the couple 

constant (e.g., λ ≈ 2.6 for Am-Pb0.45Bi0.55) (Wolf, 2012). 
The combination of high characteristic phonon frequency 
and large couple constant can provide the high temperature 
superconducting state. This be the case for the sulfur hydrides, 
where such combination lead to a high value of Tc (see 
Sec. IV). 
Note also that the complex structure of the phonon spectrum 

require a modification of the usual method a discuss in 
Sec. IV.B. 

B. Function α2ðΩÞFðΩÞ: Tunneling spectroscopy 

Tunneling spectroscopy of ordinary metal be the uniquely 
powerful tool allow u to obtain important information 
about the energy spectrum of a superconductor. To be more 
concrete, with the use of this technique, one can measure 
the value of the energy gap, which include the case of the 
multigap structure of the spectrum (the case be relevant to the 
hydrides, see Sec. VI.D). Moreover, it allows one to evaluate 
such an important quantity a the function α2ðΩÞFðΩÞ; see 
Eqs. (3.1)–(3.4). 
The tunnel contact contains two electrode separate by 

a barrier. For the most interest case of the S-I-N system 
(S stand for a superconductor, N for a normal metal, and I for 
an insulator), one can obtain the follow relation [Schrieffer, 

Scalapino, and Wilkins, 1963; see also the review by 
Scalapino (1969)]: 

σs=σN ¼ jωj½jωj2 − Δ2ðωÞ�−1=2. ð3:11Þ 
Here σs be the tunnel conductivity, σs ¼ ∂j=∂V, j be the 
tunnel current, and V be the apply voltage. ΔðωÞ 
corresponds to the analytical continuation of ΔðωnÞ to the 
real axis, and σN be the conductivity for the N-I-N junction. 
The value of the energy gap ε0 be determine by ω ¼ ΔðiωÞ. 
The quantity σs=σN can be measure experimentally [see 

Eq. (3.11)]. Since this quantity have a sharp peak at ω ¼ ε0, the 
tunnel can be use for measure the value of the energy 
gap that corresponds to the peak in the density of states. Note 
that the observation, say, of two peak would manifest the 
presence of the two energy gap (see Sec. VI.D). 
The special inversion procedure, allow one to recon- 

struct the function α2ðΩÞFðΩÞ and the value of μ� be 
developed by McMillan and Rowell (1965) [see Rowell 
(1969) and Wolf (2012)]. Usually the function α2ðΩÞFðΩÞ 
contains peaks; they correspond to peak in phonon density of 
states. Note that, in turn, the function FðΩÞ can be measure 
independently by the neutron scatter technique. The 
coincidence of the peak obtain by these two method 
(i.e., tunnel spectroscopy and neutron scattering) be crucial 
evidence of the fact that the pairing, indeed, be cause by the 
phonon mechanism. 
For the sulfur hydride the tunnel spectroscopy have not 

be perform yet. It would be interest to develop 
tunnel spectroscopy and determine the important function 
α2ðΩÞFðΩÞ for these new materials. 
Note that the tunnel measurement under pressure be 

perform by Zavaritskii, Itskevich, and Voronovskii (1971) to 
study property of Pb. Asmentioned, this method have not be 
use so far for sulfur hydride and the function α2ðΩÞFðΩÞ and 
the energy gap have not be determine experimentally. In 
what follow we be use the result of several theoretical 
paper describe the calculation of α2ðΩÞFðΩÞ perform 
with use of the density-functional formalism (see Sec. IV.A). 

IV. SULFUR HYDRIDES 

A. Phonon spectrum and the electron-phonon interaction 

Let u now turn our attention to the material of interest, 
sulfur hydride. As noted, the Cooper pair in the super- 
conduct state be provide by the electron-phonon inter- 
action and the main role be played by high-frequency optical 
modes. This mechanism be manifest in the large value of the 
isotope coefficient for substitution of deuterium for hydrogen 
(see Sec. V). 
In principle, the value of the critical temperature can be 

evaluate with the help of Eqs. (3.1) and (3.3), which contain 
the function α2ðΩÞFðΩÞ. As mentioned, the tunnel mea- 
surements allow one to reconstruct this function have not 
be perform yet. Instead, we use result of the calculation 
carry out by several groups. For example, Fig. 6 show the 
function α2ðΩÞFðΩÞ calculate by Duan et al. (2014) both for 
the high-Tc phase (Tc ¼ 203 K) and for the structure with the 
low value of the critical temperature (Tc ≈ 120 K). For

Rev. Mod. Phys., Vol. 90, No. 1, January–March 2018 011001-7 



comparison, one can see the picture for Pb, the conventional 
superconductor (Fig. 5). The lattice dynamic and super- 
conduct property be treat with use of the density- 
functional theory ( Baroni et al., 2001) and the quantum 
expresso code (Paolo, 2009). Results for the function 
α2ðΩÞFðΩÞ be also give by Durajski, Szczesniak, and Li 
(2015), Errea et al. (2015), and Sano et al. (2016). As 
mentioned, all these calculation be base on the density- 
functional formalism, but because of use different code 
they differ in details, which lead to some spread in the 
numerical results. Nevertheless, the calculate density of 
state FðΩÞ and the function α2ðΩÞFðΩÞ be rather similar. 
One can see from Fig. 6 that for sulfur hydride the function 

α2ðΩÞFðΩÞ have a rather complicate structure. Indeed, in 
addition to acoustic modes, it contains a number of optical 
phonons. Moreover, because of high frequency of optical 
modes, the phonon spectrum be broad and extend up to 
200 meV [Fig. 5(c)]. 
As mention in Sec. III.A, the value of the critical 

temperature can be found without invoke the couple 
constant concept (Akashi et al., 2015; Errea et al., 2015; 
Flores-Livas, Sanna, and Gross, 2016; Sano et al., 2016). Such 
a program be carry out in the framework of the super- 
conduct density-functional theory (Luders et al., 2005). 
Errea et al. (2015) use the equation, similar to Eq. (3.1) with 
the replacementjωnj → ½ω2n þ Δ2ðωnÞ�1=2 in the denominator 
of the integrand. This equation be valid at any temperature. The 
value of Tc be calculate from such a nonlinear equation by 
successive approximations. With each iteration the value of 

order parameter ΔðωnÞ decreases, and Tc be identify a the 
point (after up to 512 iterations) where the order parameter 
approach zero. 
According to Errea et al. (2015) and Sano et al. (2016), an 

important role be played by anharmonicity. For example, 
take anharmonicity into account noticeably shift the value 
of Tc by a much a up to ∼60 K: from Tc ≈ 260 K to Tc ≈ 
200 K in the high-Tc phase. The role of anharmonicity and 
quantum effect be analyze with the use of the so-called 
stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation, developed 
by Errea, Calandra, and Mauri (2014). The impact of the zero 
point motion be analyze by Bianconi and Jarlborg (2015a) 
and Sano et al. (2016). The effect of anharmonicity and zero 
point motion could be essential, because of the small mass of 
the hydrogen ions. The problem raise in the aforementioned 
paper deserve further study. 
As notice in the previous section, the concept of the 

couple constant be fruitful for study conventional 
superconductors. A similar approach be use by Li et al. 
(2014) and Papaconstantopoulos et al. (2015) to calculate Tc 
for sulfur hydrides. Since the value of the total couple 
constant be large λ ≳ 2 (see Fig. 6), they do not use Eq. (3.8), 
but a more general expression (Allen and Dynes, 1975): 

Tc ¼ 
f1f2 ~Ωlog 

1.2 
exp 

� 
− 1.04ð1þ λÞ 
λ − μ� − 0.62λμ� 

� 
. ð4:1Þ 

Equation (4.1) be similar to Eq. (3.8), but the preexponential 
factor be multiply by the product f1f2; the function f1 and 
f2 be numerically fit for the solution valid at large λ and have 
the follow form: 

f1 ¼ ½1þ ðλ=Λ1Þ3=2�1=3; 
f2 ¼ 1þ λ2ð ~Ω=Ωlog − 1Þðλ2 þΛ22Þ−1; 
Λ1 ¼ 2.46ð1þ 3.8μ∗Þ; 
Λ2 ¼ 1.82ð1þ 6.3μ∗Þð ~Ω=ΩlogÞ. 

The large value of the constant for the couple to character- 
istic phonon frequency lead to a high Tc close to that 
observe experimentally. 
The phonon spectrum of the sulfur hydride be broad and 

rather complex: it contains a number of optical and acoustic 
branches. On the other hand, these branch be well sepa- 
rated, and this separation allows u to develop a different 
approach, which will be described in the next section. 

B. Generalized equation and two couple constant 

In a more general approach (Gor’kov and Kresin, 2016) the 
value of Tc be evaluate analytically. As will be shown, it 
allows u to compare the relative contribution of the optical 
and acoustic mode for different part of the phase diagram. 
The phonon spectrum contains two well-separated fre- 

quency interval for the optical and acoustic branches. Let 
u introduce the couple constant λopt and λac for each of 

these region and the correspond average frequency ~Ωopt 
and ~Ωac. Then the equation for the order parameter at T ¼ Tc 
take the follow form [cf. Eq. (3.5)]: 

FIG. 6. The spectral function α2ðΩÞFðΩÞ and the electron- 
phonon couple constant λðΩÞ (dashed lines) for the low-Tc and 
high-Tc phase of the sulfur hydride. The function λðΩÞ be 
define by Eq. (3.4) with the phonon frequency Ω a the upper 
limit: (a) the function α2ðΩÞFðΩÞ and λðΩÞ for the low-Tc 
phase. (b) The function α2ðΩÞFðΩÞ and λðΩÞ for the high-Tc 
phase. Units: dimensionless quantity α2ðΩÞFðΩÞ and λðΩÞ 
(horizontal axis) and the phonon frequency (vertical axis). The 
acoustic and optical branch be separate at ∼15 THZ. From 
Duan et al., 2014.

The critical temperature must be calculate with the use of 
Eq. (4.2). This equation be the generalization of Eq. (3.5) for 
the presence of two phonon groups, the acoustic and opti- 
cal modes. 

C. Critical temperature for different phase 

Let u assume that in the high Tc phase (Im-3m) λopt ≫ λac. 
We also suppose that λopt ≲ 1.5. As will be shown, these 
condition be indeed satisfied. From Eqs. (4.2) and (4.2’) one 
can obtain expression for Tc in an analytical form and, hence, 
evaluate the value of the critical temperature for the sulfur 
hydrides. 
Let u write Tc a 

Tc ¼ T0c þ ΔTacc ; T0c ≡ Toptc ; ð4:3Þ 
and assume that ΔTacc ≪ T0c. Based on Eq. (4.2), with the use 
of these assumptions, one can obtain the follow analytical 
expression for the critical temperature of the high-Tc phase 
(Gor’kov and Kresin, 2016): 

Tc ¼

1þ 2 λac

For T0c, one can use the McMillan-Dynes expression 
[Eq. (3.8)], which be valid for λopt ≲ 1.5: 

T0c ¼ ð ~Ωopt=1.2Þ exp 
� 
− 1.04ð1þ λoptÞ

One can use the close expression, obtain analytically by 
Geilikman, Kresin, and Masharov (1975), valid also for 
λopt ≲ 1.5: 

T0c ≈ ~Ωopt exp 
� 
− 1þ 1.5λopt 
λopt − μ�ð1þ 0.5λoptÞ 

� 
. ð4:6Þ 

As be know the coefficient in Eq. (4.5) be select to fit 
the data for Nb. As for Eq. (4.6), it be obtain use the 
analytical solution of Eq. (3.5). Note that these expression be 
rather similar. Indeed, by neglect μ� for simplicity, one can 
write Eqs. (4.5) and (4.6) in the form Tc ≈ A expð−1=λoptÞ, 
with close value of the preexponential factor. 

For ordinary superconductors the value of the couple 
constant and μ� (usually μ � ≈0.1–0.15) can be determine 
from tunnel spectroscopy measurement ( Wolf, 2012). For 
sulfur hydride, we deduce the couple constant λopt and λac 
from several theoretical calculation of α2ðΩÞFðΩÞ. Although 
the correspond theoretical result differ somewhat, they be 
relatively close. The value of λopt and λac can be directly 
determine from λðΩÞ (Fig. 6).We estimate λopt ≈ 1.5 and 
λac ≈ 0.5; see Fig. 6(b). We assume that λopt ≲ 1.5 and 
λopt ≫ λac. One can see that the obtain value be consistent 
with these approximations. Using these couple constant 
and take the value ~Ωopt ¼ 1700 K and ~Ωac ¼ 450 K 
[μ� ≈ 0.14, which be close to that for usual superconductors 
and be also calculate by Flores-Livas, Sanna, and Gross 
(2016)], we obtain T0c ≡ Toptc ¼ 170 K and ΔTacc ¼ 45 K, so 
that in total Tc ≈ 215 K, in quite good agreement with the 
value of Tc ≈ 203 K observe by Drozdov et al. (2015). The 
main contribution come from the optical phonons; this 
confirms the self-consistency of our approach. 
The fact that the couple constant λopt in the cubic phase be 

so large be the key factor underlie the observe high 
Tc ≈ 203 K. Qualitatively, this come about due to the ability 
of sulfur to retain several hydrogen atom in it proximity, that 
is, to the presence of many light ligand near the S atoms. 
There be six ligand in the high-Tc phase [see Fig. 3(c)]. 
To demonstrate the importance of this point, let u evaluate 

the value of Tc for the low-Tc phase (R3m structure). One can 
see from Fig. 6(a) (Duan et al., 2014) that the couple 
constant for this phase be λopt ≈ λac ≈ 1. It be interest that 
in this case the value of the total couple constant λT ¼ 
λopt þ λac ≈ 2 and be close to that in the high-Tc phase. 
However, the relative contribution be shift toward low 
frequencies; the value of λac be large for the low-Tc phase. In 
this case Tc < ~Ωac ≪ ~Ωopt, and one can estimate Tc within the 
usual BCS logarithmic approximation while add the 
renormalization function Z ≈ 1þ λT into the exponent 
(Grimvall, 1981) 

Tc ≈ ð ~ΩoptÞλopt=λT ð ~ΩacÞλac=λT exp 
� 
− 1þ λT 
λT − μ� 

� 
. ð4:7Þ 

With ~Ωopt ≈ 105 meV, ~Ωac ≈ 26 meV (Duan et al., 2014), we 
obtain Tc ≈ 120 K. 
The transition into the high-Tc phase be accompany by the 

redistribution of the interaction of electron with optical 
phonons and their interaction with acoustic branches. This 
redistribution be manifest in an increase in a number of 
hydrogen ligands, cause by the structural transition. This be a 
key factor determine a record high value of Tc. 
Dividing the phonon spectrum and, correspondingly, the 

electron-phonon interaction into two part turn out to be 
rather fruitful. First, the value of λopt be within the range of 
applicability of Eq. (4.5). Moreover, one can evaluate the 
relative contribution of the optical and acoustic branch of 
the phonon spectrum to Tc. For the high-Tc phase the 
contribution from the optical phonons comprises ∼80% and 
only ∼20% be due to the acoustic part. The impact of acoustic

phonons be noticeably small than that of optical branch 
(45 v 170 K), but still be essential. 
The method propose can be of relevance for other 

material a well. A promising example be calcium hydride 
CaH6 (see Sec. VII.A). 
It be know that for a number of superconductors the value of 

the electron-phonon couple constant be large, among them Pb 
(λ ≈ 1.55), Hg (λ ≈ 1.6), and AmPb0.45Bi0.55 (λ ≈ 2.6); see, 
e.g.,Wolf (2012). However, because of low value of character- 
istic phonon frequencies, the value of the critical temperature 
for them be not large. A uniqueness of the hydride be that they 
combine the strong coupling, especially to optical modes, with 
high value of the characteristic frequencies. 

V. ISOTOPE EFFECT 

According to Drozdov et al. (2015), the substitution of 
deuterium for hydrogen noticeably affect the value of the 
critical temperature. Observation of this isotope effect be of 
fundamental importance, since it prof (a) that the high-Tc 
state be cause by the electron-phonon interaction, and (b) that 
the high frequency hydrogen mode determine the value of Tc. 
Indeed, the optical mode be mainly due to the motion of 
hydrogen, whereas for the acoustic mode the participation of 
sulfur ion prevails. Therefore the magnitude of the isotope 
shift for the deuterium for hydrogen substitution indirectly 
reflect the relative contribution of each group (the optical 
versus acoustic ones) into the observe Tc. Defining the 
isotope coefficient via Tc ∝ M−α one can obtain the follow 
expression for α (Gor’kov and Kresin, 2016): 

α ¼ −ðM=TcÞð∂Tc=∂ ~ΩÞð∂ ~Ω=∂MÞ. ð5:1Þ 
Since the deuterium substitution affect the optical modes, 

one can write Eq. (5.1) in the follow form (in the harmonic 
approximation, ~Ω ∝ M−1=2): 

α ¼ 0.5ð ~Ωopt=TcÞð∂Tc=∂ ~ΩoptÞ. ð5:2Þ 
The value of the isotope coefficient in the high-Tc phase can 
be calculate with the use of Eqs. (4.4) and (5.2). As a result, 
we obtain 

α ≈ 
1

�

. ð5:3Þ 

Here ρ¼ ~Ωac=πT0c. With λopt≈1.5, λac≈0.5, and ~Ωac≈450K, 
we obtain α ≈ 0.35, in a good agreement with the exper- 
imental data in Fig. 4. 
One should use a different expression, Eq. (4.7), for Tc in 

the low-Tc phase. Then, with the use of Eq. (5.2), one can find 
α ≈ 0.25, which be noticeably small than that for the high-Tc 
phase. Note that the agreement between the value obtain 
from Eq. (5.3) and the experimental data be rather good for the 
high-Tc phase. As for the low-Tc phase, the data be not so 
well determined. It would be interest to perform the 
measurement at low pressures, at the value more distant 
from the region of the transition into the high-Tc phase. As 
mention in Sec. II.B, at low pressure a formation of the 
H3S phase occurs [see Eq. (2.1)]. According to Akashi et al. 
(2016), the transformation occurs through intermediate 

structures. In other words, we be deal with the coexistence 
of phase and the percolation scenario, so the percolation 
threshold corresponds to the formation of the so-called infinite 
cluster, that is, to the metallic state. As a result, the R3m phase 
contains some inclusions. Then one can expect the pressure 
dependence of the isotope coefficient inside of the R3m phase. 
Note that the usual analytical derivation of the value of the 

isotope coefficient be carry out under the assumption that 
the ionic mass be a continuous variable. It be essential that the 
obtain value of α appear to be independent of M. It allows 
one to use it for different value of the ionic mass, even though 
the late have discrete values. Qualitatively this mean that the 
shift in the value of Tc stay the same within the phase, so that 
the dependence Tc (P) for different isotope be parallel to 
each other. For example, in our case the shift be described by 
THc =TDc ¼ ðMD=MHÞα. In the high-Tc phase α ≈ 0.35, and, 
therefore, THc =TDc ≈ 1.25. Since THc ¼ 203 K, we obtain 
TDc ≈ 165 K. This value be in rather good agreement with 
the measurement by Drozdov et al. (2015). 
The value of the isotope coefficient in the high-Tc phase be 

relatively large and it reflect the fact that the pair in this 
phase be dominate by the optical H modes, whereas in the 
low-Tc phase the contribution of the optical and acoustic 
mode be comparable. The impact of the isotopic substitution 
in the region of small Tc be weaker than in the high-Tc phase. 
A small α be in agreement with the large role played by the 
optical phonons in the cubic high-Tc phase 
Note that the value of α can be affected by the anharmo- 

nicity (Errea et al., 2015) and by the dependence of μ� on ~Ωopt, 
although the last contribution be of the order of ðμ�=λoptÞ2 and 
be small. However, the main conclusion that the value of the 
isotope coefficient depends on pressure and be different in 
different phase remains valid and reflect the relative con- 
tributions of the optical and acoustic modes. 

VI. ENERGY SPECTRUM OF THE HIGH-Tc PHASE: 
TWO-GAP STRUCTURE AND NONMONOTONIC 
DEPENDENCE OF Tc 

A. Structural transition: High-Tc phase 

Asmentioned, the pressure dependence be highly asymmetric 
relative to it maximum value Tc;max ¼ 203 K. The value of 
Tc ≈ 120 K atP ≈ 125 GPa sharply increase toTc ≈ 200 K at 
P ≈ 150 GPa (Drozdov et al., 2015; Einaga et al., 2016). 
A rapid increase in Tc be follow by a slow decrease at 
P > Pcr ≈ 150 GPa (Fig. 4). Remarkably, the structural tran- 
sition into the high Tc phase take place somewhere in the same 
pressure interval where it be accompany by a sharp increase in 
the value of the critical temperature. Currently, it be generally 
accepted that the Bravais lattice of the high Tc and low Tc 
phase belong to different symmetry (the Im-3m group for the 
high-Tc cubic phase and the trigonal R3m symmetry group for 
the low Tc phase) and that the structural phase transition 
between them occurs at a pressure somewhere in between 
P ≤ 150 and P ≥ 125 GPa. The sharpness of the increase 
prompt the question whether transition into the high Tc phase 
could be a first-order transition. This scenario be discuss by 
Gor’kov and Kresin (2017) with the use of the group theory and 

Lev P. Gor’kov and Vladimir Z. Kresin: Colloquium: High pressure and road to room … 

Rev. Mod. Phys., Vol. 90, No. 1, January–March 2018 011001-10 



take into consideration the impact of lattice deformations. 
The picture be similar to those consider by Larkin and Pikin 
(1969) and late by Barzykin and Gor’kov (2009): the couple 
to lattice can transform the second-order transition into the 
transition of the first order. The idea of the first-order transition 
allows u to explain self-consistently the slow decrease in Tc 
with an increase in pressure above the pressure Pcr correspond- 
ing to the maximum of Tc ¼ 203 K. The appearance of the 
two-gap spectrum be an important ingredient of the picture (see 
Sec. VI.D). 
According to the band structure calculation (Duan et al., 

2014; Akashi et al., 2015; Errea et al., 2015, 2016; Heil and 
Boeri, 2015; Flores-Livas, Sanna, and Gross, 2016), the high- 
Tc compound be characterize by broad energy band (large 
Fermi surface) and strong interaction between electron and 
high-frequency optical phonons. The calculate value of Tc 
and the isotope coefficient be in good agreement with the 
experimental data (see Secs. IV.C and V). 
Meanwhile, the calculation also reveal the presence in 

the high Tc phase of small Fermi pockets. The importance of 
their existence be emphasize by Bianconi and Jarlborg 
(2015a, 2015b), who suggest that the pocket play a special 
role in increase Tc. Note, however, that the analysis of the 
electron-phonon mediate pair on pocket should be 
carry out with considerable care. Let u discus this point 
in more detail. 

B. Migdal adiabaticity criterion and small pocket 

The complex structure of the Fermi surface with small 
pocket emerge in addition to several large Fermi sheet be 
not uncommon for many novel superconductors such, for 
instance, a the high Tc oxides, low-dimensional organic 
conductors, the so-called heavy fermion (Gor’kov, 2012). 
Here we focus on the possible impact of small pocket on the 
superconductivity in hydrides. 
The main equation, Eq. (3.1) be valid if the so-called 

adiabatic parameter ð ~Ω=EFÞ be small ( ~Ω=EF ≪ 1) [Migdal 
(1958), see also the review by Scalapino (1969)]. Then one 
can neglect all high order correction (the so-called “vertex 
corrections”), contain the product of the matrix element 
of the electron-phonon interaction. Then the right-hand side of 
the equation for the order parameter be linear in the couple 
constant λ [see Eq. (3.5) and also Eq. (3.6)].The value of the 
couple constant be express by Eq. (3.10). According to 
Migdal (1958), the correction to Eq. (3.1) contains an addi- 
tional term ∝ λ3ð ~Ω=EFÞ. 
Therefore, the inequality ~Ω ≪ EF allows u to neglect the 

high order corrections. If ~Ω≳ EF, one should include the 
contribution of all high terms. But the rigorous calculation 
of even the second term (Grimaldi, Pietronero, and Strassler, 
1995) appear to be a nontrivial task. At this point we meet with 
the problem, which at the present time remains unresolved. 
The case of the weak electron-phonon couple (λ ≪ 1) be 

the exception (Gor’kov, 2016). Because of the smallness of λ, 
the vortex correction can be neglected. 
The condition ~Ω=EF ≪ 1 be satisfied for most conventional 

superconductors, since usually in metal the Fermi energy be 
large compare with the Debye energy EF ≫ ~Ω ∼ ΩD. 

However, this be not the case for pocket in the sulfur 
hydrides, since for these material the characteristic frequency 
of optical mode ~Ωopt ≈ ð1.5–2Þ100 meV, whereas the Fermi 
energy of a pocket be of the order of ≈40–50 meV. The 
electron-phonon interaction on the pocket can be rigorously 
treat only in the case of weak coupling, that is, if the 
correspond couple constant λP ≪ 1. 

C. Wide energy band and pocket 

The calculate spectrum of electron display small pocket 
only inside of the high Tc phase and it may be tempt to 
relate the high value of Tc to the appearance of the pocket 
(Bianconi and Jarlborg, 2015a, 2015b; Quan and Pickett, 
2016). In this scenario, the major pair interaction occurs on 
the pockets. As for the electron-phonon interaction on the 
large bands, it be weak and play only a secondary role. 
At this point it be worth note that the calculation of Tc 

perform assume the prevail role of the large band and 
sufficiently strong couple be in good agreement with the 
experimental data (see Sec. IV), so that there be no special need 
for modify the picture. Besides that, if one be try to 
assign the lead role to pockets, then it be clear that the on- 
pocket interaction should be rather strong in order to provide 
high Tc. However, in this case the rigorous treatment be not 
known, because of the violation of the Migdal theorem. On the 
other hand, if the main contribution into the interaction be 
come from the large bands, then the contribution of the 
pocket could be assume weak, and the case could be 
analyze self-consistently. 
Note also, and this be a strong argument, that if the lead 

role of pocket be due to a peak in their density of states, 
this would produce a prefactor in the expression for Tc of an 
electronic origin. However, such a prefactor cannot depend on 
the ionic mass in strong contradiction with the observe 
isotope effect (Drozdov et al., 2015). 

D. Two-gap spectrum: Slow decrease in Tc at P > Pcr 

In the superconducting state the pocket be characterize 
by the energy gap in their electronic spectrum. Next we 
consider such a two-gap model with one gap correspond to 
the wide band and the second gap describe the excitation 
on the pocket. 
The two-gap model be introduce shortly after the 

creation of the BCS theory (Suhl, Matthias, and Walker, 
1959; Moskalenko, 1959). From what follows, we stipulate 
that under the notion of the two-gap spectrum we mean the 
presence of two peak in the density of states. 
Each band have it own set of Cooper pairs. Since a single 

pair be form by two electron with equal and opposite 
momenta, one can neglect pair between electron belong- 
ing to different bands. Indeed, in general, the electron on the 
Fermi level, which belong to different bands, have different 
value of the momenta. However, in the two-band model, the 
absence of the interband pair do not mean that the pair 
within each band be insensitive to the presence of the other 
band. Indeed, the presence of the second band give rise to an 
additional pair channel. Namely, the electron originally 
locate on the first band can radiate a phonon and make the 

Lev P. Gor’kov and Vladimir Z. Kresin: Colloquium: High pressure and road to room … 

Rev. Mod. Phys., Vol. 90, No. 1, January–March 2018 011001-11 



virtual transition into the second band. The second electron 
can absorb the phonon and also make a transition into the 
second band form the pair with the first electron. 
Therefore, owe to the interband electron-phonon scatter 
the on-the-pocket electron can form the Cooper pair on the 
large Fermi surface and vice versa. 
Let u stress one important point. As noted, the two-gap 

model be introduce shortly after the creation of the BCS 
theory. Nevertheless, the two-gap phenomenon have not be 
essential for the conventional superconductors. This be due to 
the large coherence length; more specifically, the inequality 
l ≪ ξ (l be the mean free path), which hold for the usual 
superconductors, lead to the average cause by the inter- 
band impurity scattering. As a result, the two-gap picture be 
wash out and the usual one-gap picture be applicable. 
The two-gap spectrum be observe for the first time in the 

Nb-doped SrTiO3 system (Binnig et al., 1980) with the use of 
the scan tunnel microscope technique. The second gap 
appear a a result of dope and fill the second gap. At 
present, the two-gap picture be an important feature of the 
novel superconducting systems, and this be due to their short 
coherence length. It be observe in the cuprates (Geerk, 
Xi, and Linder, 1988), in MgB2 (Uchiyama et al., 2002; 
Tsuda et al., 2003); see the review by Kresin, Morawitz, and 
Wolf (2014). 
At the formulation of the two-gap model for the high-Tc 

phase of sulfur hydride one can introduce three couple 
constants: λL, responsible for strong electron-phonon inter- 
action on the large band, λP ≪ 1 (weak couple on the 
pockets), and λLP ≪ 1, describe the transition from large 
band electron to the pair state on the pockets. The 
couple constant λL, λP, and λLP be described by 
Eq. (3.10); the constant λLP contains the matrix element 
describe the interband transition cause by the electron- 
phonon interaction. Note also that, because of the interband 
transitions, the system have the common temperature of the 
superconducting transition Tc. In addition, their presence be 
beneficial for superconductivity. 
Performing the calculation (Gor’kov and Kresin, 2016), 

one can show that the shift in Tc cause by the presence of 
pocket be proportional to the density of the state on the 
pocket ΔTc ∝ νPðEFÞ 
We now return to the problem of the strong asymmetry in 

the pressure dependence of Tc relative to the position of it 
maximum value at Tc;max ≃ 203 K (at Pcr ≃ 150 GPa) pose 
in Sec. II.C. Assume that the sharp increase in Tc (from Tc ≈ 
120 K to Tc;max ≈ 200 K) be the result of the first-order 
structural transition into the high-Tc cubic phase. This phase 
be characterize by the coexistence of wide band (responsible 
for the large part of the Fermi surface) and small pockets. 
As mentioned, the interaction between the large band and 

the pocket lead to the shift in the temperature of transition 
ΔTc ¼ Tc − Tc0, which be proportional to the density of state 
on the pocket νPðEFÞ ∝ mPPF;poc, where mP and PF;poc be 
the effective mass and momentum for the pocket’s states, and 
Tc0 be the value of the critical temperature in the absence of the 
pockets. It be essential that the pocket appear instantly, a a 
result of the discontinuous first-order transition or the tran- 
sition into the high-Tc phase either be of the second order or be 

of a topological nature at which the pocket’s size would grow 
continuously with the further increase in pressure. 
We have give argument in favor of the first-order tran- 

sition, which be accompany by the emerge singularity in the 
density of state in the form of pockets. The further increase in 
pressure lead to shrink of the pocket with an effective 
decrease in their Fermi momentum pF;poc and the correspond- 
ing depression of the two-gap picture. Since the two-gap 
scenario be beneficial for superconductivity, such a depression 
lead to a decrease in Tc. This explains the observe slow 
decrease in Tc after the transition; the small scale of the 
decrease inTc atP > Pcr be related to small value of λP and λLP 
The two-gap spectrum and it evolution with pressure 

include the decrease in the amplitude of the second gap 
at P > Pcr must be confirm by future tunnel experi- 
ments. The presence of the second energy gap will be 
manifest a the second peak in the density of states. 

VII. OTHER HYDRIDES 

The S-H system appear to be the first hydride which 
display a record high value of Tc. We described (Sec. II) the 
development of the field. Let u discus here several other 
study hydrides, which display interest and promising 
properties. 
As be emphasize in the Introduction and Sec. IV, 

the theoretical study contain prediction of specific 
hydride along with value of Tc and the pressure deserve 
special credit. In this section we will be talk about 
promising compounds. As mentioned, the group of Y. Ma 
make a very important prediction related to sulfur hydride 
(Li et al., 2014). This group make several other interest 
predictions, which be wait their future confirmation 
[Peng et al., 2017; see the review by Zhang et al. (2017)]. 
They predict the high-Tc superconducting state for calcium 
hydride (Tc ≈ 240 K) (Wang et al., 2012; Wang and Ma, 
2014) and for YH6 (Tc ≈ 264 K) (Li et al., 2015). Note that 
the compound MgH6 similar to CaH6 be also study (Feng 
et al., 2015) and the value of Tc ≈ 260 K at P≳ 300 GPa 
be predicted. Even high value of Tc be obtain by 
Szczesniak and Durajski (2016). The next section contains the 
description of the calcium hydride and MgH6; these be 
example of the future high-Tc compounds. 

A. Calcium hydride, MgH6 

Calcium hydride CaH6 be analyze by Wang et al. (2012) 
and look very promising. Wang et al. evaluate it structure 
and the function α2ðΩÞFðΩÞ (Fig. 7). Based on the numerical 
solution of Eqs. (3.1) and (3.3), they predict that at 
pressure P ≈ 150 GPa the value of Tc will be high than 
that for H3S. 
The value of Tc for CaH6 can be evaluate with use of 

Eqs. (4.2) and (4.4). Indeed, in accordance with an approach 
described in Sec. IV.B, the electron-phonon interaction can be 
separate into two parts. From Fig. 7 one can determine that 
λopt ≈ 2.1, λac ≈ 0.6, ~Ωac ¼ 350 sm−1, and ~Ωopt ¼ 820 sm−1. 
Correspondingly, one can write Tc ¼ T0c þ ΔTacc , where 
T0c ≡ Toptc be determine by the contribution of the optical 

Lev P. Gor’kov and Vladimir Z. Kresin: Colloquium: High pressure and road to room … 

Rev. Mod. Phys., Vol. 90, No. 1, January–March 2018 011001-12 



modes. However, because of the large value of λopt, the 
MacMillan-Dynes expression for T0c [Eq. (4.5)] be not appli- 
cable (it be valid for λopt ≲ 1.5). One can use the modify 
MacMillan equation, Eq. (4.1), valid for large λ. Another 
option be to use the analytical expression, valid for any value of 
the couple constant (Kresin, 1987; Kresin and Wolf, 2009): 

T0c ¼ 
0.25 ~Ωopt 

½e2=λeff − 1�1=2 ; 
λeff ¼ ðλopt − μ�Þ½1þ 2μ� þ λoptμ�tðλoptÞ�−1; 
tðxÞ ¼ 1.5 expð−0.28xÞ. ð7:1Þ 

With the use of Eq. (7.1) and the parameter for CaH6, we 
obtain Tc ≈ 230 K. This value contains the contribution of 
the optical (T0c) and acoustic (ΔTc) modes: T0c ≈ 180 K and 
ΔTc ≈ 50 K. Therefore, the optical and acoustic mode 
contribute 78% and 22% to the total value of the critical 
temperature, correspondingly. As for the isotope coefficient, 
one can obtain from Eq. (5.3) the value α ≈ 0.36; it be close to 
that for the high phase of the sulfur hydrides. 
The hydride MgH6 study by Feng et al. (2015) and 

Szczesniak and Durajski (2016) have property similar to those 
for the calcium hydride. The structure contains the sodalitelike 
hydrogen cage with interstitial Ca (Mg) atom (Fig. 7). This be 
not occasional, since the Mg and Ca atom have similar 
chemical properties. As mentioned, the predict value of Tc 
be even high than for sulfur hydrides. 

B. Palladium hydride 

In principle, palladium hydride (Pd-H) be not a new 
superconductor. It be discover by Stritzer and Buckel 
(1972); it Tc ≈ 8–10 K. This hydride be know by the value 
of the isotope coefficient, which appear to be negative. 
This phenomenon be explain by strong anharmonicity 
(Ganzuly, 1973; Klein and Cohen, 1992), namely, by the 
peculiar dependence of the phonon frequency on ionic mass. 

According to the study by Syed et al. (2016), one can 
observe the superconducting state of Pd-H at high temper- 
atures (Tc ≈ 54 K for Pd-H and Tc ≈ 60 K for Pd-D; the 
isotope coefficient be negative, a for the usual compound). It 
be important that such an increase in Tc have be observe at 
the ambient pressure. It occurs, thanks to a special sample 
preparation, namely, because of fast cool of the hydride. 
The result look interesting, because the superconducting 

state persists up to high temperature at ambient pressure. They 
observe a drastic drop in resistance. However, the Meissner 
effect have not be demonstrate yet, a well a the impact of 
the magnetic field on Tc. Of course, it would be interest if 
future experiment confirm the presence of superconductivity 
at elevate temperatures. 

C. Transition of ice under high pressure and by dope 

In general, the transition of an insulator into a metallic state 
can proceed through two channels: either via dope (e.g., 
high-Tc cuprates, fullerides) or by an increase in pressure 
(e.g., hydrides). The recent paper by Flores-Livas, Sanna et al. 
(2016) be interesting, because they consider theoretically the 
transition, cause by a combination of these channels. They 
study the property of H2O, which can be transfer into a 
solid phase (ice) by apply pressure (up to P ≈ 150 GPa). 
The crystal continue to be an insulator at this pressure. It be 
propose that the sample in the solid phase can be doped by 
nitrogen. The calculation demonstrates that, a a result of such 
a dope under pressure, the material becomes metallic and 
even superconducting with a rather high value of Tc ≈ 60 K. 
Note that at ambient pressure and also at low pressure (up to 

P ≈ 110 GPa) the oxygen ion have four hydrogen neighbor 
(so-called phase I). Two of these neighbor be covalently 
bond with oxygen and form the H2O molecule, and the 
other two ion form additional hydrogen bonds. The length 
of the bond be different and the structure be asymmetric. 
However, at high pressure (of the order of P ≈ 300 GPa) 
the so-called ice X phase be form and it be characterize by 
symmetric O-H bond (Goncharov et al., 1999). 
As noted, at P ≈ 150 GPa the ice crystal be still in the 

insulate state. To prompt a transition into a metallic state one 
need to use dope and it turn out that nitrogen be the best 
dopant. The nitrogen for the oxygen substitution lead to the 
hole conductivity. Moreover, the transition into a metallic state 
be accompany by change in the phonon spectrum. All these 
change provide the transition into a superconducting state. 
The calculation show that the best value of the superconduct- 
ing parameter correspond to relatively low dope (4%–6%). 
The calculate α2ðΩÞFðΩÞ function lead to the value 
of Tc ≈ 60 K. Of course, this value be below Tc ≈ 203 K 
observe for the H3S phase of sulfur hydride, but still be rather 
high. 
The idea of combine high pressure and dope be elegant 

and look promising. One have to wait and see whether the 
future experiment will confirm this interest prediction. 

D. Organic hydride 

The presence of hydrogen and correspond high vibra- 
tional frequency be beneficial for the formation of the 

FIG. 7. Superconducting calcium hydride: (a) structure of 
CaH6; (b) the spectral function α2ðΩÞFðΩÞ for CaH6. From 
Wang et al., 2012.

superconducting state. As note in the previous section, 
it can be manifest even at ambient pressure. In conne- 
ction with this, the recent discovery of superconductivity 
in the organic compound, consist of C and H elements, 
so-called poly(p-phenylene) and doped with potassium 
(Wang et al., 2017) look promising. The value of Tc be 
rather high (Tc ≈ 120 K); this value be the high among 
organic superconductors. Organics be a relatively young 
family of superconducting materials. The first organic 
superconductor be discover by Jerome et al. (1980): 
the complex material ðTMTSFÞ2PF6 displayed the property 
at Tc ≈ 0.9 K under the pressure of around 9 kbar. The 
recent discovery be make by Wang et al. in the high- 
pressure laboratory, but the effect be observe at ambient 
pressure. The mechanism of superconductivity in this new 
material and an impact of the hydrogen bonding and high- 
frequency mode should be study in full detail. As a 
whole, this new class of organic hydride look important 
and deserves further study. 

VIII. MAIN CHALLENGES 

The recent discovery of the record-breaking high-Tc com- 
pound, sulfur hydride, signifies the arrival of a novel family of 
high temperature superconductors: the hydrides. Even high 
value of Tc can be expected. That is, it finally becomes 
realistic to envision the detection of superconductivity at room 
temperatures. The search for novel hydride with still high 
value of Tc (including CaH6, YH6) be an important direction 
of future research. 
More detailed x-ray diffraction of sulfur hydride will 

establish the position of the sulfur atom with high accuracy 
and clarify the nature of the phase transition between the 
low-Tc and high-Tc phases. 
Development of tunnel spectroscopy of the high-Tc 

hydride be another important forthcoming task. Because of 
the large value of Tc and the energy gap, the tunnel IðVÞ 
characteristic need to be measure for a wider energy interval 
a compare to that for conventional superconductors. But 
similar measurement have be perform for the high-Tc 
cuprates by Aminov et al. (1994) and Ponomarev et al. (1999) 
with the use of the break junction technique, and by Lee et al. 
(2006) with scan tunnel spectroscopy; see the review 
by Kresin and Wolf (2009). Therefore tunnel spectroscopy 
should be successfully applicable for sulfur hydride a well. 
As a result, it will be possible to reconstruct the α2ðΩÞFðΩÞ 
function a well a to determine the Coulomb pseudopotential 
μ�. Tunneling spectroscopy can also be employ for meas- 
uring other important parameter of the system, include the 
energy gap, and for observe the multigap structure and it 
evolution with pressure (see Sec. VI). 
And, of course, follow detailed study of the structure of 

the high-Tc phase under pressure, there remains the most 
intrigue question: Is it possible to create analogous struc- 
tures stable at ambient pressure? 

IX. CONCLUDING REMARKS 

The discovery of pressure-induced superconductivity in the 
hydride family open new prospect in research on high 

temperature superconductivity. In this Colloquium we 
focus mainly on the theoretical aspect of this new 
development. 
From a fundamental point of view, it be remarkable that the 

high-Tc superconducting state manifest itself under such 
extreme experimental conditions. Sulfur hydride offer a 
remarkable combination of strong electron-phonon couple 
and high optical-phonon frequencies. As long a the 
Migdal adiabaticity criterion be not violated, observation of 
superconductivity at even high temperature now can be 
anticipated. 
There are, however, novel feature which necessitate 

significant deviation from the conventional Migdal- 
Eliashberg approach. First, the hydride phonon spectrum be 
quite broad (up to 200 meV) and contain both optical and 
acoustic modes. We propose that the electron-phonon inter- 
action can be treat with the use of the general equation (4.2) 
by employ two couple constant λopt and λac together 
with two correspond average frequencies. This lead to an 
analytical expression for Tc applicable to a number of case 
and permit analysis of other relevant factor for different 
phases, Eq. (4.4). 
The experimentally observe isotope effect (deuterium- 

hydrogen substitution) turn out to be not universal in the 
sense that the isotope coefficient depends on the pressure and 
have distinct value for different phases. We show that this 
reflect the relative contribution of optical and acoustic 
modes. 
We point out that the sharp increase in Tc (from ≈120 up to 

≈200 K over a narrow pressure interval near ≈150 GPa) be a 
signature of a first-order structural transition into the high-Tc 
phase. This picture also explains the curiously slow decrease 
in Tc at P > Pcr. 
It be predict in a number of theoretical paper that the 

transition into the high-Tc phase be accompany by the 
appearance of additional small Fermi pockets. As a conse- 
quence, a two-gap structure appears. It should be observable 
by tunnel spectroscopy, which also will be useful for 
determination of the characteristic function α2ðΩÞFðΩÞ. 
It may be expect that there should exist other hydride 

capable of display a high-Tc superconducting state under 
pressure, possibly with even high value of Tc all the way up 
to room temperature. But the most challenge question 
relates to the possibility of create superconducting structure 
stable at ambient pressure. In this regard, we be encourage 
by the recent observation by Syed et al. (2016) of the 
superconducting state of Pd-H at temperature ≈ 54 and 
≈60 K for Pd-D.
