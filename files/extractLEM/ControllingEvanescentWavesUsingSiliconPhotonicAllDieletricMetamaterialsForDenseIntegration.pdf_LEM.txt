Ultra-compact, densely integrate optical component manufacture on a CMOS-foundry 

platform be highly desirable for optical information processing and electronic-photonic co- 

integration. However, the large spatial extent of evanescent wave arise from nanoscale 

confinement, ubiquitous in silicon photonic devices, cause significant cross-talk and scat- 

tering loss. Here, we demonstrate that anisotropic all-dielectric metamaterials open a new 

degree of freedom in total internal reflection to shorten the decay length of evanescent 

waves. We experimentally show the reduction of cross-talk by great than 30 time and the 

bending loss by great than 3 time in densely integrated, ultra-compact photonic circuit 

blocks. Our prototype all-dielectric metamaterial-waveguide achieves a low propagation loss 

of approximately 3.7±1.0 dB/cm, comparable to those of silicon strip waveguides. Our 

approach mark a departure from interference-based confinement a in photonic crystal or 

slot waveguides, which utilize nanoscale field enhancement. Its ability to suppress evanescent 

wave without substantially increase the propagation loss shall pave the way for all- 

dielectric metamaterial-based dense integration.

One of the long-standing goal of nanophotonics be theintegration of electronic and photonic circuitry on asingle CMOS chip for application range from infor- 
mation processing and data center to massively parallel sen- 
sing1–11. This necessarily require miniaturization with low power 
consumption in optical interconnects, active a well a passive 
photonic devices. There be two major figure of merit in 
design photonic device for a densely integrate circuit. One be 
the cross-talk, which occurs due to the field overlap of two 
adjacent photonic waveguides, and the second be the radiation 
loss at sharp bend which limit the integration density6. 

Plasmonic waveguide can strongly reduce cross-talk and 
bending loss owe to the sub-diffraction nature of light couple 
to the free electron of metals12–19. However, the large ohmic loss 
of metal restricts the application of plasmonic structure for 
photonic integration20,21. Over the last decade, many effort have 
be make to miniaturize photonic component use all- 
dielectric structures22–36. Figure 1 illustrates a few class of 
dielectric waveguide for light confinement in photonic chips. 
Strip waveguides, the most common type of waveguide for 
rout light in a silicon chip, be compose of a silicon channel 
surround by silicon oxide6 (Fig. 1a). Owing to the high contrast 
between the refractive index of the core and the cladding, light be 
confine inside the core a a result of total internal reflection 
(TIR). However, the mode size be see to increase a we reduce 
the core size which hamper the use of strip waveguide to further 
miniaturize photonic circuits37. Photonic crystal waveguide can 
confine light inside a line defect due to Bragg reflection40 

(Fig. 1b). These waveguide perform efficiently at very sharp 
bends41, however, the integration density be limited a the peri- 
odicity of Bragg reflector be on the order of the wavelength and it 
cannot be perturbed by another waveguide nearby42. Addition- 
ally, slot waveguide have be propose to confine light inside a 
sub-wavelength low-index gap surround by high-index 

dielectric rods43 (Fig. 1c). To satisfy the continuity of the normal 
component of the displacement current at the high-contrast 
interface, the electric field peak inside the gap, lead to light 
confinement but at the cost of skin-depth expansion in the 
cladding. This cause cross-talk between adjacent waveguide and 
radiation loss at sharp bend in dense photonic-integrated 
circuits. 

Several alternative approach inspire from atomic phy- 
sics44,45, transformation optics46, and inverse design algo- 
rithms47,48 have also be propose to minimize the cross-talk 
and the bending loss. However, these technique add design 
complexity and often require modification of the core a well a 
cladding46. They be not implementable on a large-scale and 
cause propagation loss fundamentally limit device perfor- 
mance. Thus, a new low-loss and scalable platform be need for 
CMOS-foundry compatible dense photonic integration with low 
cross-talk and reduce bending loss. 

In this paper, we demonstrate a platform that be fundamentally 
different from the exist approach for design CMOS 
compatible, ultra-compact, and low-loss waveguide use all- 
dielectric anisotropic metamaterials. Our approach work base 
on photonic skin-depth engineering of evanescent wave in the 
cladding use a recently propose degree of freedom in TIR37,49. 
To describe the light confinement mechanism in our waveguides, 
first, we experimentally demonstrate the phenomenon of relaxed 
TIR in anisotropic metamaterials. These relaxed condition allow 
the control of evanescent wave decay, which be the fundamental 
origin of cross-talk and bending loss in silicon photonic devices. 
As illustrate in Fig. 1d, we use these anisotropic metamaterials a 
a cladding for on-chip dielectric waveguide fabricate on a 
monolithic silicon-on-insulator (SOI) platform. As a result, cross- 
talk be reduce down to −30 dB in the photonic circuit. Fur- 
thermore, we use a transformation optic approach to show that 
the radiation loss at sharp bend be strongly influence by the 
skin-depth in the cladding. We experimentally show that the 
anisotropic metamaterial cladding can simultaneously reduce the 
bending loss at sharp bend up to three time compare with 
conventional silicon strip waveguides. We clarify the counter- 
intuitive nature of light confinement in our approach compare 
with exist photonic crystal, slot waveguide, and grade index 
waveguide methods38,43,50–53. Our work show that all-dielectric 
anisotropy on-chip present a scalable route to simultaneously 
improve cross-talk and bending loss with propagation loss a low 
a ≈3.67 dB/cm. For completeness, we show the improvement in 
figure of merit of our achieve platform with recent state-of-the- 
art photonic design (see Table 1). 

Results 
Relaxed TIR. We demonstrate that only a single component of 
the dielectric tensor governs TIR in anisotropic medium opening a 
new degree of freedom to control evanescent waves. In

conventional TIR, if n1>n2 (n1 and n2 be the refractive index of 
the medium 1 and medium 2, respectively) and the incident angle 
be great than the critical angle (θc ¼ sin�1 n2=n1ð Þ), light be 
reflect back to the first medium and decay evanescently in the 
second medium. However, we have recently found that the TIR

dielectric be relaxed to37,54:

We emphasize that these relaxed condition for p polarize 
incident light allow u to arbitrarily increase or decrease the 
permittivity in the z direction, whereas still preserve TIR. This 

hitherto un-utilized degree of freedom can thus be use to control 
the skin-depth of evanescent waves. If ε2z � 1, evanescent wave 
decay faster than in vacuum allow for strong light confinement 
inside dielectric waveguides37,49. In this limit, note that the 
average index in anisotropic medium 2 can be large than the 
refractive index in isotropic medium 1 yet the light will be totally 
reflect above the critical angle. 

We implement this anisotropy use Si/SiO2 multilayers with 
subwavelength thickness (Fig. 2a) at the telecommunication 
wavelength (λ= 1550 nm). Figure 2 highlight the contrast 
between relaxed TIR and conventional TIR, show the 
measure light reflection at the interface of a hemi-cylindrical 
Si prism and the anisotropic multilayer metamaterial. The 
periodicity of the multilayer be Λ= 100 nm and five period 
have be deposit on the prism. The Maxwell–Garnett effective 
medium theory (EMT)55 predicts that the multilayer with 
subwavelength periodicity demonstrates strong anisotropy37,56– 
59 at the operating wavelength (ε2y ¼ ε2z ¼ εSiρþ εSiO2ð1� ρÞ 
and 1=ε2x ¼ ρ=εSi þ ð1� ρÞ=εSiO2 where ρ be the fill fraction of 
silicon). Note we be in the effective medium metamaterial limit 
Λ � λð Þ away from the photonic crystal regime Λ � λð Þ. 
Reflection occurs on two interfaces, the primary silicon- 
metamaterial interface and the secondary metamaterial-air inter- 
face. We have deposit a thin tungsten layer on top of the

Fig. 2 Relaxed total internal reflection. a Schematic of the relaxed TIR experiment. We measure the reflection from the Si prism and Si/SiO2 multilayer 
interface for both s and p polarization at λ=1550 nm. Multiple sample with different ρ have be fabricated. The periodicity for all sample be 100 nm and 
the total thickness of the multilayer be 500 nm. A 200 nm layer of tungsten be deposit on top of the multilayer (brown) to suppress the reflection from 
the air interface. b The measure critical angle for s and p polarization vs. the silicon fill fraction in comparison with effective medium theory (EMT)

difference between the critical angle be see for different polarization in agreement with relaxed TIR theory. c Retrieved effective permittivity of the 
multilayer from the critical angle measurement show strong anisotropy in agreement with EMT. The refractive index of Si and SiO2 be take to be 3.4 and 
1.47, respectively, for the theoretical calculations. The inset show the SEM image of an Si/SiO2 multilayer with ρ= 0.5. d Normalized calculate magnetic

cladding strongly affect the decay of the evanescent wave in the cladding. The practical multilayer structure performs close to an ideal anisotropic case 
(ε2x ¼ εSiO2 and ε2z ¼ εSi)

multilayer metamaterial to attenuate the unwanted reflection 
from the secondary metamaterial/air interface. Figure 2b display 
different measure critical angle for s and p polarizations. 
Various sample with different fill fraction have be fabricated. 
As ρ deviate from 0 and 1, the multilayer display effective 
anisotropy and the critical angle for s and p polarize incidence 
be separate in agreement with relaxed TIR theory in Eq. (2). 
The effective permittivity of the multilayer structure (extracted 
from the critical angle) show strong anisotropy and be in good 
agreement with EMT (Fig. 2c). It be clearly see that the critical 
angle depends on only one component of the permittivity tensor 
for each polarization irrespective of the fill fraction. With the 
extra degree of freedom afford by the other component of the 
dielectric tensor, this anisotropic structure can be use a a 
cladding for conventional dielectric waveguide to control the 
evanescent wave and skin-depth in the cladding37,60. Figure 2d 
display the effect of the multilayer anisotropic cladding on 
reduce of the evanescent wave skin-depth a compare to a 
conventional slab waveguide. Note that this evanescent wave 
engineering approach in extreme skin-depth (e-skid) waveguide 
be owe to the fast variation of the evanescent field in a 

subwavelength high-index-contrast superlattice (Fig. 2d). This be 
fundamentally different from other light confinement strategy 
which function on interference of propagate wave (photonic 
crystals) or field enhancement in a slot38,43,51–53. 

On-chip e-skid waveguides. To impact the field of silicon pho- 
tonics, the one-dimensional e-skid waveguide (Fig. 2d) have to be 
implement on an SOI platform. This place stringent restric- 
tions on monolithic fabrication, minimum feature sizes, and 
deviation in field profile due to quasi-2D behavior. Our design 
to adapt relaxed TIR and skin-depth engineering δ � λð Þ on- 
chip be show in Fig. 3. Here the conventional quasi-2D strip 
waveguide be surround by a cladding make of alternate 
vacuum-silicon sub-wavelength ridge which achieves strong 
anisotropy (ε2x<εcore and ε2z � 1). Our goal be to confine the TE- 
like mode (its dominant electric field component be Ex) use in 
conventional silicon strip waveguides. Since the TM-like mode be 
polarize in the y direction, the electric field do not probe/feel 
the anisotropy of the cladding. Hence, the metamaterial cladding 
do not play any role in TM mode confinement. For more detail 
about the polarization effect, see Supplementary Figures 6 and 7.

Figure 3a emphasizes the counterintuitive nature of the 
confinement cause by anisotropic medium which beat the 
confinement of conventional high index-contrast interface 
consist of silicon surround by vacuum (blue curve in 
Fig. 3a). As it be see in Fig. 3a, if we increase the index of the 
cladding only in the z direction, whereas the index in the other 
direction be fixed, the evanescent wave decay faster in the 
cladding and the skin-depth reduces drastically. Note, the average 
cladding index increase but the mode decay length decreases. 
This behavior be in fundamental contrast to confinement in 
conventional strip waveguide with isotropic cladding or grade 
index claddings53 where decrease the contrast between the core 
index and cladding index result in slow decay of evanescent 
waves, not faster decay49. 

Figure 3b show the field profile of a practical e-skid waveguide 
with the multilayer metamaterial cladding Λ � λð Þ. We can see 
the practical multilayer cladding show strong effective aniso- 
tropy to ensure the fast decay of the evanescent wave in the 
cladding. The 2D field profile in a plane perpendicular to the 
propagation direction and comparison of the practical e-skid 
waveguide with a homogeneous anisotropic cladding be show 
in Figs. 3c and 3d. A good agreement with the effective medium 
approximation be seen. Figures 3e-h illustrate the effective modal 
index and the decay constant in the cladding for a wide range of 
core size and the fill fraction of silicon in the multilayer 
cladding. First, a strong agreement be see between EMT and 
practical multilayer structures, indicate that the cladding indeed 
achieves effective all-dielectric anisotropy. Second, the effective 
modal index be below the core index indicative of relaxed TIR a 
the mechanism of confinement. As expected, simulation prove 
that the primary role of the on-chip multilayer cladding be to 
increase the decay constant of evanescent wave kx′′=k0ð Þ, a 
show in Figs. 3f, h, and it do not significantly change the 
effective modal index of propagate wave kz′=k0ð Þ, a show in 
Figs. 3e, g. It be see that the large decay constant be achieve at 
ρ � 0:5 where the strong anisotropy be attained. Note that ρ= 

0 corresponds to the case of no cladding. We also emphasize that 
the power in the core be not compromise by the presence of the 
skin-depth engineering cladding and increase anisotropy cause 
an enhancement in power confinement. 

This light confinement strategy in e-skid waveguide be 
fundamentally different from that in photonic crystal waveguides. 
Our multilayer structure function in the deep subwavelength 
limit Λ � λð Þ, not the photonic crystal limit Λ � λð Þ and the 
performance of the e-skid waveguide be independent of the 
multilayer periodicity or disorder (see Supplementary note 2). 
Furthermore, there be no Dyakonov wave solution in e-skid 
waveguide a the optical axis of the anisotropic cladding be 
perpendicular to the interface and the direction of propaga- 
tion22,61–65. It be also important to note that the main goal of the 
anisotropic multilayer cladding be to control the decay constant of 
evanescent wave on-chip, not to achieve birefringence in the 
effective modal index of propagate wave a achieve previously 
in sub-wavelength grate structures26,50,51,66, multi-slotted 
waveguides52, or nonlinear phase match applications67. 

Cross-talk in e-skid waveguides. The skin-depth of evanescent 
wave be the fundamental origin of cross-talk between waveguide 
that hinders dense photonic integration. Cross-talk, or power 
couple between photonic devices, arises owe to the pertur- 
bation of the optical mode when the evanescent tail of one 
waveguide overlap with a nearby waveguide. However, if we 
control the skin-depth in the cladding, we can reduce the per- 
turbation due to the adjacent waveguide, subsequently reduce 
the cross-talk to surpass the integration limit in current silicon 
photonics. 

We now demonstrate this drastic reduction in the cross-talk 
make possible with the anisotropy in the cladding (Fig. 4a). The 
top view image of couple e-skid waveguide fabricate on an 
SOI chip be show in Fig. 4b. The power exchange between two

Fig. 4 Cross-talk in e-skid waveguides. a Schematic of couple e-skid waveguide on an SOI platform. The waveguide height, center-to-center separation 
between the two waveguide (s), and Λ be 220 nm, 1000 nm, and 120 nm, respectively. A cladding oxide be also add on the top of the waveguides. The 
number of ridge between the waveguide be dictate by the waveguide core size. b Top view SEM image of the couple e-skid waveguides. c The 
experimental setup to measure the cross-talk between the two waveguide at the telecommunication wavelength (λ=1550 nm). Light be in-coupled to the 
first waveguide through the middle grate coupler. The second waveguide be couple to the first waveguide for a length of L. In this experiment, the 
bending radius be 5 μm, hence, we can ignore the bending loss. d The ratio between the measure output power for strip waveguide and e-skid waveguide 
vs. L at the telecommunication wavelength. The ratio for the e-skid waveguide be two order of magnitude lower, indicate that far less power be couple to 
the second waveguide. The inset show the ratio for the waveguide without the top cladding oxide. In this case, the metamaterial cladding can increase 
the couple length up to 30 time or reduce the cross-talk -30 dB. See Supplementary Figure 8 for more details. e Comparison of the simulated and 
measure couple length for e-skid waveguide and strip waveguides. The couple length be normalize to the wavelength. Error bar represent the 
standard deviation of the fitting curves. The optimum match between the simulation and experiment be achieve when ρ= 0.6 for the cladding of e-skid 
waveguides. The couple length for e-skid waveguide be an order of magnitude large in comparison with strip waveguide (shaded region). The couple 
length for strip waveguide with large core size decrease because the overlap between the evanescent tail be increase although more power be confine 
inside the core (unshaded region)

where I0 be the input power, L be the distance for which the two 
waveguide be coupled, and Lc be the couple length. Note Lc be 
define such that if the waveguide be couple for a distance 
L=Lc, complete power transfer occurs from the first waveguide to 
the adjacent waveguide. Figure 4c illustrates the experimental 
setup to measure the couple length. Light be in-coupled to the 
first waveguide through the grate coupler68 and the second 
waveguide be couple to the first waveguide over a distance of L. 
The center-to-center separation between the two waveguide be 
only 1000 nm. The output power of the two waveguide be out- 
couple by the two grate coupler at the end of each 
waveguide. Note that we can ignore the propagation loss in this 
experiment a the total length do not exceed a few hundred 
microns, whereas the propagation loss be 3.67 dB/cm at the 
operating wavelength λ=1550 nm (see Supplementary Note 6 for 
detail about the characterization of the propagation loss). The 
ratio between the measure power for strip waveguide and e- 
skid waveguide be show in Fig. 4d. This highlight that the 
analytical expression I2=I1 ¼ tan2 πL=2Lcð Þð Þ match the experi- 
mental data. It be clearly see that the couple power to the 
second waveguide be almost two order of magnitude low for 

the e-skid waveguide. The measure and simulated69 couple 
length normalize to the wavelength for different core size be 
plot in Fig. 4e for waveguide with the same separation 
distance of 1000 nm. It be see that the couple length for the 
TE-like mode of e-skid waveguide be an order of magnitude 
high than that for strip waveguide allow miniaturization of 
photonic-integrated circuit without considerable cross-talk 
between the waveguides. Note that increase the core size in 
conventional strip waveguides, which corresponds to high 
power confinement inside the core, do not guarantee the 
reduction in cross-talk (unshaded region Fig. 4e) a the 
evanescent tail be not controlled. These drastically increase 
Lc be due to the reduce skin-depth with a high anisotropy, 
reduce the waveguide cross-talk significantly in comparison 
with other dielectric structures, which have be propose to 
reduce the cross-talk (Table 1). Note that a the TM-like mode 
have a negligible electric field component in the x direction, it do 
not probe/feel the dielectric anisotropy of the cladding. As 
expected, this result in high cross-talk for TM-modes 
compare with strip waveguide (see Supplementary Figures 6 
and 7 for more detail about the polarization effect and the 
propose design to control the skin-depth of the TM-like mode). 

Bending loss in e-skid waveguides. The critical phenomenon of 
bending loss70–72 can also be reduce by add the anisotropic 
metamaterial cladding. The counterintuitive connection of 
bending loss and skin-depth be reveal by an approach adapt 
from transformation optics70,73. Here, we consider a curve 
waveguide in the xz plane with a 90° bend and a bending radius of 
R R � δð Þ. The center of the curve waveguide be at the origin 
(Figs. 5b, d (inset)). If we apply the transformation: 
uþ iw ¼ Rln xþizR ; v ¼ y70,73, the curve waveguide be mapped to 
a straight waveguide in the uw plane (Figs. 5b, d). This cause the 
refractive index of the transform waveguide to become inho- 
mogeneous in the new coordinate system as70,73: 
n′ uð Þ ¼ n xðuÞð Þeu=R, where n x uð Þð Þ be the refractive index of the 
straight waveguide a show in Figs. 5a, b. Bending loss or 
radiative power leakage from the core occurs in this straight 
inhomogeneous index waveguide when the local index of the 
cladding exceeds the effective modal index (neff). Hence, if we 
suppress the field near and beyond this radiation condition point 
(Figs. 5b, d), we can reduce the bending loss. Note that due to the 
spatial transformation of coordinates, the electromagnetic field 
be also transform cause the expansion of the skin-depth (δ) 
on the right-hand side of the waveguide and shrinkage of it on the 
left-hand side (Figs. 5b, d): 

δright � δ þ 2δ2=R; 

δleft � δ � 2δ2=R: ð4Þ 

However, if we add the anisotropic metamaterial cladding, we can 
reduce the skin-depth. As a result, less power will be radiate at 
the radiation condition point, lead to reduce bending loss. 

To confirm the effect of the anisotropic metamaterial cladding 
on the bending loss, we have investigate the bending loss of 
the e-skid and strip waveguides, both experimentally and 
numerically74. To characterize the bending losses, we have 
cascade 90° bent waveguide sequentially with different number 
of turn (Fig. 6a and Supplementary note 4), then characterize 
the bending loss per turn by compare the transmissions. 
Figures 6b, c show the measure bending loss vs. the core size 
and the bending radius. In all cases, the bending loss with the e- 
skid waveguide be low than that with the strip waveguide, which 
be due to the reduce skin-depth with the anisotropic

metamaterial claddings. Note that if the fabrication advancement 
on the CMOS platform allow u to reduce the feature size and 
approach an ideal anisotropic cladding Λ ! 0ð Þ, we would 
achieve further reduction of the bending loss for TE-like mode in 
e-skid waveguide (See Supplementary note 4 for more detail a 
well a the bending loss calculation for TM-like modes). Our 
simulation account for all source of bending loss include 
radiation and mode-mismatch. 

Discussion 
In summary, we have introduce a photonic platform that can 
add the critical but overlook functionality of control eva- 
nescent wave to the CMOS foundry. We have show that high- 
index contrast grate structure in the deep sub-wavelength limit 
can act a an all-dielectric metamaterial cladding for simulta- 
neously achieve TIR and control the skin-depth of eva- 
nescent waves. The couple length be improve more than an 
order of magnitude and the bending loss be improve three time 
compare with conventional on-chip waveguide with an average 
propagation loss of 3.67 dB/cm at telecommunication wave- 
lengths. The decrease photonic skin-depth regime have not be 
realize till date but have be attempt in initial studies75. This be 
because an anisotropic all-dielectric metamaterial response 
require more than one period of the unit cell to control eva- 
nescent wave decay37,49,54. Although we use electron-beam 
lithography (EBL) a a convenient prototyping technique for 
the sub-wavelength structures, these device can in principle be 
fabricate use deep ultraviolet CMOS foundries; specifically, 
advanced 193 nm immersion lithography technology have be 
use to fabricate silicon photonic device with feature size down 
to 50 nm76. Our work pave the way for all-dielectric metama- 
terials to enter the practical realm of CMOS-foundry photonics to 
achieve improve photonic-integrated circuits. 

Methods 
Relaxed total internal reflection. Si/SiO2 multilayers be fabricate use 
magnetron sputter and magnetron reactive sputtering, respectively. Silicon and 
silica be both deposit at a power of 150 W use a pulse power supply at a 
frequency of 150 kHz and off time of 0.5 μs for silicon and 0.8 μs for silica. A 
special substrate holder be built to hold the prism during deposition. With the 
new substrate holder and the large thickness of the prism, the film property would 
change a the substrate be much closer to the target, produce film with high 
loss. Reducing the deposition power produce low loss films. A 200 nm thick 
layer of tungsten be deposit at 300W, 150 kHz, and 0.5 μs on top of the 
multilayer structure at each fill fraction. The prism be illuminate with a 1530 nm 

narrow line width laser. A broadband linear polarizer place in the beam path 
create s and p polarize light. The incident angle be increase in increment of 2° 
from 10° to 80°. A Newport Optics Optical Power Meter calibrate to a wavelength 
of 1530 nm be then use to measure the reflect power. The two reflection at 
the prism/air interface in the optical path be account for when compare 
experiment with EMT simulations. 

On-chip platform 1. The on-chip device for measure cross-talk in the main text 
and bending loss in Supplementary Figure 9 be fabricate use a JEOL JBX- 
6300FS EBL system77 operate at 100 keV energy, 8 nA beam current, and 500 μm 
exposure field size. A silicon-on-insulator wafer (220 nm thick silicon on 3 μm 
thick silicon dioxide) have be used. A solvent rinse and hot-plate dehydration 
baked. Then, hydrogen silsesquioxane resist (HSQ, Dow-Corning XP-1541-006) 
be spin-coated at 4000 rpm, and then hot-plate bake at 80 °C for 4 min Shape 
placement by the machine grid, the beam step grid, and the space between 
dwell point during the shape writing, be 1 nm, 6 nm, and 6 nm, respectively. An 
exposure dose of 2800 μC/cm2 be used. The resist be developed by immersion in 
25% tetramethylammonium hydroxide for 4 min., follow by a flow deionize 
water rinse for 60 s, an isopropanol rinse for 10 s. Then blown dry with nitrogen. 
The inductively couple plasma etch in an Oxford Plasmalab System 100 be 
use to remove silicon from unexposed areas, with a chlorine gas flow of 20 sccm, 
ICP power of 800 W, pressure of 12 mT, bias power of 40 W, and a platen 
temperature of 20 °C, result in a bias voltage of 185 V. During etching, per- 
fluoropolyether vacuum oil be use to mount chip on a 100 mm silicon carrier 
wafer. Cladding oxide be deposit use plasma enhance chemical vapor 
deposition in an Oxford Plasmalab System 100 with nitrous oxide flow of 
1000.0 sccm, a silane flow of 13.0 sccm, high-purity nitrogen flow of 500.0 sccm, 
high-frequency RF power of 120 W, pressure at 1400 mT, and a platen temperature 
of 350 °C. Chips rest directly on a silicon carrier wafer during deposition and be 
buffer by silicon piece on all side to aid uniformity. 

To characterize the on-chip devices, a custom-built automate test setup be 
used6. An Agilent 81635A optical power sensor be use a the output detector and 
Agilent 81600B tunable laser a the input source. The wavelength be swept in 10 
pm step from 1500 to 1600 nm. To maintain the polarization state of the light, a 
polarization maintain fiber be use for couple the TE polarization into the 
grate couplers68. A polarization maintain fiber array be use to couple light 
in/out of the chip. 

On-chip platform 2. For the bending loss experiment in the main text, the cross- 
talk experiment in Supplementary Figure 8, the insertion loss experiment in 
Supplementary Figure 13, and the propagation loss experiment in Supplementary 
Figure 14, a standard SOI wafer be use a a substrate with 2 μm bury oxide and 
220 nm top silicon layer. Diluted HSQ with methyl isobutyl ketone be spun on the 
substrate a a negative-tone electron-beam resist layer. The resist layer be expose 
by a 100 kV EBL system, VB6-UHR (Raith), which be capable of 2 nm beam step 
resolution. After the development of the resist, the top silicon layer be etch by 
Cl2/O2 base reactive-ion plasma etch tool (Panasonic P610) to transfer the 
waveguide pattern from the resist to the silicon layer.

due to the metamaterial cladding help to reduce the bending loss at sharp bend in photonic-integrated circuits. This effect be strong for waveguide 
with small core sizes, a a considerable amount of the power lie outside the core and decay slowly
