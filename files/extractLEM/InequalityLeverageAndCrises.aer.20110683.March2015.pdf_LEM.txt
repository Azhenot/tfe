Inequality, Leverage, and Crises† 

By Michael Kumhof, Romain Rancière, and Pablo Winant* 

The paper study how high household leverage and crisis can 
be cause by change in the income distribution. Empirically, the 
period 1920–1929 and 1983–2008 both exhibit a large increase 
in the income share of high-income households, a large increase 
in debt leverage of low- and middle-income households, and an 
eventual financial and real crisis. The paper present a theoretical 
model where high leverage and crisis be the endogenous result 
of a grow income share of high-income households. The model 
match the profile of the income distribution, the debt-to-income 
ratio and crisis risk for the three decade precede the Great 
Recession. (JEL D14, D31, D33, E32, E44, G01, N22) 

The United States experienced two major economic crisis over the past century— 
the Great Depression start in 1929 and the Great Recession start in 2008. A 
strike and often overlook similarity between these two crisis be that both be 
preceded, over a period of decades, by a sharp increase in income inequality, and 
by a similarly sharp increase in debt-to-income ratio among lower- and middle-in- 
come households. When debt level start to be perceive a unsustainable, they 
contribute to trigger exceptionally deep financial and real crises. 

In this paper, we first document these facts, both for the period prior to the Great 
Depression and the period prior to the Great Recession, and we then present a 
dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model in which a crisis driven by great 
income inequality arises endogenously. To our knowledge, our model be the first to 
provide an internally consistent mechanism link the empirically observe rise in 
income inequality, the increase in debt-to-income ratios, and the risk of a financial

crisis. In do so it provide a useful theoretical framework, include a new meth- 
odology for it calibration, that can be use to investigate the role of income inequal- 
ity a an independent source of macroeconomic fluctuations. 

The model be kept a simple a possible in order to allow for a clear understand- 
ing of the mechanism at work. The crisis be the ultimate result, after a period of 
decades, of permanent shock to the income share of two group of households: 
top earner who represent the top 5 percent of the income distribution, and whose 
income share increases; and bottom earner who represent the bottom 95 percent of 
the income distribution.1 The key mechanism be that top earners, rather than use 
all of their increase income for high consumption, use a large share of it to accu- 
mulate financial wealth in the form of loan to bottom earners.2 They do so because, 
follow Carroll (2000) and others, financial wealth enters their utility function 
directly, which implies a positive marginal propensity to save out of permanent 
income shocks. By accumulate financial wealth, top earner allow bottom earner 
to limit the drop in their consumption, but the result large increase of bottom 
earners’ debt-to-income ratio generates financial fragility that eventually make a 
financial crisis much more likely. 

The crisis be the result of an endogenous and rational default decision on the part 
of bottom earners, who trade off the benefit of relief from their grow debt load 
against output and utility cost associate with default. Lenders fully expect this 
behavior and price loan accordingly. The crisis be characterize by partial house- 
hold debt default and an abrupt output contraction, a mechanism that be consistent 
with the result of Philippon and Midrigan (2011) and Gärtner (2013) for the Great 
Recession and the Great Depression, respectively. When a rational default occurs, it 
do provide relief to bottom earners. But because it be accompany by a collapse in 
real activity that hit bottom earner especially hard, and because of high post-cri- 
si interest rates, the effect on their debt-to-income ratio be small, and debt quickly 
start to increase again if income inequality remains unchanged. 

When the shock to income inequality be permanent, consistent with the time 
series property of US top 5 percent income shares, the preference for wealth of 
top earner (and thus their positive marginal propensity to save follow a perma- 
nent income shock) be key to our result on debt growth. We show in a baseline 
simulation that, when preference for wealth of top earner be calibrate to match 
a marginal propensity to save of around 0.4, an empirical estimate that be base 
on independent microeconomic data, a series of permanent negative shock to the 
income share of bottom earners, of exactly the magnitude observe in the data, 
generates an increase in the debt-to-income ratio of bottom earner very close to the 
magnitude observe in the 1983–2007 data. Because the evolution of the debt-to- 
income ratio of bottom earner be not a target of our calibration, this constitutes an 
empirical success of our model. Furthermore, the increase in debt lead to a signifi- 
cant increase in crisis risk, of approximately the magnitude found in the recent work 
of Schularick and Taylor (2012). In Section IF we discus other explanation for the 
1983–2007 increase in debt level and crisis risk that focus on domestic and global 

1 Note that our paper focus only on the macroeconomic implication of increase income inequality, rather 
than take a stand on the fundamental reason for change in the income distribution. 

2 In a more elaborate model, physical investment be a third option. See Kumhof and Rancière (2010).

asset market imbalance in the decade prior to the Great Depression. We also show, 
in an alternative simulation, that when the shock to income inequality be model a 
transitory, the same model parameterized without preference for wealth among top 
earner can generate an increase in debt and crisis risk purely base on a consump- 
tion smooth motive. 

The central argument of the paper link two strand of the literature3 that have 
largely be evolve separately: the literature on income and wealth distribution,4 
and the literature on financial fragility and financial crises.5 In addition, our mod- 
eling approach take element from the literature on preference for wealth,6 to 
explain the rise of household debt leverage when the increase in income inequality 
be permanent, and from the literature on rational default, to endogenize financial 
crises.7 

Rajan (2010) and Reich (2010) share with this paper an emphasis on income 
inequality a a long-run determinant of leverage and financial fragility. In contrast 
to these authors, we study this issue in the context of a general equilibrium model. 
This permit a quantification of the importance of this channel, and an identification 
of the respective role of credit demand and credit supply in the rise of household 
leverage and crisis risk.8 Another literature have related increase in income inequal- 
ity to increase in household debt (Krueger and Perri 2006, Iacoviello 2008). In 
these authors’ approach, an increase in the variance of idiosyncratic income shock 
across all household generates a high demand for insurance through credit mar- 
kets, thereby increase household debt. This approach emphasizes an increase in 
income inequality experienced within household group with similar characteris- 
tics, while our paper focus on the empirically well-documented rise in income 
inequality between two specific household groups, the top 5 percent and the bottom 
95 percent of the income distribution. 

In theory, if increase income inequality be accompany by an increase in 
intragenerational income mobility, the dispersion in lifetime earnings might be 
much small than the dispersion in annual earnings, a agent move up and down 
the income ladder throughout their lives. However, a recent study by Kopczuk, Saez, 
and Song (2010) show that short-term and long-term income mobility in the United 
States have be either stable or slightly fall since the 1950s. These author also 
find that virtually all of the increase in the variance of earnings over recent decade 
have be due to an increase in the variance of permanent earnings rather than of 
transitory earnings.9 These result provide support for one of our simplify mod- 
eling choices, the assumption of two income group with fix memberships. They 
also provide additional support for our calibration, whereby shock to the income 
distribution be permanent.

present in the online Appendix.

5 See Levitin and Wachter (2012) and the reference therein. 
6 See Carroll (2000), Reiter (2004), Francis (2009), and the reference therein. As discuss in the online 

Appendix, preference for wealth have be use by this literature because model with standard preference have 
difficulty accounting for the save behavior of the richest households.

8 Using local measure of inequality and credit, Coibion et al. (2014) find empirical evidence consistent with 

supply-side interpretation of debt accumulation pattern during the 2000s. 
9 Similar result be found by DeBacker et al. (2013). 



1220 THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW MARCH 2015 

There be little guidance from the literature on how to calibrate the preference 
for wealth specification. But there be a small literature on the marginal propensity 
to save (MPS) of different income groups. The key paper be Dynan, Skinner, and 
Zeldes (2004), who find that MPS be steeply increase in the level of permanent 
income, and reach value of 0.5 or even high for the high income groups. We 
show that these result can be mapped directly into a calibration of the preference 
for wealth parameters. This calibration methodology be another contribution of our 
paper. 

The rest of the paper be organize a followed. Section I discus key styl- 
ized fact for the Great Depression and the Great Recession. Section II present 
the model. Section III discus model calibration and the computational solution 
method. Section IV show model simulation that study the effect of increase 
income inequality on debt level and crises. Section V concludes. 

I. Stylized Facts 

This section document five key stylize fact that characterize, for the US 
economy, the period prior to the Great Recession and, where available, the Great 
Depression. These fact be relevant to the nexus between inequality, leverage, and 
crises. Some will inform the specification and calibration of our model, and others 
will be use to evaluate the empirical support for the model. We conclude this sec- 
tion with a discussion of the empirical evidence associate with the two main alter- 
native explanation for high and grow household debt that have be advanced 
in the literature. 

A. Income Inequality and Aggregate Household Debt 

In the period prior to both major crises, rapidly grow income inequality be 
accompany by a sharp increase in aggregate household debt. 

Pre-Great-Recession.—Panel A of Figure 1 plot the evolution of US income 
inequality and household debt-to-GDP ratio between 1983 and 2008. Income 
inequality experienced a sharp increase, a the share of total income command by 
the top 5 percent of the income distribution increase from 21.8 percent in 1983 to 
33.8 percent in 2007. During the same period the ratio of household debt to gross 
domestic product (GDP) doubled, from 49.1 percent to 98.0 percent. 

Pre-Great-Depression.—Panel B of Figure 1 plot the evolution of US income 
inequality and household debt-to-GDP ratio between 1920 and 1929. Between 
1920 and 1928, the top 5 percent income share increase from 27.5 percent to 34.8 
percent. During the same period, the ratio of household debt to GDP more than dou- 
bled, from 16.9 percent to 37.1 percent. 

B. Debt by Income Group 

The period prior to both major crisis be characterize by increase heteroge- 
neity in debt-to-income ratio between high-income household and all remain

households. For the period prior to the Great Depression data availability be very 
limited, but some evidence exists, and be consistent with the period prior to the Great 
Recession. 

Pre-Great-Recession.—Panel A of Figure 2 plot the evolution of debt-to-income 
ratio for the top 5 percent and bottom 95 percent of households, ranked by income, 
between 1983 and 2007.10 In 1983, the top income group be more indebted than 
the bottom income group, with a gap of around 20 percentage points. In 2007, the 
situation be reversed. The debt-to-income ratio of the bottom group, at 147.3 per- 
cent compare to an initial value of 62.3 percent, be now more than twice a high 
a that of the top group, which remain fluctuate around 60 percent. As a con- 
sequence almost all of the increase in the aggregate debt-to-income ratio show 
in Figure 1 be due to the bottom group of the income distribution. A similar pat- 
tern to the debt-to-income ratio in Figure 2 be also observe in debt-to-net-worth 
ratio (panel A of Figure 3), and in unsecured debt-to-income ratio (panel B of 
Figure 3).11 

Pre-Great-Depression.—According to Olney (1991) and Olney (1999), the ratio 
of non-mortgage consumer debt to income increase from 4.6 percent in 1919 to 
9.3 percent in 1929. Around two-thirds of this be installment debt, especially for 

10 Debt-to-income ratio be construct use data from the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF), which start 
in 1983, and become triennial start in 1989, make 2007 the last pre-crisis observation. 

11 It be sometimes argue that the more recent increase in household debt (2000–2007), which consist to a 
large extent of mortgage loans, represent borrowing against house whose fundamental value have risen. However 
several recent empirical paper (Mian and Sufi 2009; Favara and Imbs 2010; Adelino, Schoar, and Severino 2012) 
show that causation ran from credit to house prices, specifically that credit supply shock cause house price to 
increase above fundamental values.

new car increase from 8.6 percent to 24.0 percent. 

For this period, only two BLS surveys, from 1917/1919 and 1935/1936, be 
available to study difference in borrowing across income groups. The 1935/1936 
survey be take several year after the crisis of 1929. But the data be nevertheless

the survey. Panel B: Bureau of Labor Statistics, 1917/1919 Consumer Purchase Survey (CPS), and 1935/1936 
Study of Consumer Purchases in the United States. The 1917/1919 survey cover 13,000 non-farm families. The 
1935/1936 survey cover 60,000 farm and non-farm non relief families.

sponds to annual income before taxes, in the year precede the survey. 



1223 Kumhof et al.: InequalIty, leverage, and CrIsesvol. 105 no. 3 

informative, for two reasons. First, the top 5 percent income share in 1936 be still 
high (32.5 percent), imply that income inequality have only very partially be 
reverse since 1929. And second, by 1936 the number of new car sell and the per- 
centage of household buying car on installment, after have collapse between 
1929 and 1934, have recover to reach very comparable level to 1927 (Olney 1991). 

We use the income threshold provide by Piketty and Saez (2003) to classify 
the respondent of both survey into either the top 5 percent or the bottom 95 per- 
cent of the income distribution. To make the result of the two survey comparable, 
we confine the analysis to installment credit. The survey do not report stock of 
debt but rather flow of new debt associate with installment purchase in the last 
12 months. Panel B of Figure 2 present the results. In the 1917/1918 survey, the 
new installment debt to income ratio be both low and similar for both groups, at 
3.0 percent and 3.8 percent for the top and bottom income groups. In the 1935/1936 
survey, the ratio be much high and, more importantly, much more dissimilar 
across income groups, at 6.8 percent and 10.9 percent for the top and bottom income 
groups. In 1935/1936, the ratio of average income between borrower in the top 
and bottom group be 3.25, while the ratio of average amount borrow be only 
1.6. To the extent that these data be representative of other year during this period, 
it indicates a significantly high growth in debt-to-income ratio among the bottom 
income group.12 

C. Wealth by Income Group 

In the period prior to both major crises, the rise in income inequality be asso- 
ciated not only with divergent debt level across income groups, but also with diver- 
gent share of overall wealth. 

Pre-Great-Recession.—Panel A of Figure 4, which be base on SCF data, plot 
the share of wealth held by the top 5 percent of the income distribution between 
1983 and 2007. Except for a brief period between 1989 and 1992, this wealth share 
increase continuously, from 42.6 percent in 1983 to 48.6 percent in 2007. 

Pre-Great-Depression.—Panel B of Figure 4, which be base on the dataset of 
Saez and Zucman (2014), plot the share of wealth held by the top 1 percent of 
the wealth distribution between 1920 and 1928. Except for 1923, this wealth share 
increase continuously, from 34.9 percent in 1920 to 47.5 percent in 1928. 

D. Leverage and Crisis Probability 

To quantify the link between household leverage and crisis probabilities, we use 
the dataset of Schularick and Taylor (2012), which contains information on aggre- 
gate credit and crisis for 14 country between 1870 and 2008. We follow these 
authors’ methodology by running, on the full dataset, a logit specification in which 

12 Alternative source for the period immediately prior to 1929 exist and be broadly consistent with the 
1935/1936 survey, but they be much more limited in quality or scope. See Plummer (1927) and Bureau of Labor 
Statistics (1929). 



1224 THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW MARCH 2015 

the binary variable be a crisis dummy, and the latent explanatory variable include 
five lag of the aggregate loans-to-GDP ratio. The estimate logit model be use 
to predict crisis probability over the full cross section and time series sample. 
Figure 5 report the estimate probability for the United States. We observe that, 
in the period prior to both major crises, there be a sizable increase in crisis prob- 
abilities, even though a crisis remain a low probability event. 

Pre-Great-Recession.—Panel A of Figure 5 show that the estimate crisis prob- 
ability start at 2.0 percent in 1983 and increase to 5.2 percent by 2008. Between 
2001 and 2008, the crisis probability increase by two percentage points. 

Pre-Great-Depression.—Panel B of Figure 5 show that the estimate crisis prob- 
ability almost double between 1925 and 1928, from 1.6 percent to 3.0 percent, 
before reach 4.0 percent in the year of the crisis. 

E. Household Defaults during Crises 

Both major crisis be characterize by high rate of default on household loans. 
Their magnitude matter because the share of loan default on in a crisis be an 
important parameter of our model. 

Great Recession.—We compute delinquency rate a ratio of the balance of 
delinquent loan (defined a be past due by 90 day or more) to the total loan 
balance.13 Between 2006 and 2010, mortgage delinquency rate increase dramat- 
ically, from 0.9 percent to 8.9 percent, and so do unsecured consumer loan delin- 
quency rates, from 8.8 percent to 13.7 percent for credit card loans, from 2.3 percent 
to 5.3 percent for auto loans, and from 6.4 percent to 9.1 percent for student loan 
(the delinquency rate for student loan reach 11.7 percent in 2013). The figure

mention above apply to all households. Default rate among bottom earner can 
be show to have be higher. 

Great Depression.—The crisis of 1929 be follow by a wave of default on auto- 
mobile installment debt contract (Olney 1999). The percentage of car repossess 
increase from 4.1 percent in 1928 to 10.4 percent in 1932. Furthermore, reposses- 
sion rate be significantly high for use car than for new car (13.2 percent ver- 
sus 5.7 percent in 1932). Combined with the fact that wealthy household be much 
more likely to buy new car than middle- and lower-class household (Calder 1999), 
this suggests that default rate on installment debt be high among the bottom 
income group. Mortgage default rate be also high during the Great Depression. 
According to a study of 22 city by the Department of Commerce, by January 1934, 
43.8 percent of home with a first mortgage be in default (Wheelock 2008). 

F. Alternative Explanations for the Increase in Household Debt 

The literature have advanced a number of alternative explanation for the rapid 
increase in household debt prior to the Great Recession. In this subsection we briefly 
look at the empirical evidence for the two most important alternative explanations, 
financial innovation and the global save glut. 

Financial Sector Growth and Financial Innovation.—The stylize fact pertain- 
ing to the evolution of the US financial industry over the last 125 year have recently 
be document by Philippon (2013). For the purpose of our paper, the key fact 
are: (i) The finance industry’s share of GDP increase by roughly 50 percent in the 
two period of interest, from 2.8 percent to 4.6 percent between 1920 and 1928, and 
from 5.5 percent to 7.9 percent between 1983 and 2007. (ii) Most of these variation 
can be explain by correspond change in the quantity of intermediate assets. 
(iii) Intermediation be produce under constant return to scale with an annual aver- 
age cost of around 2 percent of outstanding assets. (iv) The unit cost of interme- 
diation have not decrease over the past 30 years. This implies that the substantial 
increase in the GDP share of the financial sector can be explain by the simple

growth of balance sheets, without a necessary role for financial innovation.14 In our 
model, that growth of balance sheet be due to an increase in household credit to bot- 
tom earners, follow an increase supply of saving by top earner after they expe- 
rience a permanent increase in income. According to Philippon (2013), household 
credit represent only around one-quarter of the stock of outstanding intermedi- 
ated asset between 1983 and 2007. Financial activity that relate to non-household 
credit remain outside our model. Nevertheless, the rough double of household 
credit over the 1983–2007 period contribute substantially to the overall increase in 
the GDP share of the financial sector. 

The fact state above do not however rule out that financial innovation could have 
be an additional source of financial fragility. According to Levitin and Wachter 
(2012), several financial product innovation that spread during the last phase of the 
mortgage credit boom (2004–2007) lead to significant underprice of credit risk due 
to the complexity and opacity of these products.15 Interestingly, the seemingly safe 
senior tranche of these security attract many foreign investors, contribute to 
the global save glut to which we turn next. 

Global Saving Glut.—The global save glut, which link the large current 
account surplus of Asian country and the large current account deficit of the 
United States, emerge in 1998, in the aftermath of the Asian crisis. An empirical 
challenge be that we cannot directly, from the data, measure the contribution of for- 
eign inflow to the build-up of household credit. We can however approximate this 
contribution, by consider the broad category of private credit market instrument 
in the US Flow of Funds, and by draw on the model-based estimation result of 
Justiniano, Primiceri, and Tambalotti (2014). 

In Flow of Funds data, the ratio of private domestic credit to GDP increase 
from 130.4 percent to 292.3 percent between 1983 and 2007. Meanwhile the ratio 
of foreign private credit asset to GDP increase from 2.8 percent to 34 percent. 
The contribution of foreign asset accumulation to private domestic debt accumula- 
tion differs widely between the pre-saving glut period (1983–1998) and the save 
glut period (1998–2007). In the early period, private credit grow by 71 percentage 
points, with foreign asset accumulation only accounting for around 5 percent of 
this. In the late period, private credit grow by 90.6 percentage points, with for- 
eign asset accumulation accounting for around 25 percent. Justiniano, Primiceri, 
and Tambalotti (2014) perform a quantitative model-based exercise that ass the 
role of foreign capital flow in explain the accumulation of US household credit 
over the period 1998–2006. They find that between one-quarter and one-third of the 
increase in US household debt can be explain by the dynamic of capital flows. 
In Section IVD we will show that these finding be consistent with the empirical 
performance of our model over the period 1998–2007. 

14 As state by Philippon (2013, p. 7): “Since the unit cost appear to be roughly constant, the question becomes: 
how do we explain the large historical variation in the ratio of intermediate asset over GDP?” 

15 This aspect cannot be capture in our model, in which investor correctly price default risk.

II. The Model 

The model economy consists of two group of infinitely live households, 
refer to respectively a top earners, with population share χ , and bottom earners, 
with population share 1 − χ . Total aggregate output y t be give by an autoregressive 
stochastic process 

(1) y t = (1 − ρ y ) y ̅ + ρ y y t−1 + ϵ y, t , 

where a bar above a variable denotes it steady-state value. The share of output 
receive by top earner z t be also an autoregressive stochastic process, and be give by 

(2) z t = (1 − ρ z ) z ̅ + ρ z z t−1 + ϵ z, t . 

The standard deviation of ϵ y, t and ϵ z, t be denote by σ y and σ z .

preference nest the standard case of constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) con- 
sumption preference for φ = 0 . 

When top earner lend to bottom earners, they offer p t unit of consumption 
today in exchange for 1 unit of consumption tomorrow in case bottom earner do 
not default. In case bottom earner do default, top earner receive (1 − h) unit 
of consumption tomorrow, where h ∈ [0, 1] be the haircut parameter, the propor- 
tion of loan default on in a crisis. Bottom earner default only rarely, because 
do so entail large output and utility losses, a explain in Sections IIB and IIC. 
Consumption of each top earner be give by

where b t be the amount of debt per bottom earner issue in period t at price p t , to be

to no default and δ t = 1 corresponds to default. Then we have

This condition equates the cost and benefit of acquire an additional unit of finan-

also the current utility gain from hold an additional unit of financial wealth.

which capture the social group of reference, and be assume to be increase with the income of the group.

C. Endogenous Default 

At the begin of period t , bottom earner choose whether to default on their 
past debt b t−1 . This, together with the haircut parameter h , defines the amount l t 
that bottom earner repay during period t , accord to equation (5). Their lifetime 
consumption utility V t be a function of the state of the economy s t = ( l t , y t , z t , u t ) , 
and be recursively define by 

V( s t ) = 
( c t b )

______ 

1 − 1 __ σ 
+ E t [V( s t+1 )] . 

The decision to default δ t be a rational choice make at the begin of the 
period, give a pre-default state s ̂ t = ( b t−1 , y t , z t , u t−1 ) , by compare the lifetime 
consumption utility value of default V t D = V( s ̂ t , δ t = 1) and not default 
V t N = V ( s ̂ t , δ t = 0) . Bottom earner default when V t D − V t N be high than an i.i.d. 
additive utility cost of default ξ t , a in Pouzo and Presno (2012). We can therefore 
write the decision to default as: 

(11) δ t = arg max 
δ t ∈{0, 1} 



{ V t D − ξ t , V t N } , 

where V t D = V ( b t−1 (1 − h) , y t , z t , ρ u u t−1 + γ u ) and V t N = V ( b t−1 , y t , z t , ρ u u t−1 ) . 
The distribution of δ t depends upon the distribution of ξ t . We have the simple formula 

(12) prob ( δ t = 1| s ̂ t ) = Ξ ( V t D − V t N ) , 

where Ξ be the cumulative distribution function of ξ t . We assume that Ξ take the 
modify logistic form 

(13) Ξ ( x ) = 
{ 


ψ _________ 
1 + e (− θx ) if x < ∞ , 
1 if x = ∞ . 


} 

, 

where ψ < 1 . This implies that, over the economically relevant range, default 
occurs with positive probability but never with certainty.17 The parameter ψ , θ , γ u , 
and ρ u be calibrate to match the empirical evidence for the probability of crises, 
but with γ u and ρ u in addition constrain by the need to at least approximately 
match the evidence on the depth and duration of such crises. The parameter ψ help 
to determine the mean level of crisis probability over the sample, while θ determines 
the curvature of crisis probability with respect to the difference V t D − V t N . 

17 The cost take an infinite value with probability 1 − ψ , and finite value distribute accord to the c.d.f. 
1 /( 1 + e(−θx)) with probability ψ .

D. Equilibrium 

In equilibrium, top earner and bottom earner maximize their respective lifetime 
utilities, the market for borrowing and lending clears, and the market clearing con- 
dition for good holds: 

(14) y t (1 − (1 − z t ) u t ) = χ c t τ + (1 − χ) c t b . 

E. Analytical Results 

A small number of key parameter of our model affect the speed at which bottom 
earners’ debt accumulates follow a drop in their income share. Before discuss 
the calibration, it be therefore useful to analytically derive some relationship that 
clarify the role of these parameters. 

Debt Supply and Debt Demand.—One implication of preference for wealth be 
that a unique, stable deterministic steady state for financial wealth b t exists. In this 
steady state, the Euler equation (6) and (10) can be interpret a the hypothetical 
price at which top earner and bottom earner would be willing to buy and sell 
debt while keep their consumption constant. These equation therefore represent 
steady-state supply and demand function for debt. Bottom earners’ demand price 
a a function of debt, p(b) , be flat at18 

(15) p(b) = β b , 

while top earners’ supply price a a function of debt be implicitly give by 

(16) p(b) = β τ +

1 − χ ____ χ ) 
1 __ σ

. 

By combine (15) and (16), one obtains the steady-state relationship

. 

The numerator on the right-hand side, which equal ( c ̅ τ ) 1/σ , be always positive 
because consumption utility satisfies the Inada conditions. Equation (17) therefore 
show that for any model with preference for wealth ( φ > 0 ), a steady state with 

18 The simplification of abstract from default, for the purpose of this exercise, be justified by the fact that 
default have a negligible effect on the Euler equation in the neighborhood of the original steady state.

positive debt of bottom earner ( b ̅ > 0 ) require the condition β b > β τ , which be 
therefore always satisfied in our calibration. However, this do not mean that top 
earner be more impatient than bottom earners. The reason be that their effective 
impatience be give by p(b) rather than simply by β τ . Effective impatience be there- 
fore endogenous to the level of debt, and the effective steady state impatience of top 
earner be equal to the impatience of bottom earners. 

Changes in Steady-State Income and Preferences for Wealth.—Differentiating

steady-state debt level b ̅ ,

which can be show to be positive for any plausible calibration, imply that an 
increase in income inequality raise the steady-state equilibrium level of debt. 

The left and middle subplots of Figure 6 show initial credit demand (15) a the 
horizontal dash-dotted line at a price of debt of approximately 0.96. Initial credit 
supply (16) be show a thick lines, and increase credit supply after a 10 percent- 
age point increase in the top 5 percent income share a thin lines. The solid line 
represent the baseline, and the dash and dot line show the effect of varying, 
relative to the baseline, the parameter φ or η , while adjust β τ to remain consis- 
tent with an unchanging initial level of steady-state debt. The left subplot show 
that, while the size of the increase in steady-state debt follow the increase in 
credit supply be independent of φ , a high φ increase the slope of the credit sup- 
ply schedule. Therefore, with debt start out at it initial low-debt steady state, 
a high φ implies that top earner be willing to more aggressively low interest 
rate on debt (raise the price of debt) to move toward the new high-debt steady state 
at a high speed. The middle subplot show that a high η , meaning a low cur- 
vature of the utility function with respect to wealth, lead to more financial wealth 
accumulation. The reason be that a high η reduces the rate at which marginal utility 
fall in response to increase in wealth, so that top earner limit the increase in their 
consumption more strongly in order to accumulate more wealth. 

The Marginal Propensity to Save.—At shorter horizon of 20–40 years, 
the effect of high φ and high η be hard to distinguish, because both tend 
to increase the rate at which debt increase follow a permanent increase 
in income inequality. The marginal propensity to save (MPS) of top earn- 
er follow a permanent income shock be a function of both φ and η . 
The model-based formula for the MPS be derive in the online Appendix of this 
paper. The right subplot of Figure 6 show how different combination of φ and η 
translate into different MPS in that formula.

III. Calibration and Solution Method 

A. Calibration 

We calibrate the model at the annual frequency. Top earner and bottom earner 
correspond to the top 5 percent and the bottom 95 percent of the income distribution, 
respectively, χ = 0.05 . The model combine two key mechanisms, the accumula- 
tion of debt by bottom earner follow a permanent increase in income inequality, 
and a rational default decision, with default probability increase in the level of 
debt. An increase in the default probability interacts with the speed of debt accu- 
mulation through an increase in default risk premia. However, default be partial, 
and default probability be low, range from 2.2 percent in 1983 to 5.1 percent 
in 2008, when calibrate base on the empirical evidence of Schularick and Taylor 
(2012). This implies that the effect of default risk on debt accumulation be very 
limited during the 1983–2008 period. The calibration exercise be therefore make 
more transparent by separate parameter related to debt accumulation and to the 
default mechanism.

Debt Accumulation.— 
Preferences: Following many paper in the business cycle literature, the curva- 

ture of the utility function with respect to consumption be fix at σ = 0.5 for both 
top and bottom earners. The detailed calibration procedure for the preference for 
wealth parameter φ and η be described in the online Appendix. We first use our 
theoretical model to derive an approximate formula for top earners’ MPS out of per- 
manent income shocks. We then use the empirical methodology of Dynan, Skinner, 
and Zeldes (2004) to estimate the empirical counterpart of this formula, use SCF 
and PSID data. Finally, the model’s preference for wealth parameter φ and η be 
calibrate by equate the model-based MPS to the data-based MPS. We find that 
save rate be a steeply increase function of income, and obtain a baseline MPS 
of top earner of 0.397, with a low bound of 0.248 and an upper bound of 0.505.19 
The result baseline parameter value be φ = 0.05 and η = 1.09 .20 Because 
we be match one MPS use two parameters, these value be not unique, but a 
show in Section IVD, change the combination of φ and η at a give MPS have a 
very small effect on our results. 

Initial Steady State: Steady-state output be normalize to 1, y ̅ = 1 . The steady- 
state net real interest rate be fix at 4 percent per annum, similar to value typically 
use in the real business cycle literature, by fix bottom earners’ discount factor 
at β b = 1. 04 −1 . We calibrate the initial steady state of the debt-to-income ratio λ t 
and of the top 5 percent income share τ t to be equal to their 1983 counterparts. In 
the model, λ t be give by21 

(19) λ t = 
(1 − χ) l t __________________ 

y t−1 (1 − z t−1 ) (1 − u t−1 ) 
. 

We choose β τ to replicate λ ̅ in 1983, which equal 62.3 percent. To calibrate the 
1983 value of τ t we use the data compute by Piketty and Saez (2003, updated), 
which include interest income but exclude interest payment in the computation of 
annual gross incomes. The model counterpart be give by 

(20) τ t = 
y t z t + (1 − χ) l t (1 / p t−1 − 1) _______________________________ 

y t (1 − u t (1 − z t ) ) + (1 − χ) l t (1 / p t−1 − 1) 
. 

We choose z ̅ to replicate τ ̅ in 1983, which equal 21.8 percent. 

Exogenous Shock Processes: We estimate the exogenous stochastic process for 
output y t use the detrended series of US real GDP from 1983 to 2010 obtain from 

19 By consider a wide range of different MPS estimates, we have take into account the inevitable uncer- 
tainty associate with alternative method of estimate this magnitude. 

20 We note that the relationship η > σ be consistent with the preference for wealth specification of Carroll 
(2000). 

21 This ratio be define to be consistent with SCF data, where debt liability be measure during the first 
semester of the Survey—at the time of the interview—while income refers to income in the year prior to the survey. 



1234 THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW MARCH 2015 

the BEA. Our estimate be ρ y = 0.669 and σ y = 0.012 . For the year 1983–2008 
of the baseline simulation we calibrate the shock ϵ y, t to exactly match the detrended 
data, while all subsequent shock be set to zero. 

The exogenous stochastic process for the top 5 percent output share z t be param- 
eterized by specify ρ z and σ z such that the behavior of τ t match that of the 
update Piketty and Saez (2003) data series from 1983 to 2010. Using standard 
tests, the hypothesis that this data series have a unit root cannot be rejected. In the 
baseline model, we therefore calibrate ρ z = 1 , and then estimate σ z = 0.008 from 
the data. For the year 1983–2008 of the baseline simulation we calibrate the shock 
ϵ z, t such that τ t exactly match the data, with all subsequent shock set to zero. 

Targeted and Non-targeted Facts: Table 1 summarizes the calibration of the 
model, with the exception of the default parameters. This part of the model have ten 
exactly identify parameter and two (φ and η) that be match use empirical 
estimate of the MPS of top earners. Importantly, the use of empirical estimate to 
independently calibrate the preference for wealth parameter of top earner implies 
that match the post-1983 evolution of the debt-to-income ratio of bottom earner 
be not a target of the calibration. A comparison of it simulated evolution with the 
data will therefore serve to evaluate the empirical success of our model.22 

Default Mechanism.—The haircut, or percentage of loan default upon during 
the crisis, be set to h = 0.1 , which be approximately consistent with the empirical 
evidence in Section IE. The size of default γ u = 0.04 and the depth of the crisis 
ρ u = 0.65 be calibrate to give rise to default event that be reasonably close 
to what have be observe during the Great Depression, while trigger default 
decision that be consistent with the estimate probability of crises. Our cali- 
bration implies a slightly less than 3 percent loss in aggregate output on impact, 
and a cumulative output loss of around 8 percent of annual output, less than what 
be observe during the Great Recession. However, what matter for the default 
decision be the expect depth of the contraction. Few observer have anticipate the 
Great Recession, and once it have started, most observer initially underestimated it 
full severity (Dominguez and Shapiro 2013). 

The random utility cost parameter ψ = 0.15 and θ = 18 be chosen so 
that, combine with the output cost parameter γ u and ρ u , they closely match the 
Schularick and Taylor (2012) probability of crisis in 1983 and 2008,23 thereby also 
approximate the trend in it evolution between these two dates. Our calibration 
implies that the maximum theoretically possible default probability, at extremely 
high debt levels, be 15 percent, with actual default probability generally well below 
that.24 It can be show that, at debt and income level where default occurs with 
a probability of 5 percent, roughly the magnitude reach just prior to the Great 

22 The ability of our simple endowment model to match the behavior of the interest rate, which be also non-tar- 
geted, if of course very limited. 

23 The crisis probability in our calibrate model be 2.19 percent in 1983 and 5.08 percent in 2008, while the 
probability estimate accord to Schularick and Taylor (2012) be 2.04 percent in 1983 and 5.16 percent in 
2008. 

24 Between 1900 and 2008, the maximum probability of a US crisis, estimate accord to Schularick and

Recession, the random utility cost of default need to trigger the financial crisis 
be a negative utility cost equivalent to an approximately 3.3 percent change in the 
consumption of bottom earners. 

B. Solution Method 

Our model have two feature that advise against the application of conventional 
perturbation methods. The first be the presence of default, which implies large 
discrete jump in state variables. The second be the fact that the stochastic process 
for income share z t be random walk, which in our simulation implies that bottom 
earners’ debt-to-income ratio permanently drift far away from it original steady 
state. We therefore use a global solution technique that adapts the time-iterative pol- 
icy function algorithm described by Coleman (1991). The computational procedure 
be detailed in the online Appendix.25 

IV. Results 

Figures 7–13 present simulation result that first explore the property of the 
model and then it ability to match the behavior of key historic time series that per- 
tain to the inequality-leverage-crises nexus.

A. Default Regions 

In our model, due to random utility costs, the state space be divide into region 
with a continuum of probability of default. Figure 7 contains a visual represen- 
tation that divide the state space into region whose boundary represent default 
probability that increase in equal increment of two percentage points. Each sub- 
plot show the debt-to-income ratio26 on the horizontal axis and output on the ver- 
tical axis. The effect of variation in the third state variable, the top output share, be 
illustrate by show two separate subplots, correspond to the 1983 and 2008 
top output shares. 

We observe that high debt level imply a high crisis probability, by increas- 
ing the benefit of default without affect the costs. Over the historically 
observe range of debt levels, the imply crisis probability range from 2.2 percent 
to 5.1 percent. As be standard in this class of models, default be more likely to occur 
when output be low, because at such time the insurance benefit of default be high 
while the output cost of default be low. Small drop in income start to have a sig- 
nificantly large effect on default probability a we move from region of low debt 
to region of very high debt. For the same reason a for low output, high top 
output share also lead to high crisis probabilities. But their direct effect, beyond 
the effect that operates through high debt accumulation, be very modest. 

B. Impulse Responses 

Figure 8 show a one standard deviation positive shock to aggregate output y t . This 
shock allows both top earner and bottom earner to increase their consumption, so 

26 We show the debt-to-income ratio rather than the state variable debt because the former be a key variable in 
our model. Its unit be therefore more intuitive and easy to interpret.

that the equilibrium loan interest rate drop by around 85 basis point on impact, with 
a subsequent increase back to it long-run value that mirror the gradual decrease 
in output. The drop in the interest rate represent an additional income gain for bot- 
tom earner relative to top earners, so that the top 5 percent income share fall by 
around 0.35 percentage points. Bottom earner smooth their income gain over time 
by decrease their debt-to-income ratio by around 0.8 percentage point on impact, 
while still increase their consumption by more than twice a much a top earners. 

Figure 9 show a one standard deviation permanent shock to the output share z t . 
The top 5 percent income share τ t immediately increase by 0.8 percentage points, 
accompany by a downward jump of 0.5 percent in bottom earners’ consump- 
tion and an upward jump of 1.9 percent in top earners’ consumption. The long- 
run increase in top earners’ consumption be even larger, because they initially limit 
their additional consumption in order to accumulate additional financial wealth. 
The process of debt accumulation take several decades, with bottom earners’ 
debt-to-income ratio increase by around 7 percentage point in the very long run, 
accompany by an increase in crisis probability of 0.13 percentage points. The real 
interest rate fall on impact by 9 basis points, due to the increase in credit supply 
from top earner that initially limit the drop in consumption of bottom earners. The 
top 5 percent income share τ t , because it include not only the output share z t but 
also the interest earnings on increase financial wealth, increase in the long run 
by approximately another 0.1 percentage points, and top (bottom) earners’ long-run 
increase (decrease) in consumption be correspondingly larger. We note that the one 
standard deviation income distribution shock in Figure 9 be small compare to what 
occur over the period 1983–2008. 

Figure 10 show the impulse response for a crisis shock. Bottom earner default 
on 10 percent of their loans, but they also experience a 4 percent loss in income due 
to the output cost of default, which be suffer exclusively by this group of agents. 
As a result their debt-to-income ratio only drop by around 3.9 percentage points.

The impact effect on the real economy be a 3.2 percent loss in GDP, follow by a 
V-shaped recovery. The real interest rate mirror development in output, with an 
initial increase of 2.4 percentage point follow by a return to the original interest 
rate level after about a decade. Consumption of top earner and bottom earner 
follow an almost identical profile after the crisis. Top earner suffer a loss on their 
financial wealth, but this be more than compensate by the temporary increase in 
the real interest rate, so that the top 5 percent income share increase by around 
1.2 percentage point on impact. Top earner lend after the crisis, in order to return 
their financial wealth to the desire level. The counterpart of this be reborrowing by

to it original level after about one decade. 

C. Baseline Scenario 

Figure 11 show the central simulation of the paper. The variable show be the 
same, and be show in the same units, a in the impulse response in Figures 8–10. 
The horizontal axis represent time, with the simulation start in 1983 and end 
in 2030. The circular marker represent US data, while the line represent model 
simulations. The data for GDP and for the top 5 percent income share be use a 
force process that pin down the realization of the shock ϵ y, t and ϵ z, t between 
1983 and 2008. Post-2008 data for GDP and the top 5 percent income share be 
show but be not use a force processes. Because this be an endowment econ- 
omy, interest rate fluctuation mirror output fluctuations. We assume that a crisis 
shock hit in 2009. The crisis event in 2009 is, a discuss above, characterize by 
output loss that be somewhat low than observe during the Great Recession. 
Starting in 2009, the model be simulated assume a random sequence of utility 
cost shocks, but no further nonzero realization of output or output share shocks. 
Because the precede shock imply further increase in debt after 2009, this 

27 A model with borrowing constraint would limit reborrowing. However, data from the crisis period show that, 
while the crisis stop mortgage debt from increase further, unsecured debt kept increasing.

mean that future endogenous crisis remain a possibility, and in fact become increas- 
ingly likely. 

The key force variable be the increase in the top 5 percent income share from 
21.8 percent in 1983 to 33.8 percent in 2008. In the baseline calibration, the mar- 
ginal propensity to save of top earner be equal to 0.397. Therefore, top earner save 
a sizable share of their additional income in order to acquire additional financial 
wealth, in other word to lend to bottom earners. Bottom earners’ debt-to-income 
ratio therefore increase from 62.3 percent in 1983 to 131.9 percent in 2007 and 
138.8 percent in 2008, accompany by an increase in crisis probability from 
2.2 percent in 1983 to 5.1 percent in 2008. In the data, the debt-to-income ratio 
increase from 62.3 percent in 1983 to 147.3 percent in 2007. Potential explanation 
for the 15.4 percentage point 2007 difference between model and data be discuss 
in Section IVD. 

While the initial debt-to-income ratio in the model and in the data be match 
through the calibration of the initial steady state, it post-1983 evolution be not 
target in our calibration. The fact that we nevertheless closely match it, after cal- 
ibrating the preference for wealth specification on the basis of independent micro- 
economic evidence, be therefore a measure of the empirical success for our model. 
By match the increase in debt we also match the increase in crisis probability, 
but this be not an additional independent success of the model, since the default 
mechanism be calibrate so a to replicate the empirical link between leverage and 
crisis probabilities. 

In the baseline scenario, top earner increase their consumption by a cumula- 
tive 50 percent until just prior to the Great Recession, while bottom earner reduce 
their consumption by 10 percent. The simulated top 5 percent consumption share, 
which be show in the same subplot a the top 5 percent income share, also increase 
between 1983 and 2008, but by less than the income share. This be a necessary 
consequence of the fact that top earner be lending, and be therefore maintain 
low consumption level than what their income alone would permit. There be an 
ongoing debate in the empirical literature about the relative evolution of consump- 
tion inequality and income inequality.28 The result of this literature be however not 
directly comparable to our results, because it have so far not produce an empirical 
estimate of the top 5 percent consumption share that would correspond to our model 
simulations. 

For the future, the model predicts a further increase of the income share of top 
earners, not because of further increase in their output share z t but rather because of 
further increase in debt and associate interest charges. Bottom earners’ simulated 
debt-to-income ratio increase from around 140 percent to around 180 percent over 
the post-crisis decade, accompany by an increase in crisis probability from around 
5 percent to around 8 percent. Under the random sequence of utility cost shock 
use in our simulation, the model generates one subsequent crisis in 2028. 

28 Krueger and Perri (2006) argue that consumption inequality increase by much less than income inequality 
between 1983 and 2003. These result have recently be challenged by Aguiar and Bils (2011), who estimate that 
the increase in consumption and income inequality mirror each other much more closely. Attanasio, Hurst, and 
Pistaferri (2012) confirm the result of Aguiar and Bils (2011). By contrast, Meyer and Sullivan (2013) find that the 
rise in income inequality have be more pronounce than the rise in consumption inequality.

MPS = 0.397 (φ = 0.050, η = 1.08) 
MPS = 0.397 (φ = 0.080, η = 0.96) 

The effect of the crisis on bottom earners’ debt-to-income ratio in the model be 
modest, it drop by around four percentage point on impact but then immediately 
resume it upward trajectory. The reason be the continue upward trend in top 
earners’ financial wealth accumulation, a a result of previous favorable shock to 
their income share. 

D. Empirical Performance of the Model 

The crucial implication of the MPS-based calibration be that the 1983–2007 evo- 
lution of the debt-to-income ratio of bottom earner can be use to evaluate the 
quantitative performance of the model.29 The left subplot of Figure 12 illustrates 
that this performance depends on the calibrate value of the MPS. For this figure, 
we calibrate the model base on the baseline MPS of 0.397, the upper bound MPS 
of 0.505, and the low bound MPS of 0.248. Our baseline simulation be reproduce 
a the solid line, the data a circular markers, and low and upper bound MPS a 
dash-dotted and dot lines. Differences in MPS be calibrate by hold φ at it 
baseline value of 0.05 and vary η , with a high η (higher MPS) imply that top 
earner allocate a large share of their additional income to financial wealth accumu- 
lation. The interest rate adjusts to ensure that this high credit supply be take up by 
bottom earners, who end up with a high debt-to-income ratio. 

The baseline model track the overall trend in the data well. By 2007, the model 
predicts a debt-to-income ratio of 131.9 percent, versus 147.1 percent in the data. The 
upper-bound model slightly over-predicts over the period 1992–1998 but be closer 
to the data toward the end of the period. The lower-bound model under-predicts 
throughout. However, even this calibration predicts a 1983–2007 increase in bottom 
earners’ debt-to-income ratio of around 47 percentage points, which equal well over 
one-half of the increase observe in the data. Overall, the baseline model explains 
close to 100 percent of the increase in the debt-to-income ratio of bottom earner over 
the first 15 year of the period of interest (1983–1998), and approximately 70 percent 
over the last 9 year (1998–2007). This suggests a possible role for complementary 
explanation over the latter period. As discuss in Section IF, the global save glut 

29 We focus on this period because the model be simulated over 1983–2008 for a series of inequality and output 
shock that exactly reproduce the data. 2007 be the last pre-crisis data point in SCF. 

Figure 12. Sensitivity Analysis 



1242 THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW MARCH 2015 

can explain around one-quarter of the increase in US household debt over this period. 
This be roughly the share of household debt that be left unexplained by our model. 

The right subplot of Figure 12 show that, once a MPS have be chosen (in this 
case the baseline MPS of 0.397), difference in the combination of φ and η that 
give rise to that MPS have only a very small effect on the model’s predictions. We 
note that the combination of φ and η show in Figure 12 differ by a very substan- 
tial margin, with the upper bound φ 60 percent large than the baseline (0.08), and 
the low bound φ 60 percent small than the baseline (0.031). Yet the imply 
difference in the behavior of the debt-to-income ratio be very small. What matter 
be therefore primarily the MPS itself, for which we have produce solid empirical 
evidence in the online Appendix. 

E. Pure Consumption Smoothing and Shock Persistence 

In our baseline scenario, the increase in bottom earners’ debt be due to increase 
credit supply from top earners. The reason be that shock to the income distribution 
be permanent, so that neither bottom earner nor top earner have an incentive to 
smooth consumption, while top earner have a strong incentive to accumulate wealth. 

The permanence of shock to the income distribution be consistent with the evolu- 
tion of income inequality between 1983 and 2008, and with the evidence of Kopczuk, 
Saez, and Song (2010) and DeBacker et al. (2013). It be nevertheless interest to 
ask what quantitative role pure consumption smoothing, in the complete absence of 
a wealth accumulation motive, could play if shock to the income distribution be 
perceive to be more temporary. In that case top earner would have no motive to 
accumulate wealth for it own sake, while both bottom and top earner would have a 
strong incentive to borrow and lend to smooth consumption. In other words, in such 
a world there would be an increase role for credit demand relative to credit supply. 

For this exercise we perform another variation of our baseline simulation in 
which wealth do not enter the utility function of top earner ( φ = 0 ), both 
income group have the same discount factor ( β b = β τ = 1. 04 −1 ), and shock to 
the inequality process be highly persistent but not permanent. The initial value of 
all endogenous variable be identical to the baseline case. The result be show in 
Figure 13, under the assumption ρ z = 0.98 . 

We observe that for this particular persistence parameter the effect of consump- 
tion smooth be similar to those of preference for wealth in the baseline, with 
both debt and crisis probability increase by similar magnitude prior to the crisis. 
But this would change dramatically for a less persistent z t . In that case the consump- 
tion smooth motive would become very much stronger, because it would imply 
that bottom earner continually expect their income to revert to a much high level 
over a fairly short period. The cumulative effect of this perception, which would 
represent large and one-sided forecast error over the 1983–2008 period, would be 
a much large build-up of debt. 

V. Conclusions 

This paper have present stylize facts, a theoretical framework, and an empiri- 
cal methodology for calibrate it, that explore the nexus between increase in the 



1243 Kumhof et al.: InequalIty, leverage, and CrIsesvol. 105 no. 3 

income share of high-income households, high debt leverage among poor and 
middle-income households, and vulnerability to financial crises. We provide evidence 
which suggests that this nexus be prominent prior to both the Great Depression 
and the Great Recession. In our baseline, theoretical model high debt leverage 
arises a a result of permanent positive shock to the income share of high-income 
household who, due to preference for wealth, lend part of their additional income 
back to poor and middle-income households. This increase in credit supply allows 
poor and middle-income household to sustain high consumption levels. But the 
result be that loan keep growing, and therefore so do the probability of a crisis 
that, when it happens, be accompany by a contraction in the real economy. This 
contraction, together with a desire of high-income household to accumulate further 
wealth while their income share remains high, implies that the effect of a crisis on 
debt leverage and therefore on the probability of further crisis be quite limited. 

It be possible to use our framework to simulate alternative scenario for the future 
of the US economy. One alternative, study in Kumhof, Rancière, and Winant 
(2013), look at the consequence of a reversal of the post-1983 increase in income 
inequality over a period of ten years. We find that this would lead to a sustain 
reduction in leverage that would significantly reduce the probability of further crises.
