The Causes of Economic Inequality 

January 21st, 2015 by Kara in Case Studies 





The first in SPI’s series on Inequality 



By: May Leung 



Difference in income play a role 

One important factor contribute to different level of wealth be 
people be paid different wages. There be several reason why some 
people be paid million while some merely earn minimum wage. 

(i) Wages be determine by labor market 

Wages be a function of the market price of skill require for a job 
[1]. In a free market, the “market price of a skill” be determine by 
market demand and market supply. The market price of a skill, and hence 
the wage for the job that require the skill, be low if a large number 
of worker (high supply) be willing and able to offer that skill but 
only a few employer need it (low demand). On the contrary, when there 
be low supply but high demand for a skill, the wage for a job require 
the skill go up. 

(ii) Education affect wage 

Individuals with different level of education often earn different 
wage [2]. This be probably related to reason one: the level of 
education be often proportional to the level of skill. With a high 
level of education, a person often have more advanced skill that few 
worker be able to offer, justify a high wage. 

The impact of education on economic inequality be still profound in 
developed country and city [3]. Although there be usually policy 
of free education in developed nations, level of education receive by 
each individual still differ, not because of financial ability but 
innate quality like intelligence, drive and personal ability. For 
example, in Hong Kong, 12 year of free education be provide for each 
citizen, not cover tertiary education, offer only when student 
receive certain result on public exams. 

Moreover, receive the same level of education do not mean 
receive education of the same quality. This account for the 
difference in ability and hence wage for individual all receiving, 
for example, 12 year of education. Therefore, it seem no matter how 
good the social welfare policy of a country be at prevent denial of 
education due to financial difficulties, difference in education, in 
term of level and quality, still play a prominent role in economic 
inequality. 

(iii) Growth in technology widens income gap 

Growth in technology arguably render joblessness at all skill level 
[3]. For unskilled workers, computer and machinery perform a lot of 
task these worker use to be do. In many jobs, such a packaging and 
manufacturing, machinery work even more effectively and efficiently. 
Hence, job involve repetitive task have largely be eliminated. 
Skilled worker be not immune to the nightmare of lose jobs. The 
rapid development in artificial intelligence may ultimately allow 
computer and robot to perform knowledge-based job [3]. 

The impact of increase unemployment be stagnant or decrease wage 
for most workers, a there be a low demand for but high supply of 
labor. A small portion of society, usually the owner of capital, 
control an ever-increasing fraction of the economy [3]. The income gap 
between worker who earn by their skill and owner who earn by 
invest in capital have widened. 

Although both skilled and unskilled worker be adversely affected by 
the technological advance, it seem unskilled worker be subject to 
bad outcome [3]. This be because the labor market may still need 
skilled worker to use computer and operate the advanced machines. The 
rightward shift in the demand for skilled labor creates an increase in 
the relative wage of the skilled compare to the unskilled workers. 
Hence, the income gap among worker also have widened. 

(iv) Gender do matter 

In many countries, there be a gender income gap in the labor market 
[3]. For example, in America, the median full-time salary for woman be 
77 percent of that of men [4]. However, woman who work part time make 
more on average than men who work part-time [4]. Additionally, among 
people who never marry or have children, woman make more than men [4]. 

It may be difficult to justify such differences. According to a U.S. 
Census report [4], the wage gap be not fully explain even after 
accounting for key factor that affect earnings, such a discrimination 
and the tendency of woman to consider factor other than pay when 
look for work. The only thing we know for sure be that gender do 
contribute to a difference in wage in society and hence economic 
inequality. 

(v) Personal factor 

It be generally believe that innate ability play a part in 
determine the wealth of an individual. Hence, individual possess 
different set of ability may have different level of wealth, lead 
to economic inequality [3]. For example, more determine individual 
may keep improve themselves and strive for good achievements, 
which justifies a high wage. 

Another example be intelligence [3]. A lot of people believe that 
smarter people tend to have high income and hence more wealth. This be 
debatable. In the book IQ and the Wealth of Nations, Dr. 
Richard Lynn opine that there be a correlation of 0.82 between average 
IQ and GDP. However, Stephen Jay Gould, in the book The Mismeasure of Man, criticize it for employ the wrong method of evaluation. 

In addition to innate abilities, diversity of preferences, within a 
society or among different societies, contributes to the difference in 
wealth [3]. When it come to work harder or have fun, equally 
capable individual may have totally different priorities, result in a 
difference in their incomes. Their save pattern may also differ, 
lead to different level of accumulate wealth. 

Inequality be a vicious cycle 

“The rich get richer, the poor get poorer” be not just a cliche. The 
concept behind it be a theoretical process call “wealth 
concentration.” Under certain conditions, newly create wealth be 
concentrate in the possession of already-wealthy individual [5]. The 
reason be simple: People who already hold wealth have the resource to 
invest or to leverage the accumulation of wealth, which creates new 
wealth. The process of wealth concentration arguably make economic 
inequality a vicious cycle. 

The effect of wealth concentration may extend to future generation 
[3]. Children born in a rich family have an economic advantage, because 
of wealth inherit and possibly education, which may increase their 
chance of earn a high income than their peers. These advantage 
create another round of the vicious cycle. 

The French economist Thomas Picketty recently publish a book, Capital in the Twenty-First Century 
[6]. Picketty’s thesis support the previous proposition. It be a 
700-page book on the topic of income inequality. The rich collection of 
statistic in the book show that in almost every country (examined by 
Picketty), the wealth gap have widen since 1980. Picketty hold the 
view that inequality will remain a long a the aforementioned wealth 
concentration process persists through generations. However, Picketty 
argue that global inequality have probably decreased, a there have be 
rapid growth in Asia partly at the expense of lower-to-middle income 
earner in developed countries. The statistic show economic inequality 
be not just the top 10 percent of the population be richer than the 
bottom 20 percent. Rather, it be “1 percent versus the remain 99 
percent,” i.e. the top 1 percent of the population have the vast majority 
of wealth in the economy and control of financial markets. 





Chart 1 



There be both support and criticism for Picketty’s argument 
inequality have be a persistent phenomenon. World Bank researcher 
Christoph Lakner and Milanovic Branko agree that inequality in rich 
country have be worsen significantly since 1988 [7]. In Oxfam’s 
Working Paper [8], statistic show that in 24 of 26 country 
researched, indeed the richest 1 percent increase their share of income 
between 1980 and 2012 (see Chart 1). The share of national wealth own 
by the wealthy 1 percent in the U.S. greatly increase after 2008 
(see Chart 2), meaning the top 1 percent have capture 95 percent of 
post-financial crisis growth since 2009, whereas the low-income 
population become poorer. These statistic further support the 
proposition in Picketty’s book that inequality be persistent and be 
get worse. 







Chart 2 



Critics of Picketty’s book, such a Michael Hudson, a 
distinguish research professor of economics at the University of 
Missouri, mainly focus on the solution propose by Picketty [9]. Hudson 
even supplement Picketty’s theory in an interview by say that 
another reason for the persistence of economic inequality be the top 1 
percent exploit the remain population and make the latter “in 
debt” to the former. 

It should be noted, however, some sociologists, such a Charles 
Murray, disagree with the proposition that wealth accumulation be a main 
cause of economic inequality. They argue factor like innate ability 
instead of a good start point be the most important determine 
factor in the wealth accumulate by a person. 

From a broader perspective: Economic policy and structure 

(i) Economic neoliberalism 

Economic neoliberalism be define a a form of economic liberalism 
that support “free market and minimum barrier to the flow of goods, 
service and capital” [10]. There be four pillar to this approach, 
namely capital account liberalization, trade liberalization, domestic 
liberalization, and privatization [10]. The economy be liberalize in 
different ways. Countries like the U.S. adopt economic policy 
promote neoliberalism (called the “Anglo-American model”) [11]. 

Advocates of neoliberalism often argue their ideology be helpful in 
reduce absolute inequality [12]. Some opine neoliberalism itself do 
not directly generate inequality. Rather, it promotes a free system, 
which aim to foster economic prosperity. It be the operation of 
neoliberalism, not the theory itself, which contributes to inequality 
[13]. Yet, numerous scholar argue that economic neoliberalism be itself 
a cause of inequality. While it may somehow reduce absolute inequality, 
it increase relative inequality [12]. According to the economist 
Howell and Diallo (2007), neoliberal policy in the U.S. lead to low 
wage (30 percent of the working-age population) and inadequate 
employment (60 percent of the working-age population) [14]. The wealth 
discrepancy between the rich and the poor, usually the work class, 
hence widens. 

John Schmitt and Ben Zipperer (2006) of the CEPR hold similar views. 
They claim that economic liberalism, where reduction of business 
regulation and decline of union membership be inevitable, be a cause 
of economic inequality [15]. In their analysis of the effect of 
Anglo-American neoliberal policies, their conclusion be that “the U.S. 
economic and social model be associate with substantial level of 
social exclusion, include high level of income inequality. At the 
same time, the available evidence provide little support for the view 
that U.S.-style labor-market flexibility dramatically improves 
labor-market outcomes” [15]. So it seem that economic neoliberalism be 
worsen rather than improve the problem of income inequality. 

(ii) Globalization 

The great umbrella of globalization, a product of trade 
liberalization, now cover every corner in the world. The extent of it 
effect on economic inequality be debatable. Trade economist Paul 
Krugman support the proposition that globalization be an important 
cause of inequality. Because of increase trade among countries, 
worker in richer country face a high level of competition from 
those in poorer countries, especially in job that do not require a high 
level of skill. Wages for low-skilled work in richer country be 
decline a a result. 

Other expert think the effect of globalization on inequality be 
minor when compare to other causes. For example, Lawrence Katz 
estimate globalization account only for 5 to 15 percent of rise 
inequality. Robert Lawrence, an economist, dispute any such 
relationship. Instead, technological innovation cause low-skilled job 
to be replace by machinery in wealthy nations. Rich nation no longer 
have significant number of low-skilled worker that can be affected by 
competition from poor nations. 

(iii) A Kuznets curve – Phases of development 

Nobel laureate economist Simon Kuznets argues that a an economy 
develops, a natural cycle of economic inequality occurs, represent by 
an invert U-shape curve call the Kuznets curve (see Fig. 1). From 
the curve, we observe a the economy develops, inequality first 
increases, then decrease after a certain level of average income be 
attained. In early development, investment opportunity for those who 
already have wealth multiply so owner of capital can accumulate wealth. 
At the same time, there be an influx of cheap rural labor to the 
develop cities, which drive down wages. Therefore, in early 
development, inequality increases. 





Figure 1: Kuznets Curve 



When the economy becomes mature, there be democratization and various 
redistribution mechanism such a social welfare programs. According to 
Kuznets, country move back to a low level of inequality. 

As with any theory, there be criticisms. First, the data set use be 
say to be prejudiced. Many of the middle-income country use in 
Kuznets’ data set be in Latin America, a region with a historically 
high level of inequality. According to Deininger and Squire (1998), the 
shape of Kuznets curve tends to disappear after this variable be 
controlled. Moreover, Kuznets demonstrates his theory by use 
cross-sectional data. But through use data from large panel of 
countries, Fields (2001) demonstrates that hypothesis put forward by 
Kuznets be flawed. 

The second criticism be the East Asian miracle (EAM). Basically, EAM 
describes the rapid economic growth between 1965 and 1990 of eight East 
Asian country – South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore (also know 
a Four Asian Tigers), Japan, Indonesia, Thailand, and Malaysia. EAM 
deviate from the Kuznets curve in the sense that the early development 
economy, particularly manufacturing and exports, grow powerfully, while 
the population living in absolute poverty decreased, i.e. inequality 
“surprisingly” decreased. 

Many study have be conduct to identify reason why the EAM 
successfully distributes the benefit of rapid economic growth broadly 
among the population, prevent an initial increase in inequality. 
Joseph Stiglitz propose EAM occur through the immediate reinvestment 
of initial benefit into land reform increase the rural productivity 
and income, a well a universal education and government policy such 
a increase wage and limit price increase in commodities. Hence, 
there be no significant initial increase in inequality. Average 
citizen could then have more financial ability to consume and invest in 
the economy, further economic growth. Simply put, what Stiglitz 
suggests be high economic growth provide resource to promote equality, 
which then provide positive feedback for growth. This be contrary to 
the Kuznets curve theory, which insists that economic growth inevitably 
creates inequality, which then promotes overall growth. 

Inequality be not doom to happen when a country start developing. 
If there be sufficient government policy and economic planning, a 
high growth rate can coexist with low economic inequality at any stage 
of development. 

A free-market society without statutory protection on wage may have 
unfairly low wage for certain type of work, usually those involve 
repetitive task and low skills, which widens the wealth gap. Likewise, 
economic neoliberalism, which promotes minimum trade barriers, may also 
lead to labor exploitation in the form of unfairly low wages. Looking at 
EAM in a reverse way, if there have not be policy and regulation to 
distribute the benefit of rapid economic growth broadly among the 
population, those eight country might have have totally different fate 
– economic inequality would have increase in their early stage of 
development.

One Response to “The Causes of Economic Inequality” 





Tina 
August 5, 2015 at 11:17 pm 





Hi Angela, 

Thanks for put out an interest article about economic inequality. 
I just want to highlight the fact (often misinterpreted) be that 
Kuznet’s curve be NOT predictive but DESCRIPTIVE of a certain phase in 
history. Kuznet go on to lament it use a a tool to predict (and 
often excuse) inequality a country developed. 

I just thought I’d shrae this with you. 

Thanks
