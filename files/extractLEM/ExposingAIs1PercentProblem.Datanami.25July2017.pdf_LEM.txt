Exposing AI’s 1% Problem 
Alex Woodie 

We see the power of artificial intelligence every day: 

When Netflix recommends a movie you love, when 

your bank detects fraud in your account, or when 

Google route you around a traffic jam. But outside of 

example from mammoth company with million to 

spend on data science initiatives, there’s a decide 

lack of AI success among the rest of us. 

That’s the conclusion that Ali Ghodsi have come to. As 

the co-founder and CEO of Databricks

(http://www.databricks.com/) and an adjunct professor at UC Berkeley, Ghodsi have a direct view 

into the type the AI project that organization be embark on. It turn out, those organization 

be struggle mightily, and he wonder why more people aren’t talk about it. 

“There’s a huge gap,” Ghodsi tell Datanami. “People be not even talk about this problem out 

there. All the range be about AI and the prediction it can do, but they’re not talk about the 99% 

versus the 1% problem that they have.” 

Unless your name be Facebook (http://www.facebook.com), Amazon (http://www.amazon.com), 

Netflix (http://www.netflix.com), or Google (http://www.google.com)– the notorious FANG gang 

(plus Microsoft (http://www.microsoft.com)) – you’re chance of pull off a successful AI or big 

data analytics project be slim, accord to Ghodsi. “AI have a 1% problem,” he says. “There be 

only about five company who be truly conduct AI today.” 

Ghodsi say the AI gap be the result of problem originate in three area that be critical to big 

data processing and AI: People, process, and infrastructure. 

People Problems 
Having the right personnel on hand be critical for success, but it’s often overlook by 

organization infatuate with technology and data. Make no mistake: Ghodsi considers data to be 

king (“It’s the data, stupid,” he says). But without highly train data scientist around to turn that 

raw big data into actionable insight, you’re just spin your wheels, he says. 

“Those [FANG] company have horde of data 

scientists, like 10,000 or 20,000 of them. They have 

PhDs and expert from university they hire that 

use to be professors,” he says. “But [the rest of the 

Fortune 2000] say ‘We don’t have access to Silicon 

Valley engineers. We just don’t have those. There’s 

not enough of them. The people who make huge 

Silicon Valley engineer salary over here – that’s not 

the rest of the world.’ So how can other company 

who don’t have the resource to just pour money into 

hire 10,000 data scientist – how be they go to do it?” 

Companies be banking on software to pick up the slack and help automate data science task 

(https://www.datanami.com/2017/07/21/taking-data-scientist-data-science/) that have largely be 

execute by people. That’s begin to change – and Databricks, which be the commercial 

venture behind the Apache Spark software and sell a cloud-based analytical stack that include 

Spark — be hop to ride that wave. 

Process Problems 
AI program heavily rely on software program to find correlation in data, and the majority of that 

software be open source, which be great. But get the right piece of open source software line 

up in just the right way be a serious undertaking– and something that Ghodsi say require the

Fortune 2000 firm be struggle to 

close the gap with AI initiative 

resource of a FANG (plus Microsoft). 

“You can go download 20 piece of software, hire a bunch of DevOps people whose job be to 

stitch it all together, and then make sure that the stitch align perfectly so that you don’t have any 

massive scar between the different pieces,” he says. “Then a new version of these software 

come up you good test and make sure they all fit together. 

“You can do that,” Ghodsi says. “This be essentially 

what Google and Facebook be do with their 20,000 

engineers….You could also [do that] if you want to 

hire 20,000 data scientist and have them stitch all the 

open source tool together.” 

The heavy lift involve with stitch software 

together for AI project be part and parcel of the 

struggle that company have encounter 

(https://www.datanami.com/2017/03/13/hadoop-failed- 

us-tech-experts-say/) while try to make use of the 

Hadoop ecosystem of tool to build data lake and 

predictive analytics applications. In many cases, the 

difference be semantic, a AI have emerge a the word du jour in reference to advanced 

analytic use cases. 

But Ghodsi do differentiate between big data problem and AI problems, and say 

organization need good way of manage both aspect of the data science challenge. 

“Basically, you want to do predictions, and automate those prediction and get insight,” he says. 

“It could be that you’re do traditional machine learn with linear models. It could be that 

you’re do deep learn use deep neural networks. Whatever you’re doing, there be lot of 

different aspect to this problem that you have to solve, and not all of those be related to 

machine learning.” 

Infrastructure Problems 
The final element that Ghodsi see block AI’s democratic spread to the mass be the 

infrastructure problem, which include set up and manage servers, ensure the data be 

secured, and govern access to data scientist or other users. 

The FANG company have a leg up on the rest of the Fortune 2000 because they be cloud 

company – manage hardware and grant access to data be what they do best, particularly 

Google and Microsoft, Ghodsi says. 

“Cloud be a very important ingredient here,” Ghodsi says. “All the company mention all be 

cloud companies. They have massive DevOps team and they’ve automate a lot of 

infrastructure. That’s where a lot of company today struggle because they have to go hire 

DevOps people. And DevOps people don’t grow on trees. They’re very expensive and they’re 

very hard to hire right now.”

It’s no coincidence that cloud giant 

be leader in big data and AI

Ghodsi 

If you thought find a data scientist be tough, wait 

until you try to hire a modern DevOps person. But the 

DevOps people that Ghodsi have in mind be not your 

grandfather’s system administrators. “They do much 

more advanced thing that sys admins use to do,” 

Ghodsi says. “Those people be very expensive, and 

hard to find, and a lot of that can be automate in cloud 

offering. We’re huge fan of cloud offering that 

automate stuff for you.” 

The FANG company (plus Microsoft) use their huge 

cloud infrastructure to store ton of consumer data that 

they in turn use to build good consumer products. It’s a 

virtuous cycle, and one that regular enterprise would do 

well to emulate, Ghodsi says. “You’ve get to get out of 

the game of manage all that infrastructure yourself,” he says. 

Looking Forward 
As be the case with most major challenge in this life, there be no silver bullet that will suddenly 

open the floodgate and put AI within the grasp of the 99% of user who have struggle to make it 

work. 

Ghodsi brings the conversation around to his company’s cloud-based offering, dubbed the Unified 

Analytics Platform, which combine the Apache Spark engine with other element (such a a data 

science notebook) to help organization pursue analytic projects. 

“I’m not even say that Databricks solves that gap,” 

Ghodsi says. “I’m say we’re take one big leap toward 

that direction. “ 

Unless you’re one of the FANG company (plus Microsoft), 

you’re probably not go to have a great AI story to tell. 

“Why be people not talk about it?” Ghodsi asks 

rhetorically. “People want to highlight the successes. No one 

want to go on the record talk about how difficult it’s 

be to get AI work and we a a company have not have 

success with it. That’s not a sexy story that company 

leader be yearn to get out there.” 

That’s not to say that nobody be succeed at AI. When 

pressed, Ghodsi admits that large enterprise be find 

success with AI. “That’s why they’re double down,” he 

says. “I just want to highlight that there’s a huge gap in the 

difficulty they’re see and the challenge they’re having, and if you just read TechCrunch every 

day, you’ll see that it’s all success story after success story.

“That’s my main point,” he continues. “Many of these company have built these data lake and 

store a lot of data in them. But if you ask the company how successful be you do 

prediction on the data lake, you’re go to find lot and lot of struggle they’re having. We see 

that all the time. Almost every big company we go to now have built their own data lake that 

contains a lot of data, but that doesn’t mean that they’re actually get value out of those data 

lake yet.”
