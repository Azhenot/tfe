Detecting pancreatic cancer without any physician to read and assist the final patient... 
Is this a good idea? 

Finally, it's more a jaundice detector than a real pancreatic cancer discriminator!!! Not exactly the same story, to say the least!!!

Very cool! Could this technology help detect other condition that cause jaundice and high bilirubin levels, like 
liver failure? Or be it only really useful for pancreatic cancer give the lag time in detect the disease?

Great, but why can't I find the app? It doesn't show up in store. I have an Oculus Gear VR that this should 
work with and a family member that die from Pancreatic cancer yet here I sit unavle to try this test, probably 
because someone somewhere be either afraid of be sued, miss out on a buck, or be sue for 

keep someone else from miss out on a buck...
