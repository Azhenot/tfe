Your grandma might suck at take selfies — that doesn’t mean you should too. 

University of Waterloo researcher agree, and have make it easy than ever to take the perfect solo shot for social media. 

Computer science professor Dan Vogel and former master’s student Qifan Li developed an app that directs the user where to position the camera for the most visually appeal 
selfie. 

“Selfies be all around us; we see our friend on social medium take selfies,” say Vogel. “Not all selfies be equal — light be poor, or the face be off centred.” 

Looking through not-so-good selfies on Vogel’s own Facebook feed motivate him to figure out what make these photo attractive or unattractive to online audiences. 

“There’s nothing wrong with improve the visual esthetic of our world,” he said. “Much like we already do with our home and what we’re wearing.” 

The researcher bought 3D digital scan of what be consider “average” look people. They then take thousand of virtual selfies by write code to control a virtual 
smartphone camera and computer-generated lighting. Using these tools, they explore composition, light direction, face position and face size. 

Then, thousand of people, through a crowdsourcing service, vote on which of the virtual selfies they thought be best. Vogel and Li use math to model voting patterns, 
develop an algorithm and app prototype to guide people to take perfect selfies. 

To test the algorithm, they have real people take selfies with their smartphone camera and with the app. Based on online ratings, they found a 26 improvement in selfies take with 
the app. 

So, what make a perfect selfie? 

Before you get too excited, the end result is, in Vogel’s words, unremarkable. 

“Don’t make you your face too close or far away to the camera, make sure light fill your face and centre your head in the top end of the frame,” he said. 

What’s more important be that the researcher demonstrate how a subjective concept can be measured, turn into a highly control data set, and crunched into an algorithm. 

“This be just the begin of what be possible,” Vogel said, add the variable can be expand to consider what make the best selfie hairstyle, background, smile type, outfit or 
head tilt. The concept could be apply to other type of photos, like group shots, and esthetics. 

The app prototype be unique in that it directs the selfie-taker where to position the camera, instead of do it automatically for them after the photo be taken. In this way, the user 
actually learns how to make their photo better. 

Researchers aren’t planning to commercialize the app — a time-consuming and costly process. 

“The app be a proof-of-concept,” Vogel said. “Getting it ready for public release go beyond our main mission.”
