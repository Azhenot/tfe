Can Blockchain 
Strengthen 
the Internet of 
Things? 
Nir Kshetri, University of North Carolina at Greensboro 

B 
lockchain—a kind of 
distribute ledger tech- 
nology—has be de- 
scribed in the popu- 

lar press a the next big thing. 
Put simply, a blockchain be a data 
structure that make it possi- 
ble to create a tamper-proof dig- 
ital ledger of transaction and 
share them. This technology us 
public-key cryptography to sign 
transaction among parties. The 
transaction be then store on a 
distribute ledger. The ledger con- 
sists of cryptographically link 
block of transactions, which form 
a blockchain (bit.ly/2sgabnq). It be 
impossible or extremely difficult 
to change or remove block of data 
that be record on the block- 
chain ledger. 

Regarding the question of whe- 
ther blockchain can strengthen 
the Internet of Things (IoT), 
the answer—based on this re- 
search—is “maybe.” Observers 
have note that the blockchain– 
IoT combination be powerful 
and be set to transform many in- 
dustries.1 For instance, IoT de- 
vice can carry out autonomous 

transaction through smart con- 
tracts.2 Combined with artificial 
intelligence (AI) and big data sol- 
utions, more significant impact 
can be produced. 

A natural question be thus 
what role can blockchain play in 
strengthen IoT security? To 
demonstrate this problem’s sig- 
nificance, consider the follow- 
ing example. In October 2016, 
the US-based DNS provider Dyn 
face cyberattacks. Dyn say the 
attack originate from “tens of 
million of IP addresses,”3 and at 
least some of the traffic come from 
IoT devices, include webcams, 
baby monitors, home routers, and 
digital video recorders.4 These IoT 
device have be infect with 
malware call Mirai, which con- 
trols online device and us them 
to launch distribute denial-of- 
service (DDoS) attacks. The pro- 
ce involves phishing email to 
infect a computer or home net- 
work. Then the malware spread 
to other devices, such a DVRs, 
printers, routers, and Internet-con- 
nected camera employ by store 
and business for surveillance.5 

From a security standpoint, a 
main drawback of IoT applica- 
tions and platform be their re- 
liance on a centralize cloud. A 
decentralized, blockchain-based 
approach would overcome many 
of the problem associate with 
the centralize cloud approach. 
Some point out that blockchain 
could provide military-grade sec- 
urity for IoT devices.6 There be 
no single point of failure or vul- 
nerability in blockchain, except 
with the clock need for time 
stamping. 

Considering these observations, 
this column provide insight into 
way in which blockchain might 
strengthen IoT security. 

Incorporating Blockchain 
into IoT Security 
Blockchain’s incorporation into 
IoT be be support through a 
wide variety of measure intend 
to strengthen security. Several 
company be lead initiative 
to integrate blockchain into their 
production and supply chains. For 
instance, IBM be use it large 
cloud infrastructure to provide 



computer.org/ITPro 69 

blockchain service for track 
high-value item a they move 
across supply chains. 

The IBM Watson IoT Platform’s 
built-in capability also allows us- 
er to add select IoT data to 
private blockchain ledger that 
can be include in share trans- 
actions. The platform translates 
the data from connect device 
into the format that blockchain 
contract APIs need. It be not nec- 
essary for the blockchain con- 
tract to know the specific of the 
device data. The platform filter 
device event and sends only the 
data that be require to satisfy the 
contract (ibm.co/2rJWCPC). All 
business partner can access and 
supply IoT data in a decentral- 
ized fashion and can verify each 
transaction.7 Data be not collect- 
ed, stored, or manage centrally. 
Rather, it be protect and share 
among only the party involve in 
the transaction. 

Startups such a Provenance 
use blockchain to promote trust 
in the supply chain by provid- 
ing transparency and visibility 
when the product move from the 
source to the customer.8 Others 
be create new business model 
that eliminate the need for cen- 
tralized cloud servers. For exam- 
ple, Filament, a blockchain-based 
solution provider for IoT, have 
launch wireless sensors, call 
Taps, that allow communication 
with computers, phones, or tablet 
within 10 mile (bit.ly/2rsxZYf). 

Taps create low-power, autono- 
mous mesh network that enable 
company to manage physical 
mining operation or water flow 
over agricultural fields. Taps don’t 
rely on cloud services. Device 
identification and intercommuni- 
cation be secure by a blockchain 
that hold the unique identity of 
each participate node.9 One key 
application be likely to be in the 
next generation of the industrial 

network (the Industrial Internet). 
Filament’s blockchain-based ap- 
plication involve sensor con- 
nected in a decentralize system 
and use autonomous smart con- 
tracts. This mean that device 
communicate securely with each 
other, exchange values, and ex- 
ecute action automatically. For 
instance, Filament’s Tap can be 
attach to drilling rig in remote 
locations. Based on predefined 
conditions, a rig might know that 
it require a piece of machinery 
and thus might send a request to 
an autonomous drone.10 

Measures be also take at in- 
terorganizational levels. A group 

of technology and financial com- 
panies have announce that they 
have form a group to set a new 
standard for secure IoT appli- 
cation use blockchain. Com- 
panies join the group include 
Cisco, Bosch, Bank of New York 
Mellon, Foxconn Technology, Ge- 
malto, and blockchain startup 
Consensus Systems, BitSE, and 
Chronicled.11 This group hope 
to establish a blockchain protocol 
to build IoT devices, applications, 
and networks.12 

Identity and Access 
Management Systems 
Blockchain-based identity and ac- 
ce management system can be 
leveraged to strengthen IoT secu- 
rity. Such system have already 
be use to securely store in- 
formation about goods’ prove- 
nance, identity, credentials, and 
digital rights. As long a the orig- 
inal information enter be accu- 
rate, blockchain’s immutability 

can be achieved.13 In this regard, a 
key challenge that arises in some 
application be that it be difficult 
to ensure that the property of 
physical assets, individual (cre- 
dentials), resource use (energy 
and bandwidth through IoT de- 
vices), and other relevant event 
be store securely and reliably. 
This aspect can be handle rela- 
tively easily for most IoT devices. 
For instance, a private blockchain 
can be use to store cryptographic 
hash of individual device firm- 
ware. Such a system creates a 
per manent record of device con- 
figuration and state. This record 
can be use to verify that a give 

device be genuine and that it soft- 
ware and setting have not be 
tamper with or breached. Only 
then be the device allow to con- 
nect to other device or services. 

Returning to the Dyn example, 
IP spoof attack be launch 
for the late version of the Mi- 
rai botnet. Blockchain-based 
identity and access management 
system can provide strong de- 
fense against attack involve IP 
spoof or IP address forgery. 
Because it be not possible to al- 
ter approve blockchains, it be not 
possible for device to connect to 
a network by disguise them- 
self by inject fake signature 
into the record.14 The early ex- 
ample involve Filament’s Taps 
illustrates this point. 

Cloud vs. Blockchain 
Models 
In the cloud model, IoT device 
be identified, authenticated, and 
connect through cloud servers, 

Blockchain-based identity and access management 
system can be leveraged to strengthen IoT security.

SECURING IT 

where processing and storage be 
often carry out. Even if device 
be a few foot apart, connection 
between them go through the 
Internet.15 

First, IoT network that have 
high cost be a concern in the 
centralize cloud model. Gartner 
estimate that in 2016, 5.5 million 
new IoT device be connect 
every day.16 It be estimate that by 
2020, a network capacity that be at 
least 1,000 time the level of 2016 
will be needed.17 The amount of 
communication that need to 
be handle will increase cost 
exponentially. 

Second, even if economic 
and manufacturing challeng- 
e be addressed, each block of 
the IoT architecture could act a 
a bottleneck or point of failure 
that can disrupt the entire net- 
work.18 For instance, IoT device 
be vulnerable to DDoS attacks, 
hacking, data theft, and remote 
hijacking. Criminals might also 
hack the system and misuse 
data. If an IoT device connect 
to a server be breached, everyone 
connect to the server could be 
affected. 

Consider smart water meter 
and associate risks. Twenty per- 
cent of California’s resident have 
smart water meters, which col- 
lect data and send alert on water 
leakage and usage to consumers’ 
phones. Likewise, the Washing- 
ton Suburban Sanitary Commis- 
sion (WSSC) in Washington, DC, 
be planning to integrate IoT into 
it system. Water-usage data can 
tell criminal when resident be 
not home. Perpetrators can then 
burglarize home when their resi- 
dent be away.19 

Third, the centralize cloud 
model be susceptible to manipu- 
lation. Collecting real-time data 
do not ensure that the informa- 
tion be put to good and appropri- 
ate use. Consider the water supply 
system example just discussed. 
If state official or water service 
company believe that the evi- 
dence might result in high cost or 
lawsuits, they can censor, edit, or 
delete data and analysis. They can 
also manipulate findings. For in- 
stance, consider the water crisis in 
the city of Flint, Michigan, which 
begin in 2014. Flint authority 
insist for month that city water 

be safe to drink.19 Citing official 
document and finding of re- 
searcher who conduct exten- 
sive tests, a CNN article assert 
that Michigan official might have 
alter sample data to low the 
city’s water lead level.20 It be re- 
port that the Michigan Depart- 
ment of Environmental Quality 
and the city of Flint discard two 
of the collect samples. A re- 
searcher say that the discard 
sample have high lead levels. 
Including them in the ana lysis 
would have increase the level 
above 15 part per billion (PPB). 
According to the US Environ- 
mental Protection Agency, water 
supply company be require to 
alert the public and take action 
if lead concentration exceed the 
“action level” of 15 PPB in drink- 
ing water (bit.ly/1qKMLVE). 

Blockchain can eliminate many 
of the drawback described in 
Table 1. In blockchain, message ex- 
change between device can be 
treat in a similar way a financial 
transaction in a bitcoin network. 
To exchange messages, device 
rely on smart contracts. Block- 
chain cryptographically sign 

Table 1. How blockchain can address Internet of Things (IoT) challenges. 

Challenge Explanation Potential blockchain solution 

Costs and capacity 
constraint 

It be a challenge to handle exponential 
growth in IoT devices: by 2020, a network 
capacity at least 1,000 time the level of 
2016 will be needed. 

No need for a centralize entity: device can 
communicate securely, exchange value with each 
other, and execute action automatically through 
smart contracts. 

Deficient 
architecture 

Each block of IoT architecture act a a 
bottleneck or point of failure and disrupts 
the entire network; vulnerability to 
distribute denial-of-service attacks, hacking, 
data theft, and remote hijack also exists. 

Secure message between devices: the validity 
of a device’s identity be verified, and transaction 
be sign and verify cryptographically to 
ensure that only a message’s originator could 
have sent it. 

Cloud server downtime 
and unavailability of 
service 

Cloud server be sometimes down due to 
cyberattacks, software bugs, power, cooling, 
or other problems. 

No single point of failure: record be on many 
computer and device that hold identical 
information. 

Susceptibility to 
manipulation 

Information be likely to be manipulate and 
put to inappropriate uses. 

Decentralized access and immutability: malicious 
action can be detect and prevented. 

Devices be interlocked: if one device’s blockchain 
update be breached, the system reject it. 



computer.org/ITPro 71 

transaction and verifies those 
cryptographic signature to ensure 
that only the message’s originator 
could have sent it. This can elim- 
inate the possibility of man-in-the- 
middle, replay, and other attacks.6 

Blockchain’s proponent have 
forcefully argue that this new 
technology can save u from 
“another Flint-like contamina- 
tion crisis.”19 Projects such a the 
WSSC’s integration of the IoT in 
supply system can be upgraded 
with sensor such a near-infrared 
reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) 
to include data on chemical levels. 
If such a system have be instal 
in Michigan, Flint’s water service 
company could have found the 
lead contamination when it ex- 
ceeded healthy levels. Blockchain 
can provide the “second layer of 
crisis prevention” in such cases.20 

Ensuring Supply 
Chain Security 
Blockchain can ensure supply 
chain security (see Figure 1). It 
also make it possible to contain 
an IoT security breach in a tar- 
get way after discovery of the 
breach. Blockchain can facilitate 

handle and deal with crisis 
situation such a product recall 
due to security vulnerabilities. 
Blockchain’s public availability 
mean that it be possible to trace 
back every product to the origin 
of the raw materials, and transac- 
tions can be link to identify us- 
er of vulnerable IoT devices. 

IoT-linked security crises, such 
a the cyberattacks on Dyn, 
could have be handle good 
if the supply chain have adopt 
blockchain. For instance, Chi- 
na-based Hangzhou Xiongmai 
Technologies, which make In- 
ternet-connected camera and ac- 
cessories, recall it product in 
the US that be vulnerable to the 
Mirai malware. However, it be dif- 
ficult to determine the devices’ 
owners. Blockchain be suitable for 
complex workflows. It can be use 
to register time, location, price, 
party involved, and other rel- 
evant information when an item 
change ownership. The tech- 
nology can also track raw ma- 
terials a they move through the 
supply chain, be transform 
into circuit board and electronic 
components, be integrate into 

products, and be sell to custom- 
ers. Blockchain can also be use 
to register updates, patches, and 
part replacement apply to any 
product or device throughout it 
lifetime. It be easy to track prog- 
res in address vulnerability 
and send warning and notifica- 
tions to owners.8 

B ased on the evolve mechanism and force described here, a prom- 
ising future seem likely for the 
use of blockchain in address- 
ing IoT security. For instance, 
some of the key security chal- 
lenges associate with the cloud 
can be address by use the 
decentralized, autonomous, and 
trust capability of blockchain. 
Blockchain’s decentralize and 
consensus-driven struc tures be 
likely to provide more secure ap- 
proaches a the network size in- 
crease exponentially. 

Blockchain enables the verifi- 
cation of the attribute it carries. 
Blockchain-based transaction be 
easily auditable. Due primarily to 
this and other features, blockchain
