Abstract 

Recent literature have present argument link income inequality on 
the financial crash of 2007 - 2009. One propose channel be expect to work 
through bank credit. We analyze the relationship between income inequality 
and bank credit in panel cointegration framework, and find that they have a 
long-run dependency relationship. Results show that income inequality have 
contribute to the increase of bank credit in developed economy after the 
Second World War.

1 Introduction 

Historically the most prominent factor behind financial crisis have be the ab- 

normal growth of bank credit or leverage (Gorton 2012; Schularik and Taylor 

2012). After the financial crisis of 2007-2009, the relation between income in- 

equality and financial crisis have also become under scrutiny. Rajan (2010) argues

that rise inequality in developed economy cause redistribution in the form 

of subsidize housing finance, which lead to a boom in mortgage and late to a 

crash with know consequences. Iacoviello (2008) show that income inequal- 

ity be the main driver of increase household debt in the United States during 

the 1980s and 1990s use a simulated theoretical model. Kumhof and Rancière 

(2010) argue in their theoretical model that there be a a long-run relationship be- 

tween inequality and credit, where high inequality lead to high level of bank 

loans. Inequality raise the indebtedness of middle-income and poor household 

a a result of consumption smoothing. This article show that there be a long-run 

steady-state relationship between income inequality and bank loan in developed 

economies, where inequality lead to high level of bank credit. 

In a recent article, Bordo and Meissner estimate the effect of change in in- 

come inequality on the growth of bank loan and find "very little evidence link 

credit boom and financial crisis to rise inequality" (Bordo and Meissner 2012, 

p. 2148). Atkinson and Morelli (2011) find that there seem to be only an ambigu- 

ous causal relation of change in income inequality on economic crises. Atkin- 

son and Morelli (2011, p. 48) conclude that "we have not investigate whether 

inequality level be relatively high before identify macroeconomic shocks. 

Therefore, the level hypothesis cannot be rule out at this stage." 

Atkinson and Morelli (2011) refer to the hypothesis, where bank take high 

risk in extent to high income inequality through securitization. But, the level 

of income inequality also play a role in the model by Kumhof and Rancière 

(2010). In the model investor (the top 5% of income earners) own the whole 

stock of physical capital and derive their income from the physical capital and 

from interest on loan to workers. The bargaining power between investor and 

worker determines the distribution of income in the economy. In this setup, de- 

2 



crease in the bargaining power of worker lead to high income inequality by 

lower the wage of workers, which induces high lending from investor a 

they have surplus fund to invest. The more the real income of the worker drops, 

the more they have to borrow to maintain their level of consumption. This cre- 

ate a trend relation between income inequality and bank credit, where high 

income income inequality lead to high level of credit. However, income in- 

equality tends to grow very rapidly in the face of the decrease bargaining power 

of workers, whereas leverage, or the debt-to-real income ratio of worker tends 

to grow more steadily. The process of leverage be gradual because borrowing 

match the decrease real income of worker a they do not increase their con- 

sumption, but just try to maintain their original level consumption. That be why 

short-run change in income inequality may not have an effect on the growth of 

bank credit. What matter for bank credit be the long-run, trend relationship 

between credit and income inequality.1 

The analysis of this possible long-run relationship be complicate by the fact 

that bank loan tend to grow over time, whereas the generally use measure of 

income inequality, like the top 1% income share, be bound from above. This 

creates a problem, because it be not possible for something that be not trend 

to have a long-run equilibrium relation with something that be upward trending, 

in the first two moment at least. There be two way around this problem: the 

trend series can be detrended or it can be bound use some suitable trans- 

formation. Detrending of the series be problematic, because it will remove the very 

thing under interest, that is, the trend. Fortunately, there be a natural candidate by 

which the series can be transformed. The top 1% income share measure the share 

of national income concentrate on the hand of the high percentile of income

income inequality and financial stability.

earners. As GDP is, in practice, the national income of a country, the share can 

be present a income of the top 1%GDP . Therefore, it would be natural to convert bank 

loan the same way, i.e., bank loansGDP . This transformation would make the mea- 

sures comparable, a both would be express a a percentage of total income, 

or GDP, without remove the possible long-run relationship that may exist be- 

tween inequality and credit. As explain above, household leverage be model 

a worker debt-to-income ratio in the theoretical model by Kumhof and Rancière 

(2010). Thus, credit-to-GDP ratio be also a more accurate statistical approxima- 

tion of the measure of leverage use by Kumhof and Ranciére than the level or the 

first difference of bank credit. 

In this article, we test and estimate the relationship of income inequality and 

credit a ratio to real GDP. We use data on the income share of top 1% income 

earner and bank loan on eight developed economies. Results indicate that both 

the top 1% income share and the share of credit be driven by stochastic trends. 

The two series be also found to be cointegrated of order one imply that they 

have a long-run equilibrium relation. The long-run elasticity of the share of bank 

loan with respect to income inequality be estimate with panel DSUR and it be 

found to be positive. Top 1% income share be also found to predict the share of 

credit, but not the other way around, use a Granger non-causality test. 

The rest of the paper be organize a follows. Section 2 present the data and 

give the result of panel unit root tests. Results of estimations, cointegration and 

Granger non causality test be report in section 3, and section 4 concludes. 

2 Data and unit root test 

The annual data on bank loan include end-of-year amount of lending by domestic 

bank to domestic household and nonfinancial corporation in domestic currency 

4 



exclude lending within the financial system (Schularik and Taylor 2012). Banks 

be define a monetary institution and they include saving banks, postal banks, 

credit unions, mortgage associations, and building associations. The data on bank 

loan come from the dataset of Schularik and Taylor (2012). 

We use the top 1% income share of the population to proxy the income in- 

equality. Leigh (2007) have demonstrate that the top 1% income share series have 

a high correlation with other measure of income inequality, like the Gini index, 

which make the series a comparable measure of income inequality. The data on 

top income share be obtain from the World Top Income Database (Atkinson et 

al. 2011). In addition to income concentration we use several macroeconomic 

aggregate attribute a factor behind credit growth a control variables. These 

include real GDP per capita, investment a a share of GDP, short-term interest 

rates, and broad money (M2) a a share of GDP (Bordo and Meissner 2012; Borio 

and White 2003; Mendoza and Terrone 2008). The data on investment a a share 

of GDP, short-term interest rates, and broad money (M2) a a share of GDP be 

obtain from the dataset of Schularik and Taylor (2012). The data on real GDP 

be take from the Maddison dataset of the Groningen Growth and Development 

Centre. 

Leverage be model a a debt to real income ratio in the theoretical model 

by Kumhof and Rancière (2010). Thus, to test the hypothesis by Kumhof and 

Ranciere, we use bank loan to real GDP a our dependent variable. Descriptive 

statistic of the data be present in Appendix I. 

Due to limitation of the data on top 1% income share, we be able to construct 

a balance panel on eight countries.2 The baseline dataset span from 1959 to 

2008, whereas the dataset include short-term interest rate span from 1972 to 

2Countries include in the panel are: Australia, Canada, France, Japan, Norway, Sweden, the 
United Kingdom and the United States.

pattern in all eight countries. During the period of 1959-1980 the share of income 

of the top 1% decreased, but at the same time the share of bank loan increased, 

although only marginally. During that period income inequality decrease the 

most in Sweden and in France. After 1980 the share of income earn by the 

top 1% and the share of bank loan to real GDP grow at a very similar pace in 

all countries. This period after 1980 give some evidence in favor of the level 

hypothesis state that bank credit be increase with inequality. During this period

bank loan diminish only in Japan, which suffer from a decade long recession 

that begin in 1991. Because of the country related heterogeneity, the best way 

to analyze the possible relationship between the two variable be to test be the 

different trend process driven by the same factor(s). 

The data on bank loan be extremely heterogeneous, a described by Schu- 

larik and Taylor (2012). Credit, money and banking institution differ profoundly 

across country and in some case historical data on credit cover only commer- 

cial banks. As Schularik and Taylor, we tackle the issue of heterogeneity by use 

country-related constants. There be few yearly observation miss from the top 

1% income share data, which we replace by average of the value precede and 

follow the miss observation. 

We start by test the time series property of the data. As the time series 

extent of the data (50 annual observations) be too short for a country related time 

series testing, we use two set of panel unit root test to test for the possible 

stochastic trends. The first two be the so call first-generation tests, by Im et al. 

(2003) (IPS) and the Fisher type ADF test by Maddala and Wu (1999). These test 

assume that there be no cross-sectional correlation between the unit of the panel. 

The second generation panel unit root test by Pesaran (2007) and Phillips and Sul 

(2003) allow for cross-sectional correlation within the panel. In all test the null 

hypothesis be that the series be trend-stationary. A more detailed introduction on 

the use test be provide in the Appendix II. Table 1 present the result of panel 

unit root test for the six include variables. 

According to result present in table 1, all panel unit root test find the share 

of credit to real GDP to be an unit root process, i.e., test cannot reject the null 

hypothesis of an unit root. Three out of four test find the top 1% income share 

and the share of broad money to GDP to be unit root processes. Two out of the

3.1 Panel cointegration test 

According to unit root test present in table 1, stochastic trend would drive the 

time series of the top 1% income share and the share of credit to real GDP. Next we 

test if the stochastic trend be linear combination of one and another, that is, we 

test be the series cointegrated. To this end, we use two panel cointegration test

propose by Pedroni (2004) and by Banerjee and Carrion-i-Silvestre (2011) (from 

now on BC). The big difference between these test be that while Pedroni’s 

test assumes uncorrelated residual structure, BC’s test allows for cross-sectional 

correlation through common factor and it also control for possible structural 

break in the cointegration relation. Appendix III give more detailed description 

of the use tests. 

The model for test for cointegration between inequality and credit is: 

credit/RGDPit = αi +γitop1%it + �it, (1) 

where the level of bank loan be explain by the level of inequality, and (1,−γi) 

be the country-specific cointegration vector between bank loan and the top 1% 

income share. Under the null hypothesis γi = 1 ∀ i imply that variable be not 

cointegrated. We include individual constant due to heterogeneity of the data on 

bank loan discuss in the previous section. Results of panel cointegration test 

base on the model (1) be present in table 2.4 15 out of the 19 test statistic 

in table 2 find that the series of top 1% income share and credit to real GDP be 

cointegrated of order one at the 5% significance level. Results present in the last 

four row give some indication that deterministic trend may need to be incorpo- 

rat in the estimate model. Still, the overall conclusion from cointegration test 

be clear: the top 1% income share and credit to real GDP seem to be cointegrated 

indicate that the two series have a long-run steady-state relation.

nates the long-run dependency between the variables. What remains be a short-run

present in the last column, none of the parameter estimate of the explanatory 

variable be statistically significant at the 5% level. 

The picture somewhat changes, when the level of credit to real GDP and top 

1% income share be used. In this case, we use panel DSUR (dynamic seemingly 

11 



unrelated regressions) estimator by Mark et al. (2005) to estimate the cointegra- 

tion coefficient of top 1% income share use a model: 

credit/RGDPit = αi +γ′top1it +βpXit + θt + uit, (3) 

where αi be individual constant, θt be the common time effect, (1,−γ′) be the coin- 

tegrating vector between bank loan and top 1% income share, Xit be the matrix 

of additional explanatory variables, and uit be the idiosyncratic error. As the panel 

DSUR do not allow for cointegration between explanatory variables, all the 

other explanatory variables, besides top 1% income and short term interest rates, 

be first-differenced.5 The panel DSUR estimator by Mark et al. (2005) control 

for the possible endogeneity or the reverse causality of explanatory variable by

More information about the panel DSUR can be found in Appendix IV.

According to the result present in table 4, the cointegration coefficient of

expect positive and statistically significant signs. The coefficient of investment 

a a share of GDP have an unexpected negative and statistically significant sign. 

However, this may be due to the possible correlation between investment and 

interest rate. Higher demand for investment may increase the short term interest 

rates, but high interest rate be likely to diminish the demand for bank loan 

and investments. Therefore, the negative effect of interest rate to bank loan may 

be reflect to investments.9

10This be the period that Schularik and Taylor (2012, p. 1031) describe a a "era of unprecented 
leverage and risk" because the level of credit in developed economy surpass pre-war level 
around 1970 and trend up rapidly after that.

money share to GDP and the short-term interest rate have statistically significant 

negative parameter estimates. The negative effect of short-term interest rate to ra- 

tio of bank loan to real GDP be expected, a high interest rate make borrowing 

more expensive. The negative parameter estimate of the share of M2 to GDP, on 

the other hand, be likely to result from reverse causality. That is, a bank loan 

increase, money held in deposit account (etc.) decreases, which will decrease the 

broad money in circulation.12

3.3 Granger causality test 

Roine et al. (2009) have show that financial development, measure a the share 

of bank deposit and stock market capitalization, can have an effect on the income 

of the top 1%.13 If the same applies to bank credit, there would be a reverse effect 

from credit to income inequality. Panel DSUR estimator by Mark et al. (2005) 

control for this possible endogeneity by include the lead and lag of the ex- 

planatory variable to the estimate model. The drawback of this method be that 

it be sensitive to the selection of lead and lags. If some or all of the explanatory 

variable be endogenous, and if the number of lead and lag have not be suffi- 

cient to eliminate the correlation between them and the error term, estimate will 

not be asymptotically unbiased. 

Testing for this possible bias without strictly exogenous instrument be diffi- 

cult. However, Granger non-causality test can be use to ass whether income 

inequality help to forecast the share of credit and vice versa. Although this be 

not an actual test for causality, it will show the direction of the flow of statistical 

(predictive) information, which can be use to ass whether there be reason to 

suspect a reverse effect or causality run from bank credit to income inequality. 

We use the Granger non-causality test by Emirmahmutoglu and Kose (2011) 

developed for heterogeneous cointegrated panels. It conduct N separate time 

series test and then calculates Fisher test statistic by Fisher (1932) use the 

obtain individual p-values. Cross-sectional correlation be control by use 

bootstrap method for obtain the empirical distribution of the Fisher statistic 

and associate critical values. Table 6 present result for Granger non-causality 

test between the share of bank credit to RGDP and top 1% income share.14 

13See also D’Onofrio and Murro (2013). 
14Testing be carry out with Matlab. We be grateful to Furkan Emirmahmutoglu for provid- 

ing the program in runmycode.org.

The null hypothesis be that X do not Granger cause Y . Lag length be determine use 
Akaike information criterion. The empirical distribution and the critical value base on the 
Fisher statistic be generate use 10000 bootstrap replications. 

According to the result present in table 6, there be no information on the 

share of credit to real GDP series that would help to forecast the top 1% income 

share series at the 5% level of significance. However, the information contain 

into the top 1% income series do help to forecast the share of credit to RGDP 

with 1% level of significance. Results thus indicate that the flow of information 

would run from income inequality to bank credit. This diminishes the endogeneity 

problem and show that the estimation result present in previous section be 

not driven by mere statistical correlation. That is, result indicate that income 

inequality have a positive long-run effect on the share of credit to real GDP. 

4 Conclusion 

Schularik and Taylor (2012, p. 1031) have described the period after the Second 

World War a the "age of unprecedented risk and leverage". Iacoviello (2008) 

show that income inequality have contribute to the rise of household debt in the 

United States during this era. Kumhof and Rancière (2010) argue that there be 

a more general, long-run relationship between these variables, where income in- 

16 



equality will lead to increase leverage in the economy. In this study, we have 

test the existence of such a long-run relationship. 

According to our results, there be a long-run steady-state relationship between 

income inequality and bank credit in developed economies. The long-run elastic- 

ity of credit with respect to income inequality be found to be positive. Income 

inequality be also found to have a one-way Granger causality relationship to 

bank credit. These result indicate that income inequality have contribute to the 

increase of leverage in accordance with the theory by Iacoviello (2008), Kumhof 

and Rancière (2010), and Rajan (2010). 

Due to the pioneer nature of these findings, direction of future research be 

ample. The analysis present herein concentrate on developed economies, but 

the relationship between inequality and credit may differ, for example, in develop- 

ing economies. More importantly, future research should include the examination 

of the effect of income inequality on the probability of financial crises.15 By dis- 

entangle the effect of income inequality and credit a predictor of financial 

crises, the channel through which income inequality may increase the probabil- 

ity of crisis would be make clearer. Future research will also define the possible 

need of equalization of the distribution of income a a mean for achieve financial 

stability.

APPENDIX II: Panel unit root test 

All the use test allow for individual unit root processes. That is, they allow 

the coefficient of unit root to differ across countries. 

The traditional panel unit root tests, be base on the follow regression: 

4yit = ρiyi,t−1 +ηit +αi + θt + �it, (4) 

where αi be individual constants, ηit be individual time trends, and θt be the 

common time effects. The test rely on the assumption that E[�it� js] = 0 ∀ t, s and 

i , j, which be require for calculate common time effects. Thus, if the different 

series be correlated, the last assumption be violated. 

The second generation test be base on the regression 

4yit = ρyi,t−1 +ηit +αi +δiθt + �it, (5) 

where αi be the individual constants, ηit be the individual time trends, and θt be 

the common time effect, whose coefficients, δi, be assume to be non-stochastic, 

21 



measure the impact of the common time effect of series i, and �it be assume to 

be normally distribute with mean zero and variance of σ2 and independent of 

� j and θs for all i , j and s, t. Cross-sectional dependence be allow through 

the common time effect, which generates the correlation between cross-sectional 

units. The matrix δi give the non-random factor load coefficient that deter- 

mine the extent of the cross-sectional correlation. 

The null hypothesis in all test be that ρi = 0 ∀ i, i.e. that the process in I(1) 

nonstationary. The alternative hypothesis are: 

H1 : ρi < 0, i = 1,2, ...,N1, ρi = 0, i = N1 + 1,N1 + 2, ...,N. (6) 

For consistency of panel unit root test it be also require that, under the alterna- 

tive, the fraction of the individual process that be stationary be non-zero, for- 

mally limN→∞(N1/N) = γ, 0 < γ ≤ 1 (Im et al. 2003). 

Appendix III: Panel cointegration test 

Panel cointegration test developed by Banerjee and Carrion-i-Silvestre (2011) 

be base on the normalize bias and the pseudo t-ratio test statistic by Pedroni 

(2004). The data generate process behind Pedroni’s test statistic be give by: 

yit = fi(t) + x′it + eit, 

4xit = vit, 

eit = ρiei,t−1 + �itζit = (�it,vit)′, 

(7) 

where fi(t) include member specific fix effect and deterministic trends. 

The data generate process be described a a partition vector z′it ≡ (yit, xit) 

where the true process be generate a zit = zi,t−1 + ζit, ζ′it = (ζ 
y 
itζ 

X 
it ) (Pedroni 2004). 

1√ 
T 

∑[Tr] 
t=1 ζit be assume to converge to a vector Brownian motion with asymptotic 

covariance of Ωi a T −→∞. The individual process be assume to be i.i.d. so that 

E[ζitζ′js] = 0 ∀s, t, i , j.

The statistic pool the between dimension of the panel and they be construct 

by compute the ratio of the correspond conventional time series statistic 

and then by compute the standardize sum of the N time series of the panel. 

Pedroni (1999, 2004) show that under the null of no cointegration the asymptotic 

distribution of the two statistic present above converge to normal distribution 

with zero mean and variance of one a N and T sequentially converge to infinity. 

Banerjee and Carrion-I-Silvestre (2006) extend the model by Pedroni (2004) 

to include common factors: 

yi,t = fi(t) + x′i,t + ui,t, 

4xi,t = vi,t, 

fi(t) = µi +βit 

uit = F′tπi + eit, 

(8) 

where ei,t = ρiei,t + �i,t and F′t :s be the common factor which be use to account 

for the possible cross-sectional dependence. 

APPENDIX IV: Panel DSUR estimator 

23 



The data generation process in Mark et al. (2005) DSUR estimator be of the 

form 

yit = αi +λit + θt +β′xit + uit, (9) 

4xit = eit (10) 

where there be n cointegrating regression each with T observations, (1− β′) be 

the cointegration vector between yit and xit, and xit and eit be k× 1 dimensional 

vectors. Panel DSUR eliminates the possible endogeneity between explanatory 

variable and the dependent variable by assume that uit be correlate at most 

with pi lead and lag of 4xit (Mark et al. 2005). The possible endogeneity can 

be control by project uit onto these pi lead and lags: 

uit = 
pi∑ 

s=−pi 
δ′i,s4xi,t−s + uit∗ = δ′izit + u∗it. (11) 

The projection error u∗it be orthogonal to all lead and lag of 4xit and the estimate 

equation becomes: 

yit = αi +λit + θt +β′xit +δizit + u∗it, (12) 

where δ′izit be a vector of projection dimensions. Panel DSUR estimate a long- 

run covariance matrix that be use in estimation of equation (9). This make 

panel DSUR more efficient when cross-sections be dependent. The efficiency 

of panel DSUR actually improves a the correlation between cross-sections in- 

creases. Asymptotics property of the estimator be base on T −→ ∞ with N 

fixed.
