Multiscale directional statistic be investigate in two-dimensional incompressible 
turbulence. It be show that the short-time behavior of the mean angle of directional change 
of fluid particle be linearly dependent on the time lag and that no inertial range behavior 
be observe in the directional change associate with the enstrophy-cascade range. In 
simulation of the inverse-cascade range, the directional change show a power law behavior 
at inertial range time scales. By compare the directional change in space-periodic and 
wall-bounded flow, it be show that the probability density function of the directional change 
at long time carry the signature of the confinement. The geometrical origin of this effect 
be validate by Monte Carlo simulations. The same effect be also observe in the directional 
statistic compute from the trajectory of football player (soccer player in American 
English).

I. INTRODUCTION 

In the absence of a successful theory derive from the Navier-Stokes equations, the understand 
of turbulence be base on phenomenology and statistical characterization. One of the most universal 
feature of turbulence be perhaps it energy distribution among scales, which in a wide variety of 
flow be well approximate by Kolmogorov’s description of locally isotropic turbulence [1,2]. A 
complementary description of turbulent flow be it geometrical characterization. In the Eulerian 
frame, such a description could involve the statistic of vorticity patch and filaments, or region 
of significant strain. In the Lagrangian frame, i.e., follow fluid particles, an obvious geometrical 
characterization would involve the tortuosity or curvature of the turbulent trajectories. Indeed, it be 
the spiral motion of the fluid particle that characterizes the turbulent nature of the flow in the 
Lagrangian setting. 

The curvature in turbulent flow be study in reference [3–8]. The extension to a time scale– 
dependent curvature-related statistical measure be only recently propose in Ref. [9], and we use 
this measure to characterize the directional change of trajectory in isotropic three-dimensional (3D) 
turbulence [10]. It be show that three distinct regime could be observe in the directional change: 
First, there be a ballistic regime in which the particle change it direction a expect in a spatially or 
temporally smooth flow. Then, for large time lag we show the existence of an inertial, self-similar 
regime where the link could be make with Kolmogorov’s inertial range phenomenology. Finally, 
for time scale large than the Lagrangian correlation time, an uncorrelated regime be observed, 
in which the angle characterize the directional change be randomly distributed. One single type 
of turbulence be considered, the academic case of space-periodic isotropic 3D incompressible 
turbulence. 

The present work can be see a a logical continuation of the investigation report in Ref. [10]. 
We will address two additional questions. First, how do the statistic change if we be in two 
space dimensions? Indeed, the flow structure and Lagrangian correlation be different in the two- 
dimensional (2D) case, and we expect the directional change to reflect this difference. Second, what 
be the influence of the finite size of the domain on the statistics? This be an important question, since in 
a wide range of practical flows, solid boundary modify the property of the turbulence. To address

these question we consider statistically stationary incompressible turbulence in two dimensions. 
We will consider two different geometries: a spatially periodic case, i.e., an unbounded domain, 
and a wall-bounded circular domain. Using Monte Carlo simulation we will in particular show 
which feature of the statistic be flow-dependent and which be due to geometrical constraints. 
The statistical feature which be geometry-dependent but flow-independent should be observable in 
other physical systems. We have therefore also consider the trajectory of football player (soccer 
player in American English) and show that this system have a certain number of feature in common 
with the turbulent motion of fluid particles. 

After a description of the setup in the next section, we will discus the result on large-scale 
force turbulence, small-scale force turbulence, and football-player trajectory in Secs. III, IV, 
and V, respectively. 

II. DEFINITIONS AND SETUP OF THE SIMULATIONS 

A. Preliminary analysis and definition 

The directional change of a fluid particle be characterize by consider the angle between 
two subsequent position increment on a Lagrangian trajectory, define by X(x0,t), where x0 = 
X(x0,t = t0) be the initial position. The position increment be define by 

δX(x0,t,τ ) = X(x0,t) − X(x0,t − τ ), (1) 
and the cosine of the angle characterize the directional change be 

cos(�(t,τ )) = δX(x0,t,τ ) · δX(x0,t + τ,τ )|δX(x0,t,τ )||δX(x0,t + τ,τ )| . (2) 

As in our recent investigation [10], the main quantity we will analyze be the average modulus of 
the angle, 

θ (τ ) ≡ 〈|�(t,τ )|〉, (3) 
and the probability distribution function of �(t,τ ). Since we consider statistically stationary 
turbulent flow, we perform ensemble and time averaging, denote by 〈·〉. It be show by a 
second-order Taylor-expansion of the position vector that at short time the angle θ (τ ) could be 
estimate by the relation 

θ (τ ) ≈ 2τ 〈a⊥(t)/u(t)〉, (4) 
where u(t) be the norm of the Lagrangian velocity and a⊥(t) the norm of the acceleration perpendicular 
to the trajectory. Irrespective of the type of flow, it be thus expect that at short time the directional 
change θ , be linearly proportional to τ . Physically this corresponds to the range in which the flow can 
be consider smooth. The smoothness of the trajectory in turbulent flow which allows such an 
expansion have be show in Ref. [11]. In 2D turbulence, the velocity scale in the forward-enstrophy 
cascade range can be consider smooth, since the energy distribution fall off with a power law 
k−α , with α � 3. What this implies for the Lagrangian statistic and in particular whether an inertial 
range scale be expect for θ (τ ) at intermediate value of τ be not clear from the outset. 

In the scale range associate to the backward cascade of energy of 2D turbulence, the energy 
spectrum approximately display the same k−5/3 power law a for 3D turbulence in the inertial range. 
It be anticipate that the result observe in Ref. [10] will also be valid for this case. We will address 
this subject in Sec. IV. 

B. Setup 

The flow database we analyze be described in Ref. [12]. The flow be statistically stationary, 
force 2D turbulence with a Reynolds number, base on the domain size and the RMS velocity 
fluctuations, of the order of 104. A force term be add to the Navier-Stokes equations, act in

λ = √E/Z be Rλ = λ 

√ 
E/ν. For the periodic geometry we have Rλ = 751 and for the circular 

geometry Rλ = 633. Two type of physical domain be considered: a square double-periodic 
domain and a circular domain with no-slip boundary conditions. Numerically, all computation be 
carry out on a double-periodic domain use a standard pseudospectral solver. In the nonperiodic 
case the circular boundary be impose by a volume penalization method [13,14]. The penalization 
technique introduces a numerical parameter η which be chosen proportional to �x2 (with �x the 
grid size), to minimize the error [15]. Thereby the model error of the no-slip condition be of 
the same order a the discretization error. The quantitative influence of this error on the statistic 
be in the present case negligible. All statistic be compute in a statistically stationary state, where 
104 fluid particle be tracked for about 103 eddy-turnover times. The sensitivity to the number of 
particle be assess and the error between the statistic obtain in the periodic domain, use either 
5×103 or 104 particles, be less than 1% for all time lags. The parameter of the simulation be give 
in Table I. For further detail on the method and the parameter we refer to Ref. [12]. 

In addition to these simulations, we also consider a 2D flow force at small scales, which allows 
for the development of an inverse cascade of energy. The flow be similar to the one described in 
Ref. [16]. The domain be again a square periodic box discretized by 10242 gridpoints. The force 
be a narrow band random energy input at k = 210. At the large scales, energy be evacuate by a 
Rayleigh friction term, −αψ on the right-hand side of the Navier-Stokes equations, with ψ the 
stream function and α the friction constant. At large wave number the flow be damped by a fourth 
order hyperviscosity (in the viscous term, the Laplacian � be replace by �4). The parameter of 
this simulation be summarize in Table II. 

To illustrate the universality of geometric confinement on the statistics, we also consider a different 
physical system: football. The football-player statistic consider in Sec. V correspond to a training 
match of two football team of eight player each. The data use be collect by the real-time 
locate system deployed on a football field of the Nuremberg Stadium in Germany. Data originate 
from sensors, sample with 200 Hz frequency, locate near the players’ shoe one sensor per leg). 
Considering the small reaction time of a human to be of the order of 0.1 s, this frequency be largely 
sufficient to capture the small relevant time scale of the movement of the players. However, at 
such small time lag the angle which we calculate be most certainly influence by the measurement 
error in the position of the football players. In particular, when the football player be nearly at rest, 
the angle �(τ,t) be hard to determine, and such event be more frequent for football player (free 
kicks, penalties, etc.) than in incompressible turbulence, where due to incompressibility particle be 
rarely immobile for long time intervals. For the small time lags, the result be therefore expect 
to be less accurate. The position of the player be monitor during the full duration of the game.

III. DIRECTIONAL STATISTICS IN 2D TURBULENCE FORCED AT THE LARGE SCALES 

A. Average absolute angle 

In Fig. 1 the mean absolute angle θ (τ ) be show a a function of the time lag for 2D turbulence. 
The time τ be normalize by the Kolmogorov time scale τK , define a τK = (2Z)−1/2, where Z 
be the enstrophy. We find that at short time the evolution be approximately linear in τ , which be 
expect when τ becomes small than all physical time scale of the flow, and expression (4) be 
valid. At large time an asymptotic value be reached. In the case of a periodic domain this value 
be π/2, a expect for the angle between three random point in an infinite domain. For confine 
flow this asymptotic value be larger, approximately equal to 2π/3. The effect be geometric a we will 
demonstrate in the following. It be further observed, if we compare with our previous study [10], in 
three dimensions, that no power law be present for intermediate times. Indeed, in three dimension 
we have θ (τ ) ∼ τ 1/2 for intermediate time lags, and the exponent can be related to Kolmogorov 
scale of the pressure gradient spectrum. In the present flow, where the turbulence be stir at large 
scales, no Kolmogorov scale be observed. See, for instance, the spectrum in Fig. 4(b) of Ref. [16],

where we use a similar numerical methodology to generate a 2D turbulent flow. It be observe 
there that a power law scale approximately proportional to k−3 be present in the spectrum. Indeed, 
the forward-enstrophy range do not show the same scale a Kolmogorov’s spectrum in three 
dimensions. We will show that these result will change in 2D flow in the inverse cascade range, 
where Kolmogorov scale be observe in general. There we expect to obtain result similar to those 
present in Ref. [10]. 

B. Probability density function 

In Fig. 2 the probability density function (PDFs) of the instantaneous directional change �(τ,t) 
be shown. In the follow all PDFs be estimate by histogram with 100 equidistant bins. It be 
observe that, start from a peaked distribution around � = 0 for short times, the PDFs change 
shape, to gradually approach the long-time asymptotic shape of the distribution. For the PDF of the 
angle this shape be an equidistribution, since all angle be equally probable for three decorrelated, 
random point in an infinitely large 2D domain. In three dimensions, it be not the angle, but it 
cosine that tends to an equidistribution for long time [10]. The reason for this be that in three space 
dimension we have for the measure of surface integral in spherical coordinate cos(θ )dθ , which 
becomes dθ in two space dimensions. 

Following the reason in Ref. [10], we can try to fit these PDFs by a know distribution, by 
assume both the velocity and the acceleration to be near Gaussian and independent. If this be 
so, their square be χ2-distributed and the ratio of two χ2-distributed quantity follow a Fischer 
distribution. For small value of �, the cosine of the directional change can be approximate by 
cos(�) ≈ 1 − �2/2, so that the PDF of 1 − cos(�) should, under these assumption and when 
properly normalized, obey an F-distribution. As show in Fig. 3, the shape of the PDFs can indeed 
be reasonably well approximate by an F1,2 Fischer distribution. The parameter 1,2 correspond to 
the dimension of the perpendicular acceleration and local velocity, respectively. Indeed, in a 2D 
velocity field the acceleration perpendicular to a trajectory be a one-dimensional (1D) quantity. The 
collapse be not perfect, and this be not expect either, since the derivation of the shape of the PDFs 
lead to the F-distribution assumes Gaussianity of both the velocity and the acceleration, which 
be only partially true in general. Apparently, the Fischer-distribution reasonably well describes the 
distribution of the ratio of two random variables, even when these random variable be not precisely 
Gaussian distributed. The PDFs for the circularly confine case be similar, except for the long-time 
asymptotic shape, where no equidistribution be observed. We will now discus the influence of 
confinement.

particle in 2D turbulent flow (forward cascade) in a periodic domain. Rescaled and fit by a theoretical 
model. 

C. The influence of geometrical confinement on the statistic 

We have see in Figs. 1 and 2 that the difference in the directional change induced by solid 
boundary manifest itself only at long times. This be expected, since most of the velocity trajectory 
be at short time situate far away from the boundaries, so the statistic should be determine by 
these trajectory for which the influence of the wall be small. Indeed, it be show in Ref. [12], by 
position-dependent measures, that the solid boundary do not strongly affect the statistic in the 
consider flow away from the wall. At long time the statistic be however significantly affected, 
when compare to the periodic domain. In particular, the long-time asymptote of θ (τ ) change from 
π/2 to a value of θ (τ ) ≈ 2. What we will show now be that this effect be not due to the modify 
property of the velocity field, but due to the effect of geometrical confinement, irrespective of the 
flow, a long a the Lagrangian velocity correlation of fluid particle decay to zero at long times. 

It can be understood that at long times, when the separation of the fluid particle on a trajectory 
becomes of the order of the domain size, the angle might not be equidistributed. For instance 
consider the sketch in Fig. 4, it can easily appreciate that for a give distance between the 
first and the second of three random points, and if all position within the circle be equiprobable, 
the chance to have a configuration I, with a large value of � be large than the chance to have a

configuration II. Larger value of � become thus more probable when the distance between the three 
position point X(x0,t) becomes comparable to the domain size. 

To confirm this idea we carry out Monte Carlo simulation use 6×107 randomly distribute 
point in a circular domain and rectangular domain of different aspect ratio. Computing the PDF 
for the angle between two connect line segments, define by three randomly distribute point in 
a circle, the PDF have exactly the shape of the long-time asymptotic PDF in Fig. 5, with an average 
value θ ≈ 2, a observe in Fig. 1. The functional form that we have fit for this PDF be 

P∞(�) = a + b exp{−[(1 − �/π )/c]2} (5) 
with a = 0.10, b = 0.54, c = 0.46. The chosen functional form is, however, not good justified 
than by the fact that it accurately fit the data points. Using the same algorithm, compute the 
angle between randomly place points, we have further determine the influence of confinement on 
angular statistic for rectangular domain with different aspect ratios. The result be also show in 
Fig. 5. It be observe that the shape of the PDFs change a a function of the aspect ratio. When the 
aspect ratio becomes large, a sketch in the right side of Fig. 4, the problem becomes close to 1D, 
and the PDF can easily be determine analytically. 

In this 1D limit when the rectangle approach a line, the PDF should tend to the form 

P (�) = 13δ(�) + 23δ(� − π ). (6) 
This be qualitatively confirm in Fig. 5 for the maximum aspect ratio of 400, where two distinct 
peak of different height be found. The mean angle corresponds to the first moment of the PDF, and 
thus we get 

∫ π 
0 �P (�) d� = 2π3 . 

The PDF in the 1D limit case can be justified theoretically. Consider three random point (r1,r2,r3) 
on a line segment (of length L) have a uniform probability distribution U . Using conditional 
probability we find that the probability that r3 > r2, give that r2 > r1, have a probability of 1/3, 
while the probability that r3 < r2, give that r2 > r1, have a probability of 2/3. For the correspond 
angle we have only two values, 0 for r3 > r2 > r1 and π for r3 < r2 > r1. This justifies the above 
PDF. 

For rectangle with finite aspect ratio we consider three random vector 
ri = (xi,yi) for i =1,2,3. 
Each component have a uniform probability distribution, i.e., 
ri ∈ U (−Lx/2,Lx/2)×U (0,Ly). 
Without loss of generality we suppose Ly > Lx and we consider the y component first. Again 
we can show that we have a probability of 1/3 for y3 > y2, give that y2 > y1 (or y3 < y2, give

that y2 < y1). The x component be uniformly distribute between −Lx/2,Lx/2, and thus we obtain 
value of the angle in −π/2 < θ < π/2. The symmetry of the domain with respect to the center line 
x = 0 implies a mean value of 0. The probability for y3 < y2, give that y2 > y1, be large and equal 
to 2/3. This implies value for the angle in π/2 < θ < 3π/2. Again by symmetry argument of the 
domain we find a mean value of π . The mean value of the angle for all realization thus corresponds 
to 2π/3, which be indeed observe in our Monte Carlo simulation for rectangle of aspect ratio 
range from 1 to 400 in Fig. 6(a). 

The above argument be also valid for other confine geometry which posse a reflectional 
symmetry with respect to an axis, like the circular case. Furthermore these argument also hold for 
confine geometry in high dimensions, e.g., in three dimensions. These result concern the mean 
value θ , it seem that it variance be more complicate to determine from symmetry arguments. 
However, for the infinite aspect ratio PDF (corresponding to the 1D limit) [Eq. (6)], it be directly 
found that the second center moment (or variance) be equal to (2/9)π2. This asymptotic value be 
confirm in Fig. 6(b) by Monte Carlo simulations. 

IV. ANGULAR STATISTICS IN THE INVERSE CASCADE RANGE 

We anticipate in the previous section that the directional change in the inverse cascade range 
of 2D turbulence should resemble the statistic of the 3D case. Our reason to believe this be that 
Kolmogorov scale be in general even good observe in such flows, and the scale of the energy 
spectrum, proportional to k−5/3, be often closely approached. In Fig. 7(a) we show the energy 
spectrum. We observe a power law in the spectrum close to k−5/3 for the large scales. 

The time lag dependence [Fig. 7(b)] of the directional change contains a expected, a in 3D 
turbulence, two distinct power law before the long-time asymptote be reached. The ballistic regime 
can again be associate with a linear dependence on τ . For inertial range time lag a second power 
law be indeed observed. In this range, the predict directional change be proportional to τ 1/2. 
It be observe that the exponent be somewhat smaller. This could be due to the finiteness of the 
Reynolds number. In general Lagrangian time correlation be rather sensitive to Reynolds number 
correction [18]. Furthermore, this be also consistent with our previous result in 3D turbulence, 
where the scale of τ be observe to be proportional to a power law of the time lag with an 
exponent small than 1/2. 

The PDFs of the angle a a function of τ (Fig. 8) do again evolve from a peak around zero for 
short time towards an equidistribution for long times. The intermediate evolution of the PDF of 
1 − cos(�) can be capture by a Fischer distribution, a in the foregoing. It do seem that the main

behavior of the mean absolute angle θ . 

V. ANGULAR STATISTICS OF FOOTBALL PLAYERS 

Let u come back here to the influence of confinement on directional change. Since the influence of 
confinement be purely geometrical at large time lags, it should be universally present for trajectory of 
quantity in other physical situation than turbulent flow in confine domains, a soon a time lag 
be consider long compare to the typical correlation time of the move body. We have therefore 
study a totally different system: football. More precisely, we have consider the statistic of a 
training match of two team of eight football players. In Fig. 9 we show the trajectory of four

keepers) we will evaluate the same statistic a for the fluid particle in the forego sections, in 
order to evaluate which effect be robust enough to survive when we completely change the physical 
system. 

We have compute the Lagrangian velocity spectrum, which be show in Fig. 10(a). The data 
seem valid up to a frequency f ≈ 0.6, where the spectrum show an important change of slope, 
which we do not have a clear interpretation for. For frequency small than f ≈ 0.6, the spectrum

show a clear power law with an exponent close to −2. In the case of 2D flows, this exponent can 
be expect from Kolmogorov-arguments in the energy-transfer inertial range and be also observe 
in experiment on 3D turbulence [19]. 

We have compute the average absolute angle a a function of the time lag, and the result be 
show in Fig. 10(b). It seem that at small time the accuracy be not sufficient to show a power law 
behavior correspond to a ballistic regime. At such small time lag the angle be most certainly 
influence by the measurement error in the position of the football players, and the Lagrangian 
energy spectrum also show an unexplained increase behavior for these time lags. However, for 
large times, the mean absolute angle show a behavior correspond to a Kolmogorov-like inertial 
range, where θ be proportional to τ 1/2. If we would push the analogy further, we would be tempt 
to say that the trajectory of football player be similar to those of fluid particle in the inverse 
cascade range of 2D turbulence, but at high enough Reynolds number to observe asymptotic scaling. 
In this same range, an f −2 power law for the Lagrangian velocity spectrum be observe [Fig. 10(a)], 
analogous to the inertial range scale of isotropic turbulence, thereby corroborate our conjecture 
that these two range be associate with the same dynamics. 

The long-time behavior observe in the turbulent wall-bounded flow be show to be remarkably 
robust. Indeed, even though a football match do not seem to be ergodic, and some may argue that 
the trajectory of football player be not completely random, the long-time PDF of the directional 
change converge to a shape close to the one for fluid particles, a show in Fig. 10(c). Moreover, 
the mean-absolute angle for long time converges to a value θ ≈ 2π/3, exactly a for confine 2D 
turbulence. It seem that the fact that in a football match the movement of the player be strongly 
anisotropic do not prevent the PDF from converge to a universal shape correspond to random 
position in a close domain. The anisotropy might only show up in more global statistics, such a 
the global velocity correlations, in a sense similar a the return to isotropy of the small scale in 
complex turbulent flows. Furthermore, again the PDFs of 1 − cos(�) be close to an F1,2 distribution 
[Fig. 10(d)]. 

VI. CONCLUSION 

We have investigate geometrical multiscale statistic by analyze the directional change of 
fluid particle in 2D turbulence, and we have put a particular emphasis on the distinction between 
flow-dependent and geometry-dependent features.

for the two halftime of the match; (c) PDFs of the instantaneous angle �(τ,t); (d) normalize PDFs. 

For the average absolute angle θ (τ ), characterize the directional change a a function of the 
time lag τ , it be show that in the case we considered, a short-time regime could be identify 
where the angle scale linearly, θ (τ ) ∼ τ . This linear regime corresponds to smooth trajectories, and 
it existence be roughly independent of the type of flow, or the confine geometry. 

For intermediate time lags, unlike 3D turbulence, no inertial range scale be observe in a 
flow dominate by forward enstrophy transfer, which be due to the fact that such flow be statistically 
smooth in space. Different result be observe for the inverse-cascade range, which be show to 
behave similar to 3D turbulence with respect to scaling. Indeed, an inertial range be observe 
for the mean angle of directional change, but it exponent deviate from the prediction base on 
Kolmogorov scaling. The presence or absence of an inertial range scale in the angular statistic be 
thus clearly flow-dependent, at least in two space dimensions. 

A salient feature of the present study be the investigation of the effect of confinement. It be 
show that the size of the domain influence the long-time behavior of the directional change, 
and the precise behavior can be reproduce by consider the angle between two connect line 
segment define by three points, randomly place in the domain. Monte Carlo simulation allow 
to disentangle the geometrically dependent feature from the flow-dependent features. Indeed, the 
effect of confinement seem independent of the flow properties, a long a the flow can be consider 
ergodic, which should be the case for time lag much large than the Lagrangian correlation time. 

In all consider cases, for short time the shape of the PDFs for different time lag be reasonably 
well described by a Fischer distribution. At long times, the PDF be entirely determine by the shape 
of the geometry and becomes independent of the flow properties. Even for the case of football

players, who are, in general, not randomly space on a field, the shape of the PDF of the directional 
change be close to these behaviors, both at short and at long times.
