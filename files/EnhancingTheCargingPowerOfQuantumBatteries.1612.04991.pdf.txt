Can collective quantum effects make a difference in a meaningful thermodynamic operation? Focusing on
energy storage and batteries, we demonstrate that quantum mechanics can lead to an enhancement in the amount
of work deposited per unit time, i.e., the charging power, when N batteries are charged collectively. We first
derive analytic upper bounds for the collective quantum advantage in charging power for two choices of con-
straints on the charging Hamiltonian. We then demonstrate that even in the absence of quantum entanglement
this advantage can be extensive. For our main result, we provide an upper bound to the achievable quantum
advantage when the interaction order is restricted, i.e., at most k batteries are interacting. This constitutes a
fundamental limit on the advantage offered by quantum technologies over their classical counterparts.

Introduction – Technology is currently being miniaturised
at such a rate that we must give serious thought to the funda-
mental laws and blueprints of the machines of the future. In
the microscopic domain, where these machines are expected
to function, fluctuations of both thermal and quantum nature
begin to proliferate, and quantum effects must be included
in any reasonable physical description. When we deal with
technologies working in this quantum regime, familiar ther-
modynamic concepts like work, heat, and entropy need to be
applied with great care and consideration. It comes as no sur-
prise that there has been a recent intense effort to understand
how the laws of thermodynamics generalise to arbitrary quan-
tum systems away from equilibrium. This effort is known as
quantum thermodynamics and, given current interest in the
development of quantum technologies, it is receiving a great
deal of attention across a wide range of scientific communi-
ties [1–3].

Despite current momentum in the field of quantum ther-
modynamics, the explicit role of genuinely quantum features
in the operation of thermal machines is not fully understood.
A common issue raised is that the universal applicability of
thermodynamics is rooted in the theory’s complete lack of re-
spect for microscopic details. So why then should thermody-
namics really care about quantum mechanics? For example,
the striking feature of Carnot’s bound for the efficiency of a
heat engine lies in the fact that it is insensitive to microscopic
details [4]. Nevertheless, if one relaxes the assumptions of
large system size and quasi-static conditions, it is absolutely
reasonable to get corrections based on the fine details of the
working medium [5–8]. An important question is then: can
such quantum features be harnessed to improve other thermo-
dynamically meaningful figures of merit, such as power?

Collective quantum phenomena are known to offer advan-
tages in areas such as computation, secure communication,
and metrology. Very recently, these possible advantages have
received some attention in the context of batteries [9–17]. The
issue is subtle, in particular when one deals with mixed states.
In particular, Alicki and Fannes suggested that entangling op-
erations lead to increased work extraction from an energy
storage device which they coined a “quantum battery” [9].
Nonetheless, while entangling operations are necessary for
optimal work extraction, it has been shown that protocols ex-
ist for which no entanglement is actually created during op-
timal work extraction [10, 11]. Furthermore, considering a
regime where entangling operations do not increase the ex-
tractable energy, some of the authors of the present work re-
cently showed that entangling operations can, nonetheless, en-
hance the charging power of collections of two level quantum
batteries [15], also see [18]. However, the demonstration was
reliant on a highly nonlocal Hamiltonian, which may be diffi-
cult to implement in practice.

In this Letter, we first formally define the collective quan-
tum advantage for thermodynamic power, before deriving its
ultimate upper bound. Next, we show that attaining a quan-
tum advantage requires entangling operations, but not entan-
glement itself. We then go on to analytically prove that, for
charging fields with finite interaction order, i.e., involving at
most k-body interaction terms, the quantum advantage is up-
per bounded by a quadratic function of k and cannot scale with
the total number of batteries. Our result is a fundamental limit
on how large power can be for physically realisable charging
schemes, where the achievable interaction order is typically
constrained.

Quantum Batteries – We begin by defining what we mean
by a quantum battery: Consider a quantum system with an
internal Hamiltonian I . Such a system can be used to store
work by manipulating an external control field V (t) over some
time interval t ∈ (0, T ). This generates the unitary dynamics

U = ~T exp{−i
∫ T

0
dtH(t)}, where H(t) = I + V (t) and ~T

is the time ordering operator (we set ~ = 1). Note that V (t)
vanishes outside the time interval (0, T ). During the charging
process, the system is taken from an initial state ρ to a higher
energy final state σ = UρU† in a time T . Since the evolu-
tion is unitary, there is no heat generated [19], and the work
deposited onto the system is given by W = tr[I(σ − ρ)] with
an average charging power given by P = W/T .

Now, consider N such batteries, whose joint initial state is
ρ⊗N . As before, we can deposit work on all of them by trans-
forming ρ⊗N into σ⊗N . One way to implement this transfor-
mation is to perform the charging in parallel, following ex-
actly the procedure described above for each battery indepen-
dently. In this case, the unitary transformation is simplyU⊗N ,
and the time taken to charge N batteries is equal to the single
battery charging time: T‖ = T . Since the deposited work
scales extensively, W‖ = NW , leading to a charging power
P‖ = NP that grows linearly with the number of batteries.

Alternatively, to deposit work onto an array of N batter-
ies we could apply a more general unitary transformation
U , generated by the time-dependent N -battery Hamiltonian
H(t) =

∑N
j=1 I

(j) + V (t). Here, I(j) is the internal Hamil-
tonian for the j-th battery, and we require that V (t) vanishes
outside the time interval (0, T]). A bold font here denotes
many-body operators. Henceforth, time-dependence will be
left implicit where it is unambiguous. The crucial difference
betweenU⊗N andU is thatV may contain terms correspond-
ing to interactions between batteries – i.e., the batteries are
charged collectively. In this case the collective state of N -
batteries ρ may become entangled. As before, we require that
the system is transformed from state ρ⊗N to state σ⊗N via a
cyclical operation; this ensures that the deposited work is the
same as in the parallel case, i.e.,W] = NW = W‖. However,
the joint time-evolved state ρ in this case may be entangled,
and the time taken to implement U and U could in principle
be different, with T] ≤ T‖ in the optimal case. This in turn
leads to different charging powers: P] ≥ P‖.

Quantum advantage – We are now in a position to define
the quantum advantage for collective charging as

Γ :=
P]
P‖

=
T‖

T]
, (1)

where the second equality is a consequence of our requirement
that the work done is independent of the charging method.
Here, “quantum” refers specifically to an enhancement over
charging with the best local (i.e., non-entangling) operations.
That is, to compute the quantum advantage we must take the
optimal values for P‖ (P]) for given ρ (ρ⊗N ) and σ (σ⊗N ).

In order for this advantage to be meaningful, we must en-
sure that the parallel and collective charging strategies are
fairly compared. In particular, we would like to isolate the
advantage due to collective quantum effects without worrying
about other consequences of introducing interactions between
batteries, such as the increased energy available to drive tran-
sitions. In order to take this extra energy into account, we
must constrain the collective Hamiltonian H to be similar to∑
j H

(j), the total Hamiltonian in the parallel charging case.

Without constraints, we could freely increase the total energy
of the collective charging Hamiltonian to achieve faster driv-
ing, making the advantage arbitrarily large. Noting that the
variance and mean energy are extensive quantities for non-
interacting systems, we consider two possible constraints on
H , namely:

(C1) The time-averaged standard deviation in energy during
the collective evolution for time T] should not exceed

√
N

times that of a single battery, i.e., ∆E] ≤
√
N∆E with

∆E] :=

∫ T]
0

∆Hρ
T]

, ∆E :=

∫ T‖
0

dt
∆Hρ
T‖

, (2)

where (∆Xy)2 := 〈(X − 〈X〉y)2〉y and 〈X〉y = tr[Xy].

(C2) The time-averaged energy during the collective evolution
for time T] should not exceed N times that of a single battery,
i.e., E] ≤ NE with

E] :=

∫ T]
0

dt
〈H − hg〉ρ

T]
, E :=

∫ T‖
0

dt
〈H − hg〉ρ

T‖
, (3)

where hg (hg) is the instantaneous ground state energy of H
(H), that can also depend on time.

We are free to choose either of these rescalings as a con-
straint on H . They represent alternative ways of accounting
for the differing energetic structure of the parallel and collec-
tive charging Hamiltonians. The choices of C1 and C2 are
additionally motivated by the form of the quantum speed limit
(see below). While C1 leads to a stricter upper bound on the
quantum advantage, there is no reason a priori to choose one
over the other. We are now ready to derive our first main re-
sult.

Upper bound – Since the quantum advantage defined
in Eq. (1) amounts to a ratio of transition times, we can
use the quantum speed limit (QSL) to upper bound it for
a given constraint. The QSL states that the time re-
quired to transform ρ⊗N into σ⊗N is lower bounded as
T] ≥ T (N)QSL := LN max (1/E], 1/∆E]), where Lm :=
arccos(

√
F [ρ⊗m, σ⊗m]) is the Bures angle and F (ρ, σ) :=

tr[
√√

ρ σ
√
ρ]2 is the Uhlmann fidelity [20]. The two con-

straints, C1 and C2, are clearly related to the QSL, as ∆E]
andE] can be computed using Eqs. (2) and (3) respectively. If
we could change the Hamiltonian at will to include arbitrary
interaction terms, and only concern ourselves with the state
transformation, we could replace H with a time-independent
Hamiltonian such that the initial state traverses the great circle
connecting ρ⊗N and σ⊗N in the N -partite state space [21–
23]. In the absence of further constraints, the evolution with
such time-independent Hamiltonians is in fact optimal. In
this case, the QSL reduces to the usual inequalities due to
Mandelstam-Tamm [24] and Margolus-Levitin [25], whereE]
is replaced by the average initial energy and ∆E] is replaced
by the average initial standard deviation.

To derive the upper bound, we first confine ourselves to
constraint C1. We proceed by noting that the quantum speed
limit for collectively charging N quantum batteries is given
by T] ≥ LN/∆E]. This means that Γ ≤ T‖∆E]/LN .



3

Now, using constraint C1, i.e., ∆E] ≤
√
N∆E, we get

Γ ≤ T‖
√
N∆E/LN . A similar argument can be made with

constraint (C2). Taking into account that the speed limit for
parallel charging is not always attainable, we arrive at the fol-
lowing upper bounds for the quantum advantage:

ΓC1 ≤ β
√
N
L1
LN

and ΓC2 ≤ βN
L1
LN

, (4)

for constraints (C1) and (C2) respectively, where β :=
T‖/T

(1)
QSL quantifies the inability to saturate the QSL in the

parallel case.
Two remarks are in order: Firstly, for orthogonal pure ini-

tial and final states, the QSL can be saturated and β = 1.
Though the quantum advantage for power could be larger in
other cases, including where the battery states are mixed [26],
the improvement cannot grow with the number of batteries;
i.e., β is a constant function ofN . Secondly, we have excluded
cases where ρ and σ do not lie on the same unitary orbit, as
there is no way of transforming the former into the latter us-
ing the scheme outlined above; the two states will therefore
necessarily have the same spectrum [27].

The two bounds in Eq. (4) are independent from each other,
and constraint C1 is stronger than C2, as it leads to a stricter
bound on the quantum advantage. Many other bounds can be
derived by considering other extensive constraints. The quan-
tum advantage is tight for orthogonal initial and final states,
due to the example given in Ref. [15].

The significance of entanglement for quantum enhance-
ment has previously been studied in the context of quantum
speed limits for pure states: it was shown that, for non-
interacting systems, initial entanglement is required for an
enhancement in the speed of evolution [28, 29], while for
interacting systems a speedup may be achieved for initially
separable states, since intermediate entangled states are ac-
cessible [30–32]. In the more general case of mixed states,
the necessity of entanglement for an enhancement may not be
directly inferred, though it has been argued that, in general,
larger quantum Fisher information of the state with respect to
the generator of evolution leads to enhanced speed [33, 34].
In fact, as we now show, entanglement does not appear to be
necessary for a nontrivial quantum advantage.

Proposition 1 An extensive quantum advantage can be at-
tained even for highly mixed states, including those confined
to the separable ball throughout the charging procedure.

We prove this with an explicit example: Consider N two-
level batteries with internal Hamiltonian I with eigenstates
|E1〉 and |E0〉, and corresponding energies E1 = 1 and
E0 = 0. Let the initial state be thermal: ρ = exp(−�I)/Z
at inverse temperature � with Z = tr[exp(−�I)], and the fi-
nal state be σ = exp(�I)/Z . The optimal local charging
scheme is achieved in time T‖ = π/2 by applying Hamil-
tonian H = |E0〉〈E1|+ |E1〉〈E0| to each battery. In contrast,
the joint charging of N batteries is achieved in T] = T‖/α]
using the global HamiltonianH] = α]H⊗N , where the posi-
tive constant α] is introduced to satisfy the chosen constraint.

In both cases (local and global) the deposited work is iden-
tical; thus, the quantum advantage is simply the ratio of T‖ to
T]: Γ = α], which can be evaluated for the choice of con-
straint. We find ΓC1 =

√
N and ΓC2 = N (also ΓC0 = N for

C0 given in Eq. (5)).
ForN quantum systems of d-dimensions, there exists a ball

of radiusR(N, d), centred on the maximally mixed state, con-
taining only separable states [35]. Since the distance from the
maximally mixed state cannot change under unitary evolution,
for a small enough choice of �, the joint state of N batter-
ies will lie within this ball throughout the evolution; yet, the
quantum advantage remains extensive. �

Remarkably, neither T‖ nor T] depend on �, while the to-
tal work done does. In other words, no matter how mixed the
battery is a quantum advantage that scales with the number of
batteries involved is always achievable. The trade-off of using
highly mixed states is that the charging power suffers as � be-
comes smaller and smaller. Proposition 1 implies that, while
a quantum advantage requires entangling operations, the joint
state of N -batteries does not have to be entangled during the
charging process.

The Hamiltonian used in the example above, and in
Ref. [15], to saturate the bound for quantum advantage in-
volvesN -body interactions. Such interactions are notoriously
difficult to engineer. In the next section, we consider physi-
cally realisable interactions, and study the dependence of the
enhancement on the order of the charging interaction, i.e., the
number of batteries that take part in a single interaction term.
k-local charging – We now investigate the achievability

of a significant quantum advantage in a regime where arbi-
trary multipartite entanglement generation is possible during
the charging process. In particular, we demonstrate that, al-
though a nontrivial quantum advantage is achievable in physi-
cal systems characterised by at most k-body interactions, this
advantage – upper bounded by a quantity that depends at most
quadratically on k – cannot scale with the number N of bat-
teries that compose the system.

First, we consider the situation where work is deposited
onto the battery by means of a piecewise unitary circuit, an
example of which is depicted in Fig. 1 in the supplementary
material (SM). This model is reminiscent of the circuit model
of universal quantum computation, which is known to out-
perform its classical counterpart. In this case, the collective
state of N-batteries will, in general, be highly entangled. This
scheme allows us to study how the quantum advantage is re-
lated to the number of batteries that are simultaneously inter-
acting.

We consider batteries composed ofN d-level systems, with
internal Hamiltonian I =

∑
j I

(j), as before. More explicitly,
and without loss of generality, we assume that each term is
given by I(j) =

∑d
l=1 λl|l〉j〈l|j with λd − λ1 = 2λd > 0,

and with eigenvalues arranged in increasing order. The time
interval [0, T]] is divided up into L steps: at each step the
Hamiltonian is the sum of s = dN/ke terms, each acting on
a different set of k batteries. In order to allow the formation
of highly entangled states, these partitions could be different
at each step. At any time t, the k-local Hamiltonian can be
written as H =

∑s
µ=1 hµ where each term hµ acts on a dif-



4

ferent k-partition of the Hilbert space, identified by the set
µ = (µ1, . . . , µk) of k indices.

In order to make a meaningful statement in this scenario,
we need to introduce a third constraint:

(C0) The time-averaged operator norm of the driving Hamil-
tonian H during the collective evolution for time T] should
not exceed N times that of a single battery driving Hamilto-
nian, i.e., E] ≤ NE with

E] :=
1

T]

∫ T]
0

dt ‖H‖op and E :=
1

T‖

∫ T‖
0

dt ‖H‖op, (5)

where the operator norm ‖A‖op is defined as the largest sin-
gular value of A.

Constraint C0 guarantees that both the time-averaged stan-
dard deviation and the time-averaged energy are bounded
from above, as shown in Sec. A of SM. There, we show that
E] upper bounds both E]/2 and ∆E]. In this sense, it is a
stricter constraint than C1 or C2.

We now show that, with this constraint, the upper bound on
the quantum advantage depends on the interaction order k:

Theorem 2 For a circuit based charging procedure with in-
teraction order of at most k, the achievable quantum advan-
tage is upper bounded as ΓC0 < γk, where γ is a constant
that does not scale with the number N of batteries.

Proof in Sec. B of SM. In the important case where ρ and σ
are the ground and maximally excited states respectively, γ =
π/2. By construction, the bound on the quantum advantage is
not tight. For comparison, it has been shown elsewhere that
ΓC1 =

√
k and ΓC2 = k are achievable if the total number

of batteries N can be divided by k, i.e., if N/k = s ∈ N [15,
36]. In this particular case, such a speed-up can be obtained
for pure states using the time-independent Hamiltonian H =√
s
∑s
µ=1 hµ, with hµ = |1〉⊗k〈d|⊗k + h.c., assuming that

each hµ acts on a completely different set of k batteries, i.e.,
[hµ, hµ′ ] = 0 ∀µ, µ′. In the same situation, using constraint
C0 we obtain ΓC0 = k, suggesting that the strict inequality
in Theorem 2 is only different by a constant factor from an
achievable bound.

Theorem 2 can be extended to more general cases, where
k-body time-dependent interactions can occur between over-
lapping sets of batteries, with the restriction that each battery
is simultaneously interacting with at most m others. This re-
striction is motivated by the idea that the reach of the interac-
tion should be limited.

Theorem 3 For a generic time-dependent charging proce-
dure, the achievable quantum advantage is upper bounded as
ΓC0 < γ

(
k2(m − 1) + k

)
, where k is the interaction order

and m is the maximum participation number.

The proof is given in Sec. C of SM. For many physical
systems, both k and m are limited: 2 or 3-body interactions
are the norm for fundamental processes, and higher interac-
tion orders are generally hard to engineer here [37–39]. The
effective participation number, or reach, m tends to be con-
strained by the spatial arrangement of systems and the fact

that interaction strength often drops off with distance. Excep-
tions to this include the Dicke model [40] where collective
coherence leads to superradiance, the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick
model [41], where all particles interact with each other, and
the Mølmer-Sørensen interaction [42], in which an ensemble
of ions are effectively coupled by a spatially uniform electro-
magnetic field.

Note that these bounds are not tight; while a scaling of the
power P] with the number of batteriesN is surely not feasible
in the context of k-body interactions, it is more likely that
the quantum advantage is tightly limited by k. In fact, we
conjecture that, for any choice ofH , a conservative bound for
the quantum advantage is given by ΓC0 < γk:

Conjecture 4 Theorem 2 holds for any time-dependent k-
body interaction Hamiltonian.

We examine this particular statement in SM Sec. D, an-
ticipating that the result holds if a particular mathematical
conjecture does too. While we cannot exclude measure zero
cases, a large sample of charging Hamiltonians (generated
from Haar-random unitary operations), with (N, k) = (3, 2),
(4, 2), (4, 3) and (6, 2), has failed to produce any counterex-
amples. We believe that similar conjectures should also hold
for constraints C1 and C2.

Conclusions – In this Letter, we have introduced the notion
of collective quantum advantage for thermodynamic power.
Our results directly complement a previous strain of research
into quantum speed limits, by deriving a concrete upper bound
on the ratio between the maximum speed of interacting and
non-interacting driving between separable states. We have
proven two fundamental upper bounds for the quantum ad-
vantage, each corresponding to a different constraint on the
charging Hamiltonian. We have also shown analytically that
a quantum advantage that grows with the number of batteries
is not achievable with any physically reasonable Hamiltonian
(i.e., one with at most k-body interactions). Nevertheless, a
quantum advantage that grows with the interaction order k can
be achieved.

The quantum advantage has been interpreted as the re-
sult of rapid evolution through the space of high-dimensional
quantum states, typically obtained by means of global oper-
ations [15]. While, in the case of pure states, entanglement
is a necessary consequence of these global operations, a fully
separable evolution is still accessible for those states that live
in the separable ball.

A striking consequence of our results, which hold in gen-
eral for mixed states, is that an enhanced charging power is
available even for arbitrarily mixed states, in remarkable anal-
ogy to the case of quantum metrology. There, an enhancement
in sensing is still available for highly mixed states lying inside
the separable ball [43].

While collective behaviour has been demonstrated to pro-
vide an advantage in performing many information theoretic
tasks, such distinctions from classical behaviour are few and
far between in thermodynamics. This Letter demonstrates that
thermodynamic processes can indeed benefit from collective
effects when time enters the picture, though physical limita-
tions on the interaction order prevent us from utilising them.

This result has fundamental importance for our understanding
of how quantum theory and thermodynamics are related.

SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL: ENHANCING THE

tation. In the first case we have

∆E] =

where we have used tr[H2ρ(t)] ≤ ‖H2‖op = ‖H‖2op to get
to the final line.

Similarly, the time-averaged energy

E] =

∫ T]

dt ‖H‖op = 2E]. (A2)

Thus, if the time-averaged operator norm of the Hamiltonian
is bounded, ∆E] and E] are also bounded.

Appendix B: Proof of Theorem 2

Proof. Consider W (t) = tr[Iρ(t)] − tr[Iρ⊗N ], the average
work done on the system up to time t during the charging pro-
cess. The instantaneous power is given by P (t) = dtW (t) =
itr{[H, I]ρ(t)}. The strict inequality

P] =
1

T]

∫ T]
0

dtP (t) < max
H
{‖[H, I]‖op} =: P ↑ (B1)

follows from the fact that any unitary charging has to have
vanishing instantaneous power for times t = 0 and t = T].
We now evaluate the commutator [H, I] in order to find an
upper bound P ↑ for the average power P], remembering that
we have I =

∑
j I

(j) and H =
∑s
µ=1 hµ. We will use the

subscript µ̄ to indicate the set of battery indices that are not
included in partition defined by µ. Using the commutation
relation between hµ and I(j) we obtain

[H, I] =

s∑
µ=1

[
hµ ⊗ 1µ̄ ,

∑k

(µj) ⊗ 1µ̄j
]

=
∑
µ

[
hµ ,

∑k
j=1I

(µj) ⊗ 1i 6=µj∈µ
]
⊗ 1µ̄. (B2)

Using the definition for I , it follows from direct calculation
that ‖

∑k
i=1I

(µi)‖op = λdk. Let us define αµ := ‖hµ‖op and
introduce two normalized operators Xµ and ιµ, as follows:

Xµ =
hµ
αµ
, ιµ =

1

λdk

k∑
i=1

I(µi). (B3)

Using these, we can rewrite the commutator as

[H, I] = 2 · λdk
∑
µ

αµ

[Xµ, ιµ]⊗ 1µ̄

= 2λdk
∑
µ

αµYµ ⊗ 1µ̄, (B4)

where Yµ = 12 [Xµ, ιµ], such that ‖Yµ‖op ≤ 1.
At any time t, the operator norm of the Hamiltonian H is

given by

‖H‖op =
∥∥∥∥ s∑
µ=1

hµ

∥∥∥∥
op

=
s∑

µ=1

‖hµ‖op =
s∑

µ=1

|αµ|, (B5)

where the equality holds due to the fact that, at each step
in time, every term hµ acts on a different k-partition of the
Hilbert space. Accordingly, we obtain that

∫ T]
0

dt‖H‖op =

∫ T]

dt

s∑

|αµ| ≤ NE . (B6)

Now we consider the expression given in Eq. (B4), to cal-
culate the upper bound P ↑. Once again, we use the fact that
at each step in time there are s terms acting on different k-
partitions of the Hilbert space, such that the operator norm of
[H, I] can be calculated exactly,

‖[H, I]‖op = 2λdk
∥∥∥∥ s∑

= 2λdk

s∑
µ=1

‖αµYµ ⊗ 1µ̄‖op

≤ 2λdk
s∑

µ=1

|αµ|, (B7)

where the inequality in line Eq. (B7) holds due to the fact that
‖Yµ‖op ≤ 1 by definition, and where the sum can be carried
out of the operator norm thanks to the fact that, at any given
time, the s subgroups of k batteries are not overlapping. Using
Eq. (B6), we obtain

Plugging this result back into Eq. (B1), we get

FIG. 1. (Color online) Unitary circuit with k=2. At each time
step t, the driving Hamiltonian consists of a set of s = N/2 terms,
each of which involving a different pair of batteries i, j. The result
is s independent unitary operations u(t)ii+1 acting on pairs i, i + 1.
Note that at each step, there is no overlap between different pairs of
batteries; at every successive step the pairs are changed in order to
allow the formation of highly entangled states. A circuit of this type
can be used to approximate any time-dependent unitary evolution
U(t) [47], with precision that increases with the number of steps
L. The implementation of U requires an extra amount of time that
depends on the number of non-commuting terms in the Hamiltonian.

We calculate the quantum advantage as in Eq. (1), where P‖ is
given by the ratio between W‖ and T‖ = βL1/min{E,∆E}.
Work W‖ = NW is extensive, and in general W = q2λd,
where 0 < q ≤ 1. Thus, we obtain

Appendix C: Proof of Theorem 3

Proof. Here our goal is to relate a generic unitary evolution
to a circuit based charging procedure. We first note that the
charging Hamiltonian can always be decomposed into a num-
ber M of non-commuting terms:

H(t) =

M∑
j=1

H(j)(t) with H(j)(t) =
s∑

µ=1

h(j)µ (t), (C1)

where [h(j)µ (t), h
(j)
µ′ (t)] = 0; this decomposition is in general

different for different values of t. The unitary evolution U
generated by this time-dependent Hamiltonian can always be
approximated, using the Trotter-Suzuki decomposition [47],
by the following product of unitary tranformations:

UTrot =

L∏
l=1

M∏
j=1

exp

[
−iH(j)

(
lT]
L

)
T]
L

]
. (C2)

In the limit L → ∞, UTrot = U ; however, they do not cor-
respond to the same implementation: The Hamiltonian gen-
erating UTrot is piecewise time-independent and in the cir-
cuit form discussed in Sec. B. Since each of the M terms at

each time step must be implemented sequentially,UTrot takes
M times longer to run than U , with a corresponding drop in
power P] = MPTrot.

Since we have an upper bound, from Theorem 2, on the
quantum advantage for circuit model Hamiltonians, and the
power for a more general Hamiltonian is at most M times
greater, it must be that ΓC0 < Mγk in this case. In order to
complete the proof, we now need to consider how the mini-
mum necessary value of M scales with k and m.

The quantity m denotes the maximum number of other bat-
teries any one can interact with. In order for the number of
terms M in Eq. (C1) to be sufficient for the required decom-
position, it must at least equal the largest possible number of
different k-partitions µ that have a non-trivial amount of in-
dices in common, while containing the same index µi at most
m times. Let us provide a few simple examples to clarify the
meaning of M , where we will assume that N can be arbitrar-
ily large.

(k = 2,m = 1) In this case M is trivially equal to 1.
A possible choice is given by the first 2-partition (1, 2), after
which any other partition (i, j) can contain neither 1 nor 2.
This has to be true for any choice of other partitions, therefore
M = 1. In other words, in this case, the trotterization is not
necessary and the unitary can be perfectly simulated with a
piecewise unitary circuit.

(k = 2,m = 2) Let us start with the first 2-partition
(1, 2), followed by (2, 3) and (1, 3). Any other choice of two
indices would form a partition that does not contain any ele-
ment of at least one of the previous three, thus M = 3. In this
case the simulating circuit is at most 3 times slower than the
actual unitary.

(k = 3,m = 2) Now the first 3-partition (1, 2, 3) is fol-
lowed by (1, 4, 5), (2, 4, 6) and (3, 5, 6). Any other choice of
three indices would form a partition that does not contain any
element of at least one of the previous four, thus M = 4.

In general, for a given k and a given m, we could start –
without loss of generality – from the first ordered partition
(1, . . . , k). Remembering that each of those indices can ap-
pear at most m times, we can construct m sets containing 1,
followed by m − 1 sets containing 2, 3, 4 and so on until
m − 1 sets containing k, for a total of k(m − 1) + 1 terms.
In the worst case scenario, all of these partitions have at least
one element in common. However, any subsequent partition
cannot contain any of the indices included in the first ordered
partition (1, . . . , k), thus M ≤ k(m− 1) + 1.

Taking this most general, worst case scenario, we have a
bound on the quantum advantage given by

ΓC0 < (k(m− 1) + 1)γk = γ
(
k2(m− 1) + k

)
, (C3)

where γ := βL1Eqmin{E,∆E} . �

Appendix D: On Conjecture 4.

Let us consider a general time-dependent Hamiltonian that
contains all the possible k-body interaction terms between the



8

N batteries that constitute the system, i.e., H =
∑
µ hµ con-

tains N !/k!(N − k)! terms in the sum. With the aim of ob-
taining an upper bound for the quantum advantage under the
constraint C0, we follow the proof provided for Theorem 2,
until Eq. (B4). We then find an explicit relation between the
elements of Xµ and those of Yµ. Let us consider the product
basis Bµ := {|a〉µ} for the subset of batteries defined by µ.
Each element |a〉µ = ⊗ki=1|ai〉µi is a product state of the par-
tition of the Hilbert space associated with µ. In this basis we
can write

ιµ =
∑
a

ηa|a〉µ〈a|, (D1)

Xµ =
∑
a<b

(
xµab|a〉µ〈b|+ h.c.

)
+
∑
a

xµaa|a〉µ〈a|. (D2)

By explicit calculation using this basis we obtain

Yµ =
∑
a<b

(
ηb − ηa

2

)(
xµa,b|a〉µ〈b| − h.c.

)
, (D3)

where |ηa| < 1 and 0 < (ηb − ηa)/2 ≤ 1 for a < b, due to
the structure of ιµ. Our conjecture reduces to the following:

‖
∑
µαµYµ ⊗ 1µ̄‖op ≤ ‖

∑
µαµXµ ⊗ 1µ̄‖op, (D4)

which is itself upper bounded by NE . If Eq. (D4) holds, then
for any choice of time-dependent k-body interaction Hamil-
tonian H , subject to constraint C0, the average power P] is
upper bounded by 2λdkNE , thus, ΓC0 < βL1k.

An extensive numerical search failed to find any counterex-
amples to our conjecture. We have calculated the quantity
P = ‖

∑
µ αµYµ⊗1µ̄‖op/‖

∑
µ αµXµ⊗1µ̄‖op for a large set

of charging Hamiltonians, and found it to always be smaller
than the unit, as conjectured. In order to generate these Hamil-
tonians, we sample unitaries uµ according to the Haar mea-
sure, and obtain hµ = i log[uµ], where log[A] is the natural
matrix logarithm of A; P is calculated explicitly for every
sampled Hamiltonian. With a sample size ν = 105 we ran the
simulation for (N, k) equal to (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3) and (6, 2).
Not a single instance of P > 1 was recorded. This numerical
evidence does not represent a proof of our conjecture since
there could be a measure zero set of Hamiltonians for which
P > 1.
