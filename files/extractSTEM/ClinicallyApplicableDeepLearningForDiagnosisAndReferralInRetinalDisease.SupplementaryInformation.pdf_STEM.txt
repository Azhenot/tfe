consist with geograph atrophy. the view first go through the whole volum (128 slices) for a fix tissu map 
hypothesis, follow by show the differ tissu map hypothesi for a give slice. finally, we let the collag cycl through 
the differ hypothesi continu while scroll through the volume, paus on sever slice briefli to show the variations. 
the color legend for all segment map be avail in supplementari tabl 2. 

supplementari video 2 - wet amd | choroid neovascular (cnv) be the pathognomon featur of the neovascular 
(“wet”) form of age-rel macular degener (amd) and requir urgent treatment to prevent irrevers visual loss. A 72- 
year old man present with a histori of reduc vision in hi left eye. best correct visual acuiti in the affect eye be 38 
earli treatment diabet retinopathi studi (etdrs) letters. the model correctli select the most urgent diagnosi a “cnv”, 
suggest referr to an ophthalmologist on an urgent basis. the model segment highlight growth of the neovascular 
tissu in the sub-retin pigment epithelium (rpe) space – a so-cal fibrovascular pigment epithelium detach (ped). 
subretin fluid can be see surround the inferior margin of the fibrovascular ped indic the presenc of ongo cnv 
leakage. 

supplementari video 3 - normal | scan be quick and safe to perform and be thu commonli use in the screen of 
patient without visual symptom or other ophthalm findings. A 46-year old man who be refer for retin specialist review. 
best correct visual acuiti be 6/6. the model correctli select the referr decis a “observ only”, suggest that 
the oct find in isol do not requir referr to an ophthalmologist. the model accur delin the neurosensori 
retina without the presenc of ani patholog compartments. It also highlight partial separ of the posterior hyaloid of the 
vitreou – thi be a normal find a the vitreou gel increasingli liquefi with age. 

supplementari video 4 - diabet macular edema | accumul of thi fluid in the macula – diabet macular edema 
(dme) – be the commonest caus of visual impair in diabetes. A 54-year old man with diabet be refer to moorfield 
for ophthalmologist review with best correct visual acuiti in the affect eye of 45 etdr letters. the model correctli 
detect the presenc of macular retin edema (mre) and suggest semi-urg ophthalmolog referral. the model highlight 
intraretin fluid accumulation, with cystoid space in both the inner nuclear and outer plexiform layers, and a mix 
petaloid/honeycomb appear on the en face images. there be also an accompani signific increas in total retin 
thickness. 

supplementari video 5 - ambigu case (chronic csr) | In chronic csr, diagnosi of secondari cnv format be often 
challeng due to the frequent presenc of shallow irregular pigment epithelium detach (peds). A 60-64 year old woman 
present with a histori of csr in her left eye. the model correctli detect the presenc of csr but be far less certain about 
the presenc of cnv. It highlight a gravit tract of subretin fluid with a discret area of fibrovascular ped superior to
