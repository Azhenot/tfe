abstract. We appli machin learn to data set from shear laboratori 

experiments, with the goal of identifi hidden signal that preced earth- 

quakes. here we show that by listen to the acoust signal emit by a 

laboratori fault, machin learn can predict the time remain befor it 

fail with great accuracy. these predict be base sole on the instan- 

taneou physic characterist of the acoust signal, and do not make use 

of it history. surprisingly, machin learn identifi a signal emit from 

the fault zone previous thought to be low-amplitud nois that enabl fail- 

ure forecast throughout the laboratori quak cycle. We infer that thi sig- 

nal origin from continu grain motion of the fault goug a the fault 

block displace. We posit that appli thi approach to continu seismic 

data may lead to signific advanc in identifi current unknown sig- 

nals, in provid new insight into fault physics, and in place bound on 

fault failur times. 

keypoints: 

• machin learn appear to discern the friction state when appli to 

laboratori seismic data record dure a shear experi 

• machin learn us statist characterist of the record seismic 

signal to accur predict slip failur time

1. introduct 

A classic approach to determin that an earthquak may be loom be base on 

the inter-ev time (recurr interval) for characterist earthquakes, earthquak that 

repeat period [schwartz and coppersmith [1984]]. for instance, analysi of turbidit 

stratigraphi deposit dure success earthquak date back 10,000 year suggest 

the cascadia subduct zone be ripe for a megaquak [goldfing et al. [2017]]. the idea 

behind characteristic, repeat earthquak be the basi of the well-known parkfield 

predict base strictli on seismic data. similar earthquak occur between 1857 

and 1966 suggest a recurr interv of 21.9±3.1 year and thu an earthquak be 

expect between 1988-1993 [bakun and lindh [1985]], but ultim take place in 2004. 

with thi approach, a earthquak recurr be not constant for a give fault, event oc- 

currenc can onli be infer within larg error bounds. over the last 15 years, there have 

be renew hope that progress can be make regard forecast owe to tremend 

advanc in instrument qualiti and density. these advanc have lead to excit 

discoveri of previous unidentifi slip process that includ slow slip [melbourn and 

webb [2003]], low frequenc earthquak and earth tremor [shelli et al. [2007]; obara 

[2002]; brown et al. [2009]] that occur deep in faults. these discoveri inform a new 

understand of fault slip and may well lead to advanc in forecast impend fault 

failur if the coupl of deep fault to the seismogen zone can be unraveled. the 

advanc in instrument sensit and densiti also provid new mean to record 

small event that may be precursors. acoustic/seism precursor to failur appear to 

be a nearli univers phenomenon in materials. for instance, it be well establish that

failur in granular materi [michlmayr et al. [2013]] and in avalanch [pradhan et al. 

[2006]] be frequent accompani by impuls acoustic/seism precursors, mani of them 

veri small. precursor be also routin observ in brittl failur of a spectrum of in- 

dustrial [huang et al. [1998]] and earth materi [schubnel et al. [2013]; jaeger et al. 

[2007]]. precursor be observ in laboratori fault [johnson et al. [2013]; W. goebel 

et al. [2013]] and be wide but not systemat observ preced earthquak [bou- 

chon et al. [2013, 2016]; mcguir et al. [2015]; mignan [2014]; wyss and booth [1997]; 

geller [1997]]. seismic swarm activ which exhibit veri differ statist character- 

istic than classic impuls precursor may or may not preced larg earthquak but 

can mask classic precursor (e.g., ishibashi [1988]). the intern commiss on 

earthquak forecast for civil protect conclud in 2011 there be “consider 

room for methodolog improv in thi type of [precursor-bas failur forecast- 

ing] research” [intern commiss on earthquak forecast for civil protection, 

2011: jordan et al. [2011]]. the commiss also conclud that publish result may 

be bia toward posit observations. We hypothes that precursor be a manifesta- 

tion of critic stress condit preced shear failure. We posit that seismic precursor 

magnitud can be veri small and thu frequent go unrecord or unidentified. As 

instrument improves, precursor may ultim be found to exist for most or all 

earthquak [delorey et al. [2017]]. furthermore, it be plausibl that other signal exist 

that presag failure. 

2. materi and method 

here we appli recent advanc in machin learn to data from a well character 

laboratori system [johnson et al. [2013]; maron [1998]; niemeij et al. [2010]; scuderi 

c©2017 american geophys union. all right reserved. 



et al. [2014]]. our laboratori system be a two-fault configur that contain fault 

goug materi submit to doubl direct shear (see text s1, fig. s1). the drive 

piston displac at a veri constant veloc of 5 microns/sec dure the inter-ev time, 

and acceler briefli dure slip with a calibr accuraci of 0.1 micron/sec. An 

acceleromet record the acoust emiss (ae) eman from the shear layers. 

the shear stress impos by the drive block be also monitor (figs. 1, 2a, s1), a well 

a other physic paramet such a the shear rate, goug layer thickness, friction and 

the appli load [johnson et al. [2013]; maron [1998]; niemeij et al. [2010]]. the steel 

block be extrem stiff (order 160 gpa) so the deform take place larg in the 

gouge. follow a stick-slip friction failur (laboratori earthquake), the shear block 

displac while the goug materi simultan dilat and strengthens, a manifest 

by increas shear stress (figs. 1a, s1) and friction. As the materi approach failure, 

it exhibit characterist of a critic stress regime, includ mani small shear failur 

that emit impuls ae [johnson et al. [2013]]. thi unstabl state conclud with a 

laboratori earthquake, in which the shear block rapidli displaces, the friction and 

shear stress decreas precipit due to the goug failur (fig. s1, top), and the goug 

layer simultan compact. under a broad rang of load and shear veloc conditions, 

the apparatu stick-slip quasi-period for hundr of stress cycl dure a singl 

experi [maron [1998]; niemeij et al. [2010]], and in gener follow predict from 

rate and state friction [e.g., maron [1998]]. the rate of impuls precursor acceler a 

failur approach [johnson et al. [2013]], suggest that upcom laboratori earthquak 

time could be predicted. In thi work, we ask: can the failur time of an upcom

laboratori earthquak be predict use characterist of onli the continu record 

acoust signal? 

our goal be to predict the time remain befor the next failur (fig. 1a, bottom) 

use onli local, move time window of the AE data (fig. 1b, top). We appli a 

machin learn technique, the random forest (rf) [breiman [2001]; pedregosa et al. 

[2011]; loupp et al. [2013]], to the continu acoust time seri data record from 

the fault (see fig. 1 and text s2, s3). the RF model be an averag over a set of decis 

tree (fig. 1c). each decis tree predict the time remain befor the next failur 

use a sequenc of decis base on statist featur deriv from the time windows. 

figur 1a, top, show the laboratori shear stress exhibit multipl failur event dure 

an experiment. 

from each time window, we comput a set of approxim 100 potenti relev 

statist featur (e.g. mean, variance, kurtosis, autocorrelation, etc.). the most use 

featur be then select recurs [gregorutti et al. [2017]]. the RF us these select 

featur to predict the time remain befor the next failur (text s4). fig. 1b show 

four of these featur on the same time scale a in fig. 1a, through multipl failur 

cycles. some featur be sensit to chang in signal characterist earli in time dure 

the stress cycle, just follow a laboratori earthquake. all featur show be strongli 

sensit to signal characterist just preced failure, a the system approach shear- 

stress criticality. 

3. result 

fig. 1d and 2 show failur predict on test data-th acoust signal correspond 

to a sequenc of slip event the model have never seen. We emphas that there be no past

or futur inform consid when make a predict (blue curve): each predict 

us onli the inform within one singl time window of the acoust signal. thus, 

by listen to the acoust signal current emit by the system, we predict the time 

remain befor it fails-a ‘now’ predict base on the instantan physic charac- 

terist of the system that do not make use of it history. We quantifi the accuraci of 

our model use r2, the coeffici of determination. 

A näıv model base exclus on the period of the event (averag inter-ev 

time) onli achiev an R2 perform of 0.3 (see fig. s2). In comparison, the time 

to failur predict from the RF model be highli accurate, with an R2 valu of 0.89. 

surprisingly, the RF model accur predict failur not onli when failur be imminent, 

but throughout the entir laboratori earthquak cycle, demonstr that the system 

continu progress toward failure. thi be unexpected, a impuls precursor be 

onli observ while the system be in a critic stress state. We find that statist quanti- 

fy the signal amplitud distribut (e.g. it varianc and high order moments) be 

highli effect at forecast failure. the variance, which character overal signal am- 

plitud fluctuation, be the strong singl featur earli in time (fig. 1b). As the system 

near failure, other outlier statist such a the kurtosi and threshold becom predict 

a well. these outlier statist be respond to the impuls precursor AE (fig. 3c) 

typic observ a a materi approach failur [huang et al. [1998]], includ those 

under shear condit in the laboratori [johnson et al. [2013]] and in earth [bouchon 

et al. [2013, 2016]; wyss and booth [1997]]. these signal be due to small, observ 

shear failur within the goug immedi preced the laboratori earthquak [johnson 

et al. [2013]].

our machin learn analysi provid new insight into the slip physics. specifically, 

the AE signal occur long befor failur be previous assum to be nois and thu 

overlooked, illustr human bia that ML can overcom [johnson et al. [2013]]. thi 

signal bear resembl to non-volcan tremor [shelli et al. [2007]; obara [2002]; brown 

et al. [2009]] associ with slow slip [roger and dragert [2003]; rubinstein et al. [2009]], 

that exhibit ring characterist over long period of time. An import differ be 

that tremor be isol in time. In the laboratori experiments, the central block (fig. s1) 

slowli slip throughout the stress cycle, briefli acceler at the time of failure. fig. (3b) 

show a raw time seri far from failure. the signal exhibit small modul that be 

challeng to identifi by eye and persist throughout the stress cycle. these modul 

increas in amplitud a failur be approached, a measur by the increas in signal 

variance. thi increas in signal varianc show that the energi carri by the acoust 

signal steadili increas throughout the stress cycle. We posit that these variat be 

due to systemat groaning, creak and chatter from continu grain motion of the 

fault goug due to slow slip of the block (discret element model of thi system 

[ferdowsi et al. [2014]; dorostkar et al., 2017]] be ongo to further investig the origin 

of thi new found signal). our ml-driven analysi suggest that the system emit a 

small but progress increas amount of energi throughout the stress cycle, befor 

abruptli releas the accumul energi when a slip event take place (figs. s3, s4). 

the predict of our model gener across experiment conditions. To demonstr 

this, we train the system at one appli load level, and then test it on data from 

differ load levels, exhibit differ inter-ev time between failures. We observ 

that the model predict retain their accuraci across load level and correctli predict

clear outlier (see fig. s5). the fact that time predict can be make under condit 

the RF have never see suggest that the time seri signal be captur fundament physic 

that lead to the prediction. further, when the stress-cycl period be disrupt by a 

shorter recurr time a show in the inset of fig. 2, the RF still do an excel 

job in predict failur time, show that the approach can be gener to aperiod 

fault cycles. the fact that time predict can be make under condit the RF have 

never see suggest that the time seri signal be captur fundament physic that 

lead to the prediction. our physic interpret be that the chatter signal varianc 

and high order moment be a fingerprint of the instantan friction and shear-stress 

state, the varianc and other featur of the time seri carri quantit friction state 

inform (see figs. s3-s4), inform the RF of when the next slip event will occur. If 

true, thi be a remark observ in itself. We be current work on the relat 

between the signal varianc and friction to determin if inde there be a direct link. 

there be a number of issu to consid in appli what we have learn to earth. 

the laboratori shear rate be order of magnitud larg than earth (5 microns/sec 

v mms-cms/year). the laboratori temperatur condit in no way resembl those in 

earth, while the pressur could be repres of in situ pressur when fluid pressur 

be large. while it be a signific leap link the laboratori studi to earth scale, we 

know from past work [johnson et al. [2013]; W. goebel et al. [2013]] that the fundament 

scale relat in fault physics, the gutenberg-richt relat calcul from the labo- 

ratori precursor [gutenberg and richter [1949]], be within the bound observ in earth 

[johnson et al. [2013]; W. goebel et al. [2013]]. thi similar impli that some of the 

import fault friction physic scale. A laboratori experi clearli cannot captur

all of the physic of a complex ruptur in earth. nevertheless, the machin learn ex- 

pertis we be develop a we move from the laboratori to earth will ultim guid 

further work at larg scale. 

4. conclus 

To summarize, we show that ML appli to thi experi provid accur failur 

forecast base on the instantan analysi of the acoust signal at ani time in the 

slip cycle, and reveal a signal previous unidentified. these result should suffic to 

encourag ML analysi of seismic signal in earth. To our knowledge, thi be the first 

applic of ML to continu acoustic/seism data with the goal of infer failur 

times. these result suggest that previou analysi base exclus on earthquak cat- 

alog [keilis-borok et al. [1988]; liu et al. [2005]; alv [2006]; alexandridi et al. [2014]] 

may be incomplete. In particular, ml-base approach mitig human bia by auto- 

matic search for pattern in a larg space of potenti relev variables. our 

current approach be to progress scale from the laboratori to the earth by appli 

thi approach to earth problem that most resembl the laboratori system. An inter- 

est analog to the laboratori may be fault that exhibit small repeat earthquakes. 

for instance, fault patch locat on the san andrea fault near parkfield [nadeau and 

mcevilli [1999]; zechar and nadeau [2012]] exhibit such behavior. repeat at these 

fault patch may be emit chatter in analog to the laboratory. If so, can thi 

signal be record by borehol and surfac instruments? We be current studi thi 

problem. whether ML approach appli to continu seismic or other geophys 

data succeed in provid inform on time of earthquak (not to mention the chal- 

leng of predict earthquak magnitude), thi approach may reveal unidentifi signal

associ with undiscov fault physics. furthermore, thi method may be use for 

failur predict in a broad spectrum of industri and natur materials. technolog 

be at a confluenc of dramat advanc in instrumentation, machin learning, the abil- 

iti to handl massiv data set and faster computers. thus, the stage have be set for 

potenti mark advanc in earthquak science.

figur 1. random forest (rf) approach for predict time remain befor failure. 
(a) shear stress (black curve) exhibit sharp drops, indic failur event (laboratori earthquakes). 
We wish to predict the time remain befor the next failur deriv from the shear stress drop (red 
curve), use onli the acoust emiss (dynam strain) data (b). the dash rectangl repres a 
move time window; each window gener a singl point on each featur curv below (e.g., variance, 
kurtosis, etc.). (c) the RF model predict the time remain befor the next failur by averag the 
predict of 1000 decis tree for each time window. each tree make it predict (white leaf 
node), follow a seri of decis (color nodes) base on featur of the acoust signal dure 
the current window (see supplementari materials). (d) the RF predict (blue line) on data it have 
never see (test data) with 90% confid interv (blue shade region). the predict agre 
remark well with the actual remain time befor failur (red curve). We emphas that the 
test data be entir independ of the train data, and be not use to construct the model. data 
from experi number p2394.

figur 2. time remain befor the next failur predict by the random forest. 
As in fig. 1a, the red line show the actual time befor failur (y-axis) versu experiment run time 
(x-axis). the red dash line show the time remain befor the next failur (deriv from the shear 
stress data), and the blue line show the correspond predict of the RF regress model (deriv 
exclus from the ‘instantaneous’ acoust data). the blue shade region indic the 5th and 95th 
percentil of the forecast-that is, 90 percent of the tree that compris the forest make a forecast within 
these bounds. the inset emphas predict on aperiod slip behavior. the RF do a remark 
job of forecast slip time even with aperiod data. the RF be train on ≈150 second of data 
(≈10 slip events), and test on the follow ≈150 seconds, show here. We stress that the predict 
from each time be entir independ of past and futur history-each blue point be a ‘now’ prediction. 
the data point can be scrambl in time and the predict remain the same. data from experi 
number p2394.

figur 3. the physic of failure. the RF identifi two class of signal and us them to 

predict failure. (a) shear stress and dynam strain encompass two failur events. (b) zoom 

of dynam strain when failur be in the distant future. thi newli identifi signal, term 

‘laboratori tremor’ offer precis predict capabl of the next failur time. (c) zoom of a 

classic, impuls acoust emiss observ in the critic stress region just preced failur 

(note vertic scale be differ for two signals). such signal be routin identifi preced 

failur in the shear apparatus, in brittl failur in most materi and in some earthquakes. data 

from experi number p2394.
