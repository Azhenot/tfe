abstract—th two underli premis of automat face recognit be uniqu and permanence. thi paper investig the 
perman properti by address the following: doe face recognit abil of state-of-the-art system degrad with elaps time 
between enrol and queri face images? If so, what be the rate of declin w.r.t. the elaps time? while previou studi have 
report degrad in accuracy, no formal statist analysi of large-scal longitudin data have be conducted. We conduct such 
an analysi on two mugshot databases, which be the larg facial age databas studi to date in term of number of subjects, 
imag per subject, and elaps times. mixed-effect regress model be appli to genuin similar score from state-of-the-art 
cot face matcher to quantifi the population-mean rate of chang in genuin score over time, subject-specif variability, and the 
influenc of age, sex, race, and face imag quality. longitudin analysi show that despit decreas genuin scores, 99% of 
subject can still be recogn at 0.01% far up to approxim 6 year elaps time, and that age, sex, and race onli margin 
influenc these trends. the methodolog present here should be period repeat to determin age-invari properti of face 
recognit a state-of-the-art evolv to good address facial aging.

1 introduct 

facial recognit technolog have rapidli matur overth last two decad to the point where it be now uti- 
lize in mani commerci and law enforc applic 
for person recognit (e.g., mobil face unlock and de- 
duplic of driver’ licenses). automat face recognit 
system oper on face imag acquir in control 
conditions, such a mugshot or driver’ licens photos, 
have achiev accuraci a high a 99% true accept rate 
(tar) at a fals accept rate (far) of 0.1% in large-scal eval- 
uation conduct by the nation institut of standard 
and technolog (nist) [1]. 

technolog advanc in automat face recogni- 
tion have progress tackl challeng caus by vari- 
ation in facial pose, illumination, and express (collec- 
tive call pie variations). current effort (e.g., [2], [3]) be 
break ground on robust to “face in the wild” (e.g., 
imag post on the web) to account for pie, occlusion, 
and partial face images. comparatively, age variat 
(i.e., larg time laps between pair of imag be com- 
pared) have receiv consider less attent in the face 
recognit community. 

publish studi on facial age in the context of au- 
tomat face recognit have primarili employ cross- 
section techniqu where a popul of individu who 
differ in age be analyz accord to differ between 
age group [1], [4], [5], [6], [7]. however, cross-sect 
analysi cannot adequ explor age-rel effect be-

hypothes about facial age are, instead, longitudin by 
natur and requir multipl measur of the same 
individu over time to reveal trend in comparison score 
with respect to facial aging. 

To what extent facial age affect the perform of 
automat face recognit system be of more than aca- 
demic concern. becaus the appear of the face chang 
throughout a person’ life, most ident document con- 
tain face imag expir after a design period of

and ten year for adults, while u.s. driver’ licens typi- 
calli requir renew everi five years. additionally, to our 
knowledge, ensur that a new (more recent) photo have 
be submit for renew be not verified, especi for 
renew by mail or online. valid period of such ident 
document may be too long if these photo be to be use 
with state-of-the-art face match systems. fig. 1 show 
that elaps time of eight to ten year between two face 
imag can caus fals non-match errors. studi how the 
actual comparison score chang over time be import for 
understand the implic of oper with a global 
threshold1 (e.g., de-dupl and other open-set scenar- 
ios) on face recognit accuracy. 

while longitudin studi for automat iri recognit 
[8] and fingerprint recognit [9] have be published, to 
our knowledge, no large-scal longitudin studi of auto- 
matic face recognit perform have be report in 
the literature. We aim to fill thi gap by address the 
follow question: how robust be state-of-the-art automat 
face recognit system to facial aging? In thi paper, we 
conduct a longitudin analysi of the perform of state- 
of-the-art cot face matcher on two longitudin face 
imag databas consist of repeat crimin offend 
(mugshots) from two differ law enforc agenc 
(see tabl 2). the cot matcher use here be among the 
top-rank perform in the frvt 2013 face recognit 
evalu [1]. the contribut of thi paper can be sum- 
mariz a follows: 

1) longitudin analysi of two of the larg longitudin 
databas studi to date. leo LS contain 31,852 im- 
age of 5,636 subjects, and pcso LS contain 147,784 
imag of 18,007 subjects, where the averag time span 
between a subject’ multipl imag acquisit be 6.1 
and 8.5 years, respectively. such large-scal databas 
allow for evalu of perform at low far valu 
(e.g., 0.01% and 0.1%). previou studi (e.g., [4], [5]) 
evalu at 1% far and higher. 

2) determin the age-invari properti of current state- 
of-the-art face matchers. rate of chang over time in 
genuin comparison score be analyz use mixed- 
effect regress models, which be appropri for 
longitudin data. In do so, we quantifi (i) the 
population-mean rate of chang in genuin score over 
time and (ii) the variabl in subject-specif longitu- 
dinal trend (i.e., how close individu in the pop- 
ulat follow the population-mean trend). We also 
investig the influenc of age at enrollment, sex, race, 
and face imag quality. 

3) methodolog and analysi tool for advanc the devel- 
opment and evalu of age-invari face recognit 
algorithms. the analysi conduct in thi paper can 
be appli to ani matcher and ani database. period 
reevalu will be necessari a face recognit tech- 
nolog evolv to good address facial aging.2 

our previou longitudin analysi of automat face 
recognit be first publish in [10]. the present work

same decis threshold for all subject across all comparisons.

ers, the code of our longitudin analysi will be make publicli avail- 
abl at http://biometrics.cse.msu.edu/. 

extend and refin our previou studi in signific ways. 
the primari differ be a follows. (i) We studi longitu- 
dinal effect of both age (elaps time) and age (biolog 
age); [10] onli studi elaps time. (ii) genuin score be 
comput to repres a scenario where the young imag 
of each subject be enrol in a galleri (a subject with ni total 
imag have ni − 1 scores, wherea [10] comput all 

(

) 
genuin scores). compar queri imag to an enrol 
imag (a fix point in time) simplifi the complex correla- 
tion structur that be present for all pairwis comparisons. 
(iii) We analyz an addit longitudin face databas 
(namely, leo ls) from a differ law enforc agenc 
than the pcso LS databas use in [10], and a differ 
cot matcher be use to obtain genuin score for leo ls. 
still, longitudin analysi show similar result for both 
databas and matchers. 

the remaind of thi paper be organ a follows. sec- 
tion 2 highlight relat work on facial age a it pertain to 
automat face recognition. section 3 detail the two longitu- 
dinal face databas use in thi study. section 4 explain the 
methodolog use for longitudin analysis. section 5 give 
result for both the pcso LS and leo LS face databases. 
section 6 summar our observ about the current 
longitudin capabl of automat face recognition. 

2 relat work 
almost all of the publish studi that investig the 
effect of facial age on automat face recognit perfor- 
manc adopt the follow approach: (i) divid the databas 
(face pairs) into partit depend on age group or time 
lapse, (ii) report summari perform measur (e.g., tar 
at fix far) for each partit independently, and then 
(iii) draw conclus from the differ in perform 
across the partitions. such an approach have lead to the 
follow gener conjectur [11]: (i) face recognit per- 
formanc decreas a the time elaps between two imag 
of the same person increas (e.g., [4], [5], [6]). (ii) face of 
old individu be easi to recognize/discrimin than 
face of young individu (e.g., [1], [6]). see tabl 1 for a 
summari of these studies.3 

partit of data (imag or subjects) base on age 
group or time laps be often arbitrari and vari from one 
studi to another. erbilek and fairhurst show that differ- 
ent age group partit result in differ perform 
trend for both iri and signatur modal [14]. further- 
more, thi cohort-bas analysi with summari statist 
cannot address whether age-rel perform trend be 
due to chang in genuin (same subject) comparison scores, 
impostor (differ subjects) comparison scores, or both. 

multilevel (hierarch or mixed-effects) statist mod- 
el have be use for determin import factor (co- 
variates) to explain the perform of face recognit 
systems. beveridg et al. [18] appli gener linear mix 
model to verif decis (accept or reject) make by 
three algorithm in the frgc exp. 4 evaluation. In addit 
to eight level of far a a covariate, they analyz gender, 
race, imag focus, eye distances, age, and elaps time. the 
limit of thi studi includ (i) the maximum elaps 

3. studi that address develop age-invari face recognit 
algorithm (e.g., [12], [13]) be beyond the scope of thi paper.

the databas use onli contain 150 subject and the elaps

recognit in thi paper follow the gener methodolog 
of linear mixed-effect statist model outlin in [8] for

the two main databas use for research on facial 
aging, includ automat age estimation, age progression, 
and age-invari face recognition, be fg-net [15] and 
morph [16]. pani et al. [20] provid a recent overview 
of research that have util the fg-net database. while 
the public releas of these databas greatli encourag 
progress in these areas, the databas be not suitabl for 
longitudin analysi becaus (i) fg-net contain onli 82

number of subject with multipl imag over time (onli 317

person photo collections), while the morph databas be mugshots, 
similar to leo LS and pcso LS use in thi paper but with differ 
databas properti (see tabl 2). 

cross-ag celebr dataset (cacd) [17] be recent re- 
leased, contain 163,446 imag of 2,000 celebr across 
10 years. however, becaus the imag be download 
from the web (via googl search), the unconstrain qualiti 
make it difficult to statist model the effect of facial 
aging. variat in pose, illumination, expression, etc., 
may larg influenc the trend in similar scores. such 
covari be difficult to quantifi in order to “teas out” 
these effect from the longitudin effects, so standard 
imag (near-frontal, neutral expression, uniform illumi- 
nation) be prefer for the longitudin studi conduct in 
thi paper. rel constrain images, such a mugshots, 
help to ensur that other effects, such a pie variations, be 
captur in the nois term in the statist models. for the 
abov reasons, our longitudin analysi util two new 
longitudin face databases, detail in section 3. 

3 longitudin face databas 
oper face imag dataset maintain by govern 
and law enforc agenc can contain longitudin 
record of individu of magnitud that be infeas to 
collect in laboratori set (e.g., elaps time over 10+ 
years). these agenc routin collect face imag of the 
same individu over time and have be do so for rel- 
ativ long durations, primarili for applic involv 
driver’ licenses, visa and passport applications/renewals, 
frequent travelers, and multipl arrest of repeat crimin 
offenders. the sourc of face imag in our longitudin 
analysi be mugshot bookings. while we acknowledg that 
lifestyl factor (e.g., drug5 and alcohol use, trauma, etc.) 
may increas age rate for some individu in thi pop- 
ulat (adult repeat crimin offenders), these acceler 
ager be expect to be outlier in the statist model in 
our analysis; the overal trend should be rel robust 
to thi factor. additionally, we be not abl to access ani 
other longitudin face data. We do attempt to use longitu- 
dinal face imag from the state depart visa databases. 
however, we discov that roughli 5% of genuin face

ual reus the same photo for a visa renew application), 
so the correspond inaccur age inform render it

the two databas use in thi longitudin studi (ls), 
denot leo LS and pcso ls, be subset of subject 
and imag from two larg mugshot databas initi 
consist of 3.7 and 1.5 million images, respectively. the 
follow criterion be use to compil the subsets: (i) each 
subject have at least 4 (leo ls) or 5 (pcso ls) face imag 
that be (ii) acquir over at least a 5 year time span, and 
(iii) each pair of consecut imag be time-separ by at 
least one month. databas statist be show in fig. 2. 

the facial variat in the pcso S and leo LS 
databas be well-control becaus the mugshot adher 
to standard similar to those detail in the ansi/nist- 
itl 2011 face imag standards.6 the standard specifi that 
mugshot should be captur at frontal pose, with neutral 
expression, uniform illumination, and a background set to 
18% gray, for examples. becaus these databas be both 
from oper sources, some confound factor be 
still present, such a minor pose and express variat 
(see fig. 6). We also observ rare occurr of facial 
occlus or injury, a show in fig. 4, but have retain 
such imag in thi study. 

for both databases, we onli includ white and black

makeup of the leo LS databas includ 2,009 white and 
3,627 black subject where 4,922 subject be male and 
714 be females. subject in leo LS be primarili adults, 
but there be 656 imag of 369 subject that be young 
than 18 years-old; these may be juvenile7 arrest or they 
could be data entri errors. due to privaci considerations, 
we onli have access to the comparison score (both genuin 
and impostor), so we cannot show face imag from thi 
database. 

3.2 pcso LS face databas 

the pcso LS databas consist of 147,784 oper 
mugshot of 18,007 repeat crimin offend book by the 
pinella counti sheriff’ offic (pcso) from 1994 to 2010. 
each subject have an averag of 8 imag over an averag 
time span of 8.5 year (maximum of 16 years). demograph 
makeup of the pcso LS databas includ 11,002 white 
and 7,004 black subject where 14,882 subject be male 
and 3,124 be females. exampl face imag from pcso LS 
be show in fig. 6. each book record in pcso LS 
contain both the date of birth and the date of arrest (actual 
date be unavail for leo ls, onli the age be 
provid to us). 

3.3 face comparison score 

face comparison score (similarities) be obtain from 
variou commerci face matcher with the aim of evalu- 
ate current state-of-the-art longitudin performance. two 
matcher be appli to the pcso LS database, and com- 
parison score be obtain from four differ matcher 
for the leo LS database.8 As show in tabl 3, cots-a 
and cots-b be the overal most accur matchers. due 
to space limitations, longitudin result be onli report 
for cots-a and cots-b throughout the remaind of the 
paper. cots-a and cots-b be both among the top-3 
perform in the frvt 2013 [1]. 

the origin mugshot imag be input to each cot 
matcher, and a total of 26,216 and 129,773 genuin score 
be comput for the leo LS and pcso LS databases, 

7. In the unit states, a juvenil be typic under the age of 17. 
8. comparison score and ancillari inform (sex, race, age) for 

the leo LS face imag databas be provid by the imag group,

each subject (i.e., the length of the age span). 

respectively, under the scenario where each subject’ set 
of face imag be compar to his/her enrol image. 
genuin comparison scores, sij , between the enrol 
and jth face imag of subject i be standard so 
yij = (sij−μ)/σ, where μ and σ be the mean and standard 
deviat of the genuin score from all subjects. thi stan- 
dardiz response, yij , be in term of standard deviat 
from the mean of the genuin distribution, which allow 
interpret of coeffici from mixed-effect regress 
model a quantifi the chang in genuin score a β 
standard deviat per year. fig. 7 show the distribut 
of cots-a and cots-b standard genuin scores. 

the respons variabl for all mixed-effect model in thi 
studi be standard genuin comparison scores. how- 
ever, to evalu face recognit performance, trend in 
genuin score should be consid in context with an 
impostor distribution. for both the leo LS and pcso LS 
databases, we comput all possibl impostor score (5.5 
million and 11.1 billion, respectively) to calcul threshold 
at differ fix far values. the threshold at 0.01% far, 
for example, be use to determin when genuin score drop 
below the threshold, caus fals reject errors. 

4 mixed-effect model 

mixed-effect model (also know a random-effects, multi- 
level, and hierarch models) be wide use in variou 
scientif disciplin for studi data that be hierarchi- 
calli structured, includ longitudin data of repeat 
observ over time [22], [23]. In our case, face imag 
be group by subject becaus we have repeat obser- 
vation of each individu in our study. when data be 
structur in such a manner, respons from the same clus- 
ter/group/individu be correl with each other and 
across time (for longitudin data). mixed-effect model en- 
abl analysi of variat in the respons (here, standard 
face comparison scores) that occur at differ level of the 
data hierarchy.

fig. 6: An exampl of cross-sect vs. longitudin analysis. (a) face imag of six exampl subject from the pcso LS 
database. the enrol face imag (leftmost column) be the young imag of each subject, and all queri imag be 
in order of increas age. In thi study, genuin similar score be comput by compar the queri imag of each 
subject to his/her enrol image. In (b), a cross-sect approach (ordinari least squar (ols) linear regression) be 
applied, which incorrectli assum that all the score be independent. In (c), ol be instead appli six times, separ to 
each subject’ set of scores. the slope estim by cross-sect analysi (black dot line) be much flatter than the slope 
of subject-specif trend in (solid color line in (c)). the longitudin analysi in thi paper util mixed-effect models, 
which provid “shrunken” ol estim for each subject, where the ol trend shrink toward a population-mean trend 
[22], [23], further account for the correl that exist between score from the same subject. 

ideally, longitudin data collect would observ all 
individu in the studi follow the exact same schedul 
over the entir durat of interest. however, longitudin 
data be typic not thi nice structur becaus it be 
difficult (and expensive) to collect, or it must be analyz 
retrospectively, a be the case with the mugshot databas 
use in thi study. instead, longitudin data be most often 
time-unstructur and unbalanced, mean individu in the 
studi popul be observ at differ schedul and 
have differ number of observations. for the mugshot 
databases, thi translat to differ rate of recidiv for 
each subject. fig. 2 show that subject in the leo LS and 
pcso LS databas have anywher from 4 to more than 20 
mugshots, and fig. 5 show that the age span of the subject 
be highli unstructured. 

mixed-effect model can handl imbalanc and time- 
unstructur data and be prefer over other approach 
becaus they model both the mean respons (fix effect 
defin the population-mean trend), a well a the covari 
structur (random effect allow deviat of individu 
from the population-mean). In longitudin data, thi co- 
varianc structur have a complic form which stem from 
the fact that error term be not independ (a be assum 

in standard linear regression). the remaind of thi section 
provid detail of the model and covari of interest. 

4.1 model formul 
given ni face imag of subject i, let ageij denot the 
absolut age of the ith individu for the jth face image, 
where ageij < ageik for j = 0, . . . , ni − 2 and k = j+1, 
. . . , ni − 1 (i.e., the ni imag be order by increas 
age). To begin with, assum that the young imag (first 
acquisition) of each subject be enrol in the gallery, and 
let agei = agei0 denot the age of individu i at 
enrol where agei < ageij for j = 1, . . . , ni − 1. 
We can comput mi = ni − 1 genuin comparison score 
by compar everi other imag to the enrol image. 
hence, in thi scenario, yij (j = 1, . . . , mi) be the comparison 
score between the jth face imag of individu i and his/her 
enrol image. ageij be the age of the jth query/prob 
imag of subject i, so the elaps time between enrol 
and queri imag be �tij = ageij −ageie. 

when studi age-rel effect on automat face 
recognit performance, there be two different, albeit 
close related, time-vari covari which be of pri- 
mari interest: (i) the elaps time between imag acquisit

be compared. below, we discu mixed-effect model 
which includ these and other covariates. 

4.1.1 function of elaps time 
the simplest notion of face recognit perform over 
time be a function of the elaps time between a subject’ 
enrol and queri face images, f(�tij). A linear mixed- 
effect model with two level (to account for subject-specif 
trends) and a singl covari for elaps time can be 
formul a follows. At level-1, the comparison score yij 
between the enrol and jth queri imag of subject i can 
be model a a linear function of �tij : 

yij = ϕ0i + ϕ1i�tij + εij , (1) 
where the ith individual’ intercept, ϕ0i, and slope, ϕ1i, be 

ϕ0i = β00 + b0i, 

ϕ1i = β10 + b1i. 
(2) 

the level-1 equat in (1) model within-subject longitudin 
chang in yij where a subject’ score can vari around 
his/her linear trend by εij (level-1 residu variation). the 
level-2 model in (2) account for between-subject variat 
in comparison score becaus each subject’ intercept and 
slope parameters, ϕ0i and ϕ1i, respectively, be model 
a a combin of fix and random effects. the fix 
effects, β00 and β10, be the grand mean of the popul 
intercept and slopes, respectively, and defin the overal 
population-mean trend, while the random effects, b0i and b1i, 
be subject-specif deviat from the population-mean 
parameters. sinc each subject can have his/her own inter- 
cept and slope parameters, mixed-effect model be flexibl 
in handling/allow for biometr zoo effect [24], [25] 
(some subject gener have high or low scores). fig. 6 
show six exampl subject from the pcso LS databas at 
differ ages, with their subject-specif trend in genuin 
score over time show in fig. 6c. 

the random structur of the abov two-level model 
includ the level-1 residuals, {εij}, a well a the random 

effects, b0i and b1i, which can be thought of a level-2 
residuals. the distribut assumpt of these two error 
term are: 

εij ∼ n(0,σ2ε) (3) 
and [

([

, 

[

]) 
, (4) 

where n(., .) denot a gaussian distribution. 
substitut the level-2 equat for subject-specif 

intercept and slope into the level-1 model in (1), the 
composit form of the two-level mixed-effect model is: 

yij = 
[ 
β00 + b0i 

] 
+ 
[ 
β10 + b1i 

]�tij + εij . (5) 
here, the model term insid the two bracket in (5) corre- 
spond to all coeffici for the intercept and slope terms. 

when the error term be equal to their assum mean 
of zero, (6) reduc to the population-mean trend of yij = 
β00 + β10�tij . the grand mean intercept β00 quantifi the 
expect margin mean comparison score when �tij = 0. 
note that thi intercept be not particularli meaningful, a our 
data do not contain ani same-day comparisons. however, 
interpret of β00 do give u some notion of differ 
in subject’ comparison score at a project baselin of 
zero year elaps time. the primari coeffici we be 
interest in be β10 which quantifi the expect chang 
in mean comparison score per one-year increas in elaps 
time sinc enrollment. becaus thi model, a well a all 
other consid in thi paper, includ random term for 
both intercept and slope (b0i and b1i), we can also analyz 
the variat in the popul paramet (i.e., differ 
in the trend of individu in the population). 

4.1.2 function of elaps time and age at enrol 
If rate of chang in comparison score be steeper or flatter 
throughout an individual’ lifetime, then face recognit 
perform may also be a function of absolut age. If we 
add the age of the enrol imag to (5): 

yij = 
[ 
β00 + β01agei + b0i 

] 
+ 
[ 
β10 + b1i 

]�tij + εij . (6)

becaus agei be a fix effect for each subject (time- 
invariant), the abov composit model actual have a two- 
level specif with the same level-1 model in (1). hence, 
agei cannot improv the model fit at level-1 (within- 
subject); it can onli influenc the level-2 subject-specif 
variations.9 the population-mean trend for (6) is: 

e(yij) = β00 + β01agei + β10�tij 
= β00 + β01agei + β10(ageij −ageie). (7) 

By definition, �tij be a center version of ageij , where 
the center term (ageie) be subject-specific. hence, the 
model for age a a function of elaps time and age at 
enrollment, f(�tij , ageie), be mathemat equival 
to a model for age a a function of the age of the queri 
imag and age at enrollment, f(ageij , ageie): 

e(yij) = β00 + β01agei + β10ageij . (8) 

the two model in (7) and (8) will result in the same 
estim for longitudin change, β10. what distinguish 
them be the interpret of the coeffici β01 quantifi 
the effect of ageie. note the relationship between the two 
models: β(8)01 = β 

(7) 
01 − β(7)10 . hence, β(8)01 be the “contextual” 

effect that model the differ between the within- and 
between-subject effect of age [26].10 the signific of 
subject age at enrol in (8) be test with the null 
hypothesi of H0 : β01 = 0, wherea restrict infer be 
need to test signific in (7) becaus the null hypothesi 
must instead be H0 : β01 = β10. 

the relationship between these two model (ct and 
ca) be similar to common approach for decoupl the 
longitudin and cross-sect effect of a time-vari 
covariate. A time-vari covari at level-1 (e.g., age or 
elaps time) exhibit variabl within, but also between 
individuals; model which assum that the within- and 
between-individu effect be equal do not properli esti- 
mate either of these effect [23], [26], [27], [28]. typically, 
the time-vari covari be “centered” on subject-specif 
means, so a to remov between-subject variat at level-1 
of the model. 

4.2 model comparison and evalu 
the goal of statist model be to find a model that 
includ substant predictor and exclud unnecessari 
one (parsimony). A common approach be to fit increasingli 
complex model to success evalu the impact of 
add differ covari [22]. model can be compar 
use goodness-of-fit measur base on log-likelihood 
statistics: deviance, akaik inform criterion (aic), and 
bayesian inform criterion (bic). devianc quantifi 
how much bad the current model be compar to the 
(hypothetical) satur model that includ all possibl co- 
variat to perfectli fit the data. becaus the log-likelihood 
(ll) of the satur model be zero, 

devianc = −2[llcurrent − llsaturated] = −2llcurrent. (9) 
9. compar all imag of a give subject to her fix enrol 

imag mean that ageij and �tij be perfectli correl at level-1 
(within-subject) of the model. hence, we cannot includ both of these 
covariates; the effect of age must be add a a level-2 covariate. 

10. the equal β(8)01 = β 
(7) 
01 − β(7)10 hold for mixed-effect model 

with random intercepts, and be approxim true for model with both 
random intercept and random slopes.

fig. 7: distribut of standard genuin comparison 
score from the two longitudin face databas use in thi

there be a total of 129,773 and 26,216 genuin score in (a) 
and (b), respectively. 

devianc can be use to compar nest model (i.e., the 
more complex model can be reduc to the simpler model 
by place constraint on it parameters) that be fit to the 
same data. To compar non-nest models, aic and bic 
penal the log-likelihood base on the complex of the 
models11 and the sampl size. smaller valu indic good 
fit for all three goodness-of-fit measures.12 

further comparison of model depend on whether the 
success model have includ a time-invari (e.g., sex, 
race) or time-vari (e.g., face imag quality) covari to 
the baselin model. for both cases, pseudo-r2 statist can 
be use to measur the proport reduct in level- 
2 varianc (σ20 , σ 

2 
1) and level-1 residu varianc (σ 

2 
ε ) at- 

tribut to inclus of time-invari and time-vari 
covariates, respectively. 

5 result 
We first focu on analysi of the pcso LS database, start 
with simpler model (i.e., model A and bt) and progress 
to more complex model includ covari for subject 
sex/rac and face imag quality. We then present result for 
the leo LS database. recal that model be discuss in 
section 4 and equat be provid in tabl 4. all model 
in our analysi be fit with full maximum likelihood (ml) es- 
timat via iter gener least-squar (gls) use 
the lme4 packag (v1.1-9) [29] for R (v3.2.2). 

5.1 model assumpt 

while mixed-effect model be capabl of handl non- 
gaussian respons distribut (e.g., cots-a genuin 
score in fig. 7a), the error term must follow gaussian dis- 
tribution. fig. 8a show normal probabl plot of the level- 
1 residuals, εij , from fit model BT to genuin score 
from the pcso LS database. sinc signific departur 
from linear be observ at the tails, we cannot verifi 
that the model assumpt hold; normal probabl plot 
of random effects, b0i and b1i, also depart from linear 

11. for full ML estimation, the number of paramet includ both 
the fix effect and the varianc components. 

12. for aic and bic, the magnitud of the reduct in model fit be 
difficult to interpret.

on the pcso LS and leo LS databas (top and bottom 
rows, respectively). departur from normal at the tail of 
the distribut be like due to low qualiti face imag or

(figs. 8b, 8c). thi behavior be observ for other model 
a well, preclud the use of standard error for formal 
hypothesi test of paramet [30]. 

when parametr model assumpt be violated, it be 
common to resort to non-parametr bootstrap to estab- 
lish confid interv for the paramet estimates, a 
follow in yoon and jain [9]. hence, for the pcso LS 
database, we conduct a non-parametr bootstrap by case 
resampl [30]; 1,000 bootstrap replic be gener 
by sampl 18,007 subject with replacement. multilevel 
model be fit to each bootstrap replicate, and the mean 
paramet estim over all 1,000 bootstrap be reported. 
test for fix effect paramet can be conduct by ex- 

amin the bootstrap confid intervals.13 tabl 5 give 
the bootstrap paramet estim (with 95% confid 
intervals), varianc components, and goodness-of-fit for the 
model in tabl 4. 

5.2 uncondit mean model (model A) 

the simplest mixed-effect model be the uncondit 
mean model, which partit the total variat in com- 
parison score by subject. denot model A in tabl 4, and 
with composit form of yij = β00+b0i+εij , b0i be the subject- 
specif mean and β00 be the grand mean. similar to analysi of 
varianc (anova), model A provid initi estim of 
the within-subject varianc σ2ε (i.e., deviat around each 
subject’ own mean comparison score) and the between- 
subject varianc σ20 (i.e., deviat of subject-specif mean 
around the grand mean). the intraclass correl coef- 
ficient (icc) quantifi the proport of between-subject 
variat in the response, ρ = σ20/(σ 

2 
0 + σ 

2 
ε). varianc 

compon for model A show in tabl 5 indic that 
between-subject differ in genuin score (i.e., biometr 
zoo) account for 38.7% (ρ = 0.3873) of the total variat 
in genuin score from the pcso LS database. baselin 
goodness-of-fit measur be also show in tabl 5. 

5.3 uncondit growth model (model bt) 

the next model to consid in longitudin analysi be the 
uncondit growth model that includ the time-rel 
covariate. In our case, we add elaps time, �tij , a well 
a random effect for slopes, b1i, to model A, result 
in model bt. tabl 5 show that model BT estim that 
pcso LS genuin score decreas by 0.1364 standard de- 
viation per one-year increas in elaps time (see solid 
black line in fig. 9). compar the level-1 residu variat 
of model A and bt, elaps time explain 35.6% of the 

13. the null hypothesi of the paramet equal to 0 can be reject at 
signific of 0.05 if the 95% confid interv do not contain 0.

fig. 9: result from model BT on cots-a genuin 
score from the pcso LS database. the bootstrap-estim 
population-mean trend be show in black (bootstrap confi- 
denc interv be too small to be visible). the blue and 
green band plot region of 95% and 99% confidence, respec- 
tively, for subject-specif variat around the population- 
mean trend. grey dot line addit add one stan- 
dard deviat of estim residu variation, σε. hence, 
model BT estim that 95% and 99% of the subject trend 
fall within the blue and green bands, but score can vari 
around their trends, extend to the grey dot lines.

longitudin chang estim by model BT impli that 
the population-mean trend will drop below the threshold for 
0.01% and 0.1% far after 19.1 and 24.0 year elaps time, 
respectively, but thi onli provid insight into perform 
on subject in the popul with averag (or higher) 
genuin score over time. A reliabl face recognit system 
must be abl to recogn much more than just 50% of the 
popul it encounters, so we be also interest in the 
spread of the popul around the population-mean trend. 
Do all subject close follow the population-mean trend, or 
be there larg variabl between subjects? Do biometr zoo 
effect extend to rate of chang over time? 

use the estim varianc compon for slope and 
intercept (σ20 , σ 

2 
1 , and σ01), we comput a 2D confid 

ellips (random effect be assum to be 2D gaussian 
distributed) to defin a region that contains, for example, 
95% of the estim subject-specif parameters. In order to 
translat from the 2D space of intercept and slope to obtain 
a confid region for genuin score versu elaps time, 
we sampl 100 combin of intercept and slope param- 
eter along the contour of the confid ellipse, comput 
the predict genuin score for each of the 100 trends, and 
defin the confid region a between the minimum and 
maximum predict score for differ valu of elaps 
time. result be show in fig. 9. 

from the confid band of subject variat in fig. 9, 
we infer that genuin score for 99% of the popul 
will remain abov the threshold at 0.01% far for up to 

14. use pseudo-r2 = (σ2ε(a)− σ2ε(bt ))/σ2ε(a).

5.4 age at enrol (model CT and D) 

We next investig whether the population-mean trend in 
genuin score over time depend on a subject’ absolut age 
(i.e., whether variat in subject-specif trend observ in 
model BT can be explain by differ in subject age). 
the signific of the agei term in model CT suggest 
a neg linear relationship between age at enrol and 
genuin scores, but the magnitud of β01 be rel small. 

To further test the complex of the effect of age 
at enrollment, we add addit term associ with 
ageie, result in model D (see tabl 4). the hypothesi 
of interest be 1) old subject be easi to recogn than 
young subjects, and 2) young subject age at faster 
rate than old subjects. these two hypothesi manifest in 
young subject have low genuin scores, on average, 
and steeper neg rate of change. tabl 5 show that

fig. 11: model E fit to cots-a genuin score from the 
pcso LS database. population-mean trend be plot by 
subject demograph of sex and race and for five differ 
age at enrol (20 to 60 years). each trend line rep- 
resent seven year of elaps time after enrollment. for 
example, the solid blue line begin at ageij = 20 year 
repres the averag decreas in genuin score for white 
male enrol at age 20 with queri imag until age 27. 

the interact term agei × �tij in model D be not 
significantli differ from zero becaus the 95% confid 
interv for β11 contain zero; hence, we cannot conclud 
that subject enrol age have a linear effect on rate of 
chang in cots-a genuin scores. the statist signif- 
icant β02 coeffici indic a quadrat relationship be- 
tween subject enrol age and intercepts, and goodness- 
of-fit measur be low compar to model bt. however, 
further compar to model bt, level-2 variat in random 
effect for intercept (σ20) be onli reduc by 0.4% after 
includ agei terms. the differ between score for 
differ age at enrol be margin compar to the 
chang in score due to elaps time; the chang in score 
between a 20 year-old and a 30 or 50 year-old (at enrollment) 
be equival to onli 7 and 5 month of elaps time (within- 
subject longitudin change), respectively. 

5.5 sex and race (model E) 

model E in tabl 4 be use to test the effect of subject 
sex and race. first, we observ that model E result in 
good model fit than model D (devianc for model E be 
285,712 compar to 286,967 for model d). the main effect 
of subject sex be statist non-zero at signific level of 
0.05, but the main effect of subject race be not (the 95% boot- 
strap confid interv contain 0). male genuin score 
at baselin (�tij = 0 years) be 0.3987 standard devia- 
tion high than femal scores. signific interact with 
elaps time indic that rate of chang in genuin score 
depend on both sex and race; population-mean slope be 
−0.0113 and −0.0267 standard deviat steeper for male 
and black subjects, respectively. population-mean trend 
separ by subject demograph be show in fig. 11 
for differ age at enrollment. while male genuin score 
decreas at slightli faster rate than femal scores, male 
be clearli easi to recogn with high genuin score

ad level-2 covari (i.e., time-invari valu for 
each subject, such a ageie) cannot improv the fit of the 
model at level-1 (within-subject). tabl 5 show that the 
level-1 residu variat σ2ε (i.e., deviat of score around 
each subject’ own linear trend) be quit larg when time 
be the onli level-1 covari for all model consid thu 
far. one standard deviat of level-1 residu variat 
estim by model BT (and similarli model CT and D) 
be equival to 4.6 year of elaps time (calcul as√ 

σ2ε/β10 = 
√ 
0.3912/−0.1372). thi be visual show by 

the dot grey line in fig. 9. 
level-1 residu variat can onli be reduc by level-1 

time-vari covari (i.e., image-specific); in thi section 
we investig whether face imag qualiti measur can 
be use to improv the model fit. the qualiti measur 
consid be interpupillari distanc (ipd) and a “frontal” 
score, both of which be output by cots-a. while high 
frontal indic good quality, the rang of the frontal 
score have littl meaning, sinc it comput be proprietary. 
We standard (z-score) the frontal score so we can 
interpret model paramet a standard deviat from the 
mean of the frontal score from all imag in pcso ls. 

after find that neither of the qualiti measur alon 
explain variat in genuin score a well a model BT with 
onli elaps time a covari (detail be omit due to 
space limitations), we then add the qualiti measur to 
model bt, result in model Q in tabl 4. tabl 6 give

note how chang frontal have a great impact on 
when population-mean genuin score cross the threshold

and valu of goodness-of-fit values. 

the valu of 100 and 120 pixel for ipd in tabl 7 be 
chosen becaus we observ systemat chang in ipd 
over time (see fig. 12); in particular, mean ipd vari around 
100 pixel from 1994–2002 but increas to a consist ∼120 
pixel start in 2003. thi observation, along with corre- 
spondenc with pinella counti sheriff’ office, suggest 
that book agenc begin to adher to imag standard 
around thi time. To investig whether thi aspect of the 
data confound the estim of longitudin effect (face 
imag in late year may be of high quality), we also 
test for a differ in slope prior to 2003 versu after 
2003 by use a piecewis linear formul for the mixed- 
effect model (with a breakpoint at 2003). We found that 
slope after 2003 be significantli flatter (less negative). 

addit face qualiti factor know to caus chang 
in face recognit perform be illumination, expres- 
sion, and occlusions. however, there be no wide accept 
method for quantifi such variat in face imag and 
do so be beyond the scope of thi paper.

model A estim that 40% of the total variat in 
genuin score be due to between-subject differences. the 
longitudin chang in genuin score estim by both 
model BT and model CT indic that a one year increas 
in elaps time decreas genuin score by β10 = −0.1699 
standard deviations. from the confid band of subject 
variat in fig. 13 (estim by model bt), we infer that 
genuin score for 99% of the popul will remain abov

repres the averag decreas in genuin score for white 
male enrol at age 20 with queri imag until age 27. 

involv agei result in signific effect of enrol 
age in model D. the signific β02 coeffici indic 
a downward quadrat relationship between age at en- 
rollment and averag genuin score (similar to cots-a 
on pcso ls). furthermore, the signific interact term 
agei ×�tij indic that longitudin chang in score 
tend to vari with subject’ age at enrollment; a 10-year 
increas in subject age result in a longitudin slope that 
be β11 = −0.0098 standard deviat steeper. population- 
mean rate of chang rang from −0.1784 to −0.1490 stan- 
dard deviat per year for subject with age at enrol 
of 20 to 50 year (calcul a β10 + β11ageie). recal that 
age at enrol have no effect on rate of chang for cots- 
A on pcso ls. 

model E result indic that intercept be 0.0565 and 
0.4238 standard deviat high for black and male sub- 
jects, respect (so, black-mal subject have intercept 
that be 0.4803 standard deviat high than white- 
femal subjects). slope be not statist differ for 
black and white subjects, but the population-mean slope for 
male be steeper (i.e., more negative) than for females. these 
population-mean trend be show in fig. 14 for differ 
age at enrollment. fig. 14 also show that the differ 
between subject race be minor compar to differ 
between male and females, a be also the case for cots-a 
on the pcso LS database. 

6 conclus 

We present a longitudin studi of automat face 
recognition, util two larg oper databas of 
mugshots, pcso LS (147,784 imag of 18,007 subjects, 
avg. 8 imag per subject over avg. 8.5 years) and leo LS 
(31,852 imag of 5,636 subjects, avg. 6 imag per subject 
over avg. 5.8 years), where each subject have at least four face 

imag acquir over at least a five-year time span. lin- 
ear mixed-effect regress model be use to analyz 
variat in genuin score due to elaps time, age, sex, 
and race, a well a subject-specif differ in score (i.e., 
biometr zoo effects). face similar score be obtain 
from state-of-the-art cot matcher for both the pcso LS 
and leo LS databases. base on our analysis, we make the 
follow observ (statement appli to both databas 
and matchers): 

� population-mean trend indic that genuin score 
significantli decreas with increas elaps time between 
enrol (gallery) and queri (probe) images, a expected. 
however, population-mean trend (averag genuin scores) 
do not fall below threshold at 0.01% far until after 15 year 
elaps time. thi suggest that in a practic application, an 
averag individual’ genuin score decreas at a rate that 
will not affect the recognit accuraci at 0.01% far until 
more than 15 year sinc enrollment. 

� signific subject-specif variabl around the 
population-mean trend be observed; genuin score for 
some subject declin at much faster rate than the 
population-mean. analysi of the estim varianc in 
subject-specif paramet (intercept and slopes) allow 
for estim of subject-bas accuraci (i.e., how mani 
subject be estim to be fals rejected, rather than 
standard image-bas accuraci calculations). for example, 
the model estim that genuin score for 99% of the 
popul will remain abov the threshold at 0.01% far 
until 6.5 year elaps time for pcso LS and 5.5 year for 
leo ls. other calcul (e.g. 95% of the population) be 
also within approxim one year for both databases. 

� subject-specif varianc in rate of chang (i.e., linear 
slopes) be onli margin attribut to subject age at 
enrollment, sex, and race. subject sex be the most signifi- 
cant factor for between-subject differ in genuin scores, 
with male have significantli high genuin score than 
females. the magnitud of the differ suggest that fals 
reject error may occur approxim two year earli for 
femal than for male (assum that a global threshold be 
use operationally). 

� while the model fit improv for more complex mod- 
el incorpor simpl measur of face qualiti (for the 
pcso LS database), the model be still limit for predict 
purposes. the within-subject variabl (i.e., level-1 residu 
variance) be still quit large. all model consid in thi 
studi indic that one standard deviat in genuin score 
due to short-term variat (e.g., illumination, hairstyle, 
etc.) be approxim equival to the chang in genuin 
score due to ±4 year of elaps time (for these particular 
databas and matchers). 

longitudin analysis, in general, be an important, yet 
veri difficult, problem. To the best of our knowledge, no 
proper statist analysi have yet be conduct for study- 
ing face recognit perform on a larg popul over 
period of time longer than five years. In thi paper, we 
attempt to analyz the covari of interest that be 
avail to u (elaps time, age, sex, race, some measur 
of quality), but there be addit covari that cannot 
be account for becaus we do not have the inform 
(e.g., camera characteristics, ipd for the leo LS database, 
express variations, etc.). despit this, the longitudin

of subjects, number of imag per subject, and time span of 
subject images, respectively) face imag databas studi

nition system continu to improve, longitudin analysi

servat about recognit accuraci in thi paper appli to 
verif scenario (i.e., one-to-on comparisons) oper

gitudin analysi on differ face crop (particularly, 
pre-crop imag to exclud most of the hair region) to 
investig the impact of chang hairstyl over time.
