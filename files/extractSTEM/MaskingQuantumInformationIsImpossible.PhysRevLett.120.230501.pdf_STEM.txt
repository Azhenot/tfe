classic inform encod in composit quantum state can be complet hidden from the reduc 
subsystem and may be found onli in the correlations. can the same be true for quantum information? If 
quantum inform be hidden from subsystem and spread over quantum correlation, we call it mask 
of quantum information. We show that while thi may still be true for some restrict set of nonorthogon 
quantum states, it be not possibl for arbitrari quantum states. thi result suggest that quantum qubit 
commitment—a strong version of the quantum bit commitment—i not possibl in general. our find 
may have potenti applic in secret share and futur quantum commun protocols.

In a quantumworld, inform encod in arbitrari pure 
quantum state cannot be copi perfectly, a result know a 
the no-clon theorem [1–4]. It play an import role in 
sever quantum inform process task like quantum 
key distribut [5] and quantum teleport [6]. It be 
also show that imposs of copi pure state can be 
extend to arbitrari densiti matrix result in the no- 
broadcast theorem [7,8]. On the other hand, delet 
quantum inform in a close system be also know to be 
imposs [9]. all these no-go theorem be consequ 
of the linear and the unitar of quantummechanics. If we 
be give a set of nonorthogon states, unitar prohibit 
clone or delet of quantum states. A strong version of 
the no-clon theorem state that a quantum copi 
machin exist onli when the blank state alreadi poss 
the full inform of the input state [10]. togeth with the 
no-delet theorem, it give a perman to quantum 
information—a notion that be onli true for quantum infor- 
mation which do not hold in a classic world (for other 
no-go theorems; see refs. [11–14] and in particular the no- 
go theorem on quantum bit commit [15,16]). 
not surprisingly, the no-clon and the no-delet 

theorem be close connect to the conserv of 
inform and the second law of thermodynam 
[17,18]. thi give u an impress that quantum infor- 
mation be truli robust in some sense. however, we also 
know that when a quantum system interact with the 
extern world, it may lose it coher and inform 
from a quantum state may disappear complet from the 
origin system in some extrem cases. can such phenom- 
ena indic loss of inform like the maxwel demon 
[19]? however, use the linear and the unitar of 
quantum mechanics, one can prove that whenev there be 
loss of inform from one system there must be 
appear of the same in some subspac of the 

environ [20]. thi be know a the no-hid theorem. 
It show that there be no inform loss in realiti and 
conserv of quantum inform in it full gener 
holds. A recent experi use nuclear magnet reso- 
nanc show that inde inform be conserv when a 
qubit undergo state random and can be fulli 
recov from the ancillari state by appli a local 
unitari oper in the ancillari hilbert space [21]. 
let u now consid an exampl of hide classic 

inform by use quantum correl of a two- 
parti state. suppos we encod a singl bit of classic 
inform in two orthogon entangl state where the 
encod map be give by j0i → ð1= ffiffiffi2p þðj00i þ j11iþ and 
j1i → ð1= ffiffiffi2p þðj00i − j11iþ. If we look at state of both the 
subsystems, it have no inform about the classic bit. 
here, we can say that although classic inform be 
actual hidden from both the subsystems, it be spread over 
quantum correl of the encod states. 
In thi letter, we deal with the encod of quantum 

inform in an arbitrari composit quantum state. We 
ask the question, can quantum inform be hidden from 
both the subsystem and remain onli in the correlation? If 
so, then somehow quantum inform get spread over 
the “spooky” correl [22] and remain invis to both 
the subsystem that be possess by the local observers. 
We call thi spread of quantum inform over 
quantum correl a “masking” quantum information. 
We prove that such mask be not possibl for arbitrari 
quantum states, although we have alreadi see that it be 
possibl for classic inform to be masked. for some 
restrict class of quantum states, however, mask be 
possible. indeed, we show that there be set of quantum 
state whose inform we can mask, which be con- 
tinuou and contain nonorthogon states.

our result have immedi applic in quantum bit 
commit [15] and quantum secret share protocol 
[23–27]. In quantum bit commitment, the receiv (bob) be 
blind to the sender’ (alice’s) commit bit, and thi be 
translat to the condit that the subsystem of the 
encod entangl state have no inform about the 
commit bit. We propos a quantum qubit commit 
where alic be commit to a qubit chosen from an 
alphabet of qubit states, and late she want to convinc 
bob that she have inde chosen one of the state from that 
set. from our result, it follow that such a scheme be not 
possible, in general. sinc the classic bit be a special case 
of a qubit (obtain by pass the qubit through a 
dephas channel), no bit commit also follow from 
our theorem. moreover, our result impli that the set of 
state which can be mask be use for quantum secret 
share and may have applic in futur quantum 
commun protocols. 
mask quantum information.—w begin by formal 

defin mask of quantum information. 
definit 1.—an oper S be say to mask quantum 

inform contain in state fjakia ∈ hag by map 
them to state fjψkiab ∈ HA ⊗ hbg such that all the 
margin state of jψkiab be identical; i.e., 

ρa¼trbðjψkiabhψkjþ and ρb¼traðjψkiabhψkjþ ð1þ 

have no inform about the valu of k. 
We call such a machin S the masker. sinc the action of 

the masker be a physic process, it can be model by a 
unitari oper US on the system A plu an ancillari 
system B, give by 

S∶ usjakia ⊗ jbib ¼ jψkiab: ð2þ 

thi be a linear transform and it preserv orthogon- 
ality. moreover, if S can mask inform in a set of state 
fjakig, then it can mask the inform contain in a state 
whose densiti matrix can be express a a linear combi- 
nation of densiti matrix fjakihakjg. furthermore, it be 
import to requir that neither A nor B contain the 
inform of the initi state. otherwis a simpl appli- 
cation of swap gate will mask the inform for A by 
simpli transfer it to B. therefore, we demand that 
mask inform sole lie in the correl between 
A and B. thi mean that the final state must be an 
entangl pure state and the margin state A and B 
contain exactli the same information. 
We now prove that it be imposs to mask the 

inform in ani arbitrari quantum state. thi theorem 
be in the same spirit a the no-clon and no-delet 
theorem [1,2,9]. however, we will show below that the set 
of maskabl state be much richer than the set of state 
which can be clone and deleted. 

theorem 2.—no masker can mask all state of a qubit 
in h2. 
proof.—let u assum that S can mask all state of a 

qubit in ha. let fjkig1k¼0 be an orthonorm basi on HA 
and the action of the masker give u s∶jki → jψki, where 
jψki be also orthonormal. now, let u express an arbitrari 
quantum state in term of the basi element of an 
orthonorm basi a jai ¼ p1k¼0 αkjki. We now assum 
that jai can be masked; i.e., 

jai¼α1j0iþα2j1i→ jψi¼α1jψ0iþα2jψ1i; ð3þ 

where jα1j2 þ jα2j2 ¼ 1. next, we take partial trace with 
respect to either A or B to get 

trx½jψihψj� ¼ ρY þ trxðα1α�2jψ0ihψ1jþ 
þ α�1α2trxðjψ1ihψ0jþ; ð4þ 

where fx; Yg ∈ fa; Bg and X ≠ Y. the last equat 
satisfi the mask condit if the off-diagon term 
vanish, namely, 

α1α 
� 
2trxðjψ0ihψjþ þ α�1α2trxðjψ1ihψ0jþ ¼ 0; ð5þ 

for arbitrari α1 and α2. It impli that we have 

trxðjψ0ihψ1jþ ¼ trxðjψ1ihψ0jþ ¼ 0: ð6þ 

We will now show that the abov condit cannot be 
satisfi for an arbitrari qubit. To prove this, we will use a 
result, give in ref. [28], for write two orthogon states, 
which be give by 

jψ0i ¼ jμi ⊗ j0i þ jνi ⊗ j1i and 
jψ1i ¼ jμ⊥i ⊗ j0i þ jν⊥i ⊗ j1i; ð7þ 

where jμi and jνi be not necessarili normal and not 
mutual orthogon while jμi (jνi) and jμ⊥i (jν⊥i) be 
mutual orthogonal. sinc the mask state be orthogo- 
nal, we will use thi decomposition. let u now comput 
the partial trace with respect to B explicitly. We have 

trb½jψ0ihψ0j� ¼ jμihμj þ jνihνj; ð8þ 

trb½jψ1ihψ1j� ¼ jμ⊥ihμ⊥j þ jν⊥ihν⊥j; ð9þ 

trb½jψ0ihψ1j� ¼ jμihμ⊥j þ jνihν⊥j: ð10þ 

use eq. (1), we get 

jμihμj þ jνihνj ¼ jμ⊥ihμ⊥j þ jν⊥ihν⊥j: 

the expect valu of the abov equat with respect 
to jμi give 

physic review letter 120, 230501 (2018) 

230501-2 



jhμjμij2 þ jhνjμij2 ¼ jhν⊥jμij2: ð11þ 

now use eq. (6) and take the expect valu of the 
oper in eq. (10) with respect to jμi, we get 

hμjνihν⊥jμi ¼ 0; ð12þ 

which impli either hμjνi ¼ 0 or hν⊥jμi ¼ 0. but in either 
case that make eq. (11) into 

jhν⊥jμij2 ¼ jhμjμij2 or jhνjμij2 ¼ −jhμjμij2: ð13þ 

the latter be a contradiction, while in the former case, we 
have jν⊥i ¼ eiϕjμi. use thi fact and take the inner 
product in eq. (10) with hμj and jμ⊥i, we obtain 

hμjtrbðjψ0ihψ1jþjμ⊥i ¼ hμjμihμ⊥jμ⊥i ¼ 0: ð14þ 

the last equat mean that either jμi ¼ 0 or jμ⊥i ¼ 0. If 
so, in either case, the state in eq. (7) be not entangled, 
impli that the state of A and B can be simpli swapped. 
thi be a contradiction. therefore, arbitrari qubit cannot 
be masked. ▪ 
abov we have show that arbitrari two-dimension 

quantum state cannot be masked. We will now show that 
thi theorem hold in arbitrari dimensions. interestingly, 
note that the proof that be give below in arbitrari 
dimens be differ than that in theorem 2. In particular, 
theorem 3 below us the schmidt decomposition, instead 
of the decomposit of two orthogon state [28]. 
theorem 3.—an arbitrari quantum state cannot be 

masked. 
proof.—se supplement materi [29]. ▪ 
the no-loc broadcast theorem [30] cleanli differ- 

entiat between classic information, which can be copied, 
and quantum information, which cannot be copied. such be 
not the case with mask of quantum inform becaus 
there be a continu famili of quantum state that can be 
masked. thi find blur the boundari that separ the 
quantum and classic worlds. We now defin such a masker 
S♯ and identifi the set of state that S♯ can mask. let 
fjkigdk¼1 be an orthonorm basi in ha. the joint unitari 
oper correspond to the masker S♯ be give by 

s♯∶ jkbiab → jkkiab: ð15þ 

theorem 4.—masker S♯ can mask the quantum infor- 
mation if it act on a state belong to a famili of state 
on the great hyperdisk whose extrem state be fjai ¼ 
ð1= ffiffiffidp þpkeiϕk jkig, with the quantum inform encod 
in the continu paramet fϕk ∈ ½−π; π�g. 

proof.—us S♯ in eq. (15) we have 

s♯jabi ¼ 1ffiffiffi 
d 

p 
X 

k 

eiϕk jkki ¼ jψi: ð16þ 

A partial trace with either system yield a maxim mix 
state. By convexity, we can mask all state on the great 
hyperdisk. ▪ 
the masker S♯ can also mask ani famili of state fjãi ¼P 
ke 

iϕkrkjkig that have the amplitud rk in common. In 
fact, abov we have onli consid the special case where 
rk ¼ 1= 

ffiffiffi 
d 

p ∀k. theorem 4 can be proven in thi more 
gener case with minor modifications. the key differ 
be that the margin state for thi case be diagon in the 
basi jkiwith eigenvalu jrkj2. therefore, the margin do 
not contain ani inform about the phase. It may be 
note here that the set of state on the great hyperdisk be of 
zero measur in the set of all states. 
In the scenario that we have consid until now, 

the encod state be pure states. We can consid the 
question of whether a similar analysi be possibl in the 
situat where the masker take pure state to mix states. 
thi be an open dynamic, and to ensur that the mask be 
complete, we must requir that the local part of the 
environ state do not carri ani inform about 
the input states. We now further requir that the environ- 
ment state and the system state have vanish quantum 
correl [31]. thi be inde possible. In particular, we 
can replac the encod state in the proof of theorem 4 
by (ð1= ffiffiffidp þpkeiϕk jkkki, where the first two parti re- 
present one party, say alice, and her environ (call 
them A and (ea), while the last two parti repres the 
other party, say bob, and hi environ (call them B and 
(eb). In thi case, reduc densiti matrix of the system a 
well a the environ be classic correlated, have 
zero quantum correlations, and the mask work a 
before. note, however, that the state in the aea: beb 
partit be still entangled. 
conjectur 5.—base on the structur of the masker S♯ 

in eq. (15), we conjectur that the maskabl state 
correspond to ani masker belong to some disk. 
no qubit commitment.—in a bit commit protocol, 

alic commit to a bit 0 or 1 and late she provid bob 
classic or quantum inform that reveal the commit 
bit. An ideal bit commit protocol should ensur 
bob that alic be inde commit to her initi bit and 
bob can learn no inform about the commit bit 
befor the open phase. however, the entangl 
base cheat strategi make ani quantum bit commit- 
ment protocol imposs in the nonrelativist domain (see 
ref. [32] and refer therein). let u briefli recal the 
cheat strategy. suppos that alic prepar two two- 
particl quantum state jψ0i and jψ1i correspond to bit 
0 or 1, keep one particle, and send the other to bob. As 
bob have no inform about 0 or 1, thi make the 

physic review letter 120, 230501 (2018) 

230501-3 



reduc densiti matrix ρB ¼ trajψ0ihψ0j ¼ trajψ1ihψ1j. 
thi condit then impli that jψ0i ¼ 

P 
i 

ffiffiffiffi 
λi 

p ja0i ijbii 
and jψ1i ¼ 

P 
i 

ffiffiffiffi 
λi 

p ja1i ijbii. however, jψ0i ¼ UA ⊗ 
ibjψ1i a they differ onli by a local chang of basis. 
thi be the key to cheating, becaus dure the unveil 
stage, alic can decid to do noth or appli a local 
unitari on her particle. thus, she can alway cheat on her 
commit bit. 
our result can have applic in a no qubit commit- 

ment protocol where alic commit to a qubit from a 
certain set (that can potenti also contain nonorthogon 
states), instead of a bit, and late unveil to bob that she have 
inde commit to that qubit. suppos alic want to 
commit to an arbitrari state of a qubit from a set fjψig. 
then she need to prepar an entangl state jψðψþi for 
each jψi with the condit that ρB ¼ trajψihψj be 
independ of jψi. but, by the no-mask theorem, it 
be imposs to achiev thi if the set fjψig be the set of all 
states. hence, commit to an arbitrari qubit or qudit be 
impossible. however, there be a trivial way to commit; i.e., 
alic encod jψi in a product state jψij0i and ρB have no 
inform about jψi. but in thi encod it be trivial to 
cheat. In the second scenario, we ask if it be possibl to 
commit to two quantum state and have a qubit commit- 
ment protocol. By our result, it be possibl to mask two 
quantum state and, hence, alic can ensur that the 
commit qubit or qudit be blind to bob. but again, by 
entangl cheat strategy, alic can alway cheat. 
the usual no bit commit proof may be consid a a 
dephas version of a no qubit commit protocol. 
To illustr the cheat strategi in the qubit commit- 

ment protocol, imagin that alic commit a qubit state 
chosen from two nonorthogon state jψ1i and jψ2i, where 

jψ1i ¼ 
1 

2 
ðj0i þ j1iþ; jψ2i ¼ 

1 

2 
ðj0i þ eiϕj1iþ: ð17þ 

note that these two state can be mask by a map give by 

jψ1i→ 
1 

2 
ðj00iþj11iþ; jψ2i→ 

1 

2 
ðj00iþeiϕj11iþ: ð18þ 

she keep one of the qubit and send the other qubit to 
bob. becaus of the fact that these two state have the same 
local reduc state, bob do not know which qubit alic 
have actual commit to. alice’ task be to convinc bob 
that she have inde commit to one of these two non- 
orthogon states. however, thi be not possible. even if she 
have commit to a qubit chosen from fjψ1i; jψ2ig at the 
unveil phase, alic can appli a local unitari trans- 
format that can chang jψ1i ↔ jψ2i. thi can be 
achiev by a unitari oper that map j0i ↔ j0i and 
j1i ↔ eiϕj1i. therefore, even if alic can choos a qubit 
state from a set that can be masked, it be possibl to cheat at 
the open stage of the protocol. 

It should be stress that it be not possibl to deriv the no 
qubit commit result from the no bit commit one. 
thi be becaus even though there be more inform to be 
hidden by alice, there be also more inform to be 
extract by bob, and there be more space in the hilbert 
space for hiding, a we be consid nonorthogon 
state for encoding, unlik orthogon state for bit commit- 
ment. moreover, we be hide quantum inform 
instead of classic information. the comparison be similar 
to that in quantum error correct or in fault toler 
quantum comput versu their classic sisters. 
focus on error correction, we know that classic error 
correct exist even though classic error tri to 
frustrat or destroy classic information. quantum nois 
be far richer and destroy quantum inform through far 
richer channels. however, there be also far richer way of 
correct error in the quantum world, and it be inde 
possibl to have quantum error correct codes. 
conclusions.—it be possibl to encod classic informa- 

tion in share quantum state in such a way that the 
inform be not in the reduc state of the subsystems, 
but onli in the correlations. the question that we ask in thi 
letter be whether the same can be possibl for quantum 
information—can quantum inform be “masked”, i.e., 
encod onli in the correlations? interestingly, it turn out 
that while thi be in gener not possible, i.e., it be not possibl 
to mask arbitrari quantum states, quantum inform in 
certain restrict set of states, that contain nonorthogon 
states, can be masked. the result be in a certain sens 
complementari to no clone and no deleting, a clone and 
delet be possibl onli for orthogon quantum states. 
however, if we allow for more than two parties, i.e., A, 

B, C, and so on, then it be possibl to mask an arbitrari 
quantum state. A straightforward exampl of thi be to use 
an error correct code [33]. however, collus between 
ani two parti would then reveal the encod quantum 
information, at least in part. thi have import implica- 
tion for quantum interact prover scenario [34]. In 
other words, the goal of quantum error correct be to store 
all quantum inform in correlation. therefore, the no- 
go theorem here fundament limit the amount and the 
flavor of quantum inform that can be store in bipartit 
quantum correlations. 
moreover, our mask protocol form the basi for 

quantum secret share [23,25]. quantum mechan 
allow for secret share of classic inform from a 
so-cal “boss” to her “subordinates,” such that the 
subordin be unabl to retriev the inform without 
collabor between themselves. It be clear that the state 
chosen by the bo to encod the secret classic bit, and 
send to her subordinates, can be from a set of orthogon 
quantum state that can be masked, a mask inform 
cannot be decod by the subordin by local quantum 
oper without classic communication. similarly, 
if the bo want to send quantum inform to her 

physic review letter 120, 230501 (2018) 

230501-4 



subordinates, she have to choos from a set of quantum 
states, which, in general, will not be orthogonal. the result 
obtain here can therefor be use to choos the substrat 
for secret share of classic or quantum information. 
the analysi of the set of state that can be mask 

reveal that quantum inform store strictli in the 
phase can alway be masked. thi be interest from 
the perspect that it be the phase of the quantum state that 
be consid to be the quintessenti quantum aspect, 
and, for example, lead to quantum interference, and it be 
exactli thi phase that can be mask just like classic 
information. quantum state have inform onli in the 
phase fall on a hyperdisk. the fact that such quantum 
state can be mask remind u of other quantum 
inform strategi and result like remot state prepa- 
ration [35,36], measurement-bas quantum comput 
[37], the no universal-not gate [38], and parallel and 
antiparallel state [39,40]. 
In thi respect, it be interest to uncov whether there 

can be a (probabilistic) mixtur of two orthogon mix 
multipartit state so that there be no inform avail 
about the probabl when the mixtur be access locally. 
however, there will still be a classic bit that will be hidden 
(“local masked”), if thi question be answer in the 
affirmative. It be also interest to know if there can be a set 
of superpos state of three orthogon pure multiparti 
state so that there be no inform avail about the 
(complex) superposit coeffici when an arbitrari 
element of the set be access locally. If true, thi will 
be local mask of a qutrit. 
the no-mask theorem impli that quantum qubit 

commitment—of which quantum bit commit be a 
dephas version—i not possible. We have also discuss 
the potenti of use the set of maskabl set a substrat 
for secret share of classic and quantum information. It 
be also possibl to see that one can consid variat of the 
masker consid here, in particular, a partial maskers, 
local maskers, and stochast approxim maskers. our 
result will have import applic in quantum com- 
munic and quantum inform protocol that requir 
hide of inform in composit quantum systems.
