abstract 

We develop an algorithm that can detect 
pneumonia from chest x-ray at a level ex- 
ceed practic radiologists. our algo- 
rithm, chexnet, be a 121-layer convolut 
neural network train on chestx-ray14, cur- 
rentli the larg publicli avail chest X- 
ray dataset, contain over 100,000 frontal- 
view x-ray imag with 14 diseases. four 
practic academ radiologist annot a 
test set, on which we compar the perfor- 
manc of chexnet to that of radiologists. 
We find that chexnet exce averag radi- 
ologist perform on pneumonia detect 
on both sensit and specificity. We extend 
chexnet to detect all 14 diseas in chestx- 
ray14 and achiev state of the art result on 
all 14 diseases. 

1. introduct 

more than 1 million adult be hospit with pneu- 
monia and around 50,000 die from the diseas everi 
year in the US alon (cdc, 2017). chest x-ray 
be current the best avail method for diagnos 
pneumonia (who, 2001), play a crucial role in clin- 
ical care (franquet, 2001) and epidemiolog studi 
(cherian et al., 2005). however, detect pneumo- 
nia in chest x-ray be a challeng task that reli on 
the avail of expert radiologists. In thi work, we 
present a model that can automat detect pneu- 
monia from chest x-ray at a level exceed practic

figur 2. chexnet outperform the averag of the radiologist at pneuomonia detect use x-ray images. chexnet 
be test against 4 practic radiologist on sensit (which measur the proport of posit that be correctli 
identifi a such) and specif (which measur the proport of neg that be correctli identifi a such). A 
singl radiologist’ perform be repres by an orang marker, while the averag be repres by green. chexnet 
output the probabl of detect pneumonia in a chest x-ray, and the blue curv be gener by vari the threshold 
use for the classif boundary. the sensitivity-specif point for each radiologist and for the averag lie below the 
blue curve, signifi that chexnet be abl to detect pneumonia at a level match or exceed radiologists. 

et al., 2017), which contain 112,120 frontal-view chest 
x-ray imag individu label with up to 14 differ- 
ent thorac diseases, includ pneumonia. We use 
dens connect (huang et al., 2016) and batch nor- 
maliz (ioff & szegedy, 2015) to make the opti- 
mizat of such a deep network tractable. 

detect pneumonia in chest radiographi can be diffi- 
cult for radiologists. the appear of pneumonia in 
x-ray imag be often vague, can overlap with other di- 
agnoses, and can mimic mani other benign abnormal- 
ities. these discrep caus consider variabil- 
iti among radiologist in the diagnosi of pneumonia 
(neuman et al., 2012; davi et al., 1996; hopstaken 
et al., 2004). To estim radiologist performance, we 
collect annot from four practic academ radi- 
ologist on a subset of 420 imag from chestx-ray14. 
On these 420 images, we measur perform of in- 
dividu radiologist use the major vote of other 
radiologist a ground truth, and similarli measur 
model performance. 

We find that the model exce the averag radiolo- 
gist perform at the pneumonia detect task on 
both sensit and specificity. To compar chexnet 
against previou work use chestx-ray14, we make 
simpl modif to chexnet to detect all 14 dis- 

ea in chestx-ray14, and find that we outperform 
best publish result on all 14 diseases. autom 
detect of diseas from chest x-ray at the level of 
expert radiologist would not onli have tremend 
benefit in clinic settings, it would be invalu in 
deliveri of health care to popul with inadequ 
access to diagnost imag specialists. 

2. chexnet 

2.1. problem formul 

the pneumonia detect task be a binari classif 
problem, where the input be a frontal frontal-view chest 
x-ray imag X and the output be a binari label t ∈ 
{0, 1} indic the absenc or presenc of pneumonia 
respectively. for a singl exampl in the train set, 
we optim the binari cross entropi loss 

l(x, t) = −t log p(t = 1|x)− (1− t) log p(t = 0|x) 

where p(t = i|x) be the probabl that the network 
assign to the label i. 

2.2. model architectur and train 

chexnet be a 121-layer dens convolut net- 
work (densenet) (huang et al., 2016) train on the 



chexnet: radiologist-level pneumonia detect on chest x-ray with deep learn 

chestx-ray 14 dataset. densenet improv flow of in- 
format and gradient through the network, make 
the optim of veri deep network tractable. We 
replac the final fulli connect layer with one that 
have a singl output, after which we appli a sigmoid 
nonlinearity, output the probabl that the im- 
age contain pneumonia. 

the weight of the network be randomli initi 
and train end-to-end use adam with standard pa- 
ramet (β1 = 0.9 and β2 = 0.999) (kingma & ba, 
2014). We train the model use minibatch of size 
16, where we oversampl the minor (positive) class 
(buda et al., 2017). We use an initi learn rate of 
0.01 that be decay by a factor of 10 each time the 
valid loss plateau after an epoch, and pick the 
model with the low valid loss. 

3. data 

3.1. train 

We use the chestx-ray14 dataset releas by wang 
et al. (2017) which contain 112,120 frontal-view x-ray 
imag of 30,805 uniqu patients. wang et al. (2017) 
annot each imag with up to 14 differ thorac 
patholog label use automat extract method 
on radiolog reports. We label imag that have pneu- 
monia a one of the annot patholog a posit 
exampl and label all other imag a neg exam- 
ple for the pneumonia detect task. We randomli 
split the entir dataset into 80% training, and 20% 
validation. 

befor input the imag into the network, we 
downscal the imag to 224×224 and normal base 
on the mean and standard deviat of imag in the 
imagenet train set. We also augment the train 
data with random horizont flipping. 

3.2. test 

We collect a test set of 420 frontal chest x-rays. an- 
notat be obtain independ from four prac- 
tice radiologist at stanford university, who be 
ask to label all 14 patholog in wang et al. (2017). 
the radiologist have 4, 7, 25, and 28 year of experi- 
ence, and one of the radiologist be a sub-specialti fel- 
lowship train thorac radiologist. radiologist do 
not have access to ani patient inform or knowl- 
edg of diseas preval in the data. label be 
enter into a standard data entri program. 

4. chexnet vs. radiologist 
perform 

We ass radiologist perform on the test set on 
the pneumonia detect task. recal that each of the 
imag in test420 have a ground truth label from 4 prac- 
tice radiologists. We evalu the perform of an 
individu radiologist by use the major vote of 
the other 3 radiologist a ground truth. similarly, we 
evalu chexnet use the major vote of 3 of 4 
radiologists, repeat four time to cover all group of 
3. 

We compar chexnet against radiologist on the re- 
ceiver oper characterist (roc) curve, which 
plot model sensit against 1 - specificity. figur 2 
illustr the model roc curv a well a the four 
radiologist and averag radiologist oper points: a 
singl radiologist’ perform be repres by an 
orang marker, while the averag be repres by 
green. chexnet output the probabl of detect- 
ing pneumonia in a chest x-ray, and the roc curv 
be gener by vari the threshold use for the 
classif boundary. chexnet have an auroc of 
0.788. the sensitivity-specif point for each radi- 
ologist and for the averag lie below the roc curve, 
signifi that chexnet be abl to detect pneumonia 
at a level match or exceed radiologists. 

We identifi two limit of thi setup. first, nei- 
ther the model nor the radiologist be permit 
to use prior examin or patient history, which 
have be show to decreas radiologist perform 
(berbaum et al., 1985; potchen et al., 1979). second, 
onli frontal radiograph be present to the radi- 
ologist and model dure diagnosis, but it have be 
show that up to 15% of accur diagnosi requir the 
later view (raoof et al., 2012). We thu expect that 
thi setup provid a conserv estim of human 
radiologist performance. 

5. chexnet vs. previou state of the 
art on the chestx-ray14 dataset 

We extend the algorithm to classifi multipl thorac 
patholog by make three changes. first, instead of 
output one binari label, chexnet output a vec- 
tor t of binari label indic the absenc or presenc 
of each of the follow 14 patholog classes: atelec- 
tasis, cardiomegaly, consolidation, edema, effusion, 
emphysema, fibrosis, hernia, infiltration, mass, nod- 
ule, pleural thickening, pneumonia, and pneumotho- 
rax. second, we replac the final fulli connect layer 
in chexnet with a fulli connect layer produc a 
14-dimension output, after which we appli an ele-

tabl 1. chexnet outperform the best publish result on all 14 patholog in the chestx-ray14 dataset. In detect 
mass, nodule, pneumonia, pneumothorax, and emphysema, chexnet have a margin of >0.05 auroc over previou state 
of the art results. 

mentwis sigmoid nonlinearity. the final output be the 
predict probabl of the presenc of each patholog 
class. third, we modifi the loss function to optim 
the sum of binari cross entropi loss 

l(x, t) = 

14∑ 
c=1 

[−tc log p(tc = 1|x) 

−(1− tc) log p(tc = 0|x)], 

where p(tc = 1|x) be the predict probabl that 
the imag contain the patholog c and p(tc = 0|x) 
be the predict probabl that the imag do not 
contain the patholog c. 

follow previou work on chestx-ray14 (wang 
et al., 2017; yao et al., 2017), we randomli split the 
dataset into train (70%), valid (10%), and test 
(20%) sets; the choic of split have be show to have 
insignific effect on performance. We compar the 
per-class area under the roc curv (auroc) of the 
model against the previou state of the art held by yao 
et al. (2017) on 13 class and wang et al. (2017) on 
the remain 1 class. 

We find that chexnet achiev state of the art result 
on all 14 patholog classes. tabl 1 illustr the 
per-class auroc comparison on the test set. On at- 
electasis, mass, nodule, pneumonia, and emphysema, 
we outperform previou state of the art consider 
(> 0.05 increas in auroc). 

6. model interpret 

To interpret the network predictions, we also produc 
heatmap to visual the area of the imag most in- 
dic of the diseas use class activ map 
(cams) (zhou et al., 2016). To gener the cams, 
we feed an imag into the fulli train network and 
extract the featur map that be output by the final 
convolut layer. let fk be the kth featur map and 
let wc,k be the weight in the final classif layer 
for featur map k lead to patholog c. We obtain 
a map Mc of the most salient featur use in classi- 
fy the imag a have patholog c by take the 
weight sum of the featur map use their associ- 
ate weights. formally, 

Mc = 
∑ 
k 

wc,kfk. 

We identifi the most import featur use by the 
model in it predict of the patholog c by upscal- 
ing the map Mc to the dimens of the imag and 
overlay the image.

autom diagnosi from chest radiograph have re- 
ceiv increas attent with algorithm for pul- 
monari tuberculosi classif (lakhani & sun- 
daram, 2017) and lung nodul detect (huang et al., 
2017). islam et al. (2017) studi the perform 
of variou convolut architectur on differ ab-

form wang et al. (2017) on 13 of 14 classes. 

8. conclus 

pneumonia account for a signific proport of 
patient morbid and mortal (gonçalves-pereira 
et al., 2013). earli diagnosi and treatment of pneu- 
monia be critic to prevent complic includ 
death (aydogdu et al., 2010). with approxim 2 
billion procedur per year, chest x-ray be the most 
common imag examin tool use in practice, 
critic for screening, diagnosis, and manag of a 



chexnet: radiologist-level pneumonia detect on chest x-ray with deep learn 

varieti of diseas includ pneumonia (raoof et al., 
2012). however, two third of the global popul 
lack access to radiolog diagnostics, accord to an 
estim by the world health organ (mollura 
et al., 2010). there be a shortag of expert who can in- 
terpret x-rays, even when imag equip be avail- 
able, lead to increas mortal from treatabl dis- 
ea (kesselman et al., 2016). 

We develop an algorithm which exce the perfor- 
manc of radiologist in detect pneumonia from 
frontal-view chest x-ray images. We also show that 
a simpl extens of our algorithm to detect multi- 
ple diseas outperform previou state of the art on 
chestx-ray14, the larg publicli avail chest X- 
ray dataset. with autom at the level of experts, 
we hope that thi technolog can improv healthcar 
deliveri and increas access to medic imag ex- 
pertis in part of the world where access to skill 
radiologist be limited.
