We complain about split attention, but whi then do we embrac distraction? 

advertis 

My attent span have shrunk 

alarmingly, and i’m easili distracted. worse, I seem to 

look for and welcom distractions. I should be 

focu my attent on the task at hand, which be 

write thi small essay. instead I keep check the 

internet with my smartphone. I look around me at 

thi coffe shop and everyon seem to be star at 

their cellphones. I don’t think we use to be like this, 

and I wonder: ha technolog do thi to us, and if 

so, be thi bad or good? 

I can’t help it. 

A recent book by adam gazzaley and larri rosen, 

(mit 

press, 2016), examin thi phenomenon from the 

viewpoint of neurosci and psychology. the 

author contend that, just a ancient human forag 

for food, we now forag for information. “we be 

information-seek creatures,” they affirm. I assum 

that they do mean to includ person 

commun and entertain in the gener 

concept of information, a otherwis the sheer 

number of emoji-laden text and 

consum daili would milit against their 

thesis.

our behavior be liken by gazzaley and rosen to that 

of squirrel forag for food in a patchi environment. 

As a squirrel experi diminish food in it 

present patch, it instinct decid when to move to 

anoth patch. the squirrel be appar 

subconsci awar of the margin valu theorem, 

which establish when the rate of diminish in a 

give patch justifi the cost and time of move to a 

new patch with a great expect return. thi

squirrel mathematician and then wide circul in

the squirrel community. 

yet, look around, it seem we’r not a smart a 

squirrels. As we brows in an inform patch, 

we be lead astray by boredom and anxiety. we’r 

easili bored, and there be the fomo effect, the 

great fear of miss out. So we constantli 

overvalu the perceiv return of a new patch, and 

jump quickly, in spite of what intellig 

applic of the margin valu theorem might 

say. for example, most of the time, we remain on a 

web page just a few scant seconds. 

Of course, we think to ourselv that we’r good at 

thi multitasking, but be thi realli true? our 

ancient brain weren’t shape by evolut for thi 

behavior. In spite of the parallel architectur in 

our brains, we be effect think with a one- 

core processor, and everi task requir a switch in 

context that be costli in resourc and lose time. 

and a we get older, these cost becom greater. 

experi show that from 20 year of age on, 

it’ all downhill. 

technology, in it develop of the internet, smartphone, and social media, have not have a passiv part 

to play in thi behavior either. As the author of say, technolog “reach out to us.” 

It be alluring, and the behavior it induc have mani consequences. studi have show that the more 

child multitask, the low their test score and grades. multitask be often a danger activity, a 

when we be drive and talk or text or fiddl with gp control or.... A procliv for 

multitask also leaf u less inclin to introspect thinking. instead of await deep thoughts, we 

seek instant gratification. 

the distract mind 

but I keep come back to my dilemma. If thi be all so bad, whi do we do it? mayb there be benefit 

that have not yet be quantified. but if there be not, and thi trend continues, what will life be like in 

anoth coupl of decades? So mani questions, so few answers. 

If thi essay seem disjointed, pleas forgiv me. i’m kind of old, and thi ancient brain be all I have. 

thi articl appear in the juli 2017 print issu a “technolog distraction.”
