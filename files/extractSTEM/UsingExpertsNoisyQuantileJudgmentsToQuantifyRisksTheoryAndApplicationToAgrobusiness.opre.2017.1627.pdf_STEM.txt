abstract. motiv by a uniqu agribusi setting, thi paper develop an optim- 
ization-bas approach to estim the mean and standard deviat of probabl distri- 
bution from noisi quantil judgment provid by experts. the approach estim the 
mean and standard deviat a weight linear combin of quantil judgments, 
where the weight be explicit function of the expert’ judgment errors. the approach be 
analyt tractable, and provid flexibl to elicit ani set of quantil from an expert. 
the approach also establish that use an expert’ quantil judgment to deduc the 
distribut paramet be equival to collect data with a specif sampl size and 
enabl combin the expert’ judgment with those of other experts. It also show ana- 
lytic that the weight for the mean add up to one and the weight for the standard 
deviat add up to zero—thes properti have be observ numer in the liter- 
atur in the last 30 years, but without a systemat explanation. the theori have be in 
use at dow agrosci for two year for make an annual decis worth $800 million. 
the use of the approach have result in the follow monetari benefits: (i) firm’ annual 
product invest have reduc by 6%–7% and (ii) profit have increas by 2%–3%. We 
discu the implement at the firm, and provid practic guidelin for use expert 
judgment for oper uncertainti in industri settings.

uncertainti be critic for decis make in busi- 
nesses. the probabl distribut for these uncer- 
tainti be usual estim use histor data

data may not be avail when firm frequent 
launch new product in the market, e.g., at firm in the 
semiconductor and in the agribusi industry. In the 
absenc of histor data, these firm turn to domain 
expert for obtain subject probabl distribu-

vise that in these situations, one should avoid ob-

input in the form of judgment for specif discret

cific quantiles, but also caution that these judgment 
be subject to judgment error (ravind et al. 1988). 
however, a systemat approach that us these judg-

tical guidelin for seek expert judgment for opera- 
tional uncertainti in industri situations. 
the rest of thi paper be organ a follows. sec- 

tion 2 provid an overview of our approach and 
the contribut to the exist literature. section 3 
and 4 discu amodel for deducingmean and standard 
deviat from quantil judgments, deriv the solu- 
tion and it structur properties. section 5 discu

data and result for combin judgment from mul- 
tipl experts. section 6 describ implement of 
the approach at da and quantif of benefit of 
use the approach. section 7 conclud with insight 
for practice. 

2. overview of approach and our 
contribut to the exist literatur 

2.1. overview 
We develop an optimization-bas approach to esti- 
mate the mean and standard deviat from quan- 
tile judgment provid by an expert; specifically, 
we obtain the minimum varianc estim of the 
mean and standard deviat of yield distribut a 
weight averag of the quantil judgment provid 
by the expert, subject to the constraint that the esti- 
mate be unbiased. the model have two inputs. the 
first input be an identif of the quantil for which 
the expert will provid judgments. for example, at 
das, the expert chose to provid judgment for the 
10th, 50th, and 75th quantil becaus hi softwar be 
set to show these quantil dure data analysis, and he 
be accustom to think about these quantiles. the 
second input be a quantif of the nois present 
in the expert’ judgment for the quantiles. thi quan- 
tific be do separ by compar the expert’ 
judgment for the quantil with the true valu for 
a number of distribut construct use histor 
data. We discu thi empir estim at da in 
section 6. 

the solut to the optim model assign two 
set of weight to the quantil judgment (e.g., for 
the 10th, 50th, and 75th quantiles). the first set of 
weight be for estim the mean a a weight aver- 
age of quantil judgments. the second set of weight 
be use similarli to estim the standard deviation. 
the weight be specif to the nois quantifi in the 
second input discuss abov for the expert’ quantil 
judgments. 

2.2. contribut to literatur 
A larg bodi of literatur consid situat in which 
expert provid their assess for event with 
binari outcom (e.g., ayvaci et al. 2017). In contrast, 
we focu on situat where continu distribut 
need to be specifi over the outcomes, and expert 
judgment be sought to estim these probabl distri- 

butions. two stream of literatur be relev to our 
focus: (i) model of judgment error and (ii) practice- 
driven literatur on the use of expert judgments. 

2.2.1. model on model-driven theori on judgments. 
the first stream of relat literatur be on model-driven 
theori of judgment errors. the exist literatur on 
expert judgment acknowledg the potenti sever 
of judgment error and focu on develop elici- 
tation guidelin for reduc judgment error (e.g., 
koehler et al. 2002). In contrast, articl on moment 
estim from quantil judgment have explor the 
problem of deduc moment from the median and 
two addit symmetr quantil (typically, the 5th 
and 95th) or four addit symmetr quantil (typ- 
ically, the 5th, 25th, 75th, and 95th), numer with a 
key assumption: no judgment error be present. pear- 
son and tukey (1965) and keefer and bodili (1983) 
follow thi paradigm. but no prior articl consid 
the problemwher subject quantil judgment from 
multipl expert need to be combin to deduc the 
mean and standard deviat or the case where an 
expert provid judgment for an arbitrari set of quan- 
tile that be differ from the standard one men- 
tion above. We contribut to thi literatur by devel- 
ope a tractabl solut approach to thi problem. 
A salient featur of thi approach be that one can use 
ani set of quantil judgment that an expert can pro- 
vide (over the 5th, 25th, 75th, and 95th a discuss 
in the prior literature) to estim the mean and stan- 
dard deviation. thi featur be use for practic sinc 
an expert may not be will to provid quantil judg- 
ment for specif symmetr quantiles. for example, 
the expert at da be habitu to see the 10th, 
50th, and 75th quantil for histor data on hi soft- 
ware and be will to estim onli these quantiles. 

the approach also provid the follow struc- 
tural insights. first, regardless of the magnitud of an 
expert’ judgment error and the quantil elicited, 
the variance-minim weight for the estim 
of the mean and standard deviat add up to 1 
and 0, respectively. thi structur properti explain 
the numer find in pearson and tukey (1965), 
lau et al. (1999), among others, who all assum that 
judgment error do not exist. second, our approach 
establish a new quantif of expertise: it speci- 
fie the size of a random sampl that would provid 
estim of mean and standard deviat with the 
same precis a that of the estim obtain use 
the expert’ judgment for quantiles. thi equival 
enabl an object comparison of experts. finally, in 
our approach, the optim weight provid point esti- 
mate and variabl in the estim for the moments. 
thi quantif of variabl of moment estim 
enabl u to combin quantil judgment from multi- 
ple expert in a ration and consist manner.

prior literature, e.g., o’hagan (1998), steven and 
o’hagan (2002), discu the role of expert judgment 
in the absenc of data for construct prior distri- 
butions; when data becom available, posterior dis- 
tribut for paramet be obtain use bayesian 
updating. the literatur discu two cases. when 
conjug prior be used, the posterior distribut 
be obtain in close form. when conjug prior 
cannot be used, numer approach must be use 
to obtain posterior distributions. We make two con- 
tribut to thi literature. first, we develop a novel 
approach to obtain the prior distribut on the 
paramet for the mean and standard deviat of 
distribut use expert judgment for quantiles. 
second, we show that the joint prior distribut 
be correl and be not conjug priors, and we 
develop a copula-bas approach to obtain the poste- 
rior distributions. 
2.2.2. practice-driven tool and insights. our contri- 
bution to practic be a follows.w provid a step-by- 
step approach to quantifi an expert’ judgment 
error and then discu some practic issu observ 
dure thi quantif at das. specifically, we dis- 
cuss a bootstrap approach to separ judgment 
error from sampl error dure the error quantifi- 
cation process. then, we show that the inform 
provid by the expert be equival to five to six year 
of data collect at da use our approach. such 
quantif have not be report in practic litera- 
ture before. We also report that the expert at da be 
reluct to provid judgment for extrem quantil 
becaus of hi inabl to distinguish between random 
variat and systemat reason a caus of extrem 
outcomes. thi observ suggest that contextu 
reason and experts’ prefer can lead to elicit 
of quantil that be differ from the standard val- 
ue (median and two or four symmetr quantiles); our 
approach be especi use in such situations. 

3. analyt model 
We consid a real-valu continu random vari- 
abl X, whose distribut be to be estimated. the pro- 
babil densiti function (pdf) of X be denot a 
φ(x;θ), where θ � [θ1 , θ2]t be the paramet of the 
pdf, and µ1, µ2 denot the mean and standard devi- 
ation, respectively. similar to lindley (1987), o’hagan 
(2006), we assum that the distribut famili be know 
from the applic context, but the paramet be 
not known. thi framework be especi relev to a 
number of oper context in which the parametr 
famili of probabl distribut be know from the 
histor data avail or from formal models. the 
cumul distribut function (cdf) of X be denot 
a Φ. A sourc of inform such a an expert pro- 
vide quantil judgment x̂i correspond to probabil- 
iti cdf valu pi for i � 1, 2, . . . ,m. In vector notation, 

we denot the quantil judgment a x̂ � [x̂1 , . . . , x̂m]t 
and probabl valu a p� [p1 , . . . , pm]t. 
We seek to develop an approach to deduc µ1 , µ2 

from the quantil judgment x̂. from theoret and 
applic perspective, it be desir that the ap- 
proach’ formul provid a uniqu solut to the 
problem, prefer in close form, and be amen 
to sensit analysis. prior literatur in thi domain 
(e.g., keefer and bodili 1983, johnson 1998) also sug- 
gest that for an eas of implementation, the approach 
should be consist with moment match and 
with other probabl discret practic in use, 
e.g., program evalu and review techniqu (pert) 
for project management. our approach accomplish 
these object and addit provid a quantifica- 
tion of the qualiti of expert’ judgment into an equiv- 
alent sampl size. 

3.1. preliminari for expert judgment 
We assum that the quantil judgment be obtain 
use an underli process or mental model (we dis- 
cuss the mental model use by the expert at das, 
in figur 1, section 6.1), which be error prone but be 
use consist for gener quantil judgments. 
thi assumpt mean that the expert’ judgment 
error be stabl dure elicitation. We further assum 
an addit error structur that be use frequent in the 
literatur (e.g., ravind et al. 1988): the quantil judg- 
ment x̂i be compos of a true valu xi and an addit 
error ei : 

x̂i � xi + ei . (1) 

In vector notation, the error model be x̂ � x + e. con- 
sistent with thi literature, we assum that the error ei 
have two parts: a systemat compon or bia δi and 
a random compon or nois �i , such that ei � δi + �i 
and e[�i] � 0. the bia δi captur the averag devi- 
ation of the judgment for quantil i from the true 
value. the nois �i captur the spread in the error 
due to random variations. In vector notation, the bia 
and residu variat be denot a δ and �, respec- 
tively. the nois � be quantifi in variance-covari 
matrix Ω. the diagon element of thi matrix ωii � 
var(�i) denot the varianc in the unbias judgment 
of quantil i. the off-diagon element be covari 
of unbias judgment ωi j �cov(�i , � j). We discu the 
empir estim of δ andω separ in section 6, 
and assum for now that these quantiti be available. 

from the bia judgment x̂, the unbias judg- 
ment q̂ be obtain by remov bia a q̂ � x̂ − δ. 
substitut thi relationship into x̂ � x + e � x + δ+ �, 
we obtain 

q̂� x+ �. (2) 

the matrix Ω for � be use a an input in the optimiza- 
tion model discuss next.

3.2. optim problem 
We seek to obtain the estim of the mean µ̂1 and 
standard deviat µ̂2 a pool or weight linear 
function of the debias quantil judgment a µ̂k � 
wtkq̂; k � 1, 2 with the weight w1 ≡ [w11 ,w12 , . . . ,w1m] 

t 

and w2 ≡ [w21 ,w22 , . . . ,w2m]t. sinc the unbias judg- 
ment q̂ be subject to nois �, the estim µ̂k ; k � 1, 2 
have varianc var[wtkq̂]. smaller valu of the vari- 
anc of these estim be desir a it would impli 
that the estim be more precise. To thi end, it be 
desir to select weight wk ; k � 1, 2 that lead to a 
small varianc in the estim µ̂k . We first restat the 
varianc of estim µ̂k in term of the weight a 

var[µ̂k]�var[wtkq̂] � e[(wtkq̂−e[wtkq̂])2] (3) 
� e[(wtk(x+ �) −e[wtk(x+ �)])2] 
� e[(wtk(x+ �) −wtkx)2] 
� e[wtk��twk]�wtkωwk . (4) 

prior literatur (e.g., bate and granger 1969, granger 
1980) show that onli minim thi varianc be not 
inform a it be minim by set wk � 0 and 
the result weight linear estim be alway equal 
to µ̂k � 0 for all judgment q̂. thi literatur suggest 
add constraint tomak statist estim respon- 
sive to forecast or judgments. our focu will be on 
a specif class of such constraints. We seek variance- 
minim weight such that the obtain estim 
wtkq̂ be unbiased, i.e., e[wtkq̂] � µk , lead to the fol- 
low optim formul for k � 1, 2: 

min 
wk 

var[µ̂k]�wtkωwk 
s.t. e[wtkq̂]� µk 

(5) 

problem (5) consist of find the weight wk that 
lead to the minimum varianc unbias estim 
of µk . In the next section, we determin these weight 
for location-scal distribut use structur proper- 
tie of these distributions. the focu on location-scal 
distribut be motiv by their widespread applica- 
tion in numer operationsmanag context (see 
kelton and law 2006, for a list of these applications) 
a well a their specif applic at das, where the 
in-hous statist team have show use exist data 
that yield be normal distributed. thi analysi be in 
section 6.2. 

4. solution: weight for 
quantil judgment 

In section 4.1 we special the problem (5) for distri- 
bution of a location-scal family, and obtain the opti- 
mal weight for quantil judgment and the weights’ 
structur properti in section 4.2. 

4.1. reformul and solut for distribut 
of a location-scal famili 

We now assum that X be a location-scal random vari- 
abl with locat and scale paramet θ1 ∈ � and 

θ2 ∈ �++, respectively, and transform the constraint 
e[wtkq̂] � µk in formul (5) use two properti of 
location-scal distributions. the first properti enabl 
u to rewrit the left-hand side (lhs) of thi constraint 
a a function of θ1, θ2. If X be a location-scal ran- 
dom variabl with pdf φ(·;θ), then a specif valu x 
that correspond to probabl p can be express a 
x � θ1 + θ2z, where z denot the valu of standard 
random variabl with the standard pdf φ(·; [0, 1]t) 
for probabl p (casella and berger 2002, p. 116). We 
write thi express in vector form a 

x�zθ, (6) 

where Z be the m×2 matrix form a Z� [1, z], z be the 
column vector of standard quantil correspond- 
ing to the probabl p, and 1 be a column vector of 
ones. substitut (6) into the lh of the error model 
in (2), q̂� x+ �, it follow that 

e[wtkq̂]� e[wtk(x+ �)]�wtke[x+ �]�wtkzθ. (7) 

the second property, formal in lemma 1 below, 
enabl u to rewrit the right-hand side (rhs) of 
the unbiased constraint e[wtkq̂] � µk a a function 
of θ1 , θ2. 

lemma 1 (character of location-scal moments). 
If X be a location-scal random variabl with paramet θ� 
[θ1 , θ2]t with finit jth moment for j � 1, 2, . . ., then, 

(a) the raw moment e[x j] be give by e[x j] �∑ j 
i�0 

( j

) 
θ

(b) the central moment be give by e[(x − µ1) j] �

∑ j 

i�0(−κ1)iκ j−i , 
where the constant κi be κ0 � 1 and κ j � e[z j] for j � 
1, 2, . . . . 

the proof be in appendix a1. the valu of κ j be 
document in the literatur for location-scal distri- 
bution (see, e.g., johnson et al. 1994). for example, 
for a normal distribution, we have (κ0 , κ1 , κ2)� (1, 0, 1). 
It follow from part (a) of lemma 1 that µ1 � e[x] � 
[1, κ1]θ. It follow from part (b) of the lemma that 
varianc of X be equal to e[(x − µ1)2] � θ22(κ2 − κ21), 
and therefor the standard deviat be equal to µ2 �√

tion be obtain by solv a lagrang formul of 
the problem. the next result establish thi uniqu 
solution. 

theorem 1. the weight that solv problem (10) be give 
by w∗k �Ω

the proof be in appendix a2. the conspicu fea- 

ture of the optim weight w∗k be that they be explicit 
function of the expert’ precis encod inω. there- 
fore, a chang in an expert’ precis in provid 
quantil judgment will modifi Ω, which, in turn, 
will chang the optim weight w∗k for the quan- 
tile judgments. finally, we note that the varianc of 
the estim var[µ̂k] at the optim weight be equal 
to var[µ̂k] � w∗k 

tωw∗k , which simplifi to var[µ̂k] � 
atk(z

varianc in the estim µ̂k to the expert-specif Ω. 

4.2. structur properti and gener of 
result avail in literatur 

the develop thu far provid new generaliza- 
tion and insight to the exist literature. first, in our 
approach, the expert can provid judgment for ani set 
of quantil that he be comfort estimating, i.e., he 
be no longer restrict to provid hi judgment for 
the 5th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 95th quantil a speci- 
fie in extant literatur such a lau et al. (1996). thi 
flexibl be use sinc we no longer need to convinc 
an expert to provid judgment for these specif quan- 
tile and instead can focu on understand whi the 
expert believ that he can provid good judgment 
for hi chosen quantiles. We discu one such exam- 

ple in section 6.2. the second gener of our 
approach be that it provid an analyt foundat 
to a numer properti observ consist in the 
exist literatur that the weight add up to a constant 
a follows. 

proposit 2. the optim weight for quantil add up to 
constants. specifically, ∑mi�1 w∗1i � 1 and ∑mi�1 w∗2i � 0. 
the proof be in appendix a3. thi result be true 

regardless of the numer valu of Ω; therefore, it 
hold true even when the judgment error be arbi- 
trarili small, e.g., when Ω � limλ→0 λi. A number of 
prior articl (pearson and tukey 1965, perri and greig 
1975, keefer and bodili 1983, johnson 1998) numer- 
ical discu the limit case when the error be 
absent. they select specif numer test case of 
mean and standard deviat of a distribut and 
obtain the 5th, 50th, and 95th quantil or other spe- 
cific symmetr quantil for these cases. then, they 
consid variou set of candid weights. for each set 
of weights, they estim the mean of all test case a 
weight linear combin of the quantil values. 
finally, they identifi the set of weight that result in 
the small squar deviat between the true and 
the estim mean over all cases. A similar analy- 
si provid the weight to obtain the standard devia- 
tion. the weight recommend in thi literatur add 
up to 1 and 0 for the mean and standard deviation, 
respectively. proposit 2 establish that the additiv- 
iti properti observ numer in these articl be 
structur properti of probabl distributions, and 
hold true for ani magnitud of judgment errors. 

third, these addit properti be also share by 
the weight assign in the project manag tech- 
niqu pert to the estim for the optimistic, pes- 
simistic, and most like scenarios. the weight for the 
mean be (1/6, 4/6, 1/6), respectively, for the estima- 
tion of the mean add up to one, and (−1/6, 0, 1/6) 
for the estim of the standard deviat add 
up to zero. fourth, one can show use straightfor- 
ward algebra that our approach automat assign 
low weight to a quantil judgment that have larg 
noise. In situat where an expert provid a num- 
ber of quantil judgments, thi featur be use in 
identifi which quantil judgment have larg nois 
and be therefor not use for the estim of the 
moments; the weight for these quantil judgment 
will be negligible. 

5. data equivalence, multipl experts, and 
other relationship 

In section 5.1, we determin the size of a randomli 
drawn sampl that be equival in term of precis to 
the expert’ judgments. In section 5.2 we discu com- 
bine judgment of one expert with the judgment 
from other experts. In section 5.3, we discu the con-

sistenc of the approach develop with least squar 
and moment matching. 

5.1. equival between expertis and 
size of a random sampl 

expert input be sought for estim probabl dis- 
tribut when collect data be costly. the expert’ 
quantil judgments, after use our approach, provid 
point-estim µ̂k and the varianc in these estim 
var[µ̂k]. We can compar thi varianc with the vari- 
anc of the mean and standard deviat obtain 
from a sampl of random observ for X if data 
collect be possible. specifically, it be well know that 
a sampl mean have a varianc of σ2/n1, where N1 be 
the sampl size. In our approach, the varianc in the 
estim of the mean be equal to var[µ̂1]�w∗1tωw∗1 (see 
appendix A4 for proof), which can be simplifi to 
[1, κ1](ztω−1z)−1[1, κ1]t. By equat these two vari- 
ances, we can determin the size of a randomli col- 
lect sampl that would provid the same precis 
of the estim of the mean a the expert does. We call 
thi size an equival sampl size for the mean. A simi- 
lar analysi provid the equival sampl size for the 
standard deviation. the next result provid expres- 
sion of these equival sampl sizes. 
proposit 3. the precis of the estim µ̂k obtain

the proof be in appendix a5. thi result have two 
profound implications. first, use thi result, multi- 
ple expert can be compar object base on their 
judgment error quantifi in Ω. more specifically, 
for two expert A and B with matrix ΩA and ΩB , the 
ratio of equival sampl size be give a na1 /nb1

independ of the true valu of µ1 , µ2. for exam- 
ple, if nak /nbk � 2, then the estim of µk obtain 
from expert A be two time a reliabl a the esti- 
mate obtain from expert B. thi benefit from use 
expert A over expert B be equal to the benefit from 
doubl the sampl size of experiment or field 
data for the purpos of estim µk . second, some 
recent literatur (e.g., akcay et al. 2011) quantifi the 
margin benefit of improv estim of probabil- 
iti distribut by collect more data befor make 
decis under uncertainty. proposit 3 provid 

a natur connect to these result by quantifi 
the econom benefit of improv the precis in

where ω11 be the m × m matrix for residu error of 
expert 1, the matrixω12 be the m ×m covari matrix 
for the error of expert 1 and 2, and so on. then, the 
matrix Ω be use in theorem 1 along with matrix Zt of 
size 2×mn, Zt � [zt1 zt2 , . . . ,ztn], where each Z j � [1, z j], 
z j be the column vector of standard quantil corre- 
spond to the probabl p j that expert j have cho- 
sen to provid judgment for, and 1 be a column vector 
of ones. the use of theorem 1 provid mn weights; the 
first m weight for the first expert, the next m weight 
for the second expert, and so on. 

We discu a special case of interest here. suppos n 
expert j � 1, 2, . . . , n provid judgment for the same 
set of quantiles, i.e., Zt � [zt0 zt0 , . . . ,zt0], and the covari- 
anc matrix of each expert j be give by Ω j j � r jω0 ∀ j 
(i.e., the judgment error structur of one expert be a 
scale version of anoth expert) and further assum 
that the error of ani two expert be mutual inde- 
pendent, i.e., all element of Ωi j , i , j be equal to 0. 
the weight for the mn quantil judgment obtain

for t � 1, 2, . . . ,mn and k � 1, 2. the first m weight be 
for expert 1, the next m weight be for expert 2, and 
so on. We can write these weight a w∗k � [w1k , . . . ,wnk ], 
where w jk be the vector of weight of expert j. We can 
also decompos the weight w∗k a the product of con- 
stant α j for expert j and a common weight vector of m 
weight wck that would be obtain if each expert be 
the onli one available, i.e., w∗k � [α1wck , . . . , αnwck]. the 
valu of α j and the relationship between w

be a follows. 
proposit 4. consid expert j � 1, 2, . . . , n, whose co- 
varianc matrix be r jω0; ∀ j, and further assum that the 
judgment error across expert be mutual independent. 
then,

sider separately, the estim weight be obtain 
a wct1 � [−0.167 1.484 − 0.317] and wct2 � [−0.576

from part (ii) of the proposit that the expert-specif

be obtain a w11 � (2/3) × (−0.167, 1.484,−0.317) � 
(−0.111, 0.989,−0.211) and w21 � (1/3) × (−0.167, 1.484,

which give w∗1 � [−0.111, 0.989,−0.211,−0.055, 0.495, 
−0.105]. 

5.3. relationship with classic least squar 
regress and moment match 

We now discu how our model and it solut be con- 
sistent with (i) the classic least squar minimization- 
base regress framework and (ii) with moment 
matching. In the classic regress framework, the 
variance-covari matrix be Ω � kω′, where K > 0 
be a scalar, the diagon element of Ω′ be equal 
to 1, and the off-diagon element be equal to 0, i.e., 
Ω′ � I. In our context, thi would be the noninforma- 
tive case when the expert be equal good at estim 
all quantil and hi judgment error be mutual 
independent. We show in theorem 1 that the opti- 
mal weight be equal to w∗k � Ω 

−1z(ztω−1z)−1ak . 
now, substitut Ω � ki, we obtain the weight a 

w∗k �z(z 
tz)−1ak , or alternately, a the familiar kernel 

of the ordinari least squar in the big parentheses: 
w∗k 

t 
� akt((zzt)−1zt). 

In the moment match framework, we would seek 
to minim the squar deviat of the debias 
quantil judgment q̂i obtain from the expert for 
probabl pi from the unobserv valu of mean 
and standard deviation, i.e., we would seek to solve: 
minµ1 , µ2{ 

∑m 
i�1(φ−1(pi ;µ1 , µ2) − q̂i)2}. thi approach be 

codifi in mani commerci softwar (e.g., @risk) 
and have be use in prior academ literatur (e.g., 
wallsten et al. 2013). for location-scal distributions, 
φ−1(pi ;µ1 , µ2)�θ1+ziθ2. use the properti that θ1 � 
µ1 − (κ1/ 

√ 
κ2 − κ21)µ2 and θ2 � (1/ 

√ 
κ2 − κ21)µ2, we can 

rewrit thi problem a 

min 
µ1 , µ2 

m∑

( 
µ1 − 

κ1√ 
κ2 − κ21 

µ2 + zi 
µ2√ 
κ2 − κ21 

− q̂i 
)2 
. 

the next result establish the classic least squar 
and moment match a a special case of our 
approach. 

proposit 5. consid the origin optim prob- 
lem: minw wtkωwk subject to e[wtkq̂]� µk . 

(1) thi problem reduc to ordinari least squar solu- 
tion when Ω� kω′, where Ω′ � I. 
(2) consid the moment match problem in the form 

minµ1 , µ2{ 
∑m 

i�1(φ−1(pi ;µ1 , µ2) − q̂i)2}. it’ solut be â � 
wta q̂ for a ∈ {µ1 , µ2} and it be ident to the solut 
obtain from the origin problem for Ω � kω′, where 
Ω′ � I. 

the proof be in appendix a7. the second part of 
the proposit impli that give quantil judgment 
and no inform for the nois in the judgments, 
the best estim of the mean and standard deviat 
(under quadrat penalty) for location-scal distribu- 
tion be linear function of the quantil judgments. 
and these estim coincid with solut obtain 
in our approach for the noninform case of Ω � I. 
our approach extend the moment match model to 
account for expert’ judgment error a captur in 
Ω a minw wtkωwk subject to e[wtkq̂] � µk for the case 
when inform for the expert’ judgment error 
be available, i.e., when Ω , ki. finally, we note that 
our approach be amen to bayesian updat use 
markov chain mont carlo methods, and we omit 
detail for sake of brevity. We next discu the imple- 
mentat of the approach develop at das.

under thi yield uncertainty, produc hybrid seed 
corn on a larg plot of land may result in a surplu

in costli shortag if the realiz yield be low. math-

median and/or chang in the spread of the distribu- 
tion. the expert’ contextu knowledg for the biolog 
of both parent provid him with insight into how 
the distributionmight chang dure cross-pollination. 
6.1.3. practic at da befor new approach. In the 
past, the yield expert have adjust the median of the 
inbreed femal distribut high or low to pro- 
vide an estim of themedian yield for the product 
of hybrid seed. thu the estim of the median seed 
product yield have be base on indirect data and 
be judgment in nature. thi median yield be use 
for product plan decis a follows. man- 
ager would first calcul the area need a area � 
demand/median yield judgment and then increas it 
by 20% or 30% to account for high profit margins. In 
our interactions, manag articul the need for a 
rigor approach to estim the spread in the uncer- 
tain yields, which could then be use to determin 
the number of acr for each hybrid use optimiza- 
tion models. furthermore, sinc the yield expert be 
requir to provid judgment for almost 200 hybrid 
seed within a span of two week everi seed produc- 
tion season, it be necessari to develop an approach 
that could be implement within thi time window. 
our analyt approach accomplish these tasks. 
In section 6.2, we discu how our approach con- 

tinu to use the expert’ judgment for the median 
(that he have estim in the past) to exploit the mental 
model that he have develop and use over year a 
well a two addit quantil select by him. da 
make the product plan decis onc a year, 
typic dure january–february. our approach be 
first use in 2014, and have be in use sinc then. In 
the first step of our implementation, we determin 
the bia vector δ, the matrix Ω of judgment errors, 
and the matrix Z correspond to the quantil for 
which the expert will provid judgments. thi be 
do use histor yield data for a set of hybrid 
seed that have be produc repetit in the past. 
detail of thi step be in section 6.2. from these quan- 
tities, we obtain the optim weight w∗k ; k � 1, 2. 
detail of thi determin be in section 6.3. finally, 
we quantifi the benefit from use our approach 
use the data from the 2014 product plan deci- 
sions. thi analysi be present in section 6.4. In sec- 
tion 6.5, we discu the integr of our approach 
into das’ oper decis making. 

6.2. implementation: data collect at da and 
calibr of judgment error 

the first task dure the implement be to col- 
lect data from the firm to determin the appropri 
distribut to use to model yield uncertainty, and to 
calibr the expert. We first describ thi data and the 

tabl 1. test to accept/reject normal of histor yield 
data for a subset of seed 

test: p valu p valu p valu 
h0: data be normal for seed 1 for seed 2 for seed 3

cramer-von mise test 0.92 0.56 0.59 
ryan-join test >0.10 >0.10 >0.10 

statist test perform to determin the paramet- 
ric famili of yield distributions. then, we describ the 
process use for calibr the expert at das. 

We ask da to identifi a set of hybrid seed 
that have be produc repetit in the last few 
years. overall, da found L � 22 such hybrid seed 
index by l � 1, 2, . . . , 22 and provid u with the 
histor yield data for these seeds. use thi data 
and other sources, we sought to determin the appro- 
priat parametr famili to model yield distribution. 
first, we analyz the avail yield data and ran 
a batteri of tests, includ the kolmogorov-smirnov 
test, anderson-darl test, and lilliefors-van soest 
test and found that they all fail to reject the hypoth- 
esi that the data be normal distributed. tabl 1 
show the result for three such seeds. these test onli 
confirm that normal cannot be rule out. We then 
ran a second test to see if normal provid the best 
fit with the data. In thi test, we determin the para- 
metric famili with the best fit with the data use the 
chi-squar test and anderson-darl test. the can- 
didat distribut be the normal distribution, the 
gamma distribution, the uniform distribution, the log- 
normal distribution, the beta distribution, the gumbel 
distribution, the exponenti distribution, the weibul 
distribution, the logist distribution, and the invers 
normal distribution. the normal distribut be the 
best fit on the anderson-darl test for all hybrid 
seeds. On the chi-squar test, the normal distribut 
provid the best fit for a major of the seeds. 

In addit to thi statist proof for the hybrid 
seeds,dasha extens data for inbr seed that sup- 
port normality. sinc the biolog factor at play dur- 
ingplantgrowthar the same inhybrid seeds, theyield 
of the hybrid seed corn also would be normal. recently, 
comhair and papier (2015) also provid statist 
evid for normal of yield dure seed corn pro- 
duction. after identifi the normal distribut to be 
appropriate, we determin the quantil that the yield 
expert at da be comfort estim (to obtain Z 
for the normal distribution), a well a determin hi 
error structur (δ andω), a describ next.

to estimate, without look at the histor yield data 
of these hybrids. the select of three quantil (rather 
than more than three) be motiv by exist liter- 
atur that suggest that three quantil perform almost 
a well a five quantil (wallsten et al. 2013), a well 
a the time constraint face by the expert. the expert 
be an agricultural-scientist; he be well train in statis- 
tic and have work extens with yield data. hi 
quantit background and experi be help 
a he clearli understood the probabilist mean and 
implic of quantiles. the first quantil he select 
be the 50th quantil sinc he have estim thi quan- 
tile regularli in the last few years. the extant literatur 
alsoha establish that estim thi quantil have the 
intuit 50–50 high-low interpret that manag 
understandwel (o’hagan 2006). 
We then ask the expert to provid u with hi 

quantil judgment for two other quantiles, one in each 
tail of the yield distribution, that he be comfort 
estimating. the yield expert chose to provid hi judg- 
ment for the 10th and 75th quantil for sever rea- 
sons. first, he have develop familiar with these 
quantil in the last few years: hi statist softwar 
(jmp) typic provid a limit number of quantil 
values, includ these two quantil dure data anal- 
ysis, and he be accustom to think about them. sec- 
ond, the expert suggest the use of these asymmetr 
quantil becaus if ask for symmetr quantiles, he 
would intuit “estim one-tail quantil and calcu- 
late the other symmetr quantil use the properti 
of the normal distribution.” thi will be equival to 
estim onli one quantil instead of two. 

finally, the expert be not comfort in provid- 
ing judgment for quantil that be further out in 
the tails, such a the 1st and the 95th quantiles. thi 
reluctancewa interest and highlight some subtl 
disconnect between theori and practice. some arti- 
cle (e.g., lau et al. 1998, lau and lau 1998) have sug- 
gest weight for extrem quantil such a 1 per- 
centile, assum no judgment errors. however, the 
expert found it difficult to estim extrem quantiles. 
specifically, he be concern that he might not be 
abl to differenti between random variat (that 
we seek to capture) and act of natur such a torna- 
do and flood (that we seek to exclud sinc the yield 
expert cannot predict these events) that lead to extrem 
outcomes. 

We then determin the matrix Z for the 10th, 50th, 
and 75th quantiles. for the normal distribution, thi 
matrix be calcul a 

Z� 


 , 
where the valu of −1.28 be equal to the invers of the 
standard normal distribut at the probabl 0.1 and 
so on. 

6.2.2. step 2: elicit sequenc and consist 
check. for each distribut l, we obtain the three 
quantil judgment x̂il(pi); i � 1, 2, 3; l � 1, 2, . . . , 22; pi � 
0.1, 0.5, 0.75 from the expert; the expert do not have 
access to the histor yield data for these hybrid 
dure thi estimation. We obtain the expert’ judg- 
ment in two rounds. In round 1, for each hybrid l, 
the expert follow hi usual procedur for studi 
the yield distribut for the femal parent, look 
at the properti of the male parent and provid 
hi judgment for the median (see figur 1). We then 
ask the expert to provid hi quantil judgment for 
the 10th and 75th quantiles, in that order. thi cus- 
tomiz sequenc be consist with the extant liter- 
atur that suggest first obtain an assess for 
50–50 odd (garthwait and dickey 1985), and then 
focu further on quantil in the tails. In round 2 of 
estimation, to encourag a care reconfirm of the 
judgment provid in round 1, we use a feedback 
mechanism. We use the inform from two quan- 
tile judgment to make deduct about the third one, 
and then ask the expert to valid these deductions. 
If the expert do not concur with the deductions, we 
provid him an opportun to fine tune the quantil 
judgments. 

As an example, consid a specif seed for which the 
expert provid valu of 15, 70, and 100 for the 10th, 
50th, and 75th quantiles, respectively. the state val- 
ue of the 10th and 50th quantil impli a mean yield 
of 70 and standard deviat of 42.92 for normal dis- 
tribut yields. these two valu impli that there be 
a 50% chanc that the yield will be between 41 and 
99 (the impli 25th and 75th quantile). We ask the 
yield expert the follow question: “your estim of 
the 10th quantil impli that there be a 50% chanc that 
the yield will be between 41 and 99. If you think that 
thi rang should be narrower, pleas consid increas- 
ing the estim of the 10th quantile. If you think the 
rang should be wider, pleas consid decreas the 
estim of the 10th quantile.” We implement thi 
feedback in an autom fashion so that the valu 
in the feedback question be gener automat 
use hi quantil estimates. the expert could revisit 
hi input and the accompani feedback question ani 
number of time befor move to the next feedback 
question for the judgment for the 75th quantil (use 
the deduc 35th and 85th quantil valu obtain 
from hi judgment for the 50th and 75th quantiles). 
after finish thi feedback, he move to the next 
seed. throughout thi process, we emphas that the 
object of thi fine tune be to help him reflect on 
hi estim care without lead him to ani spe- 
cific set of numbers. analysi show that after thi 
feedback, the standard deviat reduc by 33% for 
the tail quantil in round 2, confirm that the feed- 
back be inde help to the expert in improv the 
qualiti of hi estimates.

6.2.3. step 3: separ of sampl error use 
bootstrapping. after elicit be complete, we 
quantifi the judgment error by compar the 
expert’ state valu for the quantil with the val- 
ue obtain from the histor data. for our analysi 
in section 2, we assum that the true valu of the 
quantil xi be available. however, sinc the num- 
ber of data point for each seed at da be limit 
(the larg sampl size be 53), the quantil valu 
obtain from the data be subject to sampl varia- 
tion that need to be explicitli account for. specif- 
ically, let x̃i denot the valu of quantil i for the empir- 
ical distribution. then, for the true valu xi and the 
expert’ estim x̂i , we have the follow decomposi- 
tion of errors: 

x̂i − x̃i � (x̂i − xi)+ (xi − x̃i) (11) 
total error� judgment error+sampl error. (12) 

the comparison of the expert’ assess x̂i with 
the empir valu x̃i have two sourc of errors: the 
expert’ judgment error and the sampl error. the 
judgment error be the differ between the quan- 
tile judgment and the true quantil (x̂i − xi). the sam- 
pling error (xi − x̃i) captur the data variabl that be 
present becaus the empir distribut be base on 
a random sampl of limit size from the population. 
the expert do not see the histor data, therefor 
both sourc of error can be consid to bemutu 
independent. 
write (11) in a vector form, we have x̂− x̃� (x̂−x)+ 
(x− x̃). It follow that the total bia be equal to 

e[x̂− x̃]� e[(x̂− x)]+e[(x− x̃)] 
δt � δ+δ , 

(13) 

where δt be the total bias, and δ and δs be the expert’ 
judgment bia and the sampl bias, respectively. 
the expert’ judgment bia be comput a δ�δt −δ . 

similarly, the varianc in the estim of quantiles, 
assum independ of the data-specif sampl 
error and the expert-specif judgment error, be 

var[x̂− x̃]�var[(x̂− x)]+var[(x− x̃)].

the firm determin q∗� arg maxq{−cq+pe[h(q ,d)]},

tial capit investment, with the save be equal to∑4,500 × (qh − q∗), where the summat be over all 
200 seeds. over the complet portfolio, the cost save

in the cost be the first measur for quantifi the ben- 
efit of our approach. 

third, asw document in earli sections, the yield

amplifi by the use of the scale factor f > 1 dur- 
ing the calcul of the adjust area use Qh � 
(demand/x̂2) f . for some hybrids, thi error in the cal- 
culat of adjust area can be veri larg and may 
result in a substanti suboptim decis with a sub- 
stantial loss in profit. thi loss of profit be the second 
measur for quantifi the benefit of our approach.

cuss in bansal and nagarajan 2017), which need

the optim area. the acreag decis obtain from 
our approach be implement at da along with 
a record of the decis make use the statu quo 
approach that would have be make in the absenc of 
our approach. 
the benefit of use our approach be estim 

use the sale data avail at the end of the season. 
specifically, an in-hous busi analyt team com- 
par the cost of use the area that our approach 
recommend with the cost of use the statu quo 
approach. these result show that the annual pro- 
duction invest decreas by 6%–7% use our 
approach. equal important, da do not see a drop 
in the servic level of the seed after the adopt of 
thi new approach for estim yield distributions. 
subsequently, an analysi be perform on the 

profit. for thi analysis, the key item be that the 
demand, yield, revenue, and profit for each hybrid have 
be observ by the end of the year. for each hybrid, 
these quantiti provid the revenu if the area in the 
statu quo approach have be used. from thi revenue, 
the cost be subtract to obtain the profit. compar- 
ing the profit from thi statu quo approach with actual 
profit suggest that our approach lead to between 2% 
and 3% improv in profit. these document ben- 
efit have lead to a continu use of our approach for 
estim yield distribut at the firm. We next dis- 
cuss how thi approach have be integr into das’ 
operations, but first, we discu some nonmonetari 
benefit accrued. 
6.4.4. nonmonetari benefits. sever featur of our 
approach be perceiv to be of manageri impor- 
tanc dure the implementation. first, it provid 
a uniqu quantif of the qualiti of the expert’ 
judgments. thi quantif be import for the 
firm in understand the benefit of identifi and 
train expert in other seed busi (soybean, cot- 
ton, etc.) for which new varieti be be developed. 
specifically, at das, the yield distribut have a vari- 
anc of µ22 ≈ 400 on average. At Ω̂ show in tabl 2, 
the varianc w∗1 

tωw∗1 � 18. use proposit 3, it fol- 
low that our approach extract inform from the 
expert’ quantil judgment that be equival to the 
inform provid by 400/var(µ̂1) � 400/18 ≈ 22 
data points. We be told that thi be equival to 
approxim five to six year of test data at das. sec- 
ond, the approach provid a ration effort to estim 
the variabl in product yields, enabl the yield 

expert to support hi estim for yield distribut 
with scientif tools. 

6.5. integr into firm’ oper 
after the initi implement in 2014, da recog- 
nize the valu of formal statist model and 
analysi for yield forecast and product plan 
decisions. the firm creat a new busi analyt 
group, and two member of thi group be task 
with develop optim protocol to inform 
das’ operations. the team be compos of train 
statistician with experi in biostatistics. thi nich 
skill set be consid necessari sinc the yield dis- 
tribut and other properti of seed be driven by 
biology, and an understand of plant biolog a well 
a statist would enabl the team to develop context- 
inform models. 

for the annual product plan decision, the 
team implement the approach in the follow man- 
ner. the product plan decis be make everi 
year a few week befor the advent of spring. In the 
week preced thi decision, the team obtain a list 
of hybrid seed from the seed busi manag that 
be under consider for be offer to themarket. 
the portfolio of hybrid seed offer chang annu- 
alli and thi inform be necessari for the team to 
estim yield distribut to support the product 
plan decision. the team then send thi list to the 
yield expert who be locat at a differ geographi- 
cal location. thi expert do travel back and forth to 
the team’ location, nevertheless, da have emphas 
the develop of computer-bas tool that can be 
access from anywhere. the yield expert obtain thi 
list and provid hi judgment for yield distributions. 
the team of statistician process these quantil judg- 
ment use the process describ earli to deduc 
mean and standard deviations. A list of these val- 
ue be then sent back to the busi analyt team 
that be respons for make the product plan 
decision. 

the busi analyt team then us an optimiza- 
tion framework to determin the number of acr that 
should be use to grow each hybrid seed. yield distri- 
bution constitut the major sourc of stochast in 
thi model. under thi uncertainty, the model seek to 
balanc the trade-off between use a veri larg or a 
veri small area. the per acr till and land leas cost 
be high and use a larg area of land need up-front 
high invest and could lead to a surplu inventori 
of hybrid seeds. the use of a small area of land requir 
less up-front capit invest in the production, but 
can lead to shortages. estim the yield distribu- 
tion enabl the firm to optim thi trade-off in a 
mathemat fashion, in addit to provid a quan- 
tit decis support.

7. discuss and futur research 
7.1. summari of approach 
In chang environments, histor data do not exist 
to provid probabl distribut of variou uncer- 
tainties. In such environments, judgment be sought 
from experts. but expert judgment be prone to judg- 
mental errors. In thi paper, we develop an analyt 
approach for deduc the paramet of probabl 
distribut from a set of quantil judgment pro- 
vide by an expert, while explicitli take the expert’ 
judgment error into account. 
from a theory-build perspective, the optimiza- 

tion approach propos be consist with moment 
matching, have a uniqu analyt tractabl solution, 
and be amen for compar static analysis. the 
approach also provid an analyt foundat for 
result document numer in the prior literature. 
from a practic perspective, a salient featur of the 
approach be that an expert be no longer requir to pro- 
vide judgment for the median and specif symmetr 
quantil studi in the literature, but can provid hi 
judgment for ani set of quantiles. the approach also 
establish a novel equival between an expert’ 
quantil judgment and a sampl size of randomli col- 
lect data; thi equival be use for rank and 
compar expert objectively. finally, the model 
framework explain a consist numer find in 
the prior literatur that the weight for the mean and 
the standard deviat add up to 1 and 0, respectively. 
equal important, it provid for a linear pool 
of quantil judgment from multipl experts, therebi 
provid a practic toolkit for combin judgment 
in practice. 

from an implement perspective, the approach 
have sever featur that make it viabl for an easi 
adopt by firms. first, it us judgment for ani three 
or more quantil that an expert be comfort pro- 
viding. In a specif applic at das, we use the 
yield expert’ judgment for the 10th, 50th, and 75th 
quantil to deduc the mean and standard deviat 
of a larg number of yield uncertainties. the expert 
chose to estim these quantil base on hi experi- 
enc with obtain and use these quantil in hi 
data analysi responsibilities. second, the final out- 
come of the approach be a set of weight that be use to 
estim mean and standard deviat a weight 
linear function of quantil judgments. the implemen- 
tation of thi procedur requir simpl mathemati- 
cal oper that can be perform in a spreadsheet 
environment, and it have lead to an expedit adopt 
at das. third, theweight be specif to the expert and 
captur how good he be at provid estim of vari- 
ou quantiles. thi explicit incorpor of an expert’ 
judgment error be use sinc we can then deter- 
mine how the estim paramet (and the decis 
base on thi estim distribution) will vari a the 

qualiti of the expert’ judgment error improv or 
deteriorate. more specifically, in use theorem 1, one 
can analyt determin how the weight w chang 
when the variance-covari matrix Ω changes. 

7.2. other potenti approach 
In thi section, we discu three other potenti ap- 
proach to obtain mean and standard deviat from 
quantil judgments: paramet estim through 
entropi minimization, by minim sum of absolut 
errors, and by nonparametr approaches. 

In rel entropi methods, the entropi of the dis- 
tribut obtain from iid randomli sampl data 
rel to a benchmark distribut be comput to 
evalu the similar of twodistributions. In our prob- 
lem, onli three imperfect quantil judgment be avail- 
abl from the expert. therefor the convent theori 
avail for comparingdistributionswith iid randomli 
sampl data use entropy-bas measur be not 
directli applicable. motiv by the weight linear 
approach suggest by moment match (in propo- 
sition 5), one possibl be to estim moment from 
quantil judgment a µ̂ j � 

∑m 
i�1 w ji q̂i ; j � 1, 2, where 

the quantil judgment q̂i correspond to probabl 
pi . for the normal distribution, the cross-entropi or the 
kullback-leibl (kl) distanc of the estim µ̂ j from 
true valu µ j be give a (duchi 2007) 

KL � log

. 

for each debias quantil judgment, q̂i � µ1 + ziµ2 + 
�i , where the term �i be the nois in the judgment, and 
therefor e[�i]� 0; then it follow that

and sinc e[∑mi�1 �i w1i] � 0, thi impli that (i)∑m 
i�1 w1i � 1 and (ii) 

∑m 
i�1 zi w1i � 0. similarly, sinc µ2 � 

e[∑mi�1 q̂i w2i], it follow that (iii) ∑mi�1 w2i � 0 and (iv)∑m 
i�1 zi w1i � 1. 
use the properti (i)–(iv), the KL distanc can be 

express a

thi KL distanc be a random variable, which be a 
function of the estim error �i , thu a plausibl 
approach would be to select the weight w ji that mini- 
mize the expect valu of the KL distance, e[kl]. the 
limit behavior of e[kl] provid a point of com- 
parison between thi approach and the one develop 
earli in thi paper. As the expert becom increas- 
ingli more reliable, we have on the limit e[kl]→ 0 a 
var(�i) → 0, for ani valu of w1i and w2i that satisfi

condit (i)–(iv). sinc the valu of KL be nonnega- 
tive by construction, on the limit ani such (w1i ,w2i) 
minim e[kl]. moreover, sinc in the optimization, 
we can select 2m weight and we have onli four con- 
straints, anytim we elicit more than two quantiles, in 
general, we may have an infinit number of optim 
weight combinations. the uniqu weight obtain by 
our approach automat satisfi condit (i)–(iv), 
henc they also optim e[kl] on the limit. 

with respect to the gener case of thi approach 
(minim (15)), we make three observations: 

1. notic from equat (15), that e[kl] be a nontriv- 
ial function of the entir error covariancematrixω, and 
obtain the e[kl]-minim weight will requir 
numer optimization. 
2. the abov definit of e[kl] requir knowledg 

of µ2, which we do not have. 
3. the uniqu of the weight be not guaranteed. 
compar thi estim approach with the one 

propos and implement at dow, we can appreci- 
ate an import difference. both approach would 
requir u to estim the covari matrix Ω from 
the calibr data set. but the e[kl] minim 
approach also requir knowledg of the paramet µ2, 
which dow do not have. the estim approach 
develop in section 3–5 do not requir thi knowl- 
edge. these challeng associatedwith the e[kl]mini- 
mizat approach will need to be address by futur 
research befor the approach can be use in practice. 
the problem of estim distribut paramet 

by minim the sum of absolut error (instead of 
the sum of squar errors) be state a minwik 

∑ 
j | 
∑ 

i wik · 
q̂ ji − µ̂ jk |, where µ̂ jk be the mean (k � 1) and stan- 
dard deviat (k � 2) of the calibr distribut j. 
the optim weight for thi model be not obtain 
in close form, rather thi problem must be solv 
numer use a linear program formulation, 
and it not alway have a uniqu solut (harter 1977, 
bassett and koenker 1978, chen et al. 2008). further- 
more, there be no direct relationship between the sum 
of squar error and sum of absolut error for the 
data. due to these two issues, the equival sampl 
size for an expert, akin to the result in proposit 3, 
cannot be determined. 
nonparametr method explor variou function 

form to fit data, while minim the squar dis- 
tanc between the fit and true values. the spline 
fit approach fit one or more spline of variou 
degre to the data. the recommend function form 
for the predict model tend to be sensit to the 
data (härdle et al. 2012) and, in our context, may 
chang with the inclusion/exclus of even one prob- 
abil distribut in the calibr set. similarly, 
the addit kernel model can be sensit to tun- 
ing parameters, which need to be select subject 
(härdle et al. 2012). thi sensit and subject 

in model recommend implies, in our context, that 
the nonparametr model for new seed may have to be 
modifi for everi season, which could be undesir 
when a firm seek to develop a stabl and transpar- 
ent model for a repetit use. finally, a direct least 
squar analysi provid a strong basi for use the 
linear function form use in the paper. proposit 5 
show that the convent least squar formul 
to deduc mean and standard deviat from quantil 
judgment for location-scal distribut result in the 
estim of mean and standard deviat a linear 
combin of the quantil judgments. our approach 
exploit thi result and develop it further in the form 
of tractabl and eas to use result discuss in vari- 
ou propositions. 

7.3. futur research 
A scant but import stream of literatur have quanti- 
fie the benefit of a more reliabl estim of oper- 
ation uncertainties. akcay et al. (2011), in collabora- 
tion with smartop corporation, show that use the 
demand inform comput from 20 data point 
over 10 data point for inventori decis make 
reduc the oper cost by 10% (tabl 2—4, p. 307). 
our quantif provid a new addit to thi lit- 
erature, especi when the inform for an uncer- 
tainti be obtain from an expert. In the future, thi 
quantif should be sharpen use mont carlo 
simul studi for the seed industri aswel a other 
industries. futur research should also explor tighter 
connect between the yield of hybrid seed produc- 
tion and the genom of both parent crossed. thi 
industri be make signific invest in genet 
research, and a larg amount of genom inform 
for some corn varieti be becom available. unfortu- 
nately, currently, thi task be daunt a corn have one 
of themost complex plant genomeswith somemap 
varieti show sequenc of more than two billion 
gene (dolgin 2009); thi be in stark contrast with the 
sparsiti of the yield data available. finally, an impor- 
tant requir for the approach develop for a use, 
in practice, be that we calibr the expert by compar- 
ing their quantil judgment with the true valu for 
some distribut that be specif to the context, and 
for which histor data be avail at the firm. how- 
ever, thi data may not be avail in all businesses. 
the futur research should explor whether it be pos- 
sibl to calibr expert on almanac events, and then 
use thi inform for estim probabl distri- 
bution specif to the business.
