1 introduct 
3D shape acquisit and reconstruct method be base on opti- 
cal devices, most commonli laser scanners, that sampl the visibl 
shape surface. ese scanner yield point cloud which be oen 
noisi and incomplete. mani techniqu have be develop to 
amend such point clouds, denois them, and complet their miss 
part use variou prior [berger et al. 2014]. all these surface- 
base reconstruct techniqu assum a reason sampl rate 
of the surface. notably, these techniqu fall short in case where 
the shape contain highli occlud part that be inaccess to 
the scanner’ line-of-sight. us, complex shape such a the three- 
eleph statu in figur 2(a) and figur 2(b) cannot be properli 
acquir nor reconstruct base on convent (optical) scan- 
ners. moreover, some objects, like figur 2(c), be make of glossi or 
transpar materials, which pose anoth challeng that common 
optic cannot deal with. 

In thi work, we take a complet dier approach to shape 
reconstruction. e idea be to cast surfac reconstruct into a 
volumetr problem. our techniqu be base on the ancient uid dis- 
placement discoveri make by archimedes, state that: the volum 
of uid displac be equal to the volum of the part that be submerged. 
By dip an object in liquid along an axis, we can measur the

displac of the liquid volum displac and transform it 
into a seri of thin volum slice of the shape along the dip axis. 
By repeatedli dip the object in variou orient (see figur 
1), we gener dier volumetr displac and transform 
them into what we call a “dip transform”. 

3D reconstruct proce by measur the volum of obliqu 
thin slice of the shape. We refer to the volum of these slice a 
samples, and collect such sampl along dier angles. is, in 
turn, equip u with the abil to gener enough data to recov 
the geometri of the input shape. sinc our techniqu be base on 
use volum sampl that be gener by liquid access the 
object, we can acquir occlud and inaccess part in a rel 
straightforward fashion. 

figur 3 illustr the dip transform of 2D and 3D shapes. input 
shape (top row) be rotat and dip along dier orient 
to form the dip transform (boom row). In the dip transform 2D im- 
ages, each column repres measur along one axi and the 
row repres volum displac (or slices). We show that the 
dip transform be invert and thu the shape can be reconstruct 
back from it. 

our techniqu of reconstruct 3D shape with the dip trans- 
form be relat to comput tomographi (see section 2). common 
tomographi method use optic system with penetr wave 
to sampl the absorpt of the radiat along multipl parallel 
beams. We show that the dip transform be equival to the radon 
transform for binari volumes. while tomographi acquisit de- 
vice base on radiat system be expensive, bulki and must be 
use in a safe special environment, our dip-bas tomographi be 
inexpens and safe, while captur hidden part and structures. 
As such, it provid an appeal altern approach, gener 
a complet shape at a low comput cost, use a novel data 
acquisit technique. 

e invers transform requir solv an underdetermin prob- 
lem. e matrix involv be larg and spars and be nearli 
orthogonal. As such, they have nonzero paern and structur 
properti that can be exploit to acceler the numer com- 
putations. given a set of sampl of a give object, we use a pre- 
comput factor matrix to comput the invers dip transform 
in nearli linear time in the number of sampl and obtain a stabl 
numer solut to the problem. when the dimens of the 
problem be small to medium size, we solv the problem by (implic- 
itly) comput the pseudo-inverse, give rise to a solut with 
minimum norm. for veri larg problem we appli lsqr or lsmr, 
which be decomposition-fre and minim the norm of the residu

cannot be fulli reconstruct by convent (optical) 3D scanners. 

or relat quantiti over a krylov subspace, use matrix-vector 
products. 

e key advantag of the present approach be that it employ 
liquid a the sensor. unlik optic sensors, the liquid have no line- 
of-sight requirements, it penetr into caviti and hidden part 
of the subject, bypass all visibl and optic limit of 
convent scan devices. We demonstr the merit of our 
approach by present variou result of reconstruct complex 
objects, which includ larg portion of hidden regions. 

2 relat work 
e problem of surfac reconstruct from scan point have be 
research extens in the last coupl of decades. nevertheless 
scan base acquisit and reconstruct be beyond the scope of 
thi work, see e.g. [berger et al. 2014] for a comprehens survey. 

comput tomographi (ct) be the process of reconstruct an 
unknown volum from a collect of two-dimension project 
(shadow images) correspond to dier posit of the electro- 
magnet radiat sourc and repres the integr of emiss 
or absorpt from a give view. A classic way of reconstruct 
volum densiti from line integr captur by the project im- 
age be via the fourier slice eorem [bracewel 1956; kak and slaney 
2001; radon 1917], which state that the volum densiti can be 
recov from a number of 1D invers fourier transform of line 
in the project images. alternatively, algebra reconstruct 
techniqu (art) iter solv a set of linear equat [gordon 
et al. 1970; kak and slaney 2001] for the volum densities, use the 
kaczmarz iter scheme. 

CT play a central role in medic imag a well a in mani 
comput graphic relat applications. trifonov et al. [2006] use 
visibl light tomographi to acquir object make of glass and other 
transpar media. specically, they measur the refract of light 
through the transpar object and use tomograph reconstruct 
to reconstruct the object’ volume. 

still, 3D reconstruct of transpar and specular object have 
be a challeng problem in comput vision and graphics. trans- 
parent and specular objects, may have complex interior and exterior 
structur that can reect and refract light in complex ways. sinc 
it be beyond the scope of thi paper, we refer to the state-of-the-art 
survey of thi eld [ihrk et al. 2010]. 

stochast tomographi have be introduc in [gregson et al. 
2012] for the purpos of captur turbul uid mix behavior. 
instead of use the radon transform (fourier slice theorem) or al- 
gebraic reconstruct techniqu (art), their method us random 
walk to reconstruct the volum from an array of cameras. zhao et 
al. [2011] use an x-ray CT system to captur the inner structur of 
fabric and model their appearance. To accur render a material, 
a CT scan be use to captur it inner volum which be then use 
to comput the material’ scaer properties. recently, ijiri et 
al. [2014] use an x-ray CT system to accur captur the intri- 
cate intern structur of real-world 3D owers. ey segment the 
volum into ower organ and appli activ contour to smoothli 
reconstruct their surface.

3 3D dip transform 
accord to archimed equality, which coupl buoyanc and 
volume, dip an object in a bath of water allow for measur 
the volum of slice along the dip orient (perpendicular to 
the water surface) from the water displac level. base on thi 
principle, let u den a 3D dip transform of an object. 

3.1 definit 
suppos we be give an input object, repres a a volumetr 
binari function, 

F (x) = 
 
 

1 x ∈ Ω, 
0 otherwise,

where Ω ∈ R3 be the object’ interior domain. We den the accu- 
mulat volum of F (x) over time t , with orient θ , a the dip 
transform of the object, give by: 

F (t ;θ ) = 
∫ ∞

F (x)u

where u (t ) be a step function that equal 1 if t ≥ 0 and 0 otherwise. 
e time deriv of the dip transform, G (t ;θ ) = ∂f∂t (t ;θ ), be 

equival to the radon transform of a binari object [herman 2009]:

where δ (t ) be the dirac delta function. reli on the archimed 
equality, we get ∫ 

G (t ;θ )dt = V , ∀θ , 

where V be the volum of the object.

to the shape reconstruction. the angl from le to right, top to boom, 
be θ = 20◦, θ = 50◦, θ = 90◦ and θ = 130◦. 

analog to the comput tomographi (ct) eld, G (t ;θ ) can 
be visual use a sinogram – a visual represent of the 
object’ projections. In our case, each column in the sinogram repre- 
sent a dip prole, which be acquir along a specic orientation,

In practice, the object be dip in dier orient θ i ∈ Θ,

of sampl measurements, Gθ i [n] = G (nt ;θ i ), be extracted.

3.2 reconstruct 
In order to reconstruct F (x), an invers transform be applied. We 
rst den a discret version of the problem. denot the sampl 
measur by дθ ∈ RM , we recast the reconstruct model a 
a least-squar optim problem: 

arg min 
F̃ 

∑ 
θ i ∈Θ 




дθ i − srθ i F̃ 



2 , (4) 

where Θ be a set of dip orientations, Rθ i be a rotat oper which 
rotat the object by an angl of θ i around it center, and S be a 
summat oper that sum over the row of the rotat matrix, 
count the number of activ voxels, and output an m-length vector. 
We note that дθ i be equival to a vector of volum of slices, where 
the height of the slice be uniform. e unknown degre of freedom 
that form F̃ be give a a matrix of dimens M × K × L. our 
eventu goal be to nd a voxel binari solut in {0, 1}m×k×l 
that approxim F (x); thi solut repres the inversion. 

e matrix S and R be den via 

S =

where r̄θ be the rotat oper in matrix notat which rotat a 
vector object, gener by use bi-linear interpolation, and S̄ 
be a row sum matrix, which be oper on a vector matrix 
and sum the row of the origin matrix. In mathemat terms, 
S = I ⊗ v where I be an M ×M unit matrix and v be a column vector 
of one of size kl. 

for notat conveni we express (4) in vector form, a 
follows: 

arg min 
f 



д − Bf 

2 , (5) 

where f ∈ RN be the vector version of F̃ (column stack), д be a 
chain version of all the measur дθ , and B = SR ∈ rm×n be the 
chain “rotat and sum” matrix aer the vector procedure. 
finally, we use clamp to convert f into a binari solution, name 
a vector in {0, 1}n . 

3.3 numer solut 
In thi section we discu sever techniqu for solv (5), which 
den the invers dip transform. 

In practice, acquir dip signal by measur water’ elev 
rate be a time consum process. In addition, thi mechan oper- 
ation may limit the number of dip angles. us, a typic setup 
of a dip transform reconstruct constitut an underdetermin 
problem, where the number of measur do not uniqu 
den the desir object. 

convent invers radon transform-bas method assum 
a full represent of the data within the measurements, and 
therefor do not t our case. instead, we aim at develop a compu- 
tation inexpens method that comput the invers transform 
while exploit the structur of the dip matrices. 

our underdetermin minim problem (5) featur innit 
mani solutions, and one way to express them be by 

f = fp + z, 

where fp be a particular solut that satis bfp = д, and z be a 
vector in the null-spac of B, name a vector that satis Bz = 0. 
A common way of select a specic f , be to comput the solut 
that minim ‖ f ‖2 – thi be know a the min-norm solution. i 
method seek a solut in the activ space of the operator, eliminat- 
ing the null space. oen the null space contain high frequencies, 
and elimin them may have a regular eect. comput it 
be typic do via the pseudo-invers of B. We solv 

f = b†д, 

where 

B† = B (bbt )−1, 

and we assum that B have full row rank. In case where the reg- 
ular eect be not accomplished, tikhonov or other type of 
regular may be seamlessli incorpor into the solut 
procedure. In our case we could add a small diagon shi to bbt 
befor invert it to accomplish the desir eect. case of rank 
decienc can be dealt with by comput the QR factor of 
B and elimin linearli depend rows. It be easi to show that 
the solut in thi case have the small norm. 

In order to convert the solut back to a binari imag we de- 
termin the valu of the binari voxel use a threshold on the 
result image, use otsu’ method [otsu 1975]. e step in the 
reconstruct algorithm be demonstr in figur 6. 

comput the pseudo invers of B through it singular valu 
decomposit (svd) be the most numer stabl procedure, but 
it be unsuit for the current problem, becaus the comput 
of the svd do not respect sparsity. instead, we comput the 
choleski factor of bbt onc and for all: we seek a squar 
low triangular matrix G, such that bbt = ggt . We then store 
the factor G and use it repeatedli a we replac v throughout the 
computation. To form bbt , we exploit the block structur of B 
and construct the matrix product block by block. e solut of д 
requir backward substitut and forward substitut forgt and 
G, respectively. form the decomposit take O (W 3) oat 
point operations, wherea the backward and forward substitut 
be O (W 2). us, if we repeat the calcul for dier vector 
v , the overal comput cost be modest. 

take a close look at B = SR reveal that it be a spars matrix 
with a uniqu structure. for rθi , which rotat the object use a bi- 
linear interpolation, R typic have 4 nonzero entri per row in 2D 
reconstruct and 8 nonzero entri per row in 3D reconstruction. 
e matrix S also have a limit number of nonzero entries. e 
sparsiti paern of SR for 2D reconstruct be show in figur 5. 
onli 4% of the matrix entri be nonzero. 

In a huge-scal see a direct decomposit approach may 
consum prohibit storag resources. In such case we resort to 
iter solver such a lsqr [paig and saunder 1982] or lsmr 
[fong and saunder 2011], with an appropri precondit 
approach that exploit the special structur of S and R.

dip transform for 3D shape reconstruct • 79:5 

fig. 5. A sampl from B = SR . the object size be N = 50 × 50, number of 
orient K = 15 and number of measur for each angl T = 50. 
onli 4% of the matrix be non zero. row wise there be approxim N 
non-zero entri (white), column-wis there be roughli K . 

4 dip and volum sampl 
see up the 3D dip devic be challeng a it involv physi- 
cal measur of water level, whose accuraci can be compro- 
mise by mani factor such a ripples, tank’ cross-section, record 
sensitivity, etc. In addition, rotat and lower an object in the 
tank need to be perform in a mechanically-control manner, 
and be precis calibrated. 

We consid three dier physic setup to measur the dip 
transform in practic (see figur 7): 

(1) dip – object be lower at constant speed into a tank 
which be partial lled with water. e water elev be 
recorded, therebi measur the slices’ volume. 

(2) drain – object be xed underwat in a tank. A tap at 
the boom of the tank be released, drain the water from 
the tank at a constant ow rate and the water lower be 
recorded. i rate be proport to the volum of the 
slices. 

(3) flood – similarli to dipping, the object be lower at 
constant speed, however, here water fulli lled tank. As the 
object be dipped, water overow into a second tank, where 
the water elev rate be recorded. e second tank be 
thinner, enhanc water elev rate, which potenti 
lead to high accuracy. 

each setup have it advantag and disadvantages; we provid a 
few detail below. 

e drain process involv an oper of a mechan tap 
which introduc nois upon open and close it. furthermore, 
the drain process may creat whirlpool around the tap, result 
in nois in the water level measurement. 

e ood instal involv water transfer from one 
tank to another. water level read in the second tank be error 
prone a water may not be transfer properli to the second tank. 
for example, the water surfac tension may prevent the water from 
drip complet into the second tank even in an overow sce- 
nario. also, such water transfer take time, thu it signicantli 
reduc the measur speed. We have select the dip setup 
to be use dure our experiments. although the object be lower 
at a constant step size into the water, the amount of water elev 
be chang within each step. when the bodi be lower d unit 
in the ith step and the water level rise δi units, the volum slice 
measur correspond to d + δi vertic along of the orient 

object. sinc in our discret see in (4) the object’ voxel be 
accumul within equal space slices, we have to preprocess the 
measur so they t the algorithm input. us, we interpol 
the acquir non-uniform slice into a continu function and 
resampl it uniformly. e new sampl repres volum of slice 
with the same width. e number of slice be determin by the 
user. at said, the nest level of detail be bound by the origin 
water elev rate; the low the rate, the ner the level of detail 
of the reconstruct geometry. figur 8 exhibit physic measur 
of a spheric ball, interpol and resampled. 

It should be note that our dip scheme assum that the 
object have no vertic cap in ani orientation. A cap be a vertic 
caviti that form a vessel, in which water can be accumul if 
the object be elev vertic and air can be trapped, gener 
air pocket when the object be dip in the opposit orientation. 
most caps, if they exist, would be small and would have a minor 
eect akin to nois on the dip transform. nevertheless, cap can be 
detect by dip and then lie back the object with the liquid 
trap in the cap, yield two dier water levels. flip the 
object vertic allow detect air pocket a they becom caps. 

5 experi and result 
To test the feasibl of our techniqu we have construct both 
3D dip simulator, which virtual dip know models, and a 
physic 3D dip robot, show in figur 9. We have test our 
techniqu both qualit and quantitatively. 

5.1 dip simul 
We have implement a 3D dip simul to allow experi 
use a wide rang of 3D objects, a well a dier dip scenar- 
io (vari number of dips, noise, etc.). To simul our mechanism, 
a 3D model, repres a mesh surface, be rst convert into a 
volum representation, use standard voxel method [patil 
and ravi 2005]. dip in a specic orient be simul by 
divid the object by equal space surfac in the request ori- 
entation. e number of voxel in each slab be counted, result in 
a singl dip measurement. By collect a set of dip measurements, 
we then appli our numer solut to reconstruct the volum 
from the dip transform. It should be note that the number of dip- 
ping orient inuenc the qualiti of reconstruction. As the 
number of dip prol increases, more detail be visible. 

In order to demonstr the evolut of a shape a a function of 
the number of dips, we perform the dip process on sever 
objects, use an increas number of orientations. 

figur 10 demonstr the qualiti of our reconstruction, use 
the raw voxel representation, a a function of the number of dips. 
As can be observed, a the number of dip increas more geometr 
detail be reconstructed. note specic the ne reconstruct 
detail of the octopu arms. 

In figur 11 we show our reconstruct evolut of dier 3D 
models, with a resolut of 2403. while low number of orient 
captur the raw shape of the object, use 10% of the requir dip 
(which be theoret need for perfect reconstruction) result in 
high qualiti reconstructions. tabl 1 summar sever statist 
for these model includ a reconstruct error use the metro 
method [cignoni et al. 1998].

our method requir no line-of-sight between the sensor and the

can be understood from figur 13. In 13(a) we have test the recon- 
struction error (use metro [cignoni et al. 1998]) for increas 
number of dips. We averag over result from dier object 
and dier resolutions, thus, we present the reconstruct er- 
ror a a function of the percentag of dip orient (from the

dip transform for 3D shape reconstruct • 79:7 

fig. 9. appli the dip transform in practic use the dip robot – a 
mechan arm abl to dip a fix object in dier orient and track 
the rate of water elevation. 

onli 10% of the requir angles, a show in figur 11. In addition, 
sinc our practic system introduc nois to the measurements, we 
have add a white gaussian noise, to the virtual object’ dips, and 
measur the qualiti of reconstruct a a function of the signal to 
nois ratio (snr). sinc our method solv an optim problem 
with a matrix structur regularization, it can handl noise, in the 
sens that the error correl with the nois in a linear nature. e 
result in 13(b), which demonstr fals posit and fals negative, 
show that the reconstruct error be considerable, even for low 
snr. 

5.2 the dip robot 
follow the discuss in section 4 we construct a fulli auto- 
matic system, which incorpor the dip method. e setup be 
rather simple, consist of a robot arm with one linear axi low- 
ere the object (move perpendicular to the water surface) and 
two rotat arm respons for see the object’ orientation. 
e vertic step be set to 2[mm] and the rotat to 1◦. e 
water sensor use be non-contact absolut posit transducer, plu 
a oat ball, with accuraci of 0.1[mm]. figur 9, show our 3D 
dip robot in action. 

reconstruct an object from real dip measur be a chal- 
leng task. system nois (due to jier and water ripples) should 
be consid and a practic number of dip orient may 
not be sucient diverse. however, geometr prior on the re- 
construct body, such a smooth and symmetry, may help to 
improv the qualiti of reconstruction. 

In order to reconstruct a 3D object we perform the follow 
stages: 

(1) nois smooth - the measur signal be smoothed, 
use a normal 5 sampl gaussian kernel, in order 
to reduc nois which mainli lie in high frequenc and 
do not degrad the object’ detail due to the smooth 
assumption. 

(2) symmetri exploit - orient which yield the 
same dip signal be measur onli onc and the result- 
ing signal be duplic to all of the appropri locations. 

(3) dip signal interpol - In order to gener dip- 
ping signal of miss orient or to gener more 
sampl between two consecut measurements, interpo- 
lation between neighbor sampl be performed. 

(4) reconstruct - use the smooth duplic interpo- 
late samples, our reconstruct algorithm be generated. 

In the experiments, we dip dier object a show in the 
le column of figur 15. ese object exhibit symmetri which 
enabl signic reduct in the number of requir orientations. 
for example, the cat object (figur 15 rst row) be dip in 35 dif- 
ferent orientations, follow by nois remov smoothing. figur 14 
compar between a real noisi dip measurement, it smooth ver- 
sion and the simul ground truth dip. In order to extend the 
number of dips, we next exploit the uniqu geometri of the ob- 
ject which have symmetri of 120◦ around the z axi and an addit 
reect symmetri within each third. us, the number of real dip 
be duplic into 210 virtual dips. ese dip be interpolated, 
result a total number of 420 dips. 

i number of dip enabl resolut of 403, which can be 
upsampl and smoothed, due to the smooth properti of the 
object. e reconstruct of our dip algorithm on the real 
measur be show in figur 15(d). In addition, our dip 
reconstruct be compar qualit to a scan of a 3D struc- 
ture light scanner. As can be see in figur 15(c), the structur 
light scanner can not reconstruct self occlud part of the objects. 
however, our dip reconstruct result in a complet object.

one obviou limit of the propos method be it speed of 
acquisition. e mechan arm dip the object vertic step by 
step, and it be necessari to read the liquid level in between steps, 
which introduc a tempor boleneck. We be current explor 
way for improv thi by develop a continu dip and 
read process, wherebi we measur the ratio between the vertic 
dip speed and the liquid elevation. We be also investig 
faster comput methods. futur work may includ the devel- 
opment of spars recoveri techniqu base on compress sensing, 
which exploit the redund that exist in the binari representa- 
tion of the voxels, to signicantli reduc the number of dip 
orientations. i approach may lead to a much small optimiza- 
tion problem, which in turn will allow for further acceler of the 
solut procedure, and the reduct of the overal comput 
time requir to solv the invers transform problem. 

anoth limit that we have discuss be “no-cap” assumption. 
e dip method assum that the object have no signic cap 
or vessel. i may introduc error onc the liquid be spill into 
the cap and ll it up. We be consid deal with such cap by 
measur the level of liquid also dure a vertic li of the object. 
e amount of liquid trap in the cap can be measur to ass 
the volum of the cap. analyz the prol of the liquid level 
measur on up and down movement may reveal some addit 
geometr featur of the shape of the cap. 

e success of thi volumetr techniqu lead u to specul that 
we may be abl to consid a multi-mod acquisit setup where 
the reconstruct combin the inform gain by the variou 
modalities. for example, we may be abl to util the strength 
of laser scanner for sampl the shape-vis exterior and the 
volumetr and occlud inform reconstruct from the dip 
transform.
