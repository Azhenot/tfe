We live in an age of inequality—or at least in an age of wor-ri about inequality. pope franci remark that “ine-qu be the root of social evil”, while presid obama 
call econom inequ “the defin challeng of our time”. A 
recent pew report found that european and american judg 
inequ a pose the great threat to the world, beat reli- 
giou and ethnic hatred, pollution, nuclear weapons, and diseas 
like aids. A major of respond in each of the 44 countri 
poll say the gap between rich and poor be a big or veri big prob- 
lem face their country1. and a new report by oxfam2 reveal that 
the wealth own by the eight richest peopl in the world be equiva- 
lent to the wealth own by the poorest 50% of the world, spark 
widespread outrage. 

academics—from philosophers, economists, and polit sci- 
entist to psychologists, archaeologists, and even physicists—ar 
also fascin by the causes, consequences, and extent of eco- 
nomic inequality. thi interest be reflect in the extent of attent 
to thoma piketty’ book, capit in the twenty-first century3,4, 
and be ground in a grow public and scholarli appreci of 
the startl extent of econom inequality. globally, the top 1% of 
the popul own 50% of the wealth, and the bottom 70% own 
onli 3% of the wealth5. 

mani be particularli concern about the level of inequ 
in the unit states, which have be grow rapidli sinc the 
1970s6 (see fig. 1). the gini coeffici (a measur of inequ 
wherebi 0 be perfect equal and 100 be perfect inequality, or one 
person own all the wealth) in the unit state be now 85—the 
high of all western nations, and sixth high worldwid among 
countri with popul over 1 million (ref 6,7). A typic 
american ceo current make about 354 time a much a a typi- 
cal worker, while just 50 year ago the ratio be 20/18. although 
the unit state have be get richer overall, the vast major 
of thi increas in wealth (over 95%) have go to the top 1% of 
wealthi americans6. 

the concern that peopl express about inequ be also found 
in control laboratori studies, which find that a desir for equal 
distribut of good emerg earli in human develop and 
be appar in mani differ cultures9. As such, fran de waal 
nice summar a broad consensu across mani field when he 
writes: “robin hood have it right. humanity’ deepest wish be to 
spread the wealth.”10 

whi peopl prefer unequ societi 
christina starmans*, mark sheskin and paul bloom 

there be immens concern about econom inequality, both among the scholarli commun and in the gener public, and 
mani insist that equal be an import social goal. however, when peopl be ask about the ideal distribut of wealth in 
their country, they actual prefer unequ societies. We suggest that these two phenomenon can be reconcil by notic that, 
despit appear to the contrary, there be no evid that peopl be bother by econom inequ itself. rather, they 
be bother by someth that be often confound with inequality: econom unfairness. draw upon laboratori studies, 
cross-cultur research, and experi with babi and young children, we argu that human natur favour fair distribu- 
tions, not equal ones, and that when fair and equal clash, peopl prefer fair inequ over unfair equality. both psy- 
cholog research and decis by policymak would benefit from more clearli distinguish inequ from unfairness. 

A puzzl arises, however, when we consid a larg separ 
bodi of research in polit psycholog and behaviour econom- 
ics: it turn out that when peopl be ask about the ideal distri- 
bution of wealth in their country, they actual prefer unequ 
societies11. thi prefer for inequ materi in a wide 
rang of countries12,13, across peopl on opposit side of the politi- 
cal spectrum11, and even in adolescents14. so, when peopl be ask 
to distribut resourc among a small number of peopl in a lab 
study, they insist on an exactli equal distribution. but when peopl 
be ask to distribut resourc among a larg group of peopl in 
the actual world, they reject an equal distribution, and prefer a cer- 
tain extent of inequality. how can the strong prefer for equal 
found in public polici discuss and laboratori studi coincid 
with the prefer for societ inequ found in polit and 
behaviour econom research? 

We argu here that these two set of find can be reconcil 
through a surpris empir claim: when the data be examin 
closely, it turn out that there be no evid that peopl be actual 
concern with econom inequ at all. rather, they be both- 
ere by someth that be often confound with inequality: eco- 
nomic unfairness. 

We should stress that our argument be not that scholar and 
research fail to notic the distinct between inequ and

unfairness. On the contrary, the scientist we cite below be 
often care to distinguish equal and fair in their studies. 
however, researchers, public figures, and the medium often claim 
that peopl be specif concern about inequ of outcome. 
much polit discours frame the problem in term of grow 
econom inequality, with no refer to fair concerns. and, 
a we discu immedi below, mani experiment studi claim 
to have discov ‘inequ aversion’ or ‘egalitarian motives’. 
We leav open the question of whether these research intend 
to claim that there be evid for a specif avers to inequal- 
ity, abov and beyond an avers to fairness, or whether thi be 
just ‘loos talk’. however, to our knowledge, none of these research- 
er have make the specif claim we wish to make here: that there 
be no empir evid so far that peopl have ani avers to 
inequ itself. 

We suggest that the percept that there be a prefer for 
equal aris through an undu focu on special circumstances, 
often studi in the laboratory, where inequ and unfair 
coincide. In most situations, however, includ those involv 
real-world distribut of wealth, people’ concern about fair 
lead them to favour unequ distributions. 

An equal bia in the lab 
anyon look for evid that peopl have a natur avers to 
inequ will find numer laboratori studi that seemingli con- 
firm their view. for example, studi have found “a univers desir 
for more equal pay”12, “egalitarian motif in humans”15, “egalitari- 
anism in young children”16, and that “equal trump reciprocity”17. 
A googl scholar search for “inequ aversion” yield over 10,000 
paper that bear on thi topic. 

and, indeed, when subject in laboratori studi be ask to 
divid resourc among unrel individuals, they tend to divid 
them equally18,19. If a previou situat have lead to a pre-exist 
inequality, peopl will divid futur resourc unequ in order 
to correct or minim the inequ between others15,17. thi bia 
be so power that subject sometim prefer equal outcom in 
which everyon get less overal to unequ outcom where eve- 
ryon get more overall15,20,21. the desir for equality, even at the 
expens of good averag consequences, appear in non-monetari 
domain a well. for example, peopl object to medic interven- 
tion that would save more life overal by reduc cure rate for 
a small group of peopl and increas cure rate for a larg group 
of people22. 

furthermore, peopl appear to view the equal distribut of 
resourc a a moral good; they express anger toward those who 
benefit from unequ distributions15. thi outrag be suffici 
strong that subject will pay to punish unequ distributors23. one 
studi examin thi across 15 divers cultur found that mem- 
ber of all popul demonstr some willing to adminis- 
ter costli third-parti punish for unequ divis of resourc 
(cost themselv the equival of a half-day’ wage in some 
cases)—although the magnitud of thi punish vari sub- 
stantial across populations24,25. moreover, peopl expect other to 
engag in thi kind of costli third-parti punish for those that 
make unequ offers23. 

studi of child between the age of three and eight year find 
a similar equal bias26,16. three-year-old divid resourc equal 
among third parties27,28, and, although they be typic selfish 
when they themselv be involv in the interaction, even three- 
year-old report that they should share equally29. 

six-year-old show an even strong commit to equal dis- 
tribution, insist on throw out extra resourc rather than 
allow them to be unequ distribut between two absent third 
parties28,30. In one study, six- to eight-year-old be task with 
distribut eras to two boy who have clean up their room. 
when there be an odd number of erasers, child insist that 

the experiment should throw the extra eras in the trash rather 
than establish an unequ division28,31. they respond thi way 
even if the recipi would never know that one of them receiv 
less, suggest that child weren’t worri about the recipients’ 
feelings, but be oppos to creat the inequ even if none of 
the recipi knew about it28. even more tellingly, child be just 
a like to reject unequ distribut when they reflect generos- 
iti (the distributor give up all her candi to the receiver) a when 
they reflect selfish (the distributor kept all the candi for her- 
self). thi suggest that the reject be specif an avers to 
inequality, rather than punish selfishness30. 

thi bia show up not onli in children’ behaviour, but also in 
their evalu of others. In one study, six- to eight-year-old chil- 
dren be ask who they like better: someon who split four eras- 
er equal between the particip and anoth child, or someon 
who give all four eras to the participant. children report like 
the equal distributor more than someon who give them more than 
the other child32. 

some suggest evid for a similar bia show up in babi 
and toddlers. when twelve-month-old infant saw a puppet distrib- 
ute two item to two other puppets, they look at the scene longer 
when the distributor give both toy to one puppet than when she 
give the puppet one toy each, suggest that they be surpris 
by the unequ distribution33–35. infant not onli expect peopl to 
equal distribut resources, they also activ prefer those who 
do. after watch two puppet distribut equal or unequally, 
16-month-old prefer to approach the equal distributor34. 

An inequ bia in the real world 
given these findings, one might expect that when peopl be ask 
to distribut resourc across a real-world group of people, they 
would choos an equal distribut of resourc across all segment 
of society. but they do not. 

A recent studi by norton and ariely11 receiv well-deserv 
medium attention, a it show that peopl both underestim the 
amount of inequ in our societi and prefer a more egalitar- 
ian societi to the one they think they live in. the author describ 
their studi a examin “disagr about the optim level 
of wealth inequality”, and report the find of “a surpris level 
of consensus: all demograph groups—even those not usual 
associ with wealth redistribut such a republican and the 
wealthy—desir a more equal distribut of wealth than the statu 
quo”. and an articl by ari in atlant be titled, “american want 
to live in a much more equal countri (they just don’t realiz it)”36. 

these summari be accurate: particip in these studi do 
prefer more equal than the current situation. but the result also 
suggest that they be not particularli worri about larg inequali- 
ties. instead, these subject claim that, in the perfect society, indi- 
vidual in the top 20% should have more than three time a much 
money a individu in the bottom 20% (see fig. 2). and when they 
be give a forc choic between equal and unequ distribut 
of wealth, and told to assum that they would be randomli assign 
to be anyon from the richest to the poorest person (that is, a ‘veil of 
ignorance’37), over half of the subject explicitli reject the option 
of an equal distribut of wealth, prefer inequality11. thus, 
the data suggest that when it come to real-world distribut of 
wealth, peopl have a prefer for a certain amount of inequality. 

thi prefer for inequ materi in 16 other coun- 
tries12,13, across peopl on both the left and right of the polit 
spectrum11, and in teenagers14. As norton38 put it, “peopl exhibit a 
desir for unequality—not too equal, but not too unequal”. 

indeed, these data might underestim people’ prefer for 
unequ distributions. one follow-up study39 contrast norton 
and ariely’ question about the percentag of wealth that should 
correspond to each quintil of the american popul with a 
question about what the averag wealth should be in each quintile.

the former question result in an ideal ratio of poorest to wealthi- 
est of about 1/4, but for the latter question the ratio jump to 1/50. 
when the connect between the two question be explain to 
participants, a major chose the high inequ ratio a reflect- 
ing their actual belief for both measures. 

fair in the lab 
how can thi prefer for inequ in the real world be rec- 
oncil with the strong prefer for equal found in labora- 
tori studies? We suggest that thi discrep aris becaus the 
laboratori find review above—which report the discoveri of 
egalitarian motives, a desir for more equality, or inequ aver- 
sion—do not in fact provid evid that an avers to inequ 
be drive the prefer for equal distribution. instead, these find- 
ing be all consist with both a prefer for equal and with a 
prefer for fairness, becaus the studi be design so that the 
equal outcom be also the fair one. thi be becaus the recipi be 
indistinguish with regard to consider such a need and 
merit. hence, whether subject be sensit to fair or to equal- 
ity, they will be inclin to distribut the good equally. 

thi idea be support by numer studies, includ follow- 
up of the experi describ above, by the same researchers, in 
which fair be care distinguish from equality. these stud- 
y find that peopl choos fair over equality. for example, in 
the studi in which child have to award eras to two boy who 
have clean up their room and chose to throw out the extra eraser, 
both boy be describ a have do a good job. but when 
child be told that one boy do more work than the other, they 
award the extra eras to the hard worker28,40. In fact, when one 
recipi have do more work, six-year-old believ that he or she 
should receiv more resources, even if equal pay be an option26,41–43. 
likewise, although infant prefer equal in a neutral circumstance, 
they expect an experiment to distribut reward preferenti to 
individu who have do more work35. 

thi prefer for inequ be not restrict to situat where 
one person have do more work, but also extend to reward peo- 
ple who previous act help or unhelpfully. when three-year- 
old wit a puppet help anoth puppet climb a slide or reach 
a toy, they late alloc more resourc to the help puppet than 
to a puppet that push anoth down the slide, or hit him on the 
head with the toy44. 

As a final twist, consid a situat with two individuals, identi- 
cal in all relev regards, where one get 10 dollar and the other 
get nothing. thi be plainli unequal, but be it fair? It can be, if the 
alloc be random. adult consid it fair to use imparti pro- 
cedur such a coin flip and lotteri when distribut mani 
differ kind of resources45. children have similar views. In the 

erasers-for-room-clean studi describ above, if child be 
give a fair ‘spinner’ to randomli choos who get the extra eraser, 
they be happi to creat inequality46. one person get two eras- 
er and anoth get one (or ten and zero for that matter) can be 
entir fair and acceptable, although it be clearli not equal. 

fair in the real world 
It follows, then, that if one believ that (a) peopl in the real world 
exhibit variat in effort, ability, moral deservingness, and so on, 
and (b) a fair system take these consider into account, then 
a prefer for fair will dictat that one should prefer unequ 
outcom in actual societies. the ideal distribut of wealth pro- 
pose by particip in the norton and ari study, then, may 
reflect how fair prefer interact with intuit about the 
extent to which such trait vari in the population. 

tyler47 us a relat argument to explain whi there be not a 
strong degre of public outrag in the face of econom inequality. 
He argu that american regard the american market system to 
be a fair procedur for wealth allocation, and, accordingly, believ 
strongli in the possibl of social mobil (see box 1). On thi 
view, then, people’ discont about the current social situat will 
be good predict by their belief about the unfair of wealth 
alloc than by their belief about inequality. 

We have argu that a prefer for fair outcom be earli 
emerg and universal. but it be also clear that peopl differ in their 
intuit a to which resourc should be distribut on the basi of 
merit. most american now believ that a fair system be one in which 
everi adult get a vote, but thi be a rel modern intuition. In 
our own time, there be controversi over whether fair dictat that 
everyon should have equal access to health care and high educa- 
tion. put differently, there be some disagr over what should be 
a right, held equal and unchang by ani sort of variat in merit. 

there be also polit and cultur differences. norton and 
ariely11 found that women, democrats, and the poor desir rela- 
tive more equal distribut than men, republicans, and the 
wealthy, and be also more accur in estim the extent of 
current inequality. Or consid that a recent survey of wealthi tech- 
nolog entrepreneur in silicon valley found that all predict that 
a strict meritocracy, where everyone’ incom be strictli propor- 
tional to their productivity, would result in an extrem unequ 
society, with the top 10% earn more than 50% of the nation’ 
wealth48. thi intuit be probabl consider more extrem than 
one would find in a more typic sample. look outsid of the 
unit state and europe, it be clear that there be wide differ 
in fair concern across world cultures25,49–52. 

finally, there be development differences. while even the 
young infant test show some sensit to fair over

equality35, young child may place a great emphasi on an 
equal ‘heuristic’ than do old children53–55. indeed, the rel 
weight of variou factor that can justifi inequality—such a 
luck, effort, and skill—develop even through adolescence56. 

whi fair be central 
We be hardli the first to posit a univers moral concern with 
fairness. for instance, fair be claim to be one of the univer- 
sal foundat of moral by scholar work in moral founda- 
tion theory52,57, and have be argu by mani development and 
compar psychologist to be a univers and unlearn human 
capacity10,58. the univers of thi concern rais the question of 
it evolutionari history. 

under one analysis, a desir for fairness—such a fair distribu- 
tion of food to the member of a group—can be see a a prosoci 
motivation, evolv to constrain our natur selfishness. A propen- 
siti to favour fair distribut be sometim see a aris becaus 
it benefit the group, a propos develop in the context of cultur 
group selection59 and, more controversially, genet group selec- 
tion60,61; see ref 62,63 for critic discussions. but a sensit to fair- 
ness might also benefit individuals, consist with a more standard 
evolutionari approach. for example, fair may serv a a signal 
of impartiality, avoid the problem of signal favourit to 
one coalit over another64,65. 

but these analysi don’t provid an explan for whi a pro- 
pensiti toward and sensit to fair would emerge, a oppos 
to a presum simpler equal bias. one propos be that fair 
intuit be root in adapt for differenti respond to 
the prosoci and antisoci action of others. for cooper and 

prosoci to evolve, there have to be some solut to the problem 
of free-riders, cheaters, and bad actors. the usual explan for 
thi be that we have evolv a propens to make bad behaviour 
costli and good behaviour beneficial, through punish and 
reward66,67. that is, we respond differ to individu base on 
what one can see a their ‘deservingness’—respons that be pre- 
sent even in infants68. it’ possibl that fair intuit more gen- 
eral develop from thi moral foundation. 

A relat propos focu on shun selfish individuals, rather 
than punish them. when individu can choos the peopl 
with whom they interact for mutual benefici tasks, cooper 
individu gain benefit from be includ and selfish individu- 
al lose out on those benefit by be shunned69,70. but individu 
who be too cooperative—too generous—run the risk of be take 
advantag of by others71. So a balanc must be struck. To treat every- 
one equal would entail penal of more product individu- 
al when they collabor with less product individu rel 
to highli product individuals. In contrast with equality, fair 
allow individu with differ level of product to share the 
benefit of their collabor proportionately72. thi focu on fair- 
ness be particularli import for human (compar with even our 
closest evolutionari relatives), due to the critic import of col- 
labor in human hunt and foraging73. 

conclus and futur direct 
here we have explor the notion that, contrari to appearances, 
peopl be not troubl by inequ for it own sake; indeed, they 
often prefer unequ distributions, both in laboratori condit 
and in the real world. what realli troubl peopl about the world 

In addit to concern about the unfair of an equal distribu- 
tion, peopl might have other motiv for prefer an une- 
qual distribut of wealth in their society. here we consid two 
such motiv more closely: a selfish desir to have more than 
others, and a belief that inequ be necessari to allow for mobility. 

selfish 
one consider underli an inequ prefer have lit- 
tle to do with an abstract desir for fairness, but instead reflect 
a desir to have more than others. obvious peopl have selfish 
motivations, but what be interest here be that these desir be 
not alway for increas one’ absolut amount, but be often for 
increas one’ stand rel to others78–80. for example, stud- 
y of incom and happi have reveal that, onc a basic level 
of wealth be achieved, rel wealth be more import for overal 
happiness81–83. similarly, a vast bodi of research in social psychol- 
ogi find that peopl engag in constant comparison of themselv 
with others84,85. know that one’ incom be much high (or 
lower) than that of a neighbour have a substanti impact on hap- 
piness80. As gore vidal put it, “everi time a friend succeed I die 
a little”. 

thi motiv for rel advantag can motiv a desir for 
unequ distributions. indeed, to achiev the warm glow associ- 
ate with rel advantage, peopl be even will to pay a cost 
themselv to reduc others’ incomes86. even young child show 
thi rel advantage-seek behaviour. five-year-old often 
reject equal payout of two prize token for themselv and two 
prize token for anoth child, and choos instead onli one token 
for themselves, if that mean that the other child will get none87. 
that is, the inequ associ with rel advantag be so 
appeal that it overrid both a desir for fair and a desir 
for absolut gain. 

motiv and mobil 
A further motiv for inequ may come from the idea that 
inequ be necessari to motiv industri and allow for 
social mobility. for example, norton38 argu that peopl prefer 
inequ becaus they see it a a motiv forc that lead peo- 
ple to work harder and better, know that do so can improv 
their station in life, and that of their children. 

thi belief entail a sort of meritocrat mobility, and, indeed, 
such mobil be a necessari condit for an unequ societi to 
be a fair one. after all, a societi lack mobil be a societi in 
which those born into poverti remain in poverty, regardless of 
their hard work and ingenuity. hence, unless peopl view merit 
a be entir heritable, fair requir mobility. not surpris- 
ingly, then, a belief in meritocrat mobil be associ with more 
toler for inequality, a reflect in less discomfort with exist 
wealth inequality, less support for the redistribut of educ 
resources, and less willing to support rais tax on the rich88. 

from thi perspective, cultur differ in expect 
about mobil may account for differ in toler of ine- 
qualiti across cultures. for example, american might have an 
unreason toler for inequ in part becaus they tend to 
overestim the extent of mobil in the unit states77, which be 
in fact low than in place like canada and most of europe89–92. 
one reason for thi lack of mobil be that the incom distribut 
in the unit states—th distanc between the poorest and richest 
citizens—i much great than in rival countries. move from the 
tenth percentil to the ninetieth percentil in denmark requir a 
us$45,000 increas in income, but make the same jump in the 
unit state would requir an increas of us$93,000 (ref. 93). and 
the situat be not improving—whil 92% of american child 
born in 1940 would go on to earn more than their parents, onli 
50% of child born in 1980 have do so94.

perspectivenatur human behaviour 

we live in today be consider that be relat to inequ (see 
box 2), such a advers social consequences, a corros of demo- 
cratic ideals, poverty, and, of most interest to u here, unfairness. 

indeed, we believ that there be no evid so far that child 
or adult poss ani gener avers to inequality. A relat case 
against a focu on equal have be make recent by frankfurt74, 
who argu on norm ground that peopl shouldn’t care about 
reduc inequality. what realli matters, he argues, be that every- 
one have a suffici amount to live a decent life. frankfurt acknowl- 
edg that a focu on improv the situat of the most needi may 
reduc inequ a a side effect, but argu that thi reduct be 
not, in itself, a moral good. 

our own argument against a focu on inequ be a psychologi- 
cal one. In thi paper we have outlin a wealth of empir evi- 
denc suggest that peopl don’t care about reduc inequ 
per se. rather, peopl have an avers toward unfairness, and under 
certain special circumst thi lead them to reject unequ dis- 
tributions. In other conditions, includ those involv real-world 
distribut of wealth, it lead them to favour unequ distribu- 
tions. In the current econom environ in the unit state and 
other wealthi nations, concern about fair happen to lead to 
a prefer for reduc the current level of inequality. however, 
in variou other societi across the world and across histori (for 
example, when face with the communist ideal of the former 
ussr), concern about fair lead to anger about too much equal- 
ity. To understand these opposit drives, one need to focu not on 
whether the system result in a rel equal or unequ distribu- 
tion of wealth, but whether it be view a fair. 

Of course, it may be that there realli be a prefer for equal 
outcom that exist abov and beyond a prefer for fair out- 
comes. but to explor this, research need to construct studi that 
care distinguish equal from other relat considerations. for 
example, perhap if a procedur result in too larg an inequality, 
peopl would be motiv to reduc that inequality, even if they 
believ the procedur to be fair and the inequ to have no other 
consequences. thi be an empir question. 

furthermore, the idea that people’ discont with the current 
distribut of wealth have to do with fairness, rather than inequal- 
iti itself, open up a wealth of new question about which factor 
(for example, hard work, skill, need, morality) be psycholog 
relev for fair distributions. In particular, the development tra- 
jectori of concern for these differ factor be larg unexplored, 
includ question relat to how child determin which fac- 
tor be relev to resourc distribut (for example, effort, need, 

and so on) and which be not (for example, height). emphas 
the role of fair intuit in population-level distribut prefer- 
enc also rais some interest and under-explor psycholog 
question relat to how peopl perceiv the exist distribut 
of factor such a merit, skill, and deserving in their societies. 

what about practic implications? As with most psycholog 
claim of thi sort, our propos has, at best, indirect implic 
for public policy. even if the averag individu desir a somewhat 
unequ society, one might argu that peopl be mistaken in what 
they want. perhap peopl would actual be good off in a perfectli 
equal society—they just don’t know it. also, even if it be assum that 
peopl be correct in their desir for a societi with some econom 
divers (but not a much a we current have), thi doesn’t tell u 
how to achiev such a society. it’ perfectli coher to be in favour 
of reduc inequality, but against certain plan for redistribution75. 

We do see two implic of thi work, however. 
first, it’ clear that mani peopl be misinform about how 

well their societi match their ideals. they be wrong about how 
much inequ there is, believ the current situat to be much 
more equal than it actual is11–12,39, but see ref. 76. furthermore, 
american have exagger view about the extent of social mobil- 
iti in the unit states77, and thu the extent to which the current 
american market system be a fair procedur for wealth allocation. 
We have argu that view about fair will be most predict of 
discont with econom inequality, and thu public educ on 
the actual current rate of mobil will help to ensur that people’

econom research. 

while concern about fairness, along with other considera- 
tions, may motiv a prefer for inequality, there are, of 
course, variou countervail psycholog forc that lead to 
an equal preference. one of these forc be a worri about the 
consequ of an unequ society. that is, even if peopl have 
no problem with inequ itself, it might have neg conse- 
quenc that peopl be motiv to avoid. 

for one thing, a inequ increases, self-report happi 
diminishes, especi among the bottom 40% of incom earn- 
ers95. one reason for thi be that rel disadvantag have a larg 
neg impact on well-b than rel advantag have a posi- 
tive impact96. when peopl know where they stand in the overal 
incom distribution, those on the low end of the scale report 
less job satisfaction, but those on the high end of the scale do 
not report ani great satisfaction97. thi have neg effect for 
product too: worker who know they be on the low side of 
the distribut decreas their effort, but know that one be on 
the high end do not lead to an increas in effort98. 

still, a tyler47 point out, it be not clear whether the corros 
effect of inequ on happi be due to inequ per se, or 
due to the percept of unfair inequality. that is, it be an open 
question whether peopl who get less than other would suffer 
decreas in happi and product if they believ that 
they be in a fair system, one in which increas effort on their 
part could lead to social mobility. 

nevertheless, inequ in a societi also predict a great 
degre of violence, obesity, teenag pregnancy, and interperson 
distrust99. area of the unit state with high incom inequal- 
iti also tend to have high divorc and bankruptci rate than 
area with more egalitarian incom distributions100 and they suf- 
fer from high homicid rates101. similar neg effect show 
up in laboratori studi with simul public good game in 
which the extent of inequ be set by the researchers—when 
the inequ be make salient, there be less cooper and 
inter-connectedness102.

second, a frankfurt74 point out, contemporari polit dis- 
cours often blur togeth variou concern that should be thought 
of a distinct. worri about inequ be conflat with worri 
about poverty, an eros of basic rights, and—a we have focu 
on here—unfairness. If it’ true that inequ in itself isn’t realli 
what be bother people, then we might be good off by more 
care pull apart these concerns, and shift the focu to

and equal be differ cannot mere be a footnot on empir
