(http://www.databricks.com/) and an adjunct professor at UC berkeley, ghodsi have a direct view 

into the type the AI project that organ be embark on. It turn out, those organ 

be struggl mightily, and he wonder whi more peopl aren’t talk about it. 

“there’ a huge gap,” ghodsi tell datanami. “peopl be not even talk about thi problem out 

there. all the rang be about AI and the predict it can do, but they’r not talk about the 99% 

versu the 1% problem that they have.” 

unless your name be facebook (http://www.facebook.com), amazon (http://www.amazon.com), 

netflix (http://www.netflix.com), or googl (http://www.google.com)– the notori fang gang 

(plu microsoft (http://www.microsoft.com)) – you’r chanc of pull off a success AI or big 

data analyt project be slim, accord to ghodsi. “ai have a 1% problem,” he says. “there be 

onli about five compani who be truli conduct AI today.” 

ghodsi say the AI gap be the result of problem origin in three area that be critic to big 

data process and ai: people, process, and infrastructure. 

peopl problem 
have the right personnel on hand be critic for success, but it’ often overlook by 

organ infatu with technolog and data. make no mistake: ghodsi consid data to be 

king (“it’ the data, stupid,” he says). but without highli train data scientist around to turn that 

raw big data into action insight, you’r just spin your wheels, he says. 

“those [fang] compani have hord of data 

scientists, like 10,000 or 20,000 of them. they have 

phd and expert from univers they hire that 

use to be professors,” he says. “but [the rest of the 

fortun 2000] say ‘we don’t have access to silicon 

valley engineers. We just don’t have those. there’ 

not enough of them. the peopl who make huge 

silicon valley engin salari over here – that’ not 

the rest of the world.’ So how can other compani 

who don’t have the resourc to just pour money into 

hire 10,000 data scientist – how be they go to do it?” 

compani be bank on softwar to pick up the slack and help autom data scienc task

softwar be open source, which be great. but get the right piec of open sourc softwar line

fortun 2000 firm be struggl to 

close the gap with AI initi 

resourc of a fang (plu microsoft). 

“you can go download 20 piec of software, hire a bunch of devop peopl whose job be to 

stitch it all together, and then make sure that the stitch align perfectli so that you don’t have ani 

massiv scar between the differ pieces,” he says. “then a new version of these softwar 

come up you good test and make sure they all fit together. 

“you can do that,” ghodsi says. “thi be essenti 

what googl and facebook be do with their 20,000 

engineers….y could also [do that] if you want to 

hire 20,000 data scientist and have them stitch all the 

open sourc tool together.” 

the heavi lift involv with stitch softwar 

togeth for AI project be part and parcel of the 

struggl that compani have encount 

(https://www.datanami.com/2017/03/13/hadoop-failed- 

us-tech-experts-say/) while tri to make use of the 

hadoop ecosystem of tool to build data lake and 

predict analyt applications. In mani cases, the 

differ be semantic, a AI have emerg a the word du jour in refer to advanc 

analyt use cases. 

but ghodsi do differenti between big data problem and AI problems, and say 

organ need good way of manag both aspect of the data scienc challenge. 

“basically, you want to do predictions, and autom those predict and get insight,” he says. 

“it could be that you’r do tradit machin learn with linear models. It could be that 

you’r do deep learn use deep neural networks. whatev you’r doing, there be lot of 

differ aspect to thi problem that you have to solve, and not all of those be relat to 

machin learning.” 

infrastructur problem 
the final element that ghodsi see block ai’ democrat spread to the mass be the 

infrastructur problem, which includ set up and manag servers, ensur the data be 

secured, and govern access to data scientist or other users. 

the fang compani have a leg up on the rest of the fortun 2000 becaus they be cloud 

compani – manag hardwar and grant access to data be what they do best, particularli 

googl and microsoft, ghodsi says. 

“cloud be a veri import ingredi here,” ghodsi says. “all the compani mention all be 

cloud companies. they have massiv devop team and they’v autom a lot of 

infrastructure. that’ where a lot of compani today struggl becaus they have to go hire 

devop people. and devop peopl don’t grow on trees. they’r veri expens and they’r 

veri hard to hire right now.”

it’ no coincid that cloud giant 

be leader in big data and AI

If you thought find a data scientist be tough, wait 

until you tri to hire a modern devop person. but the 

devop peopl that ghodsi have in mind be not your 

grandfather’ system administrators. “they do much 

more advanc thing that sy admin use to do,” 

ghodsi says. “those peopl be veri expensive, and 

hard to find, and a lot of that can be autom in cloud 

offering. we’r huge fan of cloud offer that 

autom stuff for you.” 

the fang compani (plu microsoft) use their huge 

cloud infrastructur to store ton of consum data that 

they in turn use to build good consum products. it’ a 

virtuou cycle, and one that regular enterpris would do 

well to emulate, ghodsi says. “you’v get to get out of 

the game of manag all that infrastructur yourself,” he says. 

look forward 
As be the case with most major challeng in thi life, there be no silver bullet that will suddenli 

open the floodgat and put AI within the grasp of the 99% of user who have struggl to make it 

work. 

ghodsi bring the convers around to hi company’ cloud-bas offering, dub the unifi 

analyt platform, which combin the apach spark engin with other element (such a a data 

scienc notebook) to help organ pursu analyt projects. 

“i’m not even say that databrick solv that gap,” 

ghodsi says. “i’m say we’r take one big leap toward 

that direction. “ 

unless you’r one of the fang compani (plu microsoft), 

you’r probabl not go to have a great AI stori to tell. 

“whi be peopl not talk about it?” ghodsi ask 

rhetorically. “peopl want to highlight the successes. No one 

want to go on the record talk about how difficult it’ 

be to get AI work and we a a compani have not have 

success with it. that’ not a sexi stori that compani 

leader be yearn to get out there.” 

that’ not to say that nobodi be succeed at ai. when 

pressed, ghodsi admit that larg enterpris be find 

success with ai. “that’ whi they’r doubl down,” he 

says. “I just want to highlight that there’ a huge gap in the 

difficulti they’r see and the challeng they’r having, and if you just read techcrunch everi 

day, you’ll see that it’ all success stori after success story.

“that’ my main point,” he continues. “mani of these compani have built these data lake and 

store a lot of data in them. but if you ask the compani how success be you do 

predict on the data lake, you’r go to find lot and lot of struggl they’r having. We see 

that all the time. almost everi big compani we go to now have built their own data lake that 

contain a lot of data, but that doesn’t mean that they’r actual get valu out of those data 

lake yet.”
