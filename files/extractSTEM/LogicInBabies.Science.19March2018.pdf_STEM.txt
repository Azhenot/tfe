logic in babi 
12-month-old spontan 
reason use 
process of elimin 

By justin halberda 

T 
he success of scienc rest on our hu- 

man abil to reason logically. but 

where do thi abil come from? 

Is it an inher attribut of mind 

that even a young child might pos- 

sess, or be it a hard-won accomplish- 

ment master late in life? On page 1263 

of thi issue, cesana-arlotti et al. (1) reveal 

that one essenti form of logic inference, 

process of elimination, be within the toolkit 

of 12-month-old infants. thi reveal the 

earli know foundat of our human 

abil to reason logically. the race to doc- 

ument the rang of earli logic abil 

share by infants, adults, and nonhuman 

animals, and to determin how these foun- 

dation abil empow our broader ca- 

paciti to reason, have begun. 

everi scientif method requir a sup- 

port logic. for franci bacon (2), thi 

be unfett empir observ fol- 

low by induct (reason from mani 

case to form a gener principle). karl 

popper (3) stress the import of hy- 

pothesi test and the abil to refut 

hypothesi found to be fals (scienc a 

an extend instanc of process of elimi- 

nation). and thoma kuhn (4) highlight 

the dramat chang that occur dure 

scientif revolutions, in which wholli new 

model of phenomenon be creat through 

model build and abduct (sometim 

call “infer to the best explanation”). 

exampl of such revolut be the co- 

pernican revolut (5) produc the 

heliocentr model of the solar system, 

and the einsteinian revolut of special 

rel in which space and time becom 

one (6). In each of these case (induction, 

hypothesi testing, abduction), the work 

of scienc be support by an underli 

logic. No logic, no science. 

where do our human faculti to reason 

logic come from? At the end of the pre- 

viou century, susan carey suggest that 

such logic might be deep in our develop- 

mental roots: A young child might reason 

use intuit theories, models, and abduc-

and avoid infect conspecif on the basi 

of olfactori cue associ with the alter 

chemic composit of infect fece (2). 

thus, wherea prey “fear” predators, parasit 

avoid be more akin to disgust—an innat 

avers to cue associ with parasit (1). 

As with predat avoidance, parasit avoid- 

anc incur cost such a alter social inter- 

actions, reduc reproduct opportunities, 

diminish foraging, and increas energi 

expenditur (4). To predict when parasit 

avoid be most like to occur and under- 

stand it consequences, it must be integr 

into the same trade-off framework that be 

wide appli to predat avoidance. 

beyond it direct effect on hosts, parasit 

avoid have cascad effect at a rang of 

scale and in variou system (5). ant and 

their parasitoid provid a use model 

system for studi the cascad effect of 

parasit avoid on herbivory. azteca ant 

experiment expos to parasitoid fli 

dramat reduc their activ level to 

avoid infection. thi reduc the ants’ abil 

to attack their herbivor prey, the coffe 

berri borer, and allow the latter to consum 

more coffe berri (6). such ecolog im- 

pact of parasit avoid be not limit 

to top-down effect on vegetation; they also 

alter mutualism, competition, and predation. 

like the predator-induc landscap of 

fear, a parasite-induc landscap of dis- 

gust (see the figure) have far-reach con- 

sequenc for popul dynamics, speci 

interactions, and ecosystem structure. how- 

ever, wherea direct effect of predat be 

natur restrict to prey speci (7), a par- 

asite-induc landscap of disgust extend to 

all animals, includ veri larg speci and 

top predat that be typic immun to 

predat (8). for example, a recent synthesi 

by moleón et al. show that carnivor avoid 

forag on other carnivor carcass and 

rare engag in cannib (9). feed on 

conspecif increas diseas transmission, 

and forgo thi food resourc reduc expo- 

sure to share parasit (10). At a landscap 

level, thi avoid behavior dramat 

alter the amount of carcass materi that 

be avail in an ecosystem, with import 

downstream effects. for instance, carcass 

not consum by mammalian scaveng 

may support more divers and abund 

arthropod commun iti (9). furthermore, 

when carcass decompose, their nutrient 

input increas plant growth (11). like the 

ecosystem-level impact of predat avoid- 

ance, the ecosystem-level impact of parasit 

avoid be like to be substantial. 

parasit and predat avoid can exert 

oppos pressur on host and prey species. 

for example, tadpol increas their activ 

level to protect themselv from trematod 

infection, but thi increas their susceptibil- 

iti to visual predat (12). the tadpol fear 

and avoid both predat and parasites, but 

do not perceiv these threat a equal. when 

experiment forc to choos between pre- 

dation and parasit risk, tadpol opt for 

infect (13). thi make sens becaus pre- 

dation have a larg short-term fit effect 

than do parasitism, and the optim behav- 

ior avoid the great immedi threat. 

however, parasit and predat avoid 

be not alway mutual exclusive. for in- 

stance, avoid predat fece protect prey 

against both predat and their parasit 

(14), and, when anim group together, they 

dilut their risk of attack by both predat 

and some parasit (for example, ticks, bot- 

flies) (15). although predat avoid have 

receiv more attention, parasit avoid 

also have strong effect on foraging, move- 

ment, and social interact (1). 

parasit avoid be like to have impor- 

tant consequences. for example, graze ani- 

mal such a cows, sheep, and hors avoid 

fecal contamin forag (4), and chang 

livestock practic to recogn the need and 

capabl of anim to avoid parasit will 

reduc the cost associ with avoid 

livestock diseases. furthermore, conserv 

plan and project may benefit from 

knowledg of how shrink and fragment 

habitat limit the abil of anim to avoid 

riski site and conspecifics. As popul of 

larg predat continu to decline, parasit 

avoid may becom a rel strong 

driver of ecolog processes. integr 

parasit into the ecolog of fear be thu cru- 

cial to understand the gener ecolog 

and evolutionari effect of parasit on eco- 

system and predict how ecosystem be 

like to respond to the rapidli chang en- 

viron of the anthropocene. j

tion, much like a profession scientist (7). 

other development psychologist push 

thi further and suggest that even infant 

might be understood to be littl scientist 

draw infer in the cradl about ob- 

ject and caus (8). but suggest like 

these be frequent met with incredul 

(9): after all, it often feel like logic rea- 

sone be effortful, conscious, and even lin- 

guistic base (10). these characteristics, 

if accurate, would seem to preclud the pos- 

sibil that preverb infant could engag 

in ani such process. 

cesana-arlotti et al. ask whether pre- 

linguist 12- and 19-month-old infant 

would spontan reason use process 

of elimination. thi be a form of infer 

also know a disjunct syllog or mo- 

du tollendo ponens—it be ani argument of 

the form: A or B, not A, therefor B. cesana- 

arlotti et al. reli on one of the few behav- 

ior babi voluntarili engag in—look 

at whatev they find most interest (11). 

they measur infants’ look at comput- 

eriz vignett in which two differ ob- 

ject (A and B) be show be hidden 

behind a wall. infant watch a a cup 

scoop one of the object from behind 

the wall, and then come to rest next to the 

wall—critically, onli the topmost edg of 

the contain object could be see peek 

out of the cup, such that infant could not 

tell for sure whether the object be A or B. 

At thi moment, infant could have form 

a disjunct thought—for example, “either 

the object in the cup be object A or it be ob- 

ject b.” next, thi ambigu be resolved: 

the wall drop to reveal that object A be 

behind the wall, but the content of the cup 

remain hidden. thi be the moment of po- 

tential elimination, and an opportun for 

infant to draw a key inference—“becaus 

object A be not in the cup, object B must be 

in the cup.” finally, infants’ expect for 

the cup’ content be tested: either the 

expect object (object B) or, surprisingly, 

anoth object A emerg from the cup. 

infant look longer at the surpris out- 

come—an indic that their expect 

be violat and a hint that they be 

seek further inform to resolv the 

conflict (12). 

potenti even more exciting, infant 

also show sign of make the necessari 

infer along the way—for example, 

upon see which of the two object be 

behind the wall, but befor the cup’ con- 

tent be revealed, infants’ pupil dilat 

and they tend to shift their fixat to 

the cup (consist with them infer 

which object must be inside). thi pattern 

suggest that infant use the inform 

they have see to reason through a disjunc- 

tive syllog (A or B, not A, therefor 

b). there be also addit version 

of these vignett that manipul the 

precis sequenc of hide and revealing, 

which allow the author to determin 

what specif the infant be remem- 

bere and expect dure each moment. 

the care craft of stimulu and clever 

analysi of infants’ spontan look 

behavior by cesana-arlotti et al. show u 

that infant have the capac to reason 

by process of elimination. By contrast, 

wherea nonhuman anim such a dog 

face similar situat of ambigu may 

ultim form the right conclusion, they 

appear to arriv at thi hunch use an as- 

soci rather than logic process (13). 

unwind the similar and differ 

among infant, child, adult, and anim rea- 

sone abil be an import task for 

the future, a be determin why, despit 

be deploy by infants, reason feel 

effort and whi human often “go with 

our gut” and reli on heurist and bia 

rather than logic infer (14). 

A new field, studi the foundat of 

logic abilities, be emerging. As with other 

success of development psycholog 

in recent decad [a in work on the psy- 

cholog of number, language, and theori 

of mind (15)], thi new field will make use 

of behavior and brain studi with infants, 

children, and adults; studi of nonhuman 

anim abilities; studi of the correl 

between reason and other abilities; and 

train studi to determin where we 

all begin and how matur and experi- 

enc build upon these foundations. It be a 

thrill time for u a scientists—us 

logic reason to understand how we 

reason logically. j
