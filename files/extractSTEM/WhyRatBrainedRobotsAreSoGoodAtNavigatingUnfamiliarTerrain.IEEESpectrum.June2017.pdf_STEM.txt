the answer is, it can. At the , in

: If you take a robot and move it somewher else, can it figur out 

where it is? one way to solv the problem be slam, which stand for

slam algorithm, a robot can explor strang terrain, build a map of it surround while at the

like, and robot gather thi kind of data use 

sensor a vari a sonars, cameras, and laser 

scanners. the second stream concern the robot 

itself, or more specifically, it speed and 

orientation; robot deriv that data from sensor 

like rotari encod on their wheel or an inerti 

measur unit (imu) on their bodies. A slam 

algorithm look at the environment data and 

tri to identifi notabl landmarks, add these to 

it map. As the robot moves, it monitor it speed 

and direct and look for those landmarks; if the 

robot recogn a landmark, it us the 

landmark’ posit to refin it own locat on 

the map. 

but wherea most implement of slam aim 

for highli detailed, static maps, milford and wyeth 

be more interest in how to navig through an environ that’ in constant flux. their aim wasn’t 

to creat map built with costli lidar and high-pow computers—they want their system to make 

sens of space the way anim do.

“rat don’t build maps,” wyeth says. “they have other way of rememb where they are.” those way 

includ neuron call place cell and head-direct cells, which respect let the rat identifi 

landmark and gaug it direction. like other neurons, these cell be dens interconnect and work 

by adjust their spike pattern in respons to differ stimuli. To mimic thi structur and behavior 

in software, milford adopt a type of artifici neural network call an attractor network. these neural 

net consist of hundr to thousand of interconnect node that, like group of neurons, respond to an 

input by produc a specif spike pattern, know a an attractor state. comput neuroscientist 

use attractor network to studi neuron associ with memori and motor behavior. milford and wyeth 

want to use them to power ratslam. 

they spent month work on the software, and then they load it into a pioneer robot, a mobil 

platform popular among roboticists. their rat-brain bot be alive. 

but it be a failure. when they let it run in a 2-by-2-met arena, milford says, “it get lose even in that 

simpl environment.” 

that ratslam didn’t have enough inform with which to reduc 

error a it make it decisions. like other slam algorithms, it doesn’t tri to make exact, definit 

calcul about where thing be on the map it’ generating; instead, it reli on approxim and 

probabl a a way of incorpor uncertainties—conflict sensor readings, for example—that 

inevit crop up. If you don’t take that into account, your robot end up lost. 

milford and wyeth realiz 

that seem to be the problem with ratslam. In some cases, the robot would recogn a landmark and 

be abl to refin it position, but other time the data be too ambiguous. after not too long, the accru 

error be big than 2 meters—th robot thought it be outsid the arena! 

In other words, their rat-brain model be too crude. It need good neural circuitri to be abl to 

abstract more inform about the world. 

“so we engin a new type of neuron, which we call a ‘pose’ cell,” milford says. the pose cell didn’t 

just tell the robot it locat or it orientation, it do both at the same time. now, when the robot 

identifi a landmark it have see before, it could more precis encod it place on the map and keep 

error in check. 

again, milford place the robot insid the 2-by-2-met arena. “suddenly, our robot could navig quit 

well,” he recalls. 

interestingly, not long after the research devis these artifici cells, neuroscientist in norway 

announc the discoveri of grid cells, which be neuron whose spike activ form regular geometr 

pattern and tell the anim it rel posit within a certain area. [for more on the neurosci of 

rats, see “

AI design find inspir in rat brain (/biomedical/imaging/ai-designers-find- 

inspiration-in-rat-brains) 

“our pose cell weren’t exactli grid cells, but they have similar features,” milford says. “that be rather 

gratifying.”

the robot test move to big arena with great complexity. “we do a whole floor, then multipl 

floor in the building,” wyeth recalls. “then I told michael, ‘let’ do a whole suburb.’ I thought he would 

kill me.” 

milford load the ratslam softwar into a macbook and tape it on the roof of hi red 1994 mazda 

astina. To get a stream of data about the environment, he use the laptop’ camera, set it to snap a 

photo of the street ahead of the car sever time per second. To get a stream of the data about the robot 

itself—in thi case, hi car—h found a creativ solution. instead of attach encod to the wheel or

collaps or explosion, they’r also extrem

In a surfac mine, you’d simpli use high-precis

caterpillar engin consid 3D lidar, like the 

one use on self-driv cars, they conclud that 

“none of them can surviv underground,” smith 

says. 

one big reason that mine oper need to track 

their vehicl be to plan how they excavate. each 

day start with a “dig plan” that specifi the 

amount of ore that will be mine in variou 

tunnels. At the end of the day, the oper 

compar the dig plan to what be actual mined, to come up with the next day’ dig plan. “if you’r 

feed in inaccur information, your plan be not go to be veri good. you may start mine dirt 

instead of ore, or the whole tunnel could cave in,” smith explains. “it’ realli import to know what 

you’v done.”

qut navig system will more accur measur where and how far each vehicl travels, a well a 

provid a read of where the vehicl be at ani give time. the first vehicl will drive into the mine and 

map the environ use the rat-brain-inspir navig algorithm, while also gather imag of 

each tunnel with a low-cost 720p camera. the onli unusu featur of the camera be it extrem 

ruggedization, which smith say go well beyond militari specifications. 

subsequ vehicl will use those result to local themselv within the mine, compar footag from 

their own camera with previous gather images. the vehicl won’t be autonomous, milford notes, 

but that capabl could eventu be achiev by combin the camera data with data from imu and 

other sensors. thi would add more precis to the trucks’ positioning, allow them to drive 

themselves. 

the qut team have start collect data within actual mines, which will be merg with anoth larg 

data set from caterpillar contain about a thousand hour of underground camera imagery. they will 

then devis a preliminari algorithm, to be test in an abandon mine somewher in queensland, with 

the help of mining3, an australian mine r&d company; the queensland govern be also a partner 

on the project. the system could be use for deep open-pit mines, where gp tend not to work reliably. 

If all go well, caterpillar plan to commerci the system quickly. “we need these solutions,” smith 

says. 

reli on standard comput hardwar to run it algorithms, although they 

keep tab on the late research in neuromorph computing. “it’ still a bit earli for u to dive in,”

observ how rat and robot perform the same tasks, like navig a new environment, you can test 

your theori about how the brain works. you can replay scenario repeatedly. you can tinker and
