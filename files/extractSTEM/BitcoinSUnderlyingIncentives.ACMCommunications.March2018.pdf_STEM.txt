B E yond it role a a protocol for manag and 
transfer money, the bitcoin protocol creat a 
complex system of econom incent that govern it 
inner workings. these incent strongli impact the 
protocol’ capabl and secur guarantees, and the 
path of it futur development. thi articl explor 
these econom undercurrents, their strength and 
flaws, and how they influenc the protocol. 

bitcoin, which continu to enjoy grow popularity, 
be built upon an open peer-to-p (p2p) network of 
nodes.9 the bitcoin system be “permissionless”—anyon 
can choos to join the network, transfer money, and 
even particip in the author of transactions. key 
to bitcoin’ secur be it resili to manipul 
by attack who may choos to join the system under 
multipl fals identities. after all, anyon can download 
the open-sourc code for a bitcoin node and add a 
mani comput to thi network a they like, without 
have to identifi themselv to others. To counter 

this, the protocol requir node that 
particip in the system to show proof 
that they exert comput effort 
to solv hard cryptograph puzzl 
(proof-of-work) in order to particip 
activ in the protocol. 

node that engag in such work be 
call miners. the system reward min- 
er with bitcoin for gener proof- 
of-work, and thu set the incent 
for such invest of efforts.

tem thu provid payment to miner 
at a rel constant rate, regardless 
of the amount of comput power 
invest in mining. 

clearly, a the valu (in u.s. dollars) 
of bitcoin rises, the mine busi 
(which yield payment that be de- 
nomin in bitcoins) becom more 

blocks, in turn, be chain togeth 
to creat the blockchain, a record of all

graphic hash of that block—effect 
a uniqu identifi of that predecessor. 
A complet copi of the blockchain be 
kept at everi node in the bitcoin net- 
work. the process of block creation 
be call mining. one of it outcom 
(among others) be the print of fresh 
coins, which we call minting. 

the rule of the protocol make 
block creation extrem difficult; a 
block be consid legal onli if it con- 
tain the answer to a hard cryptograph- 
ic puzzle. As compensation, whenev 
miner manag to creat block they 
be reward with bitcoins. their re- 
ward be partli make up of newli mint- 
ed bitcoin and partli of mine fee 
collect from all of the transact 
emb in their blocks. the rate of 
mint be current 12.5 bitcoin per 
block. thi amount be halv approxi- 
mate everi four years. As thi amount 
decreases, bitcoin begin to reli more 
and more on transact fee to pay 
the miners. 

the key to bitcoin’ oper be to 
get all node to agre on the content

block be thu propag quickli

be sometim possibl for node to 
receiv two differ version of the 
blockchain. for example, if two node 
manag to creat a block at the same 
time, they may hold two differ ex- 
tension to the blockchain. these 
block might contain differ set of 
payments, and so a decis must be 
make on which version to accept. 

the bitcoin protocol dictat that 
node accept onli the long chain a 
the correct version of events, a show 
in the accompani figure. (to be 
more precise, node select the chain 
that contain the most accumul 
comput work. thi be usual the 
long chain.) thi rule, often call 
the “longest chain rule,” provid bit- 
coin with it security. An attack who 
wish to dupe node into believ 
that a differ set of payment have

ger chain than that of the rest of the

lucrative. more particip then find 
it profit to join the group of min- 
ers, and, a a consequence, the difficul- 
ty of block creation increases. with thi 
increas in difficulty, mine block 
slowli becom more expensive. In the 
ideal case, the system reach equilib- 
rium when the cost of block creation 
equal the amount of extract re- 
wards. In fact, mine will alway be 
slightli profitable—min be risky, 
and also requir an initi invest 
in equipment, and some surplu in 
the reward must compens for this. 
hence, bitcoin’ secur effect ad- 
just itself to match it value: A high 
valu also impli high secur for 
the protocol. 

As mine reward continu to 
declin (a per the protocol’ min- 
ing schedule), the incent to cre- 
ate block be expect to reli more on 
transact fees. If a sudden drop in 
bitcoin transact volum occurs, 
these fee might be insuffici to 
compens miner for their compu- 
tation resources. some miner might 
then halt their block creation process, 
temporarily. thi may compromis the 
system, a the secur of transact 
depend on all honest miner activ 
participating. (for addit work on 
the incent in bitcoin after mine 
declines, see carlsten et al.3) 

mani complain that the computa- 
tion requir to creat block wast 
resourc (especi electricity) and 
have no econom goal other than im- 
pose larg cost on would-b attack- 
er of the system. the proof-of-work be 
inde a solut to a useless crypto- 
graphic puzzle—except, of course, that 
thi “useless” work secur the bitcoin 
network. but what if some of the work 
could be useful? Or could be produc 
more efficiently? If mine do not 
entail a wast of resourc for each 
node, then it also cost noth for at- 
tacker to attack the system. In fact, if 
the proof-of-work be less costli to solve, 
more honest particip join min- 
ing (to collect the rewards), and soon 
the difficulti adjust mechan 
rais the difficulti again. hence, in 
a sense, the bitcoin proof-of-work be 
built to spend a certain amount of re- 
sourc no matter how effici an 
individu miner becomes. To deriv 
substanti benefit from mine with- 
out an offset increas in cost re- 

quir a proof-of-work that be use to 
societi at larg but cannot provid val- 
ue to the individu miner. (for some 
attempt at use other problem a a 
basi for proof-of-work, see ball et al.,2 
miller et al.,8 and zhang et al.13) 

mine decentr 
the key aspect of the bitcoin protocol 
be it decentralization: no singl entiti 
have a priori more author or control 
over the system than others. thi pro- 
mote both the resili of the sys- 
tem, which do not have a singl an- 
chor of trust or singl point of failure, 
and competit among the differ 
particip for mine fees. 

To maintain thi decentralization, 
it be import that mine activ in 
bitcoin be do by mani small entiti 
and that no singl miner significantli 
outweigh the others. ideally, the re- 
ward that be give to miner should 
reflect the amount of effort they put in: 
a miner who contribut an α-fraction 
of the comput resourc should 
creat an α-fraction of the block on av- 
erage, and a a consequ extract a 
proport α-fraction of all alloc 
fee and block rewards. 

In practice, some particip can 
benefit disproportion from min- 
ing, for sever differ reasons. An 
unbalanc reward alloc of thi 
sort creat a bia in favor of larg 
miner with more comput 
power, make them more profit 
than their small counterpart and 
creat a constant econom under- 
current toward the central of 
the system. even slight advantag 
can endang the system, a the miner 
can use addit return to purchas 
more and more comput power, 
rais the difficulti of mine a the 

miner grow and push the other 
small (and, hence, less profitable) 
miner out of the game. the result 
winner-takes-al dynam inevit 
lead to central within the sys- 
tem, which be then at the merci of the 
prevail miner, and no secur prop- 
erti can be guaranteed. 

asic mining. the appear of 
asic initi alarm the bitcoin 
community. asic be order of 
magnitud more effici at mine 
bitcoin than previou systems. As 
thi special hardwar be not initi 
easi to acquire, it provid it own- 
er with a great advantag over other 
miners—they could mine at a much 
low cost. those with thi advantag 
would add asic-bas proof-of-work 
to the system until the difficulti level 
would be so high that everyon els 
would quit mining. the risk be then 
that a singl larg miner would have 
sole access to asic and would come 
to domin the bitcoin system. con- 
cern subsid after some time, a 
asic becom commerci avail 
and more wide distributed. 

In fact, asic mine actual intro- 
duce long-term effect that contrib- 
ute to security. later thi articl look 
at how a miner can carri out profit 
doubl spend and selfish mine 
attacks. one can argue, however, that 
even selfish and strateg miner be 
good off avoid such attacks. in- 
deed, a miner who invest million of 
dollar in mine equip such a 
asic be heavili invest in the futur 
valu of bitcoin: the miner’ equip- 
ment be expect to yield payment of 
bitcoin over a long period in the fu- 
ture. should the miner then use thi 
gear to attack the system, confid

with a larg mine operation, such

cient cool to their machin (min-

er can also purchas asic in bulk for 
good prices. all of thi translat to 
natur advantag to size, a phenome- 
non that be not specif to bitcoin but in 
fact appear in mani industries. these 
effect give larg miner an advantag 
and slowli pull the system toward a 
central one. 

mani have rais concern that 
most of today’ bitcoin mine be do 
by chines miners. they enjoy good 
access to asics, cheaper electricity, 
and somewhat low regul than 
similar oper in other locations. 
the chines government, which tight- 
ly control internet traffic in and out 
of china, could choos to disrupt the 
system or even seiz the mine equip- 
ment that be within it borders. 

mine pool and risk avers 
bitcoin’ mine process yield veri 
high reward but with veri low prob- 
abil for each small miner. A singl 
asic that be run full time may 
have less than a 1-in-600,000 chanc 
of mine the next block, which im- 
pli that year can go by without find- 
ing a singl block. thi sort of high- 
risk/high-reward payoff be not suitabl 
for most. mani would prefer a small, 
constant rate of incom over long pe- 
riod of time (thi be essenti risk 
aversion).6 A constant incom stream 
can be used, for example, to pay the 
electr bill for mining. 

the format of pools. mine 
pool be coalit of miner that 
combin their comput resourc- 
e to creat block togeth and share 
the reward among member of the 
pool. sinc the pool’ worker togeth 
find block much more often than each 
miner alone, they be abl to provid 
small continu payment to each 
worker on a more regular basis. 

from the perspect of the bitcoin 
network, the pool be just a singl min- 

it the valu of bitcoin and futur re- 
wards. the interest of miner be 
thus, in some sense, align with the 
overal health of the system. 

all in all, asic mine introduc 
a barrier-to-entri to the system, a or- 
dinari peopl cannot simpli join the 
mine efforts; it thu reduc decen- 
tralization. On the other hand, it intro- 
duce a form of barrier-to-exit, a min- 
er cannot repurpos their equip 
to other econom activities; it there- 
fore contribut to security. 

the appear of compet cryp- 
tocurr (for example, litecoin, 
which essenti clone bitcoin), 
some of which use the same proof-of- 
work a bitcoin, offer altern for 
miner who wish to divert their mine 
power elsewhere. thi introduc com- 
plex market dynamics. for example, 
when a specif currenc lose some 
value, miner will divert their mine 
power to anoth cryptocurr until 
the difficulti readjusts. thi can caus 
fluctuat in block creation that de- 
stabil small cryptocurrencies. 

altern system with no asic 
mining. interestingly, some crypto- 
currenc use differ proof-of-work 
puzzl that be thought to be more 
resist to asic mining, that is, they 
choos puzzl for which it be difficult 
to design special hardware; for 
example, ethereum us the ethash 
puzzl (https://github.com/ethereum/ 
wiki/wiki/ethash). thi be often 
achiev by design algorithm 
problem that requir heavi access to 
other resources, such a memory, and 
that can be solv effici by com- 
mercial avail hardware. 

these altern system be in 
principl more decentralized, but on 
the flip side they lack the barrier-to-exit 
effect and it contribut to security. 

A similar effect occur when cloud 
mine becom highli available. 
some mine entiti offer their equip- 
ment for rental over the cloud. the cli- 
ent of these busi be effect 
miner who do not have a long-term 
stake in the system. As such servic 
becom cheaper and more accessible, 
anyon can easili becom a temporari 
miner, with similar effect on security. 

asicboost. recal that creat a 
block requir solv a cryptograph- 
ic puzzl uniqu to that block. thi 
involv guess input to a crypto- 

graphic hash function. solv the 
puzzl be mostli do via brute-forc 
enumer of differ inputs. 

A miner can gain an advantag by cre- 
ate block use more effici meth- 
od than hi or her counterparts. In ad- 
dition to good hardware, an advantag 
can take a more algorithm form. In 
fact, an algorithm “trick” nicknam 
asicboost have recent make head- 
lines. asicboost enabl the miner to 
reus some of the comput work 
perform dure the evalu of 
one input for the evalu of another. 
thi algorithm be proprietary, patent 
pending, and it be unclear who be and 
who be not use it. such an algorithm 
advantag can be translat to low 
power consumpt per hash. bitmain, 
a larg manufactur of asic for bit- 
coin mine that also oper some 
mine pools, be recent accus by 
some of secretli deploy a hardwar 
variant of asicboost to increas it 
profits. alleg be make that thi 
compani be polit block some 
protocol improv that would co- 
incident remov their abil to use 
asicboost. 

communication. yet anoth meth- 
od for a miner to becom more effi- 
cient be to invest in commun 
infrastructure. By propag block 
faster, and by receiv others’ block 
faster, a miner can reduc the chanc 
that their block will not belong to the 
long chain and will be discard 
(“orphaned”). As off-chain block re- 
ceiv no rewards, a good connect 
to the network translat to reduc 
losses. admittedly, with bitcoin’ cur- 
rent block creation rate, thi advantag 
be rather marginal; block be creat 
infrequently, and speed up deliveri 
by just a few second yield rel 
littl advantage. nonetheless, good 
connect be a rel cheap way to 
becom more profitable. 

furthermore, the effect of com- 
munic becom much more pro- 
nounc when the protocol be scale

ing node. pool particip interact 
with the pool’ server, which send 
the next block header that the pool be 
work on to all workers. each mem- 
ber tri to solv the cryptograph 
puzzl correspond to thi block 
(in fact, they use small variant of the 
same block and work on slightli dif- 
ferent proof-of-work puzzl to avoid 
duplic work). whenev a work- 
er find a solution, it be sent to the 
pool manager, who in turn publish 
the block to the network. the block 
provid a reward to the pool, which 
the manag then distribut among 
all of the pool’ worker (minu some 
small fee). 

reward distribut within pool 
and possibl manipulations. mani 
pool be public and open to ani will- 
ing participant. obviously, such pool 
must take measur to ensur that 
onli member who truli contribut to 
the pool’ mine effort enjoy a por- 
tion of the rewards. To that end, everi 
pool member send partial solut 
of the proof-of-work to the pool— 
these be solut that come “close” 
to be full blocks. partial solut 
be much more common than full so- 
lutions, and anyon work on the 
problem can present a steadi stream 
of such attempt that fall short of the 
target. thi indic that the worker 
be inde engag in work, and can be 
use to ass the amount of compu- 
tation power each worker dedic 
to the pool. pool thu reward work- 
er in some proport to the num- 
ber of share that they earn (a share be 
grant for everi partial solut that 
be submitted). 

fortunately, a pool member who 
have found a valid solut to the puzzl 
cannot steal the rewards. the crypto- 
graphic puzzl depend on the block 
header, which be under the control of 
the pool’ manager. It encod a com- 
mitment to the content of the block 
itself (via a cryptograph hash), in- 
clude the recipi of the block’ 
rewards. after find a valid solut 
for a specif block header, one cannot 
tamper with the header without invali- 
date the solution. 

nonetheless, pool be suscept to 
some manipul by strateg miners: 

pool hopping. In the earli day of 
bitcoin, mine pool would simpli 
divid the reward from the late block 

among all worker in proport to the 
number of partial solut each work- 
er submitted. the number of share 
be measur from the previou block 
creat by the same pool. 

some worker come up with a way 
to improv their rewards: if a pool be 
unlucki and do not find a block for a 
while, mani partial solut (shares) 
would accumulate. If a block be then 
found by the pool, it reward would be 
split among mani shares. work to 
gener addit share be just a 
costli a befor but yield low expect 
reward for thi veri reason. instead, the 
worker could just switch to anoth pool 
in which a block have be found more 
recently, and in which each addit 
share grant a high expect reward. 
If mani adopt thi behavior, a pool that 
be temporarili unsuccess should, in 
fact, be complet abandon by all 
ration miners. pool-hopping-resist 
reward scheme be quickli develop 
and adopt by most mine pools.10 

block-withhold attacks. while a 
miner cannot steal the block reward 
of a success solution, he or she can 
still deni the reward from the rest of 
the miner in the pool. the miner can 
choos to submit onli partial solut 
to the pool’ manag but discard all 
success solutions. the miner thu 
receiv a share of the reward when 
other find a solution, without provid- 
ing ani actual contribut to the pool. 
discard the success solut sab- 
otag the pool, and caus a small loss 
of incom to the attacker. 

In spite of the loss to an attack- 
er, in some situat it be worthwhil 
for mine pool to devot some of 
their own mine power to sabotag 
their competitors: the attack pool 
infiltr the victim pool by register- 
ing some of it miner a worker in 
the victim pool. these worker then 
execut a block-withhold attack. 
care calcul of the cost and 
reward show that, in some scenar- 
io (depend on the size of the 
attack and victim pools), the at- 
tack be profitable.4 To prevent such 
schemes, a slight modif of the 
mine protocol have be proposed. In 
the modifi version, worker would 
not be abl to discern between partial 
and full solut to the proof-of-work 
puzzl and would not be abl to selec- 
tive withhold full solutions.

valid transact and to valid everi 
new block befor accept it. 

interestingly, despit thi logic, 
sometim miner mine on top of a 
block without fulli valid it. thi 
practic be know a spv mine (sim- 
plifi payment verif usual 
refer to the use of thin client that do 
not read the full content of blocks). 

whi would miner engag in 
build on top of an unvalid 
block? the answer again lie in in- 
centives. some miner appli meth- 
od to learn about the hash ID of a 
newli creat block even befor re- 
ceiv it entir contents. one such 
method, know a spy-mining, in- 
volv join anoth mine pool 
a a worker to detect block creation 
events. even when the block be re- 
ceived, it take time to valid the 
transact it contains. dure thi 
time, the miner be awar that the 
blockchain be alreadi longer by one 
block. therefore, rather than let 
the mine equip lie idl until 
the block be validated, the miner de- 
cide to mine on top of it, under the 
assumpt that it will most like be 
valid. To avoid the risk that the next 
block will contain conflict with the 
transact of the unverifi block, 
the miner do not emb new trans- 
action in the next block, hop still 
to collect the block reward. 

there be inde evid that min- 
er be take thi approach. first, 
some fraction of the block be 
mine be empti (even when mani trans- 
action be wait to be approved). an- 
other piec of evid be relat to an 
unfortun incid that take place in 
juli 2015. An invalid block be (unin- 
tentionally) mine due to a bug, and spv 
miner add five addit block on 
top of it without validating. Of course, 
other valid miner reject that 
block and ani block that refer it, 
result in a six-block-long fork in the 
network. block that be discard in 
the fork could have contain double- 
spent transactions. 

thi event show the danger of spv 
mining: it lower the secur of bit- 
coin and may trigger fork in the block- 
chain. fortunately, miner have vastli 
improv the propag and valida- 
tion time of blocks, so spv mine have 
less and less effect. the plan de- 
cline in the mint reward give to 

elimin pools. while pool be 
good for small miners, mitig 
their risk and uncertainty, they intro- 
duce some central to the system. 
the pool oper be essenti con- 
troll the combin comput 
resourc of mani miner and be there- 
fore quit powerful. some research 
propos a technic modif to 
the mine protocol that undermin 
the exist of public pool altogeth- 
er.7 under thi scheme, after find 
a valid solut to the block, the pool 
member who mine it would still be 
abl to redirect the reward to them- 
self (without invalid the solu- 
tion). assum mani miner would 
claim the reward for themselves, 
pool would not be profit and 
would therefor dissolve. 

the econom of attack 
and deviat from the rule 
earlier, thi articl describ method 
by which a miner can becom more 
domin within the protocol—both to 
profit more than hi or her fair share and 
to gener more of the block in the 
chain. the method discuss thu far 
do not violat ani of the protocol’ rules; 
in some sense, miner be expect to 
make the most of their hardwar and 
infrastructure. thi section discu 
direct violat of the rule of the pro- 
tocol that allow miner to profit at the 
expens of others. In a sense, the ex- 
istenc of such strategi impli that 
there be someth fundament bro- 
ken in the protocol’ incent struc- 
ture: ration profit-maxim par- 
ticip will not follow it. 

informally, the protocol instruct 
ani node to: valid everi new mes- 
sage it receiv (block/transaction); 
propag all valid messag to it 
peers; broadcast it own new block 
immedi upon creation; and, build 
it new block on top of the long 
chain know to that node. attack on 
the protocol correspond to deviat 
from one or more of these instructions. 

validation. A miner who do not 
valid incom messag be vulner- 
able—th next block might includ an 
invalid transact that he or she do 
not verify, or refer an invalid pre- 
decessor block. other node will then 
consid thi new block a invalid and 
ignor it. thi set a clear incent for 
miner to emb in their block onli

practic 

empti block will also low the incen- 
tive to engag in such behavior. 

transact propagation. A second 
import aspect of the bitcoin pro- 
tocol pertain to inform propa- 
gation: new transact and block 
should be sent to all peer in the net- 
work. here the incent to compli 
with the protocol be not so clear. miner 
may even have a disincent to share 
unconfirm transact that have 
yet to be includ in blocks, especi 
transact that offer high fees.1 min- 
er have strong incent to keep such 
transact to themselv until they 
manag to creat a block. send a 
transact to other allow them to 
snatch the reward it offer first. thu 
far, most transact fee have be 
rel low, and there be no evid 
that transact with high fee be be- 
ing withheld in thi way. 

next, let’ turn our attent to devia- 
tion from the mine protocol intend 
explicitli to manipul the blockchain. 

selfish mining. whenev a miner 
creat a new block, the protocol say it 
should be creat on top of the long 
chain the miner observ (that is, to 
refer the tip of the long chain 
a it predecessor) and that the miner 
should send the new block immedi- 
ate to network peers. 

unfortunately, a miner can benefit 
by deviat from these rule and act- 
ing strategically.5,11 the miner’ gen- 
eral strategi be to withhold the blocks’ 
public and keep the extens of 
the public chain secret. meanwhile, 
the public chain be extend by other 
(honest) nodes. the strateg miner 
publish the chain onli when the risk 
that it will not prevail a the long 
chain be too high. when the miner do 
so, all node adopt the longer exten- 
sion that the miner suddenli released, 
a dictat by the protocol, and they 
discard the previou public extension. 

importantly, thi behavior increas- 
e the miner’ share in the long 
chain—meaning, it increas the per- 
centag of block on the eventu lon- 
gest chain that the miner generates. 
recal that bitcoin automat ad- 
just the difficulti of the proof-of-work 
so a to keep the block creation rate 
constant. thus, in the long run, a larg- 
er rel share of block in the chain 
translat to an increas in the miner’ 
absolut rewards. 

there be no definit method to verifi 
whether miner be engag in self- 
ish mine or not. given that veri few 
block be orphaned, it seem like thi 
practic have not be take up, at least 
not by larg miner (who would also 
have the most to gain from it). one way 
to explain thi be that miner who at- 
tempt such manipul over the long 
term may suffer loss to their reput 
and provok outrag by the commu- 
nity. anoth explan be that thi 
scheme initi requir lose some 
of the selfish miner’ own blocks, and 
it becom profit onli in the long 
run (it take around two week for the 
protocol to readjust the difficulti level). 

doubl spend be the basic attack 
against bitcoin users: the attack pub- 
lish a legitim payment to the net- 
work, wait for it to be emb in the 
blockchain and for the victim to confirm 
it, and then publish a longer chain of 
block mine in secret that do not con- 
tain thi payment. the payment be then 
no longer part of the long chain and, 
effectively, “never happened.” 

thi attack incur a risk: the attack- 
er could lose the reward for hi or her 
block if they do not end up in the long 
chain. surprisingly, and unfortunately, 
a persist attack can elimin thi 
risk by follow more sophist at- 
tack schemes.12 the idea be to abandon 
the attack frequently, publish the secret 
attack chain, and collect reward for it 
blocks. By reset the attack whenev 
the risk of lose block reward be too 
high, the attack can elimin the at- 
tack cost and even be profit in the 
long term. these scheme be in essenc 
a combin of selfish mine and 
double-spend attacks. 

currently, doubl spend be not 
observ often in the network. thi 
could be becaus execut a success- 
ful doubl spend be difficult, or becaus 
the veri miner who could execut 
such attack success also have a 
heavi stake in the system’ reputation. 

conclus 
incent do inde play a big role in 
the bitcoin protocol. they be crucial 
for it secur and effect drive it 
daili operation. As argu here, min- 
er go to extrem length to maxim 
their revenu and often find creativ 
way to do so that be sometim at 
odd with the protocol. 

cryptocurr protocol should be 
place on strong foundat of in- 
centives. there be mani area left to 
improve, rang from the veri basic 
of mine reward and how they inter- 
act with the consensu mechanism, 
through the reward in mine pools, 
and all the way to the transact fee 
market itself.
