the caus of econom inequ 

januari 21st, 2015 by kara in case studi 





the first in spi’ seri on inequ 



by: may leung 



differ in incom play a role 

one import factor contribut to differ level of wealth be 
peopl be paid differ wages. there be sever reason whi some 
peopl be paid million while some mere earn minimum wage. 

(i) wage be determin by labor market 

wage be a function of the market price of skill requir for a job 
[1]. In a free market, the “market price of a skill” be determin by 
market demand and market supply. the market price of a skill, and henc 
the wage for the job that requir the skill, be low if a larg number 
of worker (high supply) be will and abl to offer that skill but 
onli a few employ need it (low demand). On the contrary, when there 
be low suppli but high demand for a skill, the wage for a job requir 
the skill go up. 

(ii) educ affect wage 

individu with differ level of educ often earn differ 
wage [2]. thi be probabl relat to reason one: the level of 
educ be often proport to the level of skill. with a high 
level of education, a person often have more advanc skill that few 
worker be abl to offer, justifi a high wage. 

the impact of educ on econom inequ be still profound in 
develop countri and citi [3]. although there be usual polici 
of free educ in develop nations, level of educ receiv by 
each individu still differ, not becaus of financi abil but 
innat qualiti like intelligence, drive and person ability. for 
example, in hong kong, 12 year of free educ be provid for each 
citizen, not cover tertiari education, offer onli when student 
receiv certain result on public exams. 

moreover, receiv the same level of educ do not mean 
receiv educ of the same quality. thi account for the 
differ in abil and henc wage for individu all receiving, 
for example, 12 year of education. therefore, it seem no matter how 
good the social welfar polici of a countri be at prevent denial of 
educ due to financi difficulties, differ in education, in 
term of level and quality, still play a promin role in econom 
inequality. 

(iii) growth in technolog widen incom gap 

growth in technolog arguabl render jobless at all skill level 
[3]. for unskil workers, comput and machineri perform a lot of 
task these worker use to be do. In mani jobs, such a packag and 
manufacturing, machineri work even more effect and efficiently. 
hence, job involv repetit task have larg be eliminated. 
skill worker be not immun to the nightmar of lose jobs. the 
rapid develop in artifici intellig may ultim allow 
comput and robot to perform knowledge-bas job [3]. 

the impact of increas unemploy be stagnant or decreas wage 
for most workers, a there be a low demand for but high suppli of 
labor. A small portion of society, usual the owner of capital, 
control an ever-increas fraction of the economi [3]. the incom gap 
between worker who earn by their skill and owner who earn by 
invest in capit have widened. 

although both skill and unskil worker be advers affect by 
the technolog advance, it seem unskil worker be subject to 
bad outcom [3]. thi be becaus the labor market may still need 
skill worker to use comput and oper the advanc machines. the 
rightward shift in the demand for skill labor creat an increas in 
the rel wage of the skill compar to the unskil workers. 
hence, the incom gap among worker also have widened. 

(iv) gender do matter 

In mani countries, there be a gender incom gap in the labor market 
[3]. for example, in america, the median full-tim salari for woman be 
77 percent of that of men [4]. however, woman who work part time make 
more on averag than men who work part-tim [4]. additionally, among 
peopl who never marri or have children, woman make more than men [4]. 

It may be difficult to justifi such differences. accord to a u.s. 
censu report [4], the wage gap be not fulli explain even after 
account for key factor that affect earnings, such a discrimin 
and the tendenc of woman to consid factor other than pay when 
look for work. the onli thing we know for sure be that gender do 
contribut to a differ in wage in societi and henc econom 
inequality. 

(v) person factor 

It be gener believ that innat abil play a part in 
determin the wealth of an individual. hence, individu possess 
differ set of abil may have differ level of wealth, lead 
to econom inequ [3]. for example, more determin individu 
may keep improv themselv and strive for good achievements, 
which justifi a high wage. 

anoth exampl be intellig [3]. A lot of peopl believ that 
smarter peopl tend to have high incom and henc more wealth. thi be 
debatable. In the book IQ and the wealth of nations, dr. 
richard lynn opin that there be a correl of 0.82 between averag 
IQ and gdp. however, stephen jay gould, in the book the mismeasur of man, critic it for employ the wrong method of evaluation. 

In addit to innat abilities, divers of preferences, within a 
societi or among differ societies, contribut to the differ in 
wealth [3]. when it come to work harder or have fun, equal 
capabl individu may have total differ priorities, result in a 
differ in their incomes. their save pattern may also differ, 
lead to differ level of accumul wealth. 

inequ be a viciou cycl 

“the rich get richer, the poor get poorer” be not just a cliche. the 
concept behind it be a theoret process call “wealth 
concentration.” under certain conditions, newli creat wealth be 
concentr in the possess of already-wealthi individu [5]. the 
reason be simple: peopl who alreadi hold wealth have the resourc to 
invest or to leverag the accumul of wealth, which creat new 
wealth. the process of wealth concentr arguabl make econom 
inequ a viciou cycle. 

the effect of wealth concentr may extend to futur gener 
[3]. children born in a rich famili have an econom advantage, becaus 
of wealth inherit and possibl education, which may increas their 
chanc of earn a high incom than their peers. these advantag 
creat anoth round of the viciou cycle. 

the french economist thoma picketti recent publish a book, capit in the twenty-first centuri 
[6]. picketty’ thesi support the previou proposition. It be a 
700-page book on the topic of incom inequality. the rich collect of 
statist in the book show that in almost everi countri (examin by 
picketty), the wealth gap have widen sinc 1980. picketti hold the 
view that inequ will remain a long a the aforement wealth 
concentr process persist through generations. however, picketti 
argu that global inequ have probabl decreased, a there have be 
rapid growth in asia partli at the expens of lower-to-middl incom 
earner in develop countries. the statist show econom inequ 
be not just the top 10 percent of the popul be richer than the 
bottom 20 percent. rather, it be “1 percent versu the remain 99 
percent,” i.e. the top 1 percent of the popul have the vast major 
of wealth in the economi and control of financi markets. 





chart 1 



there be both support and critic for picketty’ argument 
inequ have be a persist phenomenon. world bank research 
christoph lakner and milanov branko agre that inequ in rich 
countri have be worsen significantli sinc 1988 [7]. In oxfam’ 
work paper [8], statist show that in 24 of 26 countri 
researched, inde the richest 1 percent increas their share of incom 
between 1980 and 2012 (see chart 1). the share of nation wealth own 
by the wealthi 1 percent in the u.s. greatli increas after 2008 
(see chart 2), mean the top 1 percent have captur 95 percent of 
post-financi crisi growth sinc 2009, wherea the low-incom 
popul becom poorer. these statist further support the 
proposit in picketty’ book that inequ be persist and be 
get worse. 







chart 2 



critic of picketty’ book, such a michael hudson, a 
distinguish research professor of econom at the univers of 
missouri, mainli focu on the solut propos by picketti [9]. hudson 
even supplement picketty’ theori in an interview by say that 
anoth reason for the persist of econom inequ be the top 1 
percent exploit the remain popul and make the latter “in 
debt” to the former. 

It should be noted, however, some sociologists, such a charl 
murray, disagre with the proposit that wealth accumul be a main 
caus of econom inequality. they argu factor like innat abil 
instead of a good start point be the most import determin 
factor in the wealth accumul by a person. 

from a broader perspective: econom polici and structur 

(i) econom neoliber 

econom neoliber be defin a a form of econom liber 
that support “free market and minimum barrier to the flow of goods, 
servic and capital” [10]. there be four pillar to thi approach, 
name capit account liberalization, trade liberalization, domest 
liberalization, and privat [10]. the economi be liber in 
differ ways. countri like the u.s. adopt econom polici 
promot neoliber (call the “anglo-american model”) [11]. 

advoc of neoliber often argu their ideolog be help in 
reduc absolut inequ [12]. some opin neoliber itself do 
not directli gener inequality. rather, it promot a free system, 
which aim to foster econom prosperity. It be the oper of 
neoliberalism, not the theori itself, which contribut to inequ 
[13]. yet, numer scholar argu that econom neoliber be itself 
a caus of inequality. while it may somehow reduc absolut inequality, 
it increas rel inequ [12]. accord to the economist 
howel and diallo (2007), neoliber polici in the u.s. lead to low 
wage (30 percent of the working-ag population) and inadequ 
employ (60 percent of the working-ag population) [14]. the wealth 
discrep between the rich and the poor, usual the work class, 
henc widens. 

john schmitt and ben zipper (2006) of the cepr hold similar views. 
they claim that econom liberalism, where reduct of busi 
regul and declin of union membership be inevitable, be a caus 
of econom inequ [15]. In their analysi of the effect of 
anglo-american neoliber policies, their conclus be that “the u.s. 
econom and social model be associ with substanti level of 
social exclusion, includ high level of incom inequality. At the 
same time, the avail evid provid littl support for the view 
that u.s.-styl labor-market flexibl dramat improv 
labor-market outcomes” [15]. So it seem that econom neoliber be 
worsen rather than improv the problem of incom inequality. 

(ii) global 

the great umbrella of globalization, a product of trade 
liberalization, now cover everi corner in the world. the extent of it 
effect on econom inequ be debatable. trade economist paul 
krugman support the proposit that global be an import 
caus of inequality. becaus of increas trade among countries, 
worker in richer countri face a high level of competit from 
those in poorer countries, especi in job that do not requir a high 
level of skill. wage for low-skil work in richer countri be 
declin a a result. 

other expert think the effect of global on inequ be 
minor when compar to other causes. for example, lawrenc katz 
estim global account onli for 5 to 15 percent of rise 
inequality. robert lawrence, an economist, disput ani such 
relationship. instead, technolog innov caus low-skil job 
to be replac by machineri in wealthi nations. rich nation no longer 
have signific number of low-skil worker that can be affect by 
competit from poor nations. 

(iii) A kuznet curv – phase of develop 

nobel laureat economist simon kuznet argu that a an economi 
develops, a natur cycl of econom inequ occurs, repres by 
an invert u-shap curv call the kuznet curv (see fig. 1). from 
the curve, we observ a the economi develops, inequ first 
increases, then decreas after a certain level of averag incom be 
attained. In earli development, invest opportun for those who 
alreadi have wealth multipli so owner of capit can accumul wealth. 
At the same time, there be an influx of cheap rural labor to the 
develop cities, which drive down wages. therefore, in earli 
development, inequ increases. 





figur 1: kuznet curv 



when the economi becom mature, there be democrat and variou 
redistribut mechan such a social welfar programs. accord to 
kuznets, countri move back to a low level of inequality. 

As with ani theory, there be criticisms. first, the data set use be 
say to be prejudiced. mani of the middle-incom countri use in 
kuznets’ data set be in latin america, a region with a histor 
high level of inequality. accord to deining and squir (1998), the 
shape of kuznet curv tend to disappear after thi variabl be 
controlled. moreover, kuznet demonstr hi theori by use 
cross-sect data. but through use data from larg panel of 
countries, field (2001) demonstr that hypothesi put forward by 
kuznet be flawed. 

the second critic be the east asian miracl (eam). basically, eam 
describ the rapid econom growth between 1965 and 1990 of eight east 
asian countri – south korea, hong kong, taiwan, singapor (also know 
a four asian tigers), japan, indonesia, thailand, and malaysia. eam 
deviat from the kuznet curv in the sens that the earli develop 
economy, particularli manufactur and exports, grow powerfully, while 
the popul live in absolut poverti decreased, i.e. inequ 
“surprisingly” decreased. 

mani studi have be conduct to identifi reason whi the eam 
success distribut the benefit of rapid econom growth broadli 
among the population, prevent an initi increas in inequality. 
joseph stiglitz propos eam occur through the immedi reinvest 
of initi benefit into land reform increas the rural product 
and income, a well a univers educ and govern polici such 
a increas wage and limit price increas in commodities. hence, 
there be no signific initi increas in inequality. averag 
citizen could then have more financi abil to consum and invest in 
the economy, further econom growth. simpli put, what stiglitz 
suggest be high econom growth provid resourc to promot equality, 
which then provid posit feedback for growth. thi be contrari to 
the kuznet curv theory, which insist that econom growth inevit 
creat inequality, which then promot overal growth. 

inequ be not doom to happen when a countri start developing. 
If there be suffici govern polici and econom planning, a 
high growth rate can coexist with low econom inequ at ani stage 
of development. 

A free-market societi without statutori protect on wage may have 
unfairli low wage for certain type of work, usual those involv 
repetit task and low skills, which widen the wealth gap. likewise, 
econom neoliberalism, which promot minimum trade barriers, may also 
lead to labor exploit in the form of unfairli low wages. look at 
eam in a revers way, if there have not be polici and regul to 
distribut the benefit of rapid econom growth broadli among the 
population, those eight countri might have have total differ fate 
– econom inequ would have increas in their earli stage of 
development.

Hi angela, 

thank for put out an interest articl about econom inequality. 
I just want to highlight the fact (often misinterpreted) be that 
kuznet’ curv be not predict but descript of a certain phase in 
history. kuznet go on to lament it use a a tool to predict (and 
often excuse) inequ a countri developed. 

I just thought i’d shrae thi with you.
