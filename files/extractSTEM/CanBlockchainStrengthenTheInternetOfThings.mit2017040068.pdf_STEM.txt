can blockchain 
strengthen 
the internet of 
things? 
nir kshetri, univers of north carolina at greensboro 

B 
lockchain—a kind of 
distribut ledger tech- 
nology—ha be de- 
scribe in the popu- 

lar press a the next big thing. 
put simply, a blockchain be a data 
structur that make it possi- 
ble to creat a tamper-proof dig- 
ital ledger of transact and 
share them. thi technolog us 
public-key cryptographi to sign 
transact among parties. the 
transact be then store on a 
distribut ledger. the ledger con- 
sist of cryptograph link 
block of transactions, which form 
a blockchain (bit.ly/2sgabnq). It be 
imposs or extrem difficult 
to chang or remov block of data 
that be record on the block- 
chain ledger. 

regard the question of whe- 
ther blockchain can strengthen 
the internet of thing (iot), 
the answer—bas on thi re- 
search—i “maybe.” observ 
have note that the blockchain– 
iot combin be power 
and be set to transform mani in- 
dustries.1 for instance, iot de- 
vice can carri out autonom 

transact through smart con- 
tracts.2 combin with artifici 
intellig (ai) and big data sol- 
utions, more signific impact 
can be produced. 

A natur question be thu 
what role can blockchain play in 
strengthen iot security? To 
demonstr thi problem’ sig- 
nificance, consid the follow- 
ing example. In octob 2016, 
the us-bas dn provid dyn 
face cyberattacks. dyn say the 
attack origin from “ten of 
million of IP addresses,”3 and at 
least some of the traffic come from 
iot devices, includ webcams, 
babi monitors, home routers, and 
digit video recorders.4 these iot 
devic have be infect with 
malwar call mirai, which con- 
trol onlin devic and us them 
to launch distribut denial-of- 
servic (ddos) attacks. the pro- 
ce involv phish email to 
infect a comput or home net- 
work. then the malwar spread 
to other devices, such a dvrs, 
printers, routers, and internet-con- 
nect camera employ by store 
and busi for surveillance.5 

from a secur standpoint, a 
main drawback of iot applica- 
tion and platform be their re- 
lianc on a central cloud. A 
decentralized, blockchain-bas 
approach would overcom mani 
of the problem associ with 
the central cloud approach. 
some point out that blockchain 
could provid military-grad sec- 
uriti for iot devices.6 there be 
no singl point of failur or vul- 
nerabl in blockchain, except 
with the clock need for time 
stamping. 

consid these observations, 
thi column provid insight into 
way in which blockchain might 
strengthen iot security. 

incorpor blockchain 
into iot secur 
blockchain’ incorpor into 
iot be be support through a 
wide varieti of measur intend 
to strengthen security. sever 
compani be lead initi 
to integr blockchain into their 
product and suppli chains. for 
instance, ibm be use it larg 
cloud infrastructur to provid 



computer.org/itpro 69 

blockchain servic for track 
high-valu item a they move 
across suppli chains. 

the ibm watson iot platform’ 
built-in capabl also allow us- 
er to add select iot data to 
privat blockchain ledger that 
can be includ in share trans- 
actions. the platform translat 
the data from connect devic 
into the format that blockchain 
contract api need. It be not nec- 
essari for the blockchain con- 
tract to know the specif of the 
devic data. the platform filter 
devic event and send onli the 
data that be requir to satisfi the 
contract (ibm.co/2rjwcpc). all 
busi partner can access and 
suppli iot data in a decentral- 
ize fashion and can verifi each 
transaction.7 data be not collect- 
ed, stored, or manag centrally. 
rather, it be protect and share 
among onli the parti involv in 
the transaction. 

startup such a proven 
use blockchain to promot trust 
in the suppli chain by provid- 
ing transpar and visibl 
when the product move from the 
sourc to the customer.8 other 
be creat new busi model 
that elimin the need for cen- 
traliz cloud servers. for exam- 
ple, filament, a blockchain-bas 
solut provid for iot, have 
launch wireless sensors, call 
taps, that allow commun 
with computers, phones, or tablet 
within 10 mile (bit.ly/2rsxzyf). 

tap creat low-power, autono- 
mou mesh network that enabl 
compani to manag physic 
mine oper or water flow 
over agricultur fields. tap don’t 
reli on cloud services. devic 
identif and intercommuni- 
cation be secur by a blockchain 
that hold the uniqu ident of 
each particip node.9 one key 
applic be like to be in the 
next gener of the industri 

network (the industri internet). 
filament’ blockchain-bas ap- 
plicat involv sensor con- 
nect in a decentr system 
and use autonom smart con- 
tracts. thi mean that devic 
commun secur with each 
other, exchang values, and ex- 
ecut action automatically. for 
instance, filament’ tap can be 
attach to drill rig in remot 
locations. base on predefin 
conditions, a rig might know that 
it requir a piec of machineri 
and thu might send a request to 
an autonom drone.10 

measur be also take at in- 
terorganiz levels. A group 

of technolog and financi com- 
pani have announc that they 
have form a group to set a new 
standard for secur iot appli- 
cation use blockchain. com- 
pani join the group includ 
cisco, bosch, bank of new york 
mellon, foxconn technology, ge- 
malto, and blockchain startup 
consensu systems, bitse, and 
chronicled.11 thi group hope 
to establish a blockchain protocol 
to build iot devices, applications, 
and networks.12 

ident and access 
manag system 
blockchain-bas ident and ac- 
ce manag system can be 
leverag to strengthen iot secu- 
rity. such system have alreadi 
be use to secur store in- 
format about goods’ prove- 
nance, identity, credentials, and 
digit rights. As long a the orig- 
inal inform enter be accu- 
rate, blockchain’ immut 

can be achieved.13 In thi regard, a 
key challeng that aris in some 
applic be that it be difficult 
to ensur that the properti of 
physic assets, individu (cre- 
dentials), resourc use (energi 
and bandwidth through iot de- 
vices), and other relev event 
be store secur and reliably. 
thi aspect can be handl rela- 
tive easili for most iot devices. 
for instance, a privat blockchain 
can be use to store cryptograph 
hash of individu devic firm- 
ware. such a system creat a 
per manent record of devic con- 
figur and state. thi record 
can be use to verifi that a give 

devic be genuin and that it soft- 
ware and set have not be 
tamper with or breached. onli 
then be the devic allow to con- 
nect to other devic or services. 

return to the dyn example, 
IP spoof attack be launch 
for the late version of the mi- 
rai botnet. blockchain-bas 
ident and access manag 
system can provid strong de- 
fens against attack involv IP 
spoof or IP address forgery. 
becaus it be not possibl to al- 
ter approv blockchains, it be not 
possibl for devic to connect to 
a network by disguis them- 
self by inject fake signatur 
into the record.14 the earli ex- 
ampl involv filament’ tap 
illustr thi point. 

cloud vs. blockchain 
model 
In the cloud model, iot devic 
be identified, authenticated, and 
connect through cloud servers, 

blockchain-bas ident and access manag 
system can be leverag to strengthen iot security.

secur IT 

where process and storag be 
often carri out. even if devic 
be a few foot apart, connect 
between them go through the 
internet.15 

first, iot network that have 
high cost be a concern in the 
central cloud model. gartner 
estim that in 2016, 5.5 million 
new iot devic be connect 
everi day.16 It be estim that by 
2020, a network capac that be at 
least 1,000 time the level of 2016 
will be needed.17 the amount of 
commun that need to 
be handl will increas cost 
exponentially. 

second, even if econom 
and manufactur challeng- 
e be addressed, each block of 
the iot architectur could act a 
a bottleneck or point of failur 
that can disrupt the entir net- 
work.18 for instance, iot devic 
be vulner to ddo attacks, 
hacking, data theft, and remot 
hijacking. crimin might also 
hack the system and misus 
data. If an iot devic connect 
to a server be breached, everyon 
connect to the server could be 
affected. 

consid smart water meter 
and associ risks. twenti per- 
cent of california’ resid have 
smart water meters, which col- 
lect data and send alert on water 
leakag and usag to consumers’ 
phones. likewise, the washing- 
ton suburban sanitari commis- 
sion (wssc) in washington, dc, 
be plan to integr iot into 
it system. water-usag data can 
tell crimin when resid be 
not home. perpetr can then 
burglar home when their resi- 
dent be away.19 

third, the central cloud 
model be suscept to manipu- 
lation. collect real-tim data 
do not ensur that the informa- 
tion be put to good and appropri- 
ate use. consid the water suppli 
system exampl just discussed. 
If state offici or water servic 
compani believ that the evi- 
denc might result in high cost or 
lawsuits, they can censor, edit, or 
delet data and analysis. they can 
also manipul findings. for in- 
stance, consid the water crisi in 
the citi of flint, michigan, which 
begin in 2014. flint author 
insist for month that citi water 

be safe to drink.19 cite offici 
document and find of re- 
searcher who conduct exten- 
sive tests, a cnn articl assert 
that michigan offici might have 
alter sampl data to low the 
city’ water lead level.20 It be re- 
port that the michigan depart- 
ment of environment qualiti 
and the citi of flint discard two 
of the collect samples. A re- 
searcher say that the discard 
sampl have high lead levels. 
includ them in the ana lysi 
would have increas the level 
abov 15 part per billion (ppb). 
accord to the US environ- 
mental protect agency, water 
suppli compani be requir to 
alert the public and take action 
if lead concentr exceed the 
“action level” of 15 ppb in drink- 
ing water (bit.ly/1qkmlve). 

blockchain can elimin mani 
of the drawback describ in 
tabl 1. In blockchain, messag ex- 
chang between devic can be 
treat in a similar way a financi 
transact in a bitcoin network. 
To exchang messages, devic 
reli on smart contracts. block- 
chain cryptograph sign

cost and capac 
constraint 

It be a challeng to handl exponenti 
growth in iot devices: by 2020, a network 
capac at least 1,000 time the level of 
2016 will be needed. 

No need for a central entity: devic can 
commun securely, exchang valu with each 
other, and execut action automat through 
smart contracts. 

defici 
architectur 

each block of iot architectur act a a 
bottleneck or point of failur and disrupt 
the entir network; vulner to 
distribut denial-of-servic attacks, hacking, 
data theft, and remot hijack also exists. 

secur messag between devices: the valid 
of a device’ ident be verified, and transact 
be sign and verifi cryptograph to 
ensur that onli a message’ origin could 
have sent it. 

cloud server downtim 
and unavail of 
servic 

cloud server be sometim down due to 
cyberattacks, softwar bugs, power, cooling, 
or other problems. 

No singl point of failure: record be on mani 
comput and devic that hold ident 
information. 

suscept to 
manipul 

inform be like to be manipul and 
put to inappropri uses. 

decentr access and immutability: malici 
action can be detect and prevented. 

devic be interlocked: if one device’ blockchain 
updat be breached, the system reject it. 



computer.org/itpro 71 

transact and verifi those 
cryptograph signatur to ensur 
that onli the message’ origin 
could have sent it. thi can elim- 
inat the possibl of man-in-the- 
middle, replay, and other attacks.6 

blockchain’ propon have 
forc argu that thi new 
technolog can save u from 
“anoth flint-lik contamina- 
tion crisis.”19 project such a the 
wssc’ integr of the iot in 
suppli system can be upgrad 
with sensor such a near-infrar 
reflect spectroscopi (nirs) 
to includ data on chemic levels. 
If such a system have be instal 
in michigan, flint’ water servic 
compani could have found the 
lead contamin when it ex- 
ceed healthi levels. blockchain 
can provid the “second layer of 
crisi prevention” in such cases.20 

ensur suppli 
chain secur 
blockchain can ensur suppli 
chain secur (see figur 1). It 
also make it possibl to contain 
an iot secur breach in a tar- 
get way after discoveri of the 
breach. blockchain can facilit 

handl and deal with crisi 
situat such a product recal 
due to secur vulnerabilities. 
blockchain’ public avail 
mean that it be possibl to trace 
back everi product to the origin 
of the raw materials, and transac- 
tion can be link to identifi us- 
er of vulner iot devices. 

iot-link secur crises, such 
a the cyberattack on dyn, 
could have be handl good 
if the suppli chain have adopt 
blockchain. for instance, chi- 
na-bas hangzhou xiongmai 
technologies, which make in- 
ternet-connect camera and ac- 
cessories, recal it product in 
the US that be vulner to the 
mirai malware. however, it be dif- 
ficult to determin the devices’ 
owners. blockchain be suitabl for 
complex workflows. It can be use 
to regist time, location, price, 
parti involved, and other rel- 
evant inform when an item 
chang ownership. the tech- 
nolog can also track raw ma- 
terial a they move through the 
suppli chain, be transform 
into circuit board and electron 
components, be integr into 

products, and be sell to custom- 
ers. blockchain can also be use 
to regist updates, patches, and 
part replac appli to ani 
product or devic throughout it 
lifetime. It be easi to track prog- 
re in address vulner 
and send warn and notifica- 
tion to owners.8 

B ase on the evolv mechan and forc describ here, a prom- 
ise futur seem like for the 
use of blockchain in address- 
ing iot security. for instance, 
some of the key secur chal- 
leng associ with the cloud 
can be address by use the 
decentralized, autonomous, and 
trust capabl of blockchain. 
blockchain’ decentr and 
consensus-driven struc ture be 
like to provid more secur ap- 
proach a the network size in- 
creas exponentially.

cation of the attribut it carries.
