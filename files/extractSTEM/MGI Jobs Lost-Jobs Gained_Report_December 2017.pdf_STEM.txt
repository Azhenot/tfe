sinc it found in 1990, the mckinsey global institut (mgi) have sought 
to develop a deeper understand of the evolv global economy. As the 
busi and econom research arm of mckinsey & company, mgi aim 
to provid leader in the commercial, public, and social sector with the fact 
and insight on which to base manag and polici decisions. the lauder 
institut at the univers of pennsylvania have rank mgi the world’ number- 
one private-sector think tank in it think tank index. 

mgi research combin the disciplin of econom and management, 
employ the analyt tool of econom with the insight of busi 
leaders. our “micro-to-macro” methodolog examin microeconom 
industri trend to good understand the broad macroeconom forc 
affect busi strategi and public policy. mgi’ in-depth report have 
cover more than 20 countri and 30 industries. current research focu 
on six themes: product and growth, natur resources, labor markets, 
the evolut of global financi markets, the econom impact of technolog 
and innovation, and urbanization. recent report have assess the 
digit economy, the impact of AI and autom on employment, incom 
inequality, the product puzzle, the econom benefit of tackl gender 
inequality, a new era of global competition, chines innovation, and digit and 
financi globalization. 

mgi be lead by three mckinsey & compani senior partners: jacqu bughin, 
jonathan woetzel, and jame manyika, who also serf a the chairman 
of mgi. michael chui, susan lund, anu madgavkar, sree ramaswamy, and

IN A time OF autom 



prefac 

autom be not a new phenomenon, and fear about it transform of the workplac 
and effect on employ date back centuries, even befor the industri revolut in 
the 18th and 19th centuries. In the 1960s, US presid lyndon johnson empanel a 
“nation commiss on technology, automation, and econom progress.” among it 
conclus be “the basic fact that technolog destroy jobs, but not work.”* fast forward 
and rapid recent advanc in autom technologies, includ artifici intelligence, 
autonom systems, and robot be now rais the fear anew—and with new urgency. 
In our januari 2017 report on automation, A futur that works: automation, employment, 
and productivity, we analyz the autom potenti of the global economy, the timelin 
over which the phenomenon could play out, and the power product boost that 
autom adopt could deliver. 

thi report go a step further by examin both the potenti labor market disrupt 
from autom and some potenti sourc of new labor demand that will creat jobs. 
We develop scenario that seek to address some of the question most often rais in the 
public debate. will there be enough work in the futur to maintain full employment, and if so 
what will that work be? which occup will thrive, and which one will wither? what be 
the potenti implic for skill and wage a machin perform some or the task that 
human now do? 

the report be part of the mckinsey global institute’ research program on the futur of work, 
and be by no mean the final word on thi topic. the technolog continu to evolve, a will 
our collect understand of the econom implications. indeed, we highlight some of the 
limit of our analysi and scenarios, and area for further research. the report build on 
our previou research on labor markets, incomes, skills, and the expand rang of model 
of work, includ the gig economy, a well a the potenti impact on the global economi 
of digitization, automation, robotics, and artifici intelligence. 

the research be lead by jame manyika, chairman and director of the mckinsey global 
institut and mckinsey senior partner base in san francisco; susan lund, an mgi partner

IN brief 

job lost, job gained: workforc 
transit IN A time OF autom 
In our late research on automation, we examin work 
that can be autom through 2030 and job that may 
be creat in the same period. We draw from lesson 
from histori and develop variou scenario for the future. 
while it be hard to predict how all thi will play out, our 
research provid some insight into the like workforc 
transit that should be expect and their implications. 
our key findings: 

 autom technolog includ artifici intellig 
and robot will gener signific benefit for 
users, businesses, and economies, lift product 
and econom growth. the extent to which these 
technolog displac worker will depend on the 
pace of their develop and adoption, econom 
growth, and growth in demand for work. even a it 
caus declin in some occupations, autom 
will chang mani more—60 percent of occup 
have at least 30 percent of constitu work 
activ that could be automated. It will also creat 
new occup that do not exist today, much a 
technolog of the past have done. 

 while about half of all work activ global have 
the technic potenti to be autom by adapt 
current demonstr technologies, the proport 
of work actual displac by 2030 will like be 
lower, becaus of technical, economic, and social 
factor that affect adoption. our scenario across 46 
countri suggest that between almost zero and one- 
third of work activ could be displac by 2030, 
with a midpoint of 15 percent. the proport vari 
wide across countries, with advanc economi 
more affect by autom than develop ones, 
reflect high wage rate and thu econom 
incent to automate. 

 even with automation, the demand for work and 
worker could increas a economi grow, 
partli fuel by product growth enabl 
by technolog progress. rise incom and 
consumpt especi in develop countries, 
increas health care for age societies, invest 
in infrastructur and energy, and other trend will 
creat demand for work that could help offset the 
displac of workers. addit invest such 
a in infrastructur and construction, benefici in their 
own right, could be need to reduc the risk of job 
shortag in some advanc economies. 

 even if there be enough work to ensur full employ 
by 2030, major transit lie ahead that could match 
or even exceed the scale of histor shift out of 
agricultur and manufacturing. our scenario suggest 
that by 2030, 75 million to 375 million worker (3 to 
14 percent of the global workforce) will need to switch 
occup categories. moreover, all worker will 
need to adapt, a their occup evolv alongsid 
increasingli capabl machines. some of that 
adapt will requir high educ attainment, 
or spend more time on activ that requir social 
and emot skills, creativity, high-level cognit 
capabl and other skill rel hard to automate. 

 incom polar could continu in the unit 
state and other advanc economies, where 
demand for high-wag occup may grow the 
most while middle-wag occup decline— 
assum current wage structur persist. increas 
invest and product growth from autom 
could spur enough growth to ensur full employment, 
but onli if most displac worker find new work 
within one year. If reemploy be slow, friction 
unemploy will like rise in the short-term and 
wage could face downward pressure. these wage 
trend be not universal: in china and other emerg 
economies, middle-wag occup such a 
servic and construct job will like see the most 
net job growth, boost the emerg middl class. 

 To achiev good outcomes, polici maker and 
busi leader will need to embrac automation’ 
benefit and, at the same time, address the worker 
transit brought about by these technologies. 
ensur robust demand growth and econom 
dynam be a priority: histori show that economi 
that be not expand do not gener job growth. 
midcar job train will be essential, a will 
enhanc labor market dynam and enabl 
worker redeployment. these chang will challeng 
current educ and workforc train models, a 
well a busi approach to skill-building. anoth 
prioriti be rethink and strengthen transit and 
incom support for worker caught in the cross- 
current of automation.

summari OF find 

the technology-driven world in which we live be a world fill with promis but also 
challenges. car that drive themselves, machin that read x-rays, and algorithm that 
respond to custom servic inquiri be all manifest of power new form of 
automation. yet even a these technolog increas product and improv our lives, 
their use will substitut for some work activ human current perform—a develop 
that have spark much public concern. 

thi research build on mgi’ januari 2017 report on autom and it impact on work 
activities.1 We ass the number and type of job that might be creat under differ 
scenario through 2030, and compar that to work that could be displac by automation.2 
the result reveal a rich mosaic of potenti shift in occup in the year ahead, with 
import implic for workforc skill and wages. the analysi cover 46 countri that 
compris almost 90 percent of global gdp. We focu on six countri that span incom 
level (china, germany, india, japan, mexico, and the unit states). for each, we model 
the potenti net employ chang for more than 800 occupations, base on differ 
scenario for the pace of autom adopt and for futur labor demand. the intent of thi 
research be not to forecast. rather, we present a set of scenario (necessarili incomplete) 
to serv a a guide, a we anticip and prepar for the futur of work. thi research be by 
no mean the final word on thi topic; ongo research be required. indeed, in box E2 at the 
end of thi summary, we highlight some of the potenti limit of the research present 
in thi report. 

our find suggest that sever trend that may serv a catalyst of futur labor demand 
could creat demand for million of job by 2030. these trend includ care for other in 
age societies, rais energi effici and meet climat challenges, produc good 
and servic for the expand consum class, especi in develop countries, not to 
mention the invest in technology, infrastructure, and build need in all countries. 
taken from anoth angle, we also find that a grow and dynam economy—in part fuel 
by technolog itself and it contribut to productivity—would creat jobs. these job 
would result from growth in current occup due to demand and the creation of new 
type of occup that may not have exist before, a have happen historically. thi 
job growth (job gained) could more than offset the job lose to automation. none of thi 
will happen by itself—it will requir busi and govern to seiz opportun to 
boost job creation and for labor market to function well. the workforc transit ahead 
will be enormous. We estim that a mani a 375 million worker global (14 percent of 
the global workforce) will like need to transit to new occup categori and learn 
new skills, in the event of rapid autom adoption. If their transit to new job be slow, 
unemploy could rise and dampen wage growth. 

indeed, while thi report be titl job lost, job gained, it could have been, job lost, job 
changed, job gained; in mani way a big part of thi stori be about how more occup 
will chang than will be lose a machin affect portion of occup and peopl 
increasingli work alongsid them. societ choic will determin whether all three of these

come workforc transit be smooth, or whether unemploy and incom inequ 
rise. histori show numer exampl of countri that have success ridden the wave 
of technolog chang by invest in their workforc and adapt policies, institutions, 
and busi model to the new era. It be our hope that thi report prompt leader in that 
direct onc again. 

autom could displac A signific share OF work global 
TO 2030; 15 percent IS the midpoint OF our scenario rang 
In our prior report on automation, we found that about half the activ peopl be paid to 
do global could theoret be autom use current demonstr technologies.3 
veri few occupations—less than 5 percent—consist entir of activ that can be 
fulli automated. however, in about 60 percent of occupations, at least one-third of the 
constitu activ could be automated, impli substanti workplac transform 
and chang for all workers. all thi be base on our assess of current technolog 
capability—an ever evolv frontier (exhibit e1). 

while technic feasibl of autom be important, it be not the onli factor that will influenc 
the pace and extent of autom adoption. other factor includ the cost of develop 
and deploy autom solut for specif us in the workplace, the labor market 
dynam (includ qualiti and quantiti of labor and associ wages), the benefit 
of autom beyond labor substitution, and regulatori and social acceptance. take 
into account these factors, our new research estim that between almost zero and 
30 percent of the hour work global could be autom by 2030, depend on the 
speed of adoption. In thi report we mainli use the midpoint of our scenario range, which be 
15 percent of current activ automated. result differ significantli by country, reflect 
the mix of activ current perform by worker and prevail wage rates. they rang

intellig (softwar algorithm that perform calcul and cognit activities). compani may adopt 
these technolog for reason other than labor cost savings, such a improv quality, efficiency, or scale, 
although worker displac could still be a consequence. A glossari of autom technolog and

technolog adopt can and often do caus 
signific short-term labor displacement, but histori 
show that, in the longer run, it creat a multitud of new 
job and unleash demand for exist ones, more than 
offset the number of job it destroy even a it rais 
labor product (exhibit e3).1 An examin of the 
histor record highlight sever lessons: 

 all advanc economi have experienc 
profound sector shift in employment, first out of 
agricultur and more recent manufacturing, even 
a overal employ grew. In the unit states, the 
agricultur share of total employ declin from 
60 percent in 1850 to less than 5 percent by 1970, 
while manufactur fell from 26 percent of total US 
employ in 1960 to below 10 percent today. other 
countri have experienc even faster declines: one- 
third of china’ workforc move out of agricultur 
between 1990 and 2015. 

 such shift can have pain consequ for some 
workers. dure the industri revolut in england, 
averag real wage stagnat for decades, even a 
product rose.2 eventually, wage growth caught up 
to and then surpass product growth. but the 
transit period be difficult for individu workers, 
and eas onli after substanti polici reforms. 

 new technolog have spur the creation of mani 
more job than they destroyed, and some of the new 
job be in occup that cannot be envis 
at the outset; one studi found that 0.56 percent of 
new job in the unit state each year be in new 
occupations.3 most job creat by technolog 
be outsid the technology-produc sector itself. 
We estim that the introduct of the person 
computer, for instance, have enabl the creation of 
15.8 million net new job in the unit state sinc 
1980, even after account for job displaced. about 
90 percent of these be in occup that use the PC 
in other industries, such a call center representatives, 
financi analysts, and inventori managers. 

 robust aggreg demand and econom growth 
be essenti for job creation. new technolog have 
rais product growth, enabl firm to low 
price for consumers, pay high wages, or distribut 
profit to shareholders. thi stimul demand 
across the economy, boost job creation.4 

 rise product be usual accompani by 
employ growth, becaus it rais incom 
which be then spent, creat demand for good and 
servic across the economy. when there have be 
a tradeoff between employ growth and labor 
product growth, it have be short-lived. In the 
unit states, for example, our analysi show that 
employ and product both grow in 95 percent 
of roll three-year period and 100 percent of roll 
10-year period sinc 1960. 

 over the long term, product growth enabl by 
technolog have reduc the averag hour work 
per week and allow peopl to enjoy more leisur 
time.5 across advanc economies, the length 
of the averag work-week have fall by nearli 
50 percent sinc the earli 1900s, reflect shorter 
work hours, more paid day off for person 
time and vacations, and the recent rise of part-tim 
work. the growth in leisur have creat demand 
for new industries, from golf to video game to 
home improvement. 

although the histor record be larg reassuring, 
some peopl worri that autom today will be 
more disrupt than in the past. technolog expert 
and economist be debat whether “thi time, 
thing be different” (and we examin that debat 
start on page 48 of thi report). our current 
view be that the answer depend on the time horizon 
consid (decad or centuries) and on the pace of 
futur technolog progress and adoption. On mani 
dimensions, we find similar between the scope and 
effect of autom today compar to earli wave of 
technolog disruption, go back to the industri

the potenti impact of autom on employ vari by occup and sector. 
activ most suscept to autom includ physic one in predict environments, 
such a oper machineri and prepar fast food. collect and process data 
be two other categori of activ that can increasingli be do good and faster with 
machines. thi could displac larg amount of labor, for instanc in mortgag origination, 
paraleg work, accounting, and back-offic transact processing. It be import to note, 
however, that even when some task be automated, employ in those occup 
may not decline, but rather worker may perform new tasks. In addition, employ in 
occup may also grow, if the overal demand for that occup grow enough to 
overwhelm the rate of automation. 

autom will have a lesser effect on job that involv manag people, appli 
expertise, and those involv social interactions, where machin be unabl to match 
human perform for now. job in unpredict environments—occup such a 
gardeners, plumbers, or provid of child- and elder-care—wil also gener see less 
autom by 2030, becaus they be difficult to autom technic and often command 
rel low wages, which make autom a less attract busi proposition. 

rise incomes, invest IN infrastructur and energy, and 
other catalyst could potenti creat million OF new job 
while automation’ displac of labor have be visibl for mani years, it be more difficult 
to envis all the new job that will be created. mani of these new job be creat indirectli 
and spread across differ sector and geographies. 

In thi report, we model some potenti sourc of new labor demand that may spur job 
creation to 2030, even net of automation. We consid two scenarios, a “trendline” scenario 
base on current spend and invest trend observ across countries, and a “step- 
up” scenario that assum addit invest in some areas. We calcul job (full-tim 
equivalents) that could be creat both directli and indirectli for more than 800 exist 
occupations. We do not consid the dynam interact between trend or across the 
economi (exhibit e4). the result be not precis forecast of futur job growth, but rather 
be suggest of where job of the futur may be. 

for three trends, we model onli a trendlin scenario. they are: 

 rise incom and consumption, especi in emerg economies. previou 
mgi research have estim that 1 billion more peopl will enter the consum class by 
2025.4 use extern macroeconom forecasts, we estim that global consumpt 
could grow by $23 trillion between 2015 and 2030, and most of thi will come from the 
expand consum class in emerg economies. As incom rise, consum 
spend more on all categories. but their spend pattern also shift, creat more job 
in area such a consum durables, leisur activities, financi and telecommun 
services, housing, health care, and education. the effect of these new consum will 
be felt not just in the countri where the incom be generated, but also in economi that 
export to those countries.5 globally, we estim that 300 million to 365 million new job 
could be creat from the impact of rise incomes. 

 age populations. By 2030, there will be at least 300 million more peopl age 
65 year and abov than there be in 2014. As peopl age, their spend pattern

5 We assum that current pattern of global trade continue, at the same level rel to gdp a today. As a 
result, advanc economi also benefit from rise incom in develop countries. the unit states, 
for example, could gain up to 3 percent of net new job from rise incom by 2030 from net exports. In 
germany’ case, that figur could be more than 40 percent.

shift, with a pronounc increas in spend on health care and other person 
services. thi will creat signific demand for a rang of occupations, includ 
doctors, nurses, and health technicians, but also home health aides, person care aid 
and nurs assist in mani countries, even a it reduc demand for pediatrician 
and primary-school teachers. globally, we estim heath care and relat job from 
age and rise incom could grow by 80 million to 130 million by 2030.6 

 develop and deploy of technology. job relat to develop and 
deploy new technolog may also grow. these job includ comput scientists, 
engineers, and IT administrators. overal spend on technolog could increas by 
more than 50 percent between 2015 and 2030. about half would be on inform 
technolog services, both in-hous IT worker within compani and extern or 
outsourc tech consult jobs. the number of peopl employ in these occup 
be small compar to those in health care or construction, but they be high-wag 
occupations. By 2030, we estim thi trend could creat 20 to 50 million job globally.

for three other trends, we model both a trendlin scenario and a step-up scenario; the latter 
be base on explicit choic that could be make by governments, busi leaders, and 
individu to creat addit jobs. 

 invest in infrastructur and buildings. infrastructur and build be two 
area of histor underspend that may creat signific addit labor demand 
if action be take to bridg infrastructur gap and overcom hous shortages. mgi 
have estim that the world need to invest about 3.8 percent of gdp annually, or an 
averag of $3.3 trillion per year to fill infrastructur gaps, compar with $2.5 trillion 
currently.7 thi includ both develop countri that be urban and industrializing, 
and advanc economi that have underinvest in maintain their infrastructur 
and buildings. rise incom also creat demand for more and high qualiti buildings. 
both factor could creat new demand, mainli in the construct sector, for up to 
80 million job in the trendlin scenario and, in some cases, potenti up to 200 million 
global in the step-up scenario.8 these job includ architects, engineers, carpent 
and other skill tradespeople, a well a construct workers, machineri oper 
and other job with low skill requirements. 

 invest in renew energy, energi efficiency, and climat adaptation. 
invest in renew energy, such a wind and solar, energi effici 
technologies, and adapt and mitig of climat chang may creat new demand 
for worker in a rang of occupations, includ in manufacturing, construction, and 
installation. In our trendlin scenario, we model futur job growth base on already- 
announc polici intent for energi effici and the requir invest to meet 
these goals.9 for a step-up scenario, we use more ambiti target that countri 
will need to get closer to meet commit to the pari climat accord.10 these 
invest could creat up to ten million new job in the trendlin scenario, and up to 
ten million addit job global in the step-up scenario. 

 “marketization” of previous unpaid domest work. the last trend we consid 
be the potenti to pay for servic that substitut for current unpaid and primarili 
domest work—includ cooking, childcare, and cleaning. thi so-cal market 
of previous unpaid work be alreadi preval in advanc economies, and rise femal 
labor forc particip worldwid could acceler the trend. about 75 percent of the 
world’ total unpaid care be undertaken by woman and amount to a much a $10 trillion 
of output per year, roughli equival to 13 percent of global gdp.11 individu decis 
within the household to use paid servic or govern invest to provid univers 
childcar and pre-school could fuel thi development. We consid thi in the step-up 
scenario only, a it magnitud and time be unclear. but we estim that thi shift could 
market 50 million to 90 million unpaid job globally, mainli in occup such a 
childcare, earli childhood education, cleaning, cooking, and gardening.

when we look at the net chang in job growth and declin from the trend describ 
abov compar with the work that can be automated, a mosaic of shift in occup 
and job categori emerg (exhibit e5). 

across all countries, the categori with the high percentag job growth net of 
autom includ health-car providers; profession such a engineers, scientists, 
accountants, and analysts; IT profession and other technolog specialists; manag and 
executives, whose work cannot easili be replac by machines; educators, especi in 
emerg economi with young populations; and “creatives,” a small but grow categori 
of artists, performers, and entertain who will be in demand a rise incom creat 
more demand for leisur and recreation. builder and relat profess will also grow, 
particularli in the step-up scenario that involv high invest in infrastructur and 
buildings. manual and servic job in unpredict environ will also grow, such a 
home health aid and gardeners. 

advanc economi may also see employ declin in occup that be most 
suscept to automation. these includ offic support occupations, such a record 
clerks, offic assistants, and financ and accounting; some custom interact jobs, 
such a hotel and travel workers, cashiers, and food servic workers; and a wide rang of 
job carri out in predict settings, such a assembl line workers, dishwashers, food 
prepar workers, drivers, and agricultur and other equip operators. help 
individu transit from the declin occup to grow one will be a large- 
scale challenge. 

the come workforc transit among occup could be veri larg 
the chang in net occup growth or declin impli that a veri larg number of peopl 
may need to shift occup categori and learn new skill in the year ahead. the shift 
could be on a scale not see sinc the transit of the labor forc out of agricultur in the 
earli 1900 in the unit state and europe, and more recent in china. but unlik those 
earli transitions, in which young peopl left farm and move to citi for industri jobs, 
the challenge, especi in advanc economies, will be to retrain midcar workers. 
there be few preced in which societi have success retrain such larg number 
of people. friction in the labor markets—includ cultur norm regard gender 
stereotyp in work and geograph mismatch between worker and jobs—could also 
imped the transition.12

We estim that between 400 million and 800 million individu could be displac by 
autom and need to find new job by 2030 around the world, base on our midpoint 
and earli (that is, the most rapid) autom adopt scenarios. We think demand for 
job will be there, base on our scenario of futur labor demand and the net impact of 
automation, a describ in the next section. howev peopl will need to find their way into 
these jobs. Of the total displaced, 75 million to 375 million may need to switch occup 
categori and learn new skills, under our midpoint and earli autom adopt 
scenario (exhibit e6).13 under the late adopt scenario (that is, the slowest), thi number 
would be far lower, below 10 million. given the minim impact on the workforc of thi 
edge-cas scenario, we have not highlight it in the exhibit in thi report. In absolut 
terms, china face the larg number of worker need to switch occupations—up to 
100 million if autom be adopt rapidly, or 12 percent of the 2030 workforce—although 
thi figur be rel small compar with the huge shift in china out of agricultur in the 
past 25 years. for advanc economies, the share of the workforc that may need to learn 
new skill and find work in new occup be much higher: up to one-third of the 2030

will there BE enough work IN the future? 
today there be grow concern about whether there will be enough job for worker give 
potenti automation. histori would suggest that such fear may be unfounded: over time, 
labor market adjust to chang in demand for worker from technolog disruptions, 
although at time with depress real wages. We address thi question about the futur 
of work through two differ set of analyses: one base on model of a limit number 
of catalyst of new labor demand and autom describ above, and one use a 
macroeconom model of the economi that incorpor the dynam interact 
among variables. We also note that if histori be ani guide, we could expect 8 to 9 percent 
of 2030 labor demand will be in new type of occup that have not exist before.14 
both analysi lead u to conclud that, with suffici econom growth, innovation, and 
investment, there can be enough new job creation to offset the impact of automation, 
although in some advanc economi addit invest will be need a per our 
step-up scenario to reduc the risk of job shortages. but a larg challeng will be ensur 
that worker have the skill and support need to transit to new jobs. countri that fail 
to manag thi transit could see rise unemploy and depress wages. 

futur job lose and job gain vari by country, with the larg disrupt 
expect in advanc economi 
the magnitud of futur job creation from the trend describ abov and the impact of 
autom on the workforc vari significantli by country, depend on four factors: 

 wage levels. higher wage make the busi case for autom adopt stronger. 
however, low-wag countri may be affect a well, if compani adopt autom 
to boost quality, achiev tighter product control, move product closer to end 
consum in high-wag countries, or other benefit beyond reduc labor costs. some 
economist worri about “prematur deindustrialization” in develop countri due 
to automation.15 

 demand growth. econom growth be essenti for job creation; economi that be 
stagnant or grow slowli creat few if ani net new jobs. countri with strong 
econom and product growth and innov will therefor be expect to 
experi more new labor demand, although the amount and natur of job creation will 
vari depend on the sector that drive growth. 

 demographics. demograph affect both labor demand and labor supply. countri 
with a rapidly-grow workforce, such a india, may enjoy a “demograph dividend” 
that boost gdp growth—if young peopl be employed. countri with a shrink 
workforce, such a japan, can expect low futur gdp growth, deriv onli from 
product growth. however, countri with a declin workforc need autom to 
offset their shrink labor supply, while countri with grow workforc have great 
job creation challenges. 

 mix of econom sector and occupations. the autom potenti for countri 
reflect the mix of econom sector and the mix of job within each sector. japan, for 
example, have a high technic autom potenti than the unit state becaus 
the weight of sector that be highli automatable, such a manufacturing, be higher. and 
within japanes manufacturing, a larg proport of job involv activ that can be 
more easili automated, such a production, than in the unit states.

these factor combin to creat differ outlook for the futur of work in each countri 
(exhibit e7). for instance, japan be rich but it economi be project to grow slowli to 2030. 
It face the combin of slow job creation come from econom expans and a 
larg share of work that can be autom a a result of high wage and the structur of it 
economy. however, japan will also see it workforc shrink by 2030 by four million people. 
In the step-up scenario, and consid the job in new occup we cannot envis 
today, japan’ net chang in job could be roughli in balance. 

like japan, the unit state and germani could also face signific workforc 
displac from autom by 2030, but their project futur growth—and henc 
new job creation—i higher. the unit state have a grow workforc and, in the step- 
up scenario, with innov lead to new type of occup and work, germany’ 
workforc will declin by three million by 2030, and it will have more than enough labor 
demand to employ all workers. 

At the other extrem be india: a fast-grow develop countri with rel modest 
potenti for autom over the next 15 years, reflect low wage rates. our analysi find 
that most occup categori be project to grow in india, reflect it potenti for 
strong econom expansion. however, india’ labor forc be expect to grow by 138 million 
peopl by 2030, or about 30 percent. employ these new entrant in formal sector job 
will requir job creation on a much larg scale than in the past. autom will make thi 
challeng more difficult; some fear “jobless growth.”16 however, our analysi suggest 
that india can creat enough new job to offset autom and employ new entrants, if it 
undertak the invest in our step-up scenario. 

china and mexico have high wage than india, and so be like to see more automation. 
china be still project to have robust econom growth and will have a shrink workforce; 
like germany, china’ problem could be a shortag of workers. mexico’ project rate of 
futur econom expans be more modest, and it workforc will grow by 15 million by 
2030. like the unit state and japan, our result suggest that mexico could benefit from 
the job creation in the step-up scenario plu innov in new occup and activ to 
make full use of it workforce.

If displac worker be not reemploy quickly, countri will face rise 
unemploy and depress wage 
To model the impact of autom on overal employ and wages, we use a gener 
equilibrium model of the economi of our six focu countri that take into account the 
econom impact of autom and dynam interactions.17 the model be not intend to 
forecast the future, but rather be a tool to explor the implic of differ scenarios. 

autom have at least three distinct econom impacts. most attent have be devot 
to the potenti displac of labor. but autom also may rais labor productivity: 
firm onli adopt autom when do so enabl them to produc more or higher-qu 
output with the same or few input (includ material, energy, and labor inputs). the third 
impact be that autom adopt rais invest in the economy, lift short-term gdp 
growth. We model all three effects.18 We also creat differ scenario for how quickli 
displac worker find new employment, base on histor data. 

the result reveal that across differ rate of re-employment, our six countri could 
expect to be at or veri near full employ by 2030. consist with the histor 
experience, labor market adjust to technolog shocks. however, the model also 
illustr the import of reemploy displac worker quickly. If displac worker 
be abl to be reemploy within one year, our model show autom lift the overal 
economy: full employ be maintain in both the short and long-term, wage grow 
faster than in the baselin model, and product be higher. however, in scenario in which 
some displac worker take year to find new work, unemploy rise in the short- to 
medium-term. the labor market adjust over time and unemploy falls—but with slow 
averag wage growth. In these scenarios, averag wage end up low in 2030 than in 
the baselin model, which could dampen aggreg demand and long-term growth. the 
pace of reemploy will be influenc by the effect of retraining, the capac of 
compani to innov and, in some sectors, the elast of demand. 

worker will requir differ skills, and wage polar IN 
advanc countri could continu 
In all six of our focu countries, we find that in general, the current educ requir 
of the occup that may grow be high than those for the job displac by 
automation. In advanc economies, occup that current requir onli a secondari 
educ or less see a net declin from automation, while those occup requir 
colleg degre and high grow. In india and other emerg economies, we find high 
labor demand for all educ levels, with the larg number of new job in occup 
requir a secondari educ but the fast rate of job growth will be for occup 
current requir a colleg or advanc degre (exhibit e8). for all countries, increas 
invest in educ and workforc train will be a priority. 

moreover, we find that worker of the futur will spend more time on activ that machin 
be less capabl of, such a manag people, appli expertise, and commun 
with others. they will spend less time on predict physic activities, and on collect 
and process data, where machin alreadi exceed human performance. the skill and 
capabl requir will also shift, requir more social and emot skills, and more 
advanc cognit capabilities, such a logic reason and creativity. 

17 We use mckinsey & company’ global growth model, a supply-sid gener equilibrium macroeconom 
model that cover more than 100 countri with data from 1960 through 2015. 

18 We obtain data for labor displac and requir firm invest from mgi’ autom model, at the 
midpoint adopt scenario. We make a conserv assumpt on the product impact of automation, 
that firm produc the same valu of output a prior to autom but with few workers. see technic 
appendix for more detail.

wage polar could be exacerb in advanc economi but develop 
countri will see a grow middl class 
wage may stagnat or fall in declin occupations. although we do not model shift in 
rel wage across occupations, the basic econom of labor suppli and demand 
suggest that thi should be the case for occup in which labor demand declines. 
sinc 1980, most advanc economi have see an overal declin share of nation 
incom be captur by labor (compar with capital). recent academ work suggest 
that technolog chang be one reason for thi decline.19 

our analysis, look at chang in employ by occup at today’ rel wage 
levels, show that most job growth in the unit state and other advanc economi 
will be in occup current at the high end of the wage distribution. some occup 
that be current low-wage, such a nurs assist and teach assistants, will 
also increase, while a wide rang of middle-incom occup will have the larg 
employ declines. these result suggest that incom polar could continue. 
polici choic we identifi in our step-up scenario, such a increas invest in 
infrastructure, buildings, and energi transit could help creat addit demand for 
middle-wag job such a construct worker in advanc economies. 

the wage trend pictur be quit differ in emerg economi such a china and india, 
where our scenario show that middle-wag job such a retail salesperson and teacher 
will grow quickli a these economi develop. thi impli that their consum class will 
continu to grow in the decad ahead. however, our analysi come with sever import 
caveat (see box e2, “what could overst or underst the impact scenario assess in 
thi research—and what we have not considered”). 

busi and policymak will need TO act TO keep peopl 
work AS autom IS adopt 
the benefit of AI and autom to user and businesses, and the econom growth that 
could come via their product contributions, be compelling. they will not onli contribut 
to dynam economi that creat jobs, but also help creat the econom surplu that 
will enabl societi to address the workforc transit that will like happen regardless. 
face with the scale of worker transit we have described, one reaction could be to tri 
to slow the pace and scope of adopt in an attempt to preserv the statu quo. while thi 
may limit the workforc transitions, it would affect the contribut that these technolog 
make to busi dynam and econom growth, via the contribut to product 
growth, and which in turn lead to job growth and prosperity. We should embrac these 
technolog but also address the workforc transit and challeng they bring. In mani 
countries, thi may requir an initi on the scale of the marshal plan involv sustain 
investment, new train models, program to eas worker transitions, incom support, and 
collabor between the public and privat sectors. 

achiev the benefit of deploy automation, such a product growth, while 
address it challenges, be not impossible. dure the transit out of agriculture, for 
example, the unit state make a major invest in expand secondari education,

today, while polici choic will vari by country, all societi will need to address four key 
area to smooth the loom workforc transitions: 

 maintain robust econom growth to support job creation. sustain robust 
aggreg demand growth be critic to support new job creation, a be support for 
new busi formation. fiscal and monetari polici that ensur suffici aggreg 
demand, a well a support for busi invest and innovation, will be essential. 
target initi in certain sector could also help, includ by increas invest 
in infrastructur and energi transitions, a well a polici to enabl a shift of unpaid 
household work such a childcar to the market, a discuss in our step-up scenario. 

 scale and reimagin job retrain and workforc skill development. provid 
job retrain and enabl individu to learn market new skill throughout their 
lifetim will be a critic challenge—and for some countries, the central challenge. 
midcar retrain will becom ever more import a the skill mix need for a 
success career changes. A rang of initi in countri from sweden to singapor 
may point the way to new approach to improv skill or teach new ones, includ 
to old workers. govern can play an import role here, a the US govern 
do in previou era with the GI bill, which enabl just under eight million veteran 
return from war to go to colleg or be retrained.21 program that can more quickli 
retool the labor forc by focu on re-train and credenti at the level of skill 
in demand rather than multi-year degre could be important. busi can take a 
lead in some areas, includ with on-the-job train and provid opportun to 
worker to upgrad their skills, both through in-hous train and partnership with 
educ providers. 

 improv busi and labor market dynam includ mobility. greater fluiditi 
will be need in the labor market to manag the difficult transit we anticipate. thi 
includ restor now-wan geograph mobil in advanc economi includ 
the unit states. digit talent platform and the rise of the “gig” economi can foster 
fluidity, by match worker and compani seek their skills, and by provid a 
plethora of new work opportun for those open to take them.22 polici maker 
in countri with rel inflex labor market can learn from other that have 
deregulated, such a germany, which transform it feder unemploy agenc into 
a power job-match entity. govern may also updat labor market regul 
to ensur that gig economi job be not subject to discrimination, and that remain 
uncertainti about worker benefit be resolved. 

 provid incom and transit support to workers. incom support and other 
form of transit assist to help displac worker find gain employ will 
be essential. beyond retraining, a rang of polici can help, includ unemploy 
insurance, public assist in find work, and portabl benefit that follow worker 
between jobs. We know from histori and from our analysi that wage for mani 
occup can be depress for some time dure workforc transitions. more 
perman polici to supplement work incom might be need to support aggreg 
demand and ensur societ fairness. possibl solut to supplement incomes, such 
a more comprehens minimum wage policies, univers basic income, or wage gain 
tie to productivity, be all be explored.

empir exploration,” the quarterli journal of economics, volum 18, number 4, novemb 2003. 

We analyz scenario for the net impact of autom 
and futur labor demand on employment, skills, and 
wages. most of them suggest that, while there will be 
enough work to maintain full employ in the long 
term, ensur that displac worker have the skill and 
support need to obtain the new job will be critical. 
If worker be not re-employ quickly, the impact on 
wage growth could be negative. thi conclus could 
overst or underst the impact. 

On the one hand, the futur disrupt could be small 
than we anticip for sever reasons: 

 adopt autom requir signific invest 
and redesign of busi processes, and compani 
have be slow to adopt digit technologies, let alon 
recent form of AI and automation.1 In our slowest 
autom adopt scenario, less than 5 percent of 
work be autom by 2030, so the overal impact on 
the economi could be minimal. 

 In our analysis, we make the strong assumpt that 
everi hour of work that be autom result in one 
hour less of work for a full-tim equival employee. 
but compani often choos to redefin occupations, 
or redeploy some worker instead. for instance, after 
the introduct of the atm, the number of bank teller 
in the unit state continu to grow for mani years, 
even a the activ they perform changed.2 

 our model of the seven catalyst of labor demand 
do not take into account dynam effect within the 
economy, and they repres onli a partial list of futur 
sourc of labor demand. If autom adopt be 
rapid, futur product growth could be high than 
we model, and thi could rais incom and result in 
more job creation than we anticipate. thi could offset 
the labor displacement, even dure the transition. 

On the other hand, the impact of autom on 
work could be more disrupt than we anticip for 
sever reasons: 

 the develop of autom technologies, 
includ ai, could acceler or break through new 
frontiers. AI research today say that machin 
learn have unlock more rapid improv in 
the technolog than could have be imagin even a 
few year ago. improv in machin capabl 

in area such a natur languag understand 
and gener could mean that more work might be 
autom more rapidli than we estim here. 

 while we assum that wage level will play a major 
role in determin autom adoption, compani 
may also adopt these technolog for other reasons, 
includ their capac to exceed human perform 
capabl in some areas. thi would mean more 
rapid autom adopt than we model, particularli 
in low-wag economi and for low-wag work in 
advanc economies. 

 displac worker might not find new work quickly, 
or at all, becaus they lack the skill or educ 
requirements, or becaus other barrier such a 
cultur prefer or geograph mobil stand 
in their way. there be few exampl of large-scal 
retrain and redeploy of midcar workers. 
moreover, labor market may not work a well a 
they need to do to help displac worker find 
new employment. 

 the assumpt we make on futur consumpt 
growth and spend on infrastructur and build 
might be too optimistic. In the past decade, actual 
gdp growth in nearli all advanc economi have 
be low than forecast. continu sluggish growth, 
rise geopolit tensions, or a new recess could 
make our futur job creation scenario too optimistic. 

A number of other caveat to our find should also be 
noted. We have not make assumpt in our model 
about sector trends, such a the growth of ecommerc 
in retailing, or the impact of fiscal constraint on public 
sector employment. We also do not model chang in 
work structure, such a the growth of the gig economy, 
or activ within an occup that could chang 
a a result of technolog innovation. our analysi of 
wage trend be base on current averag wage for each 
occup in each country, and we do not model wage 
over time by occup base on the dynam of labor 
suppli and demand. finally, we do not model chang 
skill requir for occup or analyz the “skill 
bias” of autom technologies, that is, whether they will 
enabl high-skil worker at the expens of low-skil ones, 
or vice-versa.3

We live in an age when machin answer custom inquiries, help doctor understand 
x-rays, lip-read good than human professionals, and sort trash into compost and 
recyclables—an age, too, when the public debat about autom and it impact on the 
workplac rais anxiou questions. first be the existenti one about the futur of work 
itself. given rapid advanc in technolog includ robot and artifici intelligence, will 
there be enough work to ensur full employment? second be the question about what those 
job will be, and which skill will be need for them. the third be what all thi could mean 
for wages. 

We seek to address these question in thi report through, first, an analysi of autom 
potenti and scenario about the extent of adopt of current work activ by 2030 
and, second, an analysi of potenti futur labor demand. We look at 46 countries, 
repres almost 90 percent of global gdp. To illustr the potenti impact at a countri 
level, we use six a exemplar of countri that vari by sector and occup mix, gdp per 
caput growth, wage rates, and demographics: china, germany, india, japan, mexico, and 
the unit states.23 

In thi chapter, we focu on automation’ potenti to transform the workplace. build 
on our previou autom work, we creat a rang for the number of hour that could be 
displac by autom by 2030, and seek to identifi the work activities, occupations, and 
sector that be most—and least—suscept to be autom (see box 1, “automation’ 
rapid advanc and it limitations—for now”).24 

among the find of our new research be that a much a 30 percent of the hour 
work global could be autom by 2030, depend on the speed of adoption, with 
15 percent of current work activ be autom in our midpoint scenario. the speed 
of adopt depend on factor includ technic feasibility, the pace of technolog 
development, costs, and social and regulatori acceptance. these result differ significantli 
by country, reflect the mix of activ current perform by worker and prevail 
wage rates, rang from 9 percent in india to 26 percent in japan in the midpoint adopt 
rate scenario.

autom can rais the product OF the global economi 
but will affect employment: A brief recap OF our prior research 
In our januari 2017 report, A futur that works: automation, employment, and productivity, 
we note that autom technolog such a advanc robot and artifici intellig 
be power driver of product and econom growth which can help creat econom 
surplu and increas overal societ prosperity. key find of that report include: 

 autom could acceler the product of the global economi by between 0.8 and 
1.4 percent of global gdp annually, assum that human labor replac by autom 
rejoin the workforc and be a product a it be in 2014. autom on it own will 
not be suffici to achiev long-term econom growth aspir across the world; 
for that, addit productivity-boost measur will be needed, includ rework 
busi process or develop new product and services. nonetheless, the 
product growth enabl by autom can ensur continu prosper in age 
nation and provid an addit boost to fast-grow ones.25 

 for companies, the deploy of autom can deliv benefit in the form of labor 
cost savings, but also in myriad other performance-enhanc ways. It can enabl firm 
to get closer to custom and predict mainten needs, sharpli reduc the cost of 
oper in some activ and extend the life of exist capit assets. autom 
can also increas scale and speed. nissan, for example, have halv the time it take 
to move from final product design to product thank to an autom system, while 
bmw have reduc machin downtim by 30 to 40 percent—effect gener fresh 
economi of scale with minim investment—through ai-en condition-bas 
maintenance.26 exhibit 1 compar the estim potenti perform and labor cost 
reduct benefit from autom for a number of key process within some sectors. 
these find be base on estim of potenti in case studi inform by our work 
with industry. 

 overall, our analysi suggest that roughli 50 percent of the time spent on activ 
that peopl be paid almost $15 trillion to do in the global economi have the theoret 
potenti to be autom by adapt current demonstr technology—in other 
words, the technic capabl alreadi exist, although an integr solut to 
autom each particular activ might not yet have be develop nor deployed. We 
estim the potenti for technolog to autom the more than 2,000 work activ 
in about 800 occup across the economy, by adapt current demonstr 
technologies. (we examin work activ individu rather than whole occupations, 
sinc occup consist of a rang of activ with differ potenti for automation). 
certain categori of activ be more suscept to autom than others.27 while 
less than 5 percent of occup can be fulli automated, about 60 percent have 
at least 30 percent of activ that can technic be autom (see illustration, 
“automation: A global forc that will transform economi and the workforce”). 

 our autom analysi found signific variat among sector of the economy, 
and among the occup within those sectors. for example, almost one-fifth of 
the time spent in US workplac involv predict physic activ and be preval 
in such sector a manufactur and retail trade. accordingly, these sector have a 
rel high technic potenti for autom by adapt current demonstr 
technologies. even within sectors, there be consider variation. In manufacturing, for

 technic feasibl be an essenti element of autom but four other factor also 
influenc the timing, which explain in part whi our overal analysi of autom 
adopt and the impact on employ to 2030 can vari among countries. the other 
factor be econom and social: the cost of develop and deploy autom 
solut for the workplace—that be actual develop integr solut for 
specif use cases; labor market dynam includ the supply, demand, and cost of 
human labor; the net econom benefit of automation, which includ perform 
benefit beyond labor substitut such a high throughput, rais productivity, and 
heighten safety; and regulatori and social acceptance. labor market dynam in 
particular play an import role in the nation variat around autom adoption, 
sinc wage rate vari wide by country, even for similar occupations. the rel cost 
of autom compar with the cost of labor will affect adoption: if qualifi worker 
be in abund suppli and significantli less expens than automation, thi could be 
a decis argument against autom in that situation. consequently, in the period 
to 2030, we expect advanc economies, with wage level that be rel higher, to 
adopt autom earli than mani emerg economies, especi if adopt requir 
expens hardwar solutions. that said, our autom model do consid the 
continu improv in autom technologies’ capabl over time, a well a

social factor affect the pace and extent of automation, describ above, the proport

for the six countri we use a exemplar in thi report, the hour that could be autom 
by 2030 in the midpoint adopt case rang from 26 percent of the hour work in 
japan to 9 percent in india (exhibit 3). develop countri germani (24 percent) and the 
unit state (23 percent) be not far behind japan, follow by china (16 percent) and 
mexico (13 percent). In general, wage rate be the big determin of the differ 
in autom scenario among countries; high wage rate make autom more 
econom attractive. In addition, the mix of activities, which be relat to the mix of sector 
and occupations, also affect the model rate of automation. among the main differ 
between emerg and advanc economi be the import of agricultur in the former. 
In germani and japan, manufactur also have high autom potential. that said, 
emerg economi could leverag autom technolog aggress in an effort to 
leapfrog their econom development. china, for example, have few robot per worker than 
the global average, but receiv nearli one-third of all robot shipment in 2016.28 

At the other extrem of the scenario we modeled, in our late adopt scenario, less than 
0.5 percent of work hour global will be autom by 2030, and advanc economi will 
account for the larg major of them.

could lead to strong variat in adopt rate among sector and countries. under these 
circumstances, what will be the futur of work? will the global economi creat enough 
addit job to offset those lose to automation, regardless of when adopt take place? 
and if so, what sort of job will those be, requir which skills, and pay what wages? In 
the next two chapters, we highlight find of our analysi of futur labor demand and the

for centuries, the arriv of new technolog in the workplac have spark workers’ fears— 
and, sometimes, violent backlash. alreadi in 1589, england’ queen elizabeth I refus to 
grant a patent to a stock frame invent by william lee becaus she be supposedli 
concern about the effect on hand knitters.29 In the earli 19th century, textil worker in 
britain and franc smash autom loom in their factori and printer struck to protest 
the arriv of steam-pow presses.30 

lead thinker in the past, from david ricardo to karl marx and john maynard keynes, 
rais concern about the effect of technolog chang on employment, and opinion poll 
show that anxieti have come to the fore again, amid rapid advanc in robot and artifici 
intelligence.31 A number of promin academ and technologist argu that the late 
wave of autom technologies, includ artifici intellig and machin learning, will 
be particularli disrupt to the workforce.32 

In thi chapter, we examin the histor impact of technolog on employment, skills, and 
wages. histori do not necessarili repeat itself, but it do provid valuabl context 
and possibl lesson for the futur of labor demand in a time of automation. among those 
lesson be that technolog innov in the past have enabl the creation of mani 
more new job than it have destroyed, rais productivity, spur sustain increas in 
live standards, and bring about a shift in the balanc of work and leisure. however, 
the transit have not alway be smooth: for example, real wage stagnat for nearli 
50 year in 19th centuri england dure the industri revolut there, and onli pick up 
again at a time of substanti social polici reforms. charl dicken among other novelist 
use the harsh realiti of everyday life for displac and other worker a materi for 
hi works. histori also show that robust aggreg demand and econom growth be 
essenti for job creation. new technolog have rais product growth, enabl firm 
to low price for consumers, pay high wages, or distribut profit to shareholders. thi 
stimul demand across the economy, boost job creation.

sinc the first industri revolut begin in england in the 18th century, the economi 
of europe, the unit states, and other countri have undergon two profound wave 
of structur change. mechan enabl a revolut in agricultur and in industry, 
prompt a migrat of worker from the countrysid to cities. A second structur shift 
have occur in the past 60 year a the share of manufactur employ have declin 
in some countri even a growth in servic sector accelerates.33 

the employ shift accompani thi process of structur transform have be 
veri large. In the unit states, for instance, the agricultur share of employ declin 
from 58 percent of total employ in 1850 to 2.5 percent of employ today (exhibit 5). 
In just 40 years, between 1880 and 1920, the share of agricultur employ declin 
25 percentag points. dure the same decades, other sector be be transform by 
mechan and electrif a well: the share of miner and household workers, for 
exampl maid and servants, also declined, although these shift affect few workers. 
sinc 1960, when the second wave of structur transform began, manufactur fell 
from 27 percent of total US employ to 9 percent today, a autom and global trade 
transform manufactur and a demand for servic exploded. 

the pattern be broadli similar in other countries, although there be some notabl 
differ in the pace. china’ shift sector mix in recent year have be especi rapid: 
agricultur employ fell a a share of total employ by 32 percentag point in just 
25 years, from 60 percent in 1990 to 28 percent in 2015.34 In mexico, the agricultur share 
of employ declin from 52 percent in 1960 to 13 percent in 2015, although in contrast 
with china, the declin have be gradual and continu across decades. In japan, 
agricultur employ declin from a 31 percent share of total employ in 1960 to 
3.5 percent in 2015, while manufacturing’ share of total employ drop from it peak 
in 1973 of 25 percent to 13 percent in 2015.

when we compar histor sector employ to potenti labor displac from our

displac from autom within specif sector be not unprecedented. for example, 
our analysi show that a number of sector in differ countries, includ agricultur

30 percent and more over a period of 15 years. our analysi of scenario of autom

technolog chang spark rise product and 
aggreg employ 
histori show that the adopt of technolog innov can act a a power stimulu 
on the economi and jobs. the overal effect of mechan have be to creat job on an 
unpreced scale. machin allow worker to produc more, therebi rais product 
and (eventually) wages, and lower the price of good for consumers. these twin effect 
unleash new demand for all good and services. In addition, a firm gain scale, they requir 
more managers, accountants, and other offic workers. 

thi dynam be the reason that aggreg employ have grown over the long term, 
even a the size of the workforc have grown. In the unit states, for example, femal 
employ almost doubl a a proport of working-ag woman from 32 percent in 
1950 to 60 percent in the late 1990 befor fall back to 57 percent today. yet thi major 
shift do not reduc overal employment. indeed, employ grew: the total number 
of peopl employ in the unit state more than doubl from 65 million in 1960 to 
152 million in 2017, accord to data from the US bureau of labor statistics. similar trend 
have occur in other countries. 

technolog enabl product growth, rais incomes, and stimul new 
consum demand 
evid of the economy-wid posit correl among technology, productivity, and 
employ can be see in the aggreg data across countries. within an industry, 
machin and autom can sometim contribut to employ declines. for instance, 
in the unit states, one recent studi found that everi industri robot deploy result in 
the reduct of six human worker within the surround metropolitan area.35 however, 
when look at the total economy, we see the opposit effect: rise product (often 
from technology) be usual accompani by employ growth, not decline. thi be 
becaus autom rais productivity, which in turn increas incom of worker and/or 
shareholders. higher incom be spent, creat demand for good and servic across 
the economy.36 

when there have be a tradeoff between employ growth and labor product 
growth, it have be short-lived. look at the unit state sinc 1960, for example, our 
analysi show that employ and product both grow in 79 percent of individu 
years, while product grow while employ declin in 12 percent of years. but 
both employ and product grow in 95 percent of roll three-year period and 
100 percent of roll 10-year periods. thi phenomenon be also see in other countries. 
In china, employ and product both increas in 77 percent of individu year 
but 98 percent of the 10-year period between 1960 and 2016. In germany, which saw 
unemploy rise after reunification, employ and product grow in 68 percent of 
individu year but 81 percent of roll 10-year period (exhibit 7).

not onli do technolog creat new occupations, it can also chang exist occup 
in unpredict ways. after atm be introduc in the unit states, for example, the 
number of bank teller actual rose, a bank compet to provid higher-qu servic 
to custom and the role of teller chang from dispens cash to provid broader 
advic and services. the reduct in the number of teller per branch enabl bank to 
open more branch and make retail bank more conveni for customers, which drove 
the demand for more tellers.40 from 1991 to 2007, the number of atm and teller in the 
unit state both increased. however, that trend revers a internet bank and the 
2008 financi crisi result in cutback in bank branch and tellers. 

To good understand the pattern of job creation and destruction, we conduct case 
studi of two technolog in the unit states—person comput and automobiles— 
to estim the number and type of job lose to the new technolog and the number of 
new job created. In both cases, our research reveal that while some work activ 
declined, sometim rapidly, new type of work activ be created. the net impact of 
both technolog be highli positive, creat new job that make up 10 percent of total 
employ over four decades. 

the person comput enabl the creation of 15.8 million net new job sinc 
1980, account for 10 percent of employ 
computer-rel industri such a comput and data process servic and comput 
and relat equip manufactur have be grow rapidli sinc the 1970s. microsoft 
and appl be found in that decade. laptop comput come on the market in the earli 
1980s, and thi centuri have see the rapid rise of smartphon and tablets. 

the growth of comput have gener signific employment: in the unit states, 
we estim that comput have enabl the net creation of 15.8 million job sinc 1970 
(exhibit 9). We arriv at thi figur by talli employ gain and loss in differ 
sector and occupations. We find that in total, we can identifi 3.5 million job destroy by 
the introduct of computers, includ those in typewrit manufacturing, secretari work, 
and bookkeeping. but at least 19.3 million be creat in a wide rang of occup 
and industries. 

when digit edit make it easi and more effici for author to type and then directli 
edit their own work, comput elimin the need for peopl special in edit 
and re-typ documents. employ for typist and secretari fell significantly, by 
1.4 million between 1990 and 2015, even a the overal US workforc grew. the number of 
bookkeep clerk also declined, by an annual averag of 3 percent in the same period, a 
account move from physic book to account software, result in nearli 900,000 
few jobs. 

but mani new job be also created. these includ job in the comput manufactur 
industri and supplier industri (such a semiconductors), a well a employ in 
occup enabl by comput (it system administrators, comput scientist in other 
industries), and in occup that use comput (custom servic call centers, which 
bare exist befor computers, and ecommerce). Of thi total, onli about 1 percent of net 
new job come directli from the comput manufactur industri and onli 3 percent come 
from supplier industries.

A larg share of employ gain have come in profess enabl by comput 
(18 percent of net employ created). thi includ the entir comput softwar and

employ three million peopl in the unit states, includ softwar and app developers, 
comput scientists, and manag and offic workers. 

becaus of the multitud of applic of the computer, over 75 percent of net

employ of comput scientist in finance, manufacturing, busi services, and 
other industri grow rapidly, by an annual averag of about 7 percent, between 1980 
and 2015. In the same period, employ of financi manag and specialist abl to

and survey researchers, and manag analysts. 

In theory, at least, mani inform analyst might have be replac by the rise of the 
internet, which make collect data and inform vastli more efficient, and comput 
that enabl rapid and complex computations. after all, much of their work in the 1980s, 
befor these technolog be widespread, have sinc be automated.1 

In fact, the opposit have happened. comput and the internet autom activ such 
a basic mathemat and inform gathering, yet the number of inform analyst 
soar nonetheless. As comput becom more efficient, the cost of obtain high-qual 
inform dropped. rather than decreas demand for analysts, thi stimul the 
appetit for more insight and low-cost analysis, and the number of analyst quintupl 
from around 400,000 in 1980 to about two million today (exhibit 10). 

the job of analyst have chang a well. with inform and data more easili

the automobile’ larg employ effect have be in enabl industri 
the introduct of the automobil creat 6.9 million net new job in the unit state 
between 1910 and 1950, base on our estimates.43 thi be equival to 11 percent of the 
US workforc in 1950. thi includ 7.5 million job created, and 623,000 job destroyed. 
worker displac by the automobil includ manufactur of wagons, carriages, 
har and saddles, and of railroad equip and carriages, a well a supplier 
industri such a hors breeder and metal work occupations, and enabl industri 
such a liveri servic and messag boys. 

ten time a mani job be creat in a host of new occupations. about 10 percent be 
within the auto manufactur industri (exhibit 11). three time a mani job be in the 
automot suppli chain, includ metal part manufacturers, warehous and logistics, 
and wholesalers. An even larg share of job be creat in enabl industri and 
occup that use the automobile. enabl industri includ auto dealerships, auto 
repair, ga stations, and conveni stores, and these account for around 30 percent of 
net new job created. util industries, meanwhile, includ transport and logist 
occupations, and account for about 25 percent of employ generated. 

If we have extend our analysi beyond 1950, we would have see the continu 
transform impact of the automobil on the economi and society. build of the US 
interst highway system begin in the 1950s, transform logist networks. thi in 
turn give rise to the concept of the “famili vacation,” long-haul car trip and demand for 
roadsid attractions, motels, and campgrounds. drive-in movi and restaurants, shop 
mall on the edg of towns, and park lot sprang up. the automobil also enabl 
growth in suburbs, a worker could commut to job from locat outsid urban public 
transport networks. 

the number OF hour work ha declined, while leisur time 
ha risen 
while past technolog disrupt do not reduc the amount of work avail to 
people, they nonetheless have one signific effect: a declin in the averag number of 
hour work per week—and convers an increas in the amount of leisur enjoy by 
individuals. alreadi in 1930, john maynard keyn predict the advent of great leisure: 
“for the first time sinc hi creation man will be face with hi real, hi perman problem— 
how to use hi freedom from press econom cares, how to occupi the leisure, 
which scienc and compound interest will have won for him, to live wise and agreeabl 
and well.”44 

In hindsight, keyn be right: the averag number of hour work each week by 
employ worker have declin significantli in the past 150 years, give worker more 
time for leisure. In 1870, worker in germany, sweden, and the unit state averag

that french peopl would work more if they could.46 sinc 1960, the total hour work have 
declin by 26 percent in germany, 8 percent in italy, and 7 percent in france. 

the declin in averag hour work also reflect the steadi rise of part-tim employ 
across countries. the high proport of part-tim work be in the netherland 
(39 percent of employ persons), the unit kingdom (24 percent), and germani and 
japan (22 percent).47 part-tim work be often prefer for a varieti of reason by students, 
caregivers, and peopl near retirement, but also by some employ in market where 
rigid labor market polici make full-tim hire econom unattractive. In the past 
decade, the number of peopl in the unit state and europ who earn money in the 
independ workforce—a freelancers, independ contractors, self-employed, and 
worker in the “gig” economy—ha grown, to an estim 162 million.48 mani of these 
individu work less than a full-tim schedule. 

As leisur time increases, peopl spend money on hobbies, entertainment, and other 
person services, give rise to entir new industri that in turn creat jobs. skiing, golfing,

dure the first industri revolut in england, the steam engin and other technolog 
increas the product of unskil worker and enabl them to undertak work 
previous carri out by higher-skill, and higher-paid, worker includ craftsman and 
artisans. across the economy, mechan rais output per worker. however, real 
wage stagnat for roughli 50 years, from 1790 until 1840 (exhibit 13). dure thi period, 
first note by economist friedrich engel in 1845, profit a a share of nation incom 
rise and the labor share of incom declined.50 after 1850, real wage begin rise in line 
with product increases, and by the late 1800 wage growth exceed product 
growth. but for nearli half a century, wage growth be nil and real live standard of 
worker declined. the plight of some worker provid materi for charl dickens’ bleak

decades—driven by autom and offshor in manufacturing, among other things—may 
have contribut to rise morbid rates.56 

whether the experi of technolog disrupt in the past be relev for economi in 
the futur can be debated. In chapter 4 of thi report, we present new analysi of the impact 
of autom today on the demand for differ type of skill and discu the potenti 
impact on wages. even if the particular of the histor experi turn out to differ from 
condit today, one lesson seem pertinent: although economi adjust to technolog 
shocks, the transit period be measur in decades, not years, and the rise prosper 
may not be share by all. 

autom today: could thi time BE different? 
despit the reassur lesson from histori on the long-run impact of autom on 
employment, some technolog expert argu that autom today will not behav like 
previou technolog waves. they cite a number of reason that the futur may bring more 
disrupt to worker than in the past, includ the abil of machin to perform work 
activ requir cognit capabilities, the rate of progress in new innovations, and a 
potenti futur in which machin teach themselv to improv at particular task without 
much human intervention.57 mani economists, however, tend to view autom a the 
next wave of technolog advanc and point out that an equilibrium between the 
suppli and demand of job in labor market have alway be reach historically, even if the 
transit period may be difficult.58 

In part, the discord between the two point of view may be caus by the lack of a common 
language: what exactli could be differ about autom compar with previou 
technologies? what time frame be we considering? In our research we look at a rang 
of argument on both side and examin the evid for both the scope of automation’ 
impact and it natur across multipl dimensions. thi framework be use for disentangl 
the differ element of technolog disrupt and assess the way in which today’ 
technolog may—or may not—hav a differ impact than in the past. 

We conclud that in mani respects, the impact of autom on employ today be 
not like to be differ than in the past, particularli if we look back centuries, to the first 
industri revolut in the late 1700s. but we have identifi two way in which automation, 
robotics, and AI could diverg from earli wave of technolog disruption: the speed at 
which scientif advanc be be made, if the acceler rate of progress in machin 
learn and AI continues, and the potenti to displac a high share of the workforc in 
a rel short period of time, particularli if the adopt of autom be rapid across 
multipl sector of the economy.

rate of technolog innov 
could be faster than the past 
In chapter 1 we note the rapid of recent technolog innov a a result of the 
develop of deep learn and reinforcement-learn techniqu base on neural 
networks; the avail of exponenti increas comput capac that be access 
to user via the cloud; and the sheer volum and varieti of data gener that can be 
use to train machin learn models. advoc of the argument that autom today be 
fundament differ in it scope point to thi acceler of innov a evid of a 
real break with the past. 

those who disagree, however, point to moore’ law, name for gordon moore, a co- 
founder of intel, who in 1965 note that the number of transistor incorpor in a 
comput chip would approxim doubl everi 24 months—which becom the basic 
busi model for the semiconductor industri for the follow decades.59 the shrink of 
transistor in semiconductor improv comput speed and capac and help usher 
in the internet era, a well a the mobil phone revolut and the cloud. however, the rate of 
progress in shrink transistor have slowed, and some scientist project that without a new 
comput model, futur advanc may run out. moreover, AI veteran point to previou 
era when what seem to be fast-mov advanc in AI give way to frustrat lulls. AI 
date back to the 1950s, when alan ture suggest that comput could commun 
a well a human and princeton student includ marvin minski and dean edmond 
built the first artifici neural network use 300 vacuum tube and a war-surplu gyropilot. 
after the initi excitement, fund slump in the 1970 a research backers—primarili 
the US government—tir of wait for practic AI applic and cut appropri for 
further work. anoth lull follow in the 1990s.60 

our view be that the recent technic advances, enabl machin to read lip or x-ray 
more profici than human experts, be inde remark and that if thi pace of 
innov continu rather than encount a new AI “winter,” the rate of autom 
innov could inde be faster than in the past. If so, the potenti disrupt of workforc 
model and displac of labor could be great than past technolog revolutions. 

rate of technolog adopt 
faster than 100 year ago, but no evid of acceler in recent decad 
even if technolog innov be occur more rapidly, the impact on worker 
will be differ onli if the diffus and adopt of new technolog also accelerates. 
some research say thi be the case, point to exampl such a landlin telephones, 
electrification, or the automobile. indeed, while it take almost a centuri for landlin phone 
to reach saturation, or the point at which new demand fall off, mobil phone in some 
market reach that point in just 20 year and smartphon in even less time.61 one 
commonli found refer be the speed with which certain onlin video on youtub or 
smartphon game such a angri bird or pokemon Go reach a certain threshold of 
downloads—50 million, 100 million, or more.62 base on measur of gross numbers, 
for example, of peopl adopt a technology, you could say that adopt rate have 
accelerated. however, it be also worth consid adopt rate when measur 
use percentages.

look at onli the last 60 years, our review of the histor rate of adopt of 25 previou 
technolog show that the time from commerci avail to 80 percent adopt have 
tend to fall within a rel constant range: between approxim eight and 28 years. 
for 50 percent adoption, the rang be five to 16 years. the technolog review date back 
to tv in the 1950s, and includ recent exampl of cell phones, custom relationship 
manag software, and lithium-ion cell batteries. thi rang of time for adopt be 
observ for both hardware-bas technolog that be capital-intens and requir 
physic installation; and technolog that be avail pure online. technolog with 
the fast adopt rate includ stents, airbags, mris, tv and onlin air booking, while 
slow adopt categori includ dishwash and pacemak from the 1960s, and 
cellphon in the 2000s. even highli popular and widely-us social medium applic do 
not achiev a high level of adopt faster than technolog in previou eras. facebook be 
one example: it be launch in 2004 and quickli achiev worldwid success. yet even 
by mid-2016, when it have about 1.7 billion user globally, it be still far from full adoption, 
even outsid china.63 moreover, it be not the first social network, and so the adopt 
period could be calcul a be even longer—sinc the advent of the first modern 
social network, six degrees, which launch in 1997, or classmates.com, which launch 
in 1995.64 

our view be thu that there be no evid that technolog adopt have yet acceler 
over the last 60 years, when measur in percentages, although, not surprisingly, diffus 
be faster than it be for technolog introduc in the earli 20th century. 

breadth of sector in which work can be autom 
not differ from the past 
some comment say that today’ autom be differ from the past becaus it have 
the potenti to transform work in multipl sector simultaneously. they argu that the 
larg technolog disrupt of the past have be the move out of agricultur or, more 
recently, from manufactur into services. advoc of the “thi time thing be different” 
argument point to the pervas of autom technolog a be different, in that 
they will affect multipl sector of the economy—from financ to retail to manufactur to 
transportation—simultaneously.65 

As point of comparison, one can consid the applic of some technolog in the 
past, such a electr or computers, which also transform work across multipl sector 
of the economi simultaneously. electrif transform household lighting, heating, 
and refrigeration; it enabl store and factori to open for longer hours; and it give birth 
to mass production. similarly, comput transform busi services, finance, and 
retail and give birth to the internet and mobil computing. the steam engin drove the 
industri revolution, upend numer sector from weav to printing, for example. 
between 1910 and 1950, success wave of innov also prove highli pervasive, from 
automobil to assembl lines. 

our view be that littl be new about the breadth of impact of autom technologies. 

share of job in the economi that be autom by 2030 
could be high than past technolog if adopt be rapid 
even if past technolog innov transform work in multipl sector of the economy, 
today’ autom could affect a larg share of work. propon of thi view point out 
that some sector employ shift have be extrem large—for example, the rapid 
transit out of agricultur employ in china, or the steep declin in US agricultur in

the 20th century. the potenti impact on demand for current work activ in some sector 
a a result of autom today could likewis be veri large. view over a 15-year period, 
our autom model suggest that roughli half of the exist work in countri such a 
germany, japan, and the unit state could be displac by 2030 if autom adopt 
be at the most rapid end of our modeling. In the past, also look at 15-year periods, our 
analysi show that a much a 30 percent of job be displac in histor episodes—in 
other words, low than our most rapid autom scenario but not of a complet differ 
order of magnitude. 

our view be thu that, if autom adopt be veri rapid, it could potenti displac a 
great percentag of work in some advanc economi in the next 15 year than we have 
see in the past. 

type and complex of task that can be autom 
everi wave of autom affect more complex task 
alongsid the scope of automation’ impact, it veri natur have spark discuss about 
differ between technolog chang today and in the past. one frequently-cit 
argument concern the type of task that AI in particular now can accomplish with prowess, 
from drive truck to creat music and art to play championship go. the power of 
algorithm to take on activ requir cognit capabl and creativ be held up a a 
fundament break with previou technologies.66 

skeptic point out, however, that thi be not the first time that machin have be abl 
to carri out task requir cognit capabilities. everi new wave of autom seem 
remark at the time. from the 1980s, with the birth of computer spreadsheets, 
machin have take on ever more sophist task that previous requir human 
brainpower, from manipul larg quantiti of data and alphabet list or do 
complex calcul to anticip the word your finger be about to type on a 
smartphone. while the task themselv have changed, our view be that the abil of 
machin to acquir such capabl be not in itself new. while signific progress have 
be make in specif “narrow” AI applications, formid multi-decade-long technolog 
challeng must still be overcom befor machin can match human perform across 
the rang of cognit activ and approach “artifici gener intelligence”—which would 
inde be a break with histor precedent. 

skill bia of technic chang 
today’ autom could complement both high- and low-skil worker 
technolog innov have affect worker in differ way in the past. As alreadi 
noted, the steam engin and other technolog introduc dure the industri revolut 
in europ and the unit state in the 19th centuri increas the product of unskil or 
low-skil worker and enabl them to undertak work previous carri out by high-skill, 
and higher-paid, worker includ artisan such a hand-loom weavers. In the academ 
literature, technolog chang be thu consid to be bia toward enabl low-skil 
worker at the expens of high-skil ones. 

In our era, the opposit have happened: comput and factory-floor robot have tend to 
increas the product and complement the work of high-skil workers, while machin 
have substitut for the programm and routin task that have be undertaken by 
low-skil workers, includ those work on assembl line or a switchboard operators.67 

66 see, for example, the interview with andrew Ng and neil jacobstein,”how artifici intellig will chang 
everything,” the wall street journal, march 6, 2017.

2. lesson from histori on technolog and employ mckinsey global institute52 

thi be know a skill-bias technic change. some economist view the effect of 
technolog chang and technology-en global in recent decad a a 
signific driver of inequality.68 

We do not have firm evid yet on whether autom today will tend to be more skill- 
bia or unskill-bias in it impact. our analysi of how autom will affect skills, 
detail in chapter 4, suggest that worker of all skill and educ level will be 
affected. some technolog might enabl lower-skil worker to replac higher-skil ones— 
such a nurs who can perform some of the more routin task of doctor with the aid of 
diagnost tools. other technolog will complement high-skil worker and enabl them 
to command even great power in the marketplace—for instanc surgic robot or AI 
algorithm that can suggest new invest strategies. 

impact on high-wag vs. low-wag work 
both will be affect 
A final dimens on which technolog chang could be differ today be it impact on 
worker at differ wage levels. one of the frequently-cit concern about autom 
be that machin could replac activ of high-wag job previous consid “safe,” 
includ expert in financi services, some type of doctors, and lawyers. 

while our analysi of automation’ impact on wages, also in chapter 4, suggest that a 
rang of high-wag occup could be affected, there be ampl histor preced 
for this, includ the hand-loom weaver in 19th-centuri england who suffer a steep 
declin in their livelihood after the arriv of mechan looms, which allow lower-wag 
and lower-skil worker to produc more cloth, faster, and less expensively.69 We therefor 
conclud that today’ autom be unlik to be differ from the past on thi dimension. 

••• 

In 1930, at the height of the great depression, john maynard keyn wrote, “we be 
suffering, not from the rheumat of old age, but from the growing-pain of over-rapid 
changes, from the pain of readjust between one econom period and another.” 
As mani do today, he saw the speed of technolog chang a someth formidable, 
an era of progress and invent incompar to ani that have come before—yet also a a 
time of pain transit for many. In the 1960s, a US nation commiss on technology, 
automation, and econom progress establish by presid lyndon B. johnson 
conclud that, “the basic fact be that technolog elimin jobs, not work. It be the 
continu oblig of econom polici to match increas in product potenti with 
increas in purchas power and demand. otherwise, the potenti creat by technic 
progress run to wast in idl capacity, unemployment, and deprivation.”70 the question 
for u today be whether, thi time, the transit will be larg and more pain than ever, 
and inde how demand for human labor will evolve. In thi chapter, we have describ 
the histor evid show that employ remain strong even in period of 
technolog ferment. In the follow chapters, we look at the trend that can creat 
demand for ten of million of new job in the global economi over the next decad and 
more, even a robot and AI increasingli make their way into our daili work lives, and what 
the implic will be for sectors, occupations, skills, and wages.

while autom will displac some worker and transform occupations, we also know that 
new and addit work will be creat in the next decad and beyond. what be less clear 
be how job growth net of autom will vari by occupation, and under what condit 
there will be enough new job to offset the work that be lose a robotics, artifici intelligence, 
and other technolog assum a great role in the workplace. predict all the job that 
will exist in the futur be an imposs task, yet even without a crystal ball, it be possibl to 
identifi some sourc of futur labor demand. 

In thi chapter, we discu two differ analysi that shed light on these questions. To 
understand some of the occup and type of job like to be in demand in 2030, we 
model seven specif global trend that we expect will be signific driver of job creation. 
To inform the impact of autom on aggreg employment, we conduct a second 
analysi use the mckinsey global growth model, which be a multi-countri macroeconom 
model. thi exercis allow u to model the dynam effect of autom on productivity, 
employment, and gdp growth in differ scenarios. autom have the potenti to rais 
product growth and gdp growth, but our analysi reveal that a key factor in whether 
thi will be achiev without larg advers effect on employ and wage be how quickli 
displac worker be reemploy in other jobs. 

both analysi reach broadli similar conclusions: although some worker will be displac 
by automation, other occup will grow. while in the long-term the economi can adjust 
to provid enough work for everyone, autom will prove challeng for ten of million of 
worker global who will need to switch occupations. depend on how societi manag 
thi transition, unemploy could rise in the medium-term and wage could be eroded. 
both the impact of autom and potenti new sourc of labor demand will play out 
differ from countri to country. 

seven global trend that will help shape the futur OF work 
In seek to identifi potenti sourc of labor demand to 2030, we start with a long list 
of trend and then priorit seven for deeper analysis, base on high-level initi estim 
of their potenti for job creation (see box 3, “our analysi of seven trend that will contribut 
to futur labor demand”). while there be mani scenario and sourc of potenti labor 
demand we have not included, the seven trend we focu on in thi report have the potenti 
to creat demand for hundr of million of worker global in the year to 2030, albeit 
with signific variat among countries. 

for each trend, we model both the direct impact on employ and the indirect impact. 
By direct jobs, we mean employ creat in a sector itself (for instance, increas 
spend on car would creat direct employ in the automobil manufactur sector). 
indirect refer to employ creat in all the sector that suppli good and servic to 
the direct sector (for automobiles, indirect sector would includ spare parts, paint, leather, 
etc.). We do not includ induc effects, sinc some be captur directli by our rise 
consumpt trend.

be displac by automation. size methodolog vari by trend; howev we 
captur direct and indirect job that could be creat from each of our seven 
catalysts, take into account the declin in hour work per person, and factor 
in global of work.1 

for each occup and sector, our increment labor demand net out 
autom and other product gains. We then compar that increment 
labor demand with the reduct in labor demand due to autom against 
a project 2030 baselin of employment. thi us the model we develop 
for our januari 2017 report on automation, which also model rang for the 
pace of technolog development, and for autom adoption.2 

As well a calcul direct and indirect labor demand from our select trends, 
we identifi key occup that will increase, and compar those with the 
occup in which work could declin a a result of automation. 

for three of the seven—invest in infrastructure, invest in buildings, 
and invest in renew energi and energi efficiency—w examin 
two scenarios: a “trendline” scenario in which spend follow the observ 
trend across countri and a “step-up” scenario, in which labor demand 
increas a a result of societ and polici choices. for a fourth trend, 
the increas shift to market of servic that be long do without 
remuneration, we onli examin a step-up scenario that assum rise femal 
particip in the workforce. 

our analysi offer a static view of the potenti labor demand that could 
be creat from the seven trend and do not factor in supply-demand 
dynam and feedback from factor such a chang in wage levels. (for 
a more dynam view, we use the mckinsey global growth model, a we 
discu late in thi chapter). the labor demand that our seven trend could

on the choic and invest make by businesses, policy-makers, and 
workers. the scenario we construct do not take into account ani sourc 
of labor demand outsid of our seven trends. We do not model entir new 
industries, occupations, and activ that could be invent in the future, in 
part enabl by technology; one studi suggest that on average, 0.5 percent 
of the workforc have be work in “new jobs” per year.3 We do not take into 
account sector shift in industri that be not directli relat to autom 
or these seven trends, such a the rise of e-commerc in retail. We also do not 
model chang in work structure, such a the growth of the gig economy, or 
activ within an occup that could chang a a result of technolog 
innovation. A more detail discuss of our methodolog can be found in the 
technic appendix.

rise incom in emerg economi will creat large-scal new labor 
demand a spend increas on consum goods, health care, and educ 
rise gdp per caput gener high spend on consum good and services, health 
care, and education, especi in emerg economies, and be the larg driver of labor 
demand we have identifi (exhibit 14). prior mgi research have found that rise per caput 
consumpt will gener about three-quart of global consumpt growth in the period 
from 2015 to 2030, with popul growth account for the remain 25 percent.71 the 
expand consum class in emerg economi will drive most of thi increase. As 
incom rise, consum will spend disproport more on discretionari good and 
servic such a automobiles, leisure, and accommod and food services, but they will 
also increas their non-discretionari spend on essenti such a food and clothing.72 
We estim that thi high consum expenditur could creat between about 250 million 
and 280 million new full-tim equival jobs, net of automation, across the 46 countri in 
our model. the growth due to rise incom can mitig automation’ expect toll on 
worker in retail and accommod and food services; retail salespeople, food prepar 
workers, and waiter see some of the larg boost from high consum spending. 

while thi spend will creat labor demand local in sector such a manufacturing, 
retail, accommod and food services, a well a person services, it will also creat 
labor demand in other countri that export good and servic to these countries. We 
assum that a proport of demand for tradabl good such a apparel and furnish will 
continu to be serv by countri rich in natur resourc or with strong manufactur or 
servic sectors. for the purpos of simplifi our modeling, we assum current share of 
global export to remain constant; our model assum that a countri such a germani will 
continu to serv it 2014 share of 18.5 percent of all automot export in 2030.73 

higher gdp per caput be also gener correl with high expenditur in health care 
and education. access to health care, defin a the number of care provid (such a 
physicians) per capita, could increase, especi in fast-grow emerg economi such 
a india that current have poor access to health care. We estim that great access to 
health-car provid alon at all levels, includ physician and medic assistants, could 
increas labor demand by 26 million to 43 million job (64 percent direct job in health-car 
provis and 36 percent indirect job in other sectors).74 demand for health-car provid 
could increas the most in develop countri such a india and china with the high 
econom growth, although thi may be conting on the necessari provis of fund for 
health care by govern and consumers.

In education, a with health care, econom develop typic rais expenditures, 
with a rise in gross enrol rates, particularli at secondari and tertiari levels, and fall 
student-teach ratio a qualiti improves. our analysi suggest that these continu 
improv could creat demand for up to 37 million job (78 percent direct job in the 
educ sector and 22 percent indirect job in other sectors) global by 2030, especi 
in fast-grow emerg economies. We compar gross enrol rate and student- 
teacher ratio of student in primari educ and conduct regress analysi against 
gdp per capita. use demograph project to estim the number of student by 
countri in 2030, we use our project for gross enrol rate and student-teach 
ratio to infer the potenti labor demand for teacher and support staff across each 
educ level. 

educ a a creator of labor demand be most import for countri such a india, 
which have low enrol rates, particularli at secondari and tertiari levels, high student- 
teacher ratios, and high gdp per caput growth. In other countri includ china, where 
demograph trend be like to have a small impact on labor demand in primari and 
tertiari education, increas in gross enrol rate for secondari educ and 
decreas student-to-teach ratio could impli an overal posit impact on labor demand 
in educ on an aggreg level. In advanc economi with age populations, such a 
germani and japan, there will be limit increas in labor demand from educ a the 
rel share of student in the overal popul declines. however, a with health care, 
the creation of these job would depend on the alloc of suffici fund from public, 
private, and philanthrop sectors. 

the global trend of age popul will creat new and addit labor 
demand for health care 
the global popul be continu to rise and will like reach 8.5 billion peopl by 2030.75 At 
the same time, the popul in mani countries, both develop and developing, be aging: 
by 2030, there will be at least 300 million more peopl age 65 and abov than there be in 
2014.76 the age trend be particularli acut in countri such a china, germany, italy, and 
japan; by 2030, about 25 percent of their popul will be over 65, if current fertil rate 
and immigr trend continue. thi age trend be less signific in develop countri 
with young popul such a india and nigeria, which be experi a demograph 
dividend, but it be also not restrict to advanc countri and china. brazil, for example, 
also have an age population.77 

As peopl age, their need and spend pattern change—in particular, spend on health 
care. for example, spend on hospit care for an 85-year-old american be more than five 
time high than for those 19 to 44 year old.78 We estim that shift in demograph 
could creat increment demand for 51 million to 83 million worker global (55 percent 
direct and 45 percent indirect), especi for health care occup that focu on take 
care of the elderly, such a home health aides, person care aides, nurs assistants, and 
so on.79 (a with all the estim of increment labor demand in thi chapter, thi figur be 
net of automation, which will displac work includ in health care, accord to our model). 
In countri with age popul such a japan or china, our model suggest that age 
and relat health-car need could drive the creation of between 10 and 15 percent of net 
new labor demand.

technolog develop and deploy will creat addit employ 
As technolog develop continu apace, the technolog sector be expect to keep 
grow rapidly, and thi in turn will creat increment labor demand to develop and deploy 
technology. the scale of thi employ will be modest, however. today, an estim 
2.9 million peopl be employ in the US high tech sector, but thi be onli 1.9 percent of the 
workforce. In germany, about 2.4 percent of the workforc be in a high-tech occupation. 

higher consum spend on technolog product and services, which typic rise 
a incom increase, and larg outlay by busi that adopt technolog to improv 
product and improv output a they grow, be drive the increas spend on 
software, hardware, and services. We model consum and enterpris technolog 
spend per caput with rise gdp per caput across countri in 2014. assum that 
the correl holds, we estim that by 2030 technolog spend could increas by 
$1.7 trillion to $2 trillion of which about 70 percent would be on inform technolog 
(it) services. thi includ hardware/softwar support, outsourcing, IT consulting, 
implementation, and intern IT services.80 thi increas spend on technolog will 
creat demand for 20 million to 46 million increment worker (55 percent direct and 
45 percent indirect) globally, net of automation. they will be a mix of high-skil worker such 
a softwar engin and electr engin a well a medium-skil worker includ 
web develop and electron technicians. while IT servic job such a comput 
support specialist will remain larg local, demand for technolog hardwar and especi 
softwar will like be serv by the global players, for exampl china, germany, india, the 
netherlands, and the unit states. more than half of all global tech job could be creat 
in these five countries. Of these, the larg demand will like land in china and india, with 
up to 13 million and six million job respectively. both larg economi be expect to go 
through signific digit in the next decad and beyond. 

invest in infrastructur and build can creat new labor demand, 
particularli in our step-up scenario 
infrastructur and build be two area of histor underspend that may creat 
signific addit labor demand if action be take to bridg infrastructur gap and 
overcom hous shortages. We model two scenarios: one in which annual invest 
follow the observ trend across countri and one in which signific addit 
invest be make to fill gap in infrastructur and real estate. 

global infrastructur system have not kept up with demand and hous shortag persist 
in mani countries. In critic area of infrastructur such a transportation, water treatment, 
and power grids, year of neglect be catch up with countri around the world. mgi 
have found that, from 2016 to 2030, the world need to invest about 3.8 percent of gdp in 
econom infrastructure, or an averag of $3.3 trillion per year, just to support expect 
rate of growth, with emerg economi account for some 60 percent of that.81 In real 
estate, a mani a 330 million urban household in emerg and advanc economi live 
in substandard hous or be financi stretch by hous costs.82

under our trendlin scenario, in which invest in infrastructur and build continu 
to follow pattern we have observ across countries, we note that spend on both of 
these increas a countri develop economically. thus, if countri be to increas their 
spend on the current trajectori a they develop, our model show that up to 53 million 
gross new job could be creat by continu spend on buildings, and up to 34 million 
on infrastructure. yet consider more could be do than match the invest level 
of other countries. ani addit effort would consequ stimul increas labor 
demand, especi for middle-wag job that will otherwis be particularli affect by 
autom in some advanc economies. 

In our step-up scenario, we assum that the infrastructur gap have be closed, and that 
infrastructur and build spend in 2030 be subsequ high to sustain thi high 
level of infrastructur stock and investment. We use infrastructur stock averag across 
countri and real estat stock averag in the unit state a a proport of gdp to 
estim the infrastructur and hous invest need in 2030 to keep pace with 
project econom growth. 

thi increas spend could creat demand for an increment 76 million to 134 million 
worker from add invest in build structur and 38 million to 72 million 
increment worker from add invest in infrastructure. As with health care and 
education, the creation of those job will depend on the alloc of necessari invest 
by the privat and public sector. about 30 to 40 percent of thi labor demand could 
come from india, which have current under-invest in infrastructure, be go through 
a process of large-scal urbanization, and would need to invest a signific amount to 
keep pace with an ambiti target of 6.5 percent annual growth in gdp until 2030. the 
current unproduct natur of the construct sector in some emerg economi 
such a nigeria and indonesia, coupl with low wage rate that may slow the adopt of 
autom technologies, contribut to the labor-intens of thi sector. china have alreadi 
make signific invest in infrastructur over the past decad and our model show 
that it may not need a much increment invest in 2030. develop economi 
includ the unit state and germani could also invest in build new and repair 
or re-build exist infrastructure, creat addit employ opportun in the 
construct sector, particularli for middle-wag jobs. 

invest in renew energi and energi effici 
We similarli model two scenario of labor demand for invest in new energi sourc 
and improv energi efficiency, depend on whether spend follow current trend or 
be accelerated. the energi landscap be shift rapidli a the cost of renew energies, 
such a wind and solar, fall sharply. A rang of new technologies, from smart electr 
meter to internet of thing sensor in oil rig and advanc leach techniqu in mines, 
be transform both the product and the consumpt of resources.83 the global polici 
environ for energi have be shifting: with the conclus of the pari agreement in 
decemb 2016, countri around the world pledg to take measur that would keep the 
global temperatur rise thi centuri below two degre celsiu abov pre-industri levels.84 
the intern energi agenc estim in 2015 that to reach thi goal could take up to 
$16.5 trillion of invest by 2030, includ increas the share of renew and by 
make buildings, transportation, and technolog more energi efficient.

84 while the unit state have announc it will withdraw from the pari agreement, mani other signatori 

countri and even local govern in the unit state have say they will continu to support it and meet 
the emiss reduct target that it established.

govern includ those in india and china be alreadi spend more heavili on 
renew energi and climat adapt measures. india, for instance, have announc 
it intent to increas it share of renew power to a much a 40 percent by 2030.85 
overall, our model indic that move to renew energi and rais energi 
effici at current trend could contribut up to seven million new job global in 2030, 
under our trendlin scenario, and an addit four million to seven million under our 
step-up scenario. (these job be increment to the increas in employ in the power 
sector driven by gdp per caput growth, which be model in our rise incom driver 
discuss above.) 

In the transit to new energi sources, we model the potenti job creation a countri 
shift their capac mix for electr generation. make these transit will requir 
signific invest in manufacturing, construction, and oper and mainten 
of solar panels, wind turbines, and other equipment. shift in capac mix creat job in 
two ways. first, larg amount of fix invest be need to increas the capac 
for the grow new energi source, creat job in manufacturing, construction, and 
installation. second, job may also be creat in the decreas energi sourc through 
decommiss of fossil fuel and other gener facilities, a some countri decid to 
shut down nuclear plants. job associ with the ongo oper and mainten 
of electr gener be larg variabl with capacity, so job level here will depend on 
rel labor intens of oper and mainten between energi types. renew 
manufactur be enjoy a remark period of product growth—across three 
lead renew manufacturers, employe declin by 65 percent on averag per 
gigawatt ship in 2010 to 2014. If these product gain continu at an aggress rate, 
renew manufactur be like to be a compar less labor-intens part of the 
renew value-chain. 

To attain the intern goal of avoid a rise of more than two degre celsius, the un’ 
intergovernment panel on climat chang have calcul that co2 concentr in the 
earth’ atmospher need to be stabil at 450 part per million. that will requir target 
polici choices, includ acceler transit to renew and increas spend 
on energi effici measures, both in industri and in housing. thi in turn could have a 
signific impact on job creation. In our step-up scenario, use data from mckinsey & 
company’ energi insights, we model a more ambiti shift into renew and high 
invest in energi efficiency, which would creat an addit four million to seven million 
job globally.86 high product and further autom potenti in energi reduc the 
opportun for energi to have a transform impact on the job stori in mani countries; 
in the unit states, less than 1 percent of all full-tim equival in 2014 be in util 
and mining. but major invest in renew energi will be crucial to meet global 
climat chang goals, which could creat middle-wag job along the way. 

“marketization” of unpaid work could creat new job 
today, much work do in households—from childcar to cook and cleaning—i unpaid 
and disproportion perform by women. At least some of thi work could be shift 
to paid employ through daycar or pre-kindergarten school program and senior 
care programs. rise femal labor particip rate could be one way to prompt thi shift, 
which economist call “marketization”; social decis to expand government-support 
program could be anoth (and those program in turn might enabl high femal labor 
forc participation). In recent years, we have see the rise of digit “share economy”

increas demand. academ research have found that such platform result in an increas 
in employ in the industry, both for tradit worker provid those servic and for 
the newli self-employ worker on the platform.87 the market of previous unpaid 
housework be alreadi preval in some advanc economies, especi in urban areas. 
for example, more than 90 percent of three-year-old be enrol in preschool in franc 
and sweden, most of which be fund by the government. In comparison, the rate be about 
70 percent in the unit state and less than 15 percent in india.88 

shift unpaid housework and childcar to paid employ could boost the number of 
woman in the workforc globally, if govern decid to invest in these area (such a by 
provid univers preschool and paid famili leave). women current account for half of the 
world’ working-ag popul but gener onli 37 percent of global gdp, and in some 
region of the world—includ india, other part of south asia, the middl east and north 
africa—their contribut to region output be consider low still. At the same time, 
about 75 percent of the world’ total unpaid care be undertaken by women, includ the vital 
task that keep household functioning, such a childcare, care for the elderly, cooking, 
and cleaning. thi unpaid work amount to a much a $10 trillion of output per year, 
roughli equival to 13 percent of global gdp.89 In our analysis, we observ the averag 
amount of unpaid time current spent on childcare, adult care, cooking, and clean 
use time use surveys. As these unpaid activ hour move to the marketplace, we expect 
labor demand to increas for them. while product gain will reduc the net number of 
hour worked, we estim that between 51 million and 89 million increment job global 
could be creat from thi step-up scenario of shift current unpaid domest work to 
paid employment. 

job OF the future: impact OF new labor demand vs. autom 
the seven trend we select for our analysi provid u with indic about type of 
occup that will be in demand to 2030, even net of autom of activ within those 
occupations. At the same time, our autom model highlight occup that could 
decline, if the current activ within those occup that be autom be not replac 
by other activities. the pattern differ among countries. one of the key differenti factor 
be wage rates, sinc our model assum that autom adopt will gener be more 
rapid in countri such a germani and japan, with rel high wages, than in india, 
china, or mexico, where wage be lower. but there be also differ among emerg 
economi depend on whether popul be age and the occup mix across 
sectors, among other factors.

advanc economi have a similar pattern of job growth and declin 
In advanc economies, we identifi six broad group of occup that will experi 
growth in labor demand from our trends, although the size of the increas will depend on 
countri and on scenario. for example, in our step-up scenario, the demand for builder and 
construct worker rise consider (exhibit 16). worker in occup in the follow 
group spend consider time on work activ that be among the least suscept to 
autom base on our analysis, a they requir human capabl includ social and 
emot interaction, higher-level logic reasoning, creativity, and applic of expertis 
that machin for now be less capabl of accomplishing. the occup group that 
gener grow a a result of our drivers, even net of automation, are: 

 care providers: that is, doctors, nurses, home health aid and other in care 
occup who will be in great demand a a result of rise health-car spending, 
both from increas prosper and from aging. given the disproportion cost of health 
care for the elderly, age be expect to be the predomin driver of increas health- 
care employment. countri with age popul such a japan and china will see 
a sharp increas in occup that work close with seniors, for exampl nurses, 
nurs assistants, person care aides, and home health aides. 

 professionals, defin a white-collar occup that requir academ train and 
expertis in a specif industri or function area. these includ accountants, engineers, 
and scientists. most of these occup cut across a wide rang of sectors. while 
gener less automat than other job types, certain support occup such a 
paraleg and scientif technician may face high automation. 

 technolog professionals. technolog expert will be in continu demand 
everywher a autom be increasingli adopted, although the total number remain

such a comput scientist and softwar developers, who typic have colleg 
educations, but also occup such a web develop and electron technicians, 
which onli requir a secondari education. that said, mani of these latter occup 
involv activ that be more automat than technolog worker with high level 
of education. 

 builders. In thi categori we have includ architects, surveyors, and cartographers, 
a well a construct occup and mainten and repair workers, such a 
construct laborers, electricians, carpenters, and plumbers. even though construct 
labor primarili do physic work, their activ be mostli in unpredict settings,

worker and earli childhood educ will also grow under our step-up scenario in 
which more childcar be shift to paid providers. 

 “creatives”: rise incom in emerg economi will creat more demand for leisur

entertainers, although the total number will remain rel small.

3. job gained: scenario for employ growth mckinsey global institute68 

By contrast, our analysi suggest that, in advanc economies, other occup will 
see a net declin by 2030, with more work autom than creat by our seven trends, 
assum they do not add non-autom activities. these include: 

 some custom interact jobs, includ hotel workers, travel agents, entertain 
attendants, and cafeteria workers. 

 offic support jobs, includ inform clerks, payrol processors, and 
administr assistants. 

 job carri out in predict settings. these be among the most suscept 
to autom and includ factori workers, materi move machin operators, 
transport workers, and instal and repair workers. 

It be import to note that even occup that may have a net declin due to autom 
will not disappear: rather, their number could shrink from today’ level in the next 15 years. 
for instance, even though some of the current activ of food prepar and serv 
worker could be autom (for example, by order kiosk in fast food restaurants), and 
about one-fifth of their hour work could be autom under our midpoint adopt 
scenario, there could still be demand in the unit state for more than three million of them. 

develop countri see net job growth in nearli all occup group 
the pictur be rather differ in rapidli grow and low-incom countri such a india, 
where we see net job growth in nearli everi occup category. thi be for two reasons: 
low wage mean delay adopt of automation, and rel high gdp growth creat 
job across the economy, includ in predict environ that be among the most 
affect in advanc economies. for example, product worker would rise 34 percent in 
india under our step-up scenario, compar with a 28 percent declin in the unit state 
and a 56 percent drop in japan. 

middle-incom countri such a china and mexico also have net job growth in a rang 
of occup under our scenario that in advanc economi experi declines. 
thi be the case with the categori of worker who be primarili engag in custom 
interaction, such a entertain attendants, and food-servic workers. these type 
of occup will remain in high demand in emerg economi includ china, a a 
result of rise consumpt from an increasingli prosper consum class. however, in 
mexico, the potenti growth be not a larg a in india, reflect the low gdp growth and 
high wages. 

will there BE enough work IN the future? 
the public debat in mani countri over autom can quickli focu on the existenti 
question of whether there will be enough job for worker in a futur mark by automation. 
We can see from histori that such fear have so far be unfounded: over time, labor 
market have adjust to chang in demand for worker from technolog disruptions, 
although in some era real wage have remain depress for some time. We address 
thi question of whether there will be enough work in the futur through two differ but 
complementari set of analyses. the first be base on our model of new and addit labor 
demand and autom describ above, use the select trend we have identified, and 
provid onli a partial view. for the other analysis, we use a macroeconom model of the 
economi that incorpor the dynam interact among variou factors.

both analysi point in the direct that, in most scenarios, there can be enough new job 
creation to offset the impact of automation. but a larg challeng will be ensur that 
worker have the skill and support need to transit to new jobs. countri that fail to 
enabl and smooth these transit could see rise unemploy and depress wages. 

outcom will vari significantli by country, depend on four factor 
We find a signific differ of like outcom among countries, with four factor larg 
influenc the extent to which enough new job will be creat to offset those displac by 
automation. the four factor are: 

 wage levels. advanc economi will like adopt autom in the workplac earli 
and faster than emerg economi sinc their wage be rel higher, make the 
busi case for autom stronger. (our model assum that autom begin to 
be adopt onli when it cost reach pariti with the cost of human labor). advanc 
economi will therefor like see the larg impact from autom in the next 
15 years. 

 demand growth. econom growth be essenti for job creation. while it may sound 
obvious, economi that be stagnant or grow onli slowli creat few, if any, net new 
jobs. countri with the most rapid gdp growth rate per caput will have high growth 
rate of consumpt and spending, thu stimul great proport increas in 
labor demand. slower-grow economi will creat job at a slow rate. advanc 
economi have much low project rate of gdp growth than develop countries, 
reflect age workforc and also less rapid product growth. develop countri 
such a india and china be project to have much high gdp per caput growth rates, 
which will contribut to job creation. furthermore, innov and entrepreneurship often 
underli the creation of new busi model and work activities, anoth catalyst of 
job growth. 

 demographics. the outcom of autom and futur labor demand will play out 
veri differ in countri with a young and rapidly-grow population, such a india, 
compar with countri that have a shrink popul and workforce, such a 
japan. countri with a grow workforc have a potenti “demograph dividend” that 
will lift growth. however, rapid growth of the popul will bring million more young 
peopl into the workforce, creat consider pressur to expand formal employ 
opportunities. while the impact of autom will be less, give low wage rate in 
these countries, autom will make thi alreadi consider challeng more difficult. 
In germani and japan, by comparison, age be reduc the working-ag population, 
which reduc the need for econom growth and the potenti impact of automation. 

 mix of econom sectors. the autom potenti of nation economi differ 
among countri depend on the structur of their economi and, within the 
economi a a whole, on the mix of sectors, occupations, and their constitu work 
activities. japan, for example, have a high autom potenti than the unit 
state becaus the weight of certain sector that be highli automatable, such a 
manufacturing, be high in japan; 17 percent of job in japan be in the manufactur 
sector compar with 9 percent in the unit states. and within the manufactur 
sector itself, japan be more suscept to autom becaus a larg proport of the 
job involv task that can be more easili automated, such a production. 



3. job gained: scenario for employ growth mckinsey global institute70 

these factor combin to creat differ outlook for the futur of work in each country. In 
general, countri with similar characterist across these four factor could see broadli 
similar outcom from autom adoption, albeit with nuanc for cultur and other 
differences. some cluster be apparent. for example, develop countri with age 
popul and high wage that will acceler autom adoption—such a germany, 
italy, and japan—could follow a similar trajectory, a will develop countri with young 
populations, such a canada, france, sweden, the unit kingdom, and the unit 
states. across the middl east, countri such a kuwait, saudi arabia, and the unit 
arab emir share similar on demograph and autom adopt and, to a lesser 
extent, on gdp per capita. develop countri with the young populations, includ 
egypt, kenya, and nigeria, will face similar challeng to grow aggreg demand, give 
their fast-grow workforce. 

our scenario of new and addit labor demand, net of automation, while 
incomplete, suggest ampl job creation to 2030 
We compar the number of job creat by the seven select trend identifi abov with 
the number of job expect to be displac by automation. We be consciou that thi 
exercis paint an incomplet picture. while our seven trend model the major sourc of 
new labor demand, they do not account for induc job demand creation nor the creation 
of novel work activ and occupations. one research studi have found that, each year, 
roughli 0.5 percent of the US labor forc be employ in an occup that do not exist 
in the prior year—in other words, perform an entir new set or combin of work 
activities. By 2030, thi would impli that 9 percent of the US labor forc could be employ 
in occup that do not exist today.90 just a mani occup today, such a search 
engin optimization, app designers, and websit designers, would have be imposs 
to imagin in the pre-internet era, we cannot forese the new occup that will aris in 
the future. 

In order to address the question, “will there be enough work in the future?,” we compar the 
net effect of job displac by automation, job creat by the seven trends, the creation 
of new work and other unsiz labor demand, and demograph chang in labor forc 
size. even limit our estim of new and addit job creation to the select factor 
that we model, we find that our focu countri could gener enough labor demand to 
offset the impact of autom and take into account chang in the size of labor forces.91 
nevertheless, our model from the seven trend indic that the transit toward 2030 
look quit differ depend on the countri (see exhibit 17). 

for instance, japan be rich but project to grow slowli to 2030. It face the combin of 
slow job creation come from econom expans and a larg share of work that can be 
autom a a result of high wage and the structur of it economy. however, japan will 
also see it workforc shrink by 2030 by four million people. In the step-up scenario, and 
consid the job in new occup we cannot envis today, japan’ net chang in 
job could be roughli in balance.

like japan, the unit state and germani also face signific workforc displac 
from autom by 2030, but their project futur growth—and henc new job creation— 
be higher. however, the unit state have a grow workforce. In the step-up scenario, and 
consid new occup that may arise, it be roughli in balance. germany’ workforc 
will declin by three million by 2030, and it will have more than enough labor demand to 
employ all workers. 

At the other extrem be india: a fast-grow develop countri with rel modest 
potenti for autom over the next 15 years, reflect low wage rates. our analysi 
find that most occup categori be project to grow in india, reflect it strong 
econom expansion. however, india’ labor forc be expect to grow by 138 million 
peopl by 2030, or about 30 percent. employ these new entrant in formal sector job 
will requir job creation on a much larg scale than in the past. autom will make 
thi challeng more difficult; some fear “jobless growth” will make the challeng greater. 
however, our analysi suggest that india can creat enough new job to offset autom 
and employ new entrants, for exampl by undertak the invest in our step- 
up scenario. 

china and mexico have high wage than india, and so be like to see more automation. 
china still enjoy robust econom growth and will have a shrink workforce; like germany, 
china’ problem could be a shortag of workers. given net job creation a well a declin 
labor forces, china and germani may need to explor differ option such a acceler 
autom adopt or immigr in order to fulfil the expect creation of grow futur 
labor demand. mexico’ rate of futur econom expans be more modest than china’s, 
and it workforc will grow by 15 million by 2030. like the unit state and japan, our 
result suggest that mexico may need the extra job creation from the step-up scenario plu 
innov in new occup to make full use of it workforce. 

our macroeconom model highlight the critic import of rapid 
reemploy of worker displac by autom 
the analysi of net job creation give expect autom rate and the seven trend be an 
inform but incomplet exercise, even after adjust for labor suppli chang and the 
creation of new occupations. thi be becaus the analysi abov do not take into account 
dynam interact among the trends, such a the impact of autom invest and 
automation-rel unemploy on gdp growth rate or economy-wid averag wage 
rates. thus, to develop a perspect on the potenti net impact of autom and job 
creation potenti of the economy, we use a gener equilibrium model in order to triangul 
our result with the analysi from the seven trend (see box 4, “model the econom 
impact of automation”). 

the overal result of the gener equilibrium model be the same a the result from the seven 
trends: it show that labor market will gener be flexibl enough to absorb the worker 
displac by automation. furthermore, like the outcom of the analysi from the seven 
trends, differ aris between countri in the expect transit toward 2030. the 
gener equilibrium model point toward a strong distinct in the expect transit 
between the advanc economi and the emerg economi we focu on in thi report. 



73job lost, job gained: workforc transit in a time of automationmckinsey global institut 

In advanc economies, all scenario result in full employ by 2030, but the 
transit may includ a period of high unemploy and wage adjust 
for the three advanc economi we focu on in thi report—germany, japan, and 
the unit states—economi be flexibl enough to absorb most if not all the displac 
worker by 2030 in all reemploy scenarios. the pace at which displac worker be 
reemploy be critical: low reemploy lead to high medium-term unemployment, 
while in the high reemploy scenario, the labor displac by autom will be 
reemploy fast enough such that the unemploy rate do not rise (exhibit 18). 

autom will also have a wage impact. our model result in a temporari increas 
in wage in all reemploy scenario becaus of increas product a a result of 
automation. but, a with the unemploy rate, wage will also depend on the pace of 
reemployment. In the low reemploy scenarios, wage fall in the long-run in respons 
to high medium-term unemployment. thi lead to a low labor share of income, a 
the gain of autom in thi scenario primarili accru to capit owners, not laborers. 
conversely, in the high reemploy scenario, wage growth be expect to persist, 
and thu the decades-long trend of declin labor share of incom slow or even rever 
by 2040. 

box 4. model the econom impact of autom 

1 the structur of the model be anchor in the academ literatur on econom growth models. for detail see 
shift tides: global econom scenario for 2015–25, mckinsey & company, septemb 2015. 

We use mckinsey & company’ global growth model to model the dynam impact 
of autom on the economi of our six focu countries.1 thi be a supply-sid gener 
equilibrium macroeconom model that cover more than 100 countri with data from 
1960 through 2015. 

In the model, we directli includ three factor by which autom affect econom 
growth: labor displacement, result in worker lose their jobs; capit invest need 
to implement the autom technologies; and an increas in product growth, a firm 
employ more capit per worker. these input to the global growth model be deriv 
from our autom research. To calcul the impact on productivity, we estim the 
impli product growth that would be need to maintain constant total output with 
few workers, under the rational that firm would not adopt the new technolog unless it 
produc at least the same level of output. In reality, thi be like to be an underestim of 
the impact. our experi work with firm and our prior autom research show 
that autom often result in high qualiti output and significantli high level of output 
a well. 

We also model how quickli displac worker be employ in new jobs, or the 
reemploy rate. not everi displac worker will enter unemployment; some will have the 
skill and the opportun to transit quickli into a new role at the same compani or with a 
new firm. indeed, each year million of US worker leav a job and find a new one. between 
2013 and 2015, 66 percent of displac worker in the unit state found a new job by 
the end of the period; 49 percent of worker displac between 2007 and 2009, dure the 
financi crisis, be reemploy by the begin of 2010. 

We model four reemploy rate scenarios—low, medium, high, and full reemployment. 
the reemploy rate model differ by countri and be estim from literatur and 
adjust for labor market flexibl factors. 



3. job gained: scenario for employ growth mckinsey global institute74 

In emerg economies, automation’ impact on employ be small than in 
advanc economi 
the impact of autom be lesser in china, india, and mexico than in the advanc 
economi we focu on, accord to our simulation. first, autom rate be expect 
to be lower, lead to small percentag of displac workers, low level of capit 
investment, and small product increases. As such, unemploy be not expect to 
rise significantly, nor be model wage or gdp growth sensit to the autom effect 
under ani of the reemploy scenarios. 

for more detail analysi of each of our six focu countries, see the countri impact section 
start on page 91. 

••• 

autom will displac job around the world by 2030, but in our analysi demand for 
certain type of labor—from care provid to builders—wil also increase, spur by the 
rise consum class in emerg economi and the grow health-car need of age 
popul in nation from germani and itali to china and japan, among other trends. our 
dynam model of the US and other economi suggest that enough new job will be 
creat to return to full employ by 2030, but the transit could be difficult. depend 
on the rate at which displac worker be reemployed, the unemploy rate could rise in 
the short- to medium-term, and wage may fall thereafter. moreover, our analysi highlight 
differ between the sort of job that will be lose from automation, and those that will be 
gain from a rang of trends. even if there be enough work to go around in 2030, million 
of individu may need to find new job and possibl acquir new skills. We examin these 
trend in the next chapter.

midcar retrain will be a major challeng 

© hero images/getti imag 



the combin of labor displac by autom and chang demand for 
occup that we have outlin in the previou chapter will have enorm implic 
for individu workers. We estim that 60 million to 375 million individu around the world 
may need to transit to new occup categori by 2030 , in the event of midpoint or 
earli autom adopt (although that number would be neglig in 2030 in our edge- 
case slow autom adopt scenario). nearli all job will involv a shift mix of task 
and activities. 

within occupations, the mix of activ and the capabl requir will skew toward 
more person interact and more advanc level of cognit capabilities. educ 
requir will also change: net of automation, a great share of job in the futur will 
like requir high level of educ attainment. In advanc economies, that includ 
increas demand for job that current requir a colleg degre (or other advanc 
training). At the same time, employ and worker may need to take a more fine-grain 
approach to identifi skill that be the most important. 

our result also suggest that incom polar in advanc economi includ 
the unit state could be exacerbated.92 We do not dynam model how wage 
might chang for individu occup by 2030, but base on current wages, we find 
that in most advanc countries, middle-wag job may declin the most a a result of 
automation. grow occup in these countri will tend to be either those that be less 
remunerative, for example, retail salesperson or childcar workers, or quit the opposite: 
highli paid jobs, such a softwar engineers. In develop economi includ china, 
however, we see the opposit trend. here the strong job growth will like be for middle- 
wage occupations, includ servic and construct jobs. 

the mix OF activ within occup will chang 
for nearli all occupations, autom will chang the mix of activ that human perform, 
a some task be take over by machin or software. over time, occup definit 
may change, a the boundari between differ occup becom blurred. already, 
physician assist and regist nurs carri out mani task that doctor use to do, 
such a handl routin case or give shots. for their part, doctor now write up memo 
and enter data rather than dictat to assistants. 

with automation, such shift may becom more pronounced, although the specif will 
vari by country. In germany, worker of the futur will like spend more time on activ 
that requir appli expertis (+2.9 billion full-tim equival hours), interact with 
stakehold (+1.5 billion hours), and manag peopl (+1.4 billion hours), and less time

In india, much of the project growth in activ hour will be in physic activities, driven 
by demand for construct work, particularli in the step-up scenario. china, which 
have high level of exist infrastructur and build development, will still see some 
growth in physic activities. however, most of the growth will be in activ similar to it 
advanced-economi counterparts, such a interact with stakehold and appli 
profession expertise. 

thi shift set of activ have implic for the capabl that will be need for 
futur work. exhibit 20 show how US worker will need to upgrad their masteri of the 18 
perform capabl we use for our autom modeling. 

more work activ will requir social and emot skill and advanc cognit 
capabilities, such a high-level logic reasoning—cap that be requir today for 
onli a rel limit number of jobs. thi will be a challeng for education, training, and 
skill assess models, which for now do not alway emphas “soft skills” such a social 
and emot reason and sensing.

addit job will often requir a high level of perform across mani capabilities. for 
instance, machin will be abl to perform work activ requir basic level of retriev 
inform and understand natur language—but job requir high level of these 
capabl will grow. In advanc economies, physic capabl will be less in demand 
a a percentag of the activ hour demand in the economy. In develop economi 
such a india, give the increas in demand for physic activities, demand for physic 
capabl will accordingli grow a a percentag of the new activ hour demanded. 
the shift in activ and underli capabl requir will touch almost all job in the 
economy, to vari degrees—but especi in advanc economies. As one example, the 
work of retail salesperson in these economi could chang significantly; about 20 percent 
of their current work activ could be autom in the midpoint scenario. the rote 
aspect of the job such a process transact and gather product inform may 
be automated. retail worker instead may turn their attent to the more people-focus 
side of the job: greet custom and answer questions, for example, or suggest 
new products. 

the capabl shift be not limit to front-lin jobs. mani worker in occup with high 
educ requir who spend much of their time collect and process data 
could experi a signific shift in their work activities. financi managers, for example, 
could spend less time monitor cashflow or approv expenditures, and instead

thi chang natur of activ and capabl have import implic for the 
requir and aim of job training, which will be particularli relev in time of transition. 
for example, a activ requir basic level of perform be autom in the unit 
states, train effort will need to focu on capabl for which autom be more 
challenging, such a social and emot capabilities. increasingli across occupations, 
worker will be valu for strong interperson skill and advanc reasoning. As these 
skill be often develop through guid experience, worker will like spend more time 
be coach in apprentice-lik environments. the worker of the futur will still need to 
appli expertis and judgment, so train to promot fluenci with and understand of 
inform will remain important. 

grow job categori have higher educ requir 
than the work displac BY autom 
across our six focu countries, a great share of job in the future—account for both the 
effect from autom and the addit labor demand from the seven trends—ar like 
to demand increas level of educ (exhibit 22).94 

defin and measur the skill requir to perform well in ani job be a difficult and 
imprecis task. In our modeling, we look at sever differ measur of workforc skills. 
first, we consid the formal educ requir of each occupation: secondari 
school degree, associate’s, bachelor’s, and graduat degrees. educ requir 
by occup be fairli well standard global and allow for cross-countri comparisons. 
however, even within an occupation, there will be a rang of degre that exist worker 
have obtained; we focu on the educ level that be typic required.95 We also look 
at how activ within occup will change, which give some indic of the type 
of skill that will be more or less in demand, and we consid the capabl requir to 
perform those activities—such a cognit skills, creativity, social and emot skills. 
other definit of skill and credenti be equal valid and important, but be beyond 
the scope of thi report. mani practition and research today focu on unbundl 
tradit degre into well-defin credenti that can be obtain by demonstr 
masteri of specif skills. thi be particularli attract for midcar worker who cannot 
afford to spend year earn a tradit degree, or who have accumul valuabl 
experi on the job. some credenti be for quit narrow skills: program in a certain 
comput language, or master one specif type of mechan expertise.96 

94 We do not model chang skill requir for occupations, and assum that educ requir for 
an occup in all countri be the same a in the unit states. see technic appendix for details. 

95 economist note the gener trend of “degre inflation.” for instance, in the unit states, while 80 percent of 
job open for execut assist list a bachelor’ degre a a requirement, few than half of exist ea 
have that degree. see peter capelli, will colleg pay off? A guid to the most import financi decis you’ll

have a mix outlook. As a share of job in the economies, countri such a japan will 
see increas demand for associates’ and equival degrees, primarili from middle-skil 
health-car occup such a nurs and paramedics. meanwhile, countri such a 
germani will see decreas demand, primarili becaus of a great share of automat 
offic support job such a clerk and secretaries. 

the rel growth of job requir high educ attain be not a new 
observation.97 nor be the increas of skill requir necessarili a break from histor 
trend: the manufactur revolut saw increas need for literaci train that spawn 
movement toward secondari educ includ the high school movement in the unit 
states, which we discu in the next chapter. 

however, mani of the middle-incom job of the past that requir onli a secondari 
educ or less, and minim training, will like face signific displac in an 
autom world. these job includ heavi truck driver and offic clerks, both of which 
have high technic potenti for autom over our model time horizon, and whose 
current middle-level wage rais the econom incent to deploy automation. mani 
addit job requir low and middl level of educ attain could be created, 
driven particularli by the care economy, such a the rise of nurs and nurs assistants. 
however, for mani job that requir no or onli secondari education, the addit futur 
labor demand will not fulli make up for the job displac by automation. thi would mean 
that mani displac worker would need to retrain and/or rais their educ level to 
gain employ in one of the in-demand occupations. 

the seven trend we model alon suggest that overal new demand for work current 
requir a colleg degre could be suffici to balanc the reduct in demand 
for work activ lose to autom in occup requir colleg completion, in 
the unit states, a well a in germani (where the net model demand for these 
occup increases). 

however, that do not obviat the need for colleg and advanc degre holder to 
retrain, a their activ will change. some will switch to job that requir a similar level 
of educ attainment, but veri differ skills. the come wave of technolog 
deployment, bolster by advanc in machin learn and artifici intelligence, have 
signific potenti to autom work activ previous thought to be the exclus 
domain of highly-train humans. In the midpoint autom scenario, 13 percent of the 
current work activ perform in occup that requir colleg or advanc degre 
in the unit state could be displaced. even within a give field, certain occup will 
fare good than others. In the unit states, for example, the high-skil job of applic 
softwar develop have larg net addit demand (we model nearli ten time a mani 
job creat a displaced). meanwhil certain technolog support job includ comput 
system administr and support specialist may see a cool of demand, becaus 
a substanti portion of their current activ have rel high technic autom 
potential. similarly, in US financi services, the vari skill requir of manag 
analyst could see high demand, while financi manag and secur sale agent 
could face substanti autom of their current work activ with limit sourc of 
new demand. 

97 for example, mit economist david autor have credit the trend to product boost from inform 
technolog that magnifi the product power of cognit functions, which be often central to higher-skil 
work. ibid. david H. autor, “whi be there still so mani jobs?” summer 2015. In the unit states, about two-

worker displac by autom may need to invest time to acquir new skills, either 
through formal educ or other train programs. conversely, job themselv may 
need to be redesign to accommod an influx of new worker with less sector-specif 
train and overal education. the transit could be vari and lead to friction in the 
labor market and potenti high unemploy in the short-run. but other step could 
be take to make market function better. for example, defin job requirements, a well 
a provid train and certification, base on specif skills, could improv the match 
of labor suppli and demand, a these skill can be much more fine-grain than tradit 
educ degrees, and can often be acquir in less time than finish a multi-year 
degre program. 

while some worker who be displac by autom will be abl to find a job in a similar 
function and with similar educ requir (for example, a displac cashier find 
a new job a a retail salesperson), mani will not, and will need to gain addit skills, which 
may or may not actual rais their educ level. thi be discuss in a subsequ 
section of thi chapter. 

addit job creation in our step-up scenario could help mitig some of the impact of 
automation, with addit invest in infrastructure, buildings, and energi transit 
potenti creat new work for worker with low and mid-level educ attainment. In 
all, in the unit states, we estim addit demand for mid-skil labor of up to 1 million 
jobs, net of automation, in the step-up scenario. demand for occup requir post- 
secondari educ also increas in the step-up scenario. engin and cost estim 
will be brought in to develop infrastructur projects, for example, and variou professionals, 
from account to research analysts, will also see increas demand. 

In develop countries, the larg number of new job will be those requir 
secondari educ or technic skill 
In emerg economies, the rate of job growth be high for occup that requir a 
colleg degre or more, but the absolut amount of job growth be high for occup 
with a secondari educ diploma. 

In china, for instance, occup current requir colleg and advanc degre will 
see increas demand—in the case of those with colleg degrees, thi could be a high 
a 22 million addit net job under our step-up scenario. however, the larg absolut 
number of job created—almost 60 million in the step-up scenario—curr requir onli 
a secondari school diploma, with signific increas demand for retail salespeople, 
nurs assistants, childcar worker and other accord to our analysis. despit the 
dual threat of autom (particularli for manufacturing, which make up about 19 percent 
of employ in china) and other increas productivity, signific demand will be 
creat for lower-skil work, primarili due to rise prosperity. also, job with low educ 
attain requir in these countri be gener low wage, and be thu less 
econom attract to automate. 

india, meanwhile, will see the larg new demand net of autom for worker with a 
secondari education. accord to our analysis, a mani a 100 million new job could 
be creat for indian with secondari education—even after account for the effect of 
automation—a rise prosper will creat a surg of new labor demand for construction, 
retail, and health care and educ jobs, among others. the larg countri in the 
develop world, in short, should not have a shortag of labor demand across ani 
educ level, but the signific increas in work requir complet of secondari 
educ indic a need for india to upgrad it school system.98

some of these peopl who be displac will seek new educ and mani will need new

particularli where those activ be augment by automation. As a point of calibration, 
in our rise incom trend, we project that between 190 million and 205 million student

these transit could surfac friction in the labor market, for reason rang from low

middle-wag job have felt the impact of autom in the past decad in the unit

find that ani polar of wage be not due sole to skill gaps; some of the addit 
demand for middle-skil job be in those that be current paid low wage in countri such 
a the unit states.

In the unit state and germany, in our trendlin labor demand and midpoint autom 
scenarios, occup in the top 30 percent of averag current wage experi net job 
growth by 2030 (exhibit 25). thi hold for the unit state even in the model step- 
up scenario; in the step-up scenario for germany, rise need for job such a nurs 
assist be expect to increas demand for middle-wag jobs. the larg declin be in 
job in the middl of the wage distribution. occup in the low 30 percent of wage 
decline, but thi reflect the net impact of modest growth in low-wag occup such 
a retail salespeople, and declin occup such a hand packers/packag and 
cafeteria cooks. 

100 base on analysi conduct with world bank tertiari educ data. 
101 our analysi suggest that futur labor demand on an aggreg basi will not have a gender bias. autom 

overal will affect job that be tradit male-dominated, a in manufacturing, but also job that be 
tradit female-dominated, such a food servic or accommodation. new job with a tradit male 
bia such a construct work will be created, a will job such a nurs that have tradit be 
domin by women.

the trend we identifi in thi report for both low- and 
middle-wag job and high-wage, high-skil job overlap

middle-skil job have declined. with mani routin

of the growth at the low-skil end of the spectrum have

less suscept to automation. At the same time, idea-

In the unit states, the pattern of polar be clearer if we look at the net job growth by 
wage decil (exhibit 26). the top two decil experi signific new demand for labor 
net of automation, primarili driven by an increas in demand for high-skil professionals, 
includ technolog and medic professionals. the effect of age and, in the step-up 
scenario, profession of unpaid work also creat growth at the low end of the 
wage spectrum, around the 20th percentile. thi be driven by growth in nurs assistants, 
teach assistants, and person care aides, among others. 

In our model, the step-up scenario involv increas spend on such area a 
infrastructure, real estate, and energi transit can help creat more growth in middle- 
wage (a well a low-wage) jobs. for example, in the unit states, increas infrastructur 
and real estat spend can creat addit demand for labor in construction, skill 
craftspeople, and technic product jobs, which be middle-wag jobs. the increas 
profession of unpaid servic would also add job for middle-wag work in 
countri like germani through increas demand for nurs assist and childcar 
workers. these type of job could help produc some of the addit labor demand to 
offset activ that could be automated, in particular, provid demand for middle-wag 
job in advanc economies.

4. implic for skill and wage mckinsey global institute90 

In develop countries, middle-wag occup could experi 
strong growth 
the potenti wage trend pictur be quit differ in emerg economies. In india, 
occup at all wage level be boost by demand from rise prosperity, while the 
economi will larg be shield from autom becaus of low wages. In china, our 
scenario show that middle-wag job will rise similarly. across both countries, the main 
occup that be drive thi growth in middle-wag job involv custom interaction. 
job growth be particularli pronounc for cashier and retail salespeople, which be 
middle-wag job in these markets. while in the develop world mani of these job may 
be automated, in india and china, wage be low enough that autom rate will like 
be constrain in the 2030 timefram (model at under 10 percent). the stori be a posit 
one for wage advanc and the develop of the middl class: in india, for example, 
if farmwork (with annual salari of $1,752) find themselv out of a job becaus of 
product improvements, mani new and more highly-paid servic job will sprout up in 
host (averag wage of $2,204), and for retail salesperson ($4,101). 

In these develop countries, the challeng will be to continu to creat more high-wag 
work opportun for high-skil workers, and move a great proport of worker into 
high wage jobs. while india will have high demand for high-wag work, thi type of work 
in china be more suscept to autom compar with other develop countries, 
accord to our model, primarili becaus of high wage rates. comput support 
specialist and law clerks, two high-wag occupations, have an autom potenti in the 
midpoint adopt scenario of 34 percent and 35 percent, respectively. overall, then, while 
develop countri may have less to worri about when it come to creat labor demand 
to offset the effect of autom in the near term, polici maker and busi leader may 
want to focu on the creation of more gain and desir employment.103 

••• 

work will chang in the next decad and beyond, with signific implic both for 
skill requir and wages. while our research suggest that these trend will play out 
differ among countries, some common be apparent. one be that educ 
requir and perform capabilities, includ for soft skill such a social 
and emot reasoning, will becom ever more important. In advanc economi 
includ the unit states, middle-wag worker could continu to see a shrink 
pool of opportun a autom outpac new job creation. As mani a 375 million 
individu around the world will need to switch occup categories. provid retrain 
opportun at scale will be imperative. what should the polici prioriti be in thi chang 
workplace? In the follow chapter, we look at how the transit brought about by 
autom can best be managed.

In the follow section, we highlight scenario for 
the futur of work in our six focu countries: china, 
germany, india, japan, mexico, and the unit states. 
the chart show a rang of possibl outcom for 
job displac by autom adopt to 2030 and 
scenario for futur job that could be creat by 
seven catalyst of labor demand, a well a by new 
occup that could arise. for the autom of 
work, we consid scenario base on the speed of 
adopt of autom technologies. for potenti 
labor demand, we model a trendlin scenario base 
mainli on past experience, and a step-up scenario that 
considers, among other things, increas invest 
in infrastructure, buildings, and energi effici that 
countri may choos to make. base on the net 
impact of autom versu futur labor demand 
growth by occupation, we estim the number of 
worker who may need to chang occup 

categories, and the possibl implic for 
educ attain and wages. 

these chart should not be take a forecast or 
predictions. rather, they illustr a rang of possibl 
outcomes. the scenario we ass in thi report 
may overst or underst the actual impact of 
autom on work and futur labor demand. for 
example, if autom adopt be more rapid than 
even our earli adopt scenario, thi could 
mean that more work would be autom than we 
estimate. On the other hand, autom might boost 
product growth more than we have modeled, and 
thi could lead to strong aggreg demand growth 
and more job creation across the economi than we 
have modeled. box E2 on page 21 discu the

5. manag the workforc 
transit 

brace yourself. all countri will face large-scal workforc transit over the next 15 year 
a autom displac some worker and labor demand shifts. enabl and smooth 
these transit will be a signific challeng for polici maker and busi leaders. 
some polici choic could substanti improv the employ outcomes, includ 
speed reemployment. indeed, it may take a marshal plan-scal initi of sustain 
invest by the public and privat sector in new train model and workforc transit 
program to address all the social, political, and econom issu that autom will raise. 

In thi chapter, we discu four prioriti that could make a critic difference: maintain 
robust econom growth to support job creation; scale up workforc retrain and 
skill develop programs, particularli for midcar workers; improv labor market 
dynamism; and provid incom and transit support to displac workers. We 
explor some of the choic that could be consid and cite exampl of success 
interventions. these idea should not be take a exhaust or prescriptive, but rather a 
prompt to spur discuss and new ideas. specif choic will vari base on countri 
circumst and societ choices. 

maintain robust econom growth and innov TO support 
job creation 
the start point be an econom one: sustain robust aggreg demand growth be 
essenti for enabl employ growth. economi that be not expand do not creat 
new jobs. indeed, the experi of the past decad have underscor the linger neg 
employ effect of insuffici demand. 

appropri fiscal and monetari polici can be deploy to ensur that demand 
growth be vibrant, and it go beyond the scope of thi report to catalog the appropri 
macroeconom policies. nonetheless, the import of sustain demand growth 
cannot be overemphasized. much have also be write about potenti way to encourag 
innov and entrepreneurship, from invest in research and develop 
and human capital, to invest capital, and lower barrier to entri for innov 
businesses.104 support innov and technolog diffus be critical, includ the 
adopt of autom technolog themselves, a these advanc be the fundament 
sourc of long-run productivity, growth, and prosperity, a well a the creation of new 
busi models, occupations, and work activities. To do so will requir an effect and 
balanc system for encourag the develop and deploy of intellectu property, 
a high-skil scientif and engin workforce, and public or privat fund for basic 
research and it commercialization. new busi creation, start-up communities, and 
dynam firm entri and exit be also essential.105 for small citi that lack a diversifi 
economi and where the princip employ leaves, more holist econom reviv plan 
be needed.106

octob 2012 and enrico moretti, the new geographi of jobs, marin books, march 2013.

5. manag the workforc transit mckinsey global institute106 

action can be take not onli at the nation level, but also locally. mgi studi of citi 
around the world, along with a grow bodi of academ research, illustr the vast 
differ in econom growth and prosper that aris among citi and region of the 
same country.107 the last 20 year of global and technolog chang have result 
in mani commun in the unit state and europ suffer large-scal job losses—but 
some of these commun have also show that reviv growth through knowledge- 
base economi be possible. A common pattern emerges: har intellectu capital, 
often found in universities, with privat sector r&d and local govern will to ensur 
workforc train to meet the new demand.108 

mani policymakers, in both advanc and develop countri such a india, worri 
about “jobless growth.”109 sinc the 2008 global financi crisis, it have becom clear that 
not all sourc of gdp growth have an equal impact on employ creation. growth in 
industri that be heavili capital-intens or those that be highli autom will not have 
the same impact on job creation. To support broad-bas job creation, some countri may 
provid incent to labor-intens servic sectors, such a health care, education, and 
construction. target initi may also be used. catalyz public and privat invest 
for infrastructure, includ the hous and commerci build need in urban 
countri in the develop world, not onli support long-term econom growth but also 
have the potenti to creat large-scal employ in the near-term. support measur 
to shift energi to renew sources, manag and mitig climat change, and boost 
energi effici through increas digit of the sector likewis have global econom 
benefit while boost near-term employment. the step-up scenario we outlin in chapter 
3 reflect the potenti impact of these type of “no-regret” initiatives; we estim that 
roughli 150 million to 300 million job could be creat increment on top of the trendlin 
scenario job a a result. importantly, these initi creat mani middle-skil jobs, such a 
those for electricians, carpenters, crane operators, and other trades. 

In prior research, we examin the critic role of migrat and gender parity, both of which 
amount to low-cost way to boost aggreg demand in the short- and medium-term. for 
example, a much a 70 percent of popul growth in urban area go forward could 
come from migration—with key challeng on how migrant can be integr effectively.110 

scale UP job retrain and workforc skill develop 
provid job retrain and enabl individu to learn market new skill throughout 
their lifetim will be a central challeng for some countri over the next decad and 
beyond. As we have show in thi report, hundr of million of peopl will like need to 
find new job a autom advances, and even more will need to learn new skills, includ 
how to work seamlessli with machines. 

In recent years, some countri have experienc signific challeng in tri to creat 
the condit in which worker displac by global and technolog quickli find 
new high-qual employment. the result for mani individu have be a seri of lower- 
wage job with limit opportun for advanc and low rate of labor market

will be to creat effect workforc retrain program at scale. thi could requir action 
by polici makers, busi leaders, and educators, a well a individuals. 

histori offer exampl of large-scal program to improv the skill 
of worker 
At a time when million of individu will need new skills, public fund for job train 
program be fall in mani countri (exhibit 27).113 between 1993 and 2015, spend on 
workforc train program a a percent of gdp fell from 0.08 percent to 0.03 percent in 
the unit states, while japanes spend drop from 0.03 percent to 0.01 percent. In 
germany—stil one of the larg spenders—outlay for train fell from 0.57 percent of gdp 
to 0.2 percent. 

nonetheless, we can find exampl of societies, past and present, which have chosen 
to invest in educ and workforc training, with impress results. the unit state 
provid exampl of two at-scal invest in the past century: the US high school 
movement (1910 to 1940), which make attend secondari school the norm for all children, 
and the 1944 GI bill, which enabl million of return war veteran to obtain a tertiari 
educ (see box 6, “the US high school movement and the GI bill dramat rais 
educ attain of american workers”). academ research have found that the 
sizabl human capit increas enabl by these program account for a measur 
share of the rise in incom over those decades, creat a larg and increasingli affluent 
american middl class.114 

more recently, singapor implement an innov form of support aim at upgrad 
skill a part of it effort to promot growth and competit in 23 industries.115 
through the “skillsfutur initiative,” introduc by the ministri of educ in januari 
2016, the govern provid all singaporean age 25 and abov credit of about $400,

60 percent of them over 40.116 

busi can play a signific role in train and retrain worker 
compani also have a signific role to play in train and retrain workers. thi go 
beyond a pure social role or sens of civic responsibility: busi leader will be on the 
front line of autom and will have the earli and most detail knowledg about what 
type of skill they will need a they move to adopt the technologies. In the unit states, 
some compani be work directli with educ provid to give employe an

the US high school movement (1910 to 1940) propel 
a sharp increas in high school enrol and graduat 
rates, make a high school qualif the norm.1 

In 1910, most student left educ after primari school 
to work in agricultur or other low-skil jobs. those who 
attend high school do so primarili to gain entranc to 
college. however, the economi have begin produc 
larg number of job in citi that demand a formal 
educ beyond primari school. thi demand lead to a 
grassroot movement: more high school be built and 
the curriculum shift from teach skill “for college” 
to skill “for life.” vocat (includ commercial), 
technic or manual, and industri cours be rapidli 
incorpor into most high school curricula. 

secondari school enrol increas spectacularly, 
from 18 percent in 1910 to 73 percent in 1940. graduat 
rate for 17-year-old rise from 9 percent to 51 percent in 
the same period (exhibit 28). 

higher educ attain have an impact on 
incomes. On an aggreg level, nation incom per 
worker grow annual at a 1.48 percent averag from 1929 
to 1982. one studi attribut 28 percent of the econom 
growth to human capit accumul and technolog 

progress, with chang at the secondari school level 
be quantit the most signific driver to the 
increas educ stock of american in the first 
three-quart of the 20th century.2 

the GI bill of 1944, creat to help integr world war II 
veteran back into civilian life, be instrument in make 
a colleg educ mainstream.3 studi estim 
that 1.4 million people-year of undergradu train 
have be lose becaus of the war.4 the bill provid 
all veteran dedic payment of tuition and live 
expens to attend high school, college, or vocat 
or technic school. By 1956, just under eight million 
veteran have use the GI bill educ benefits, with 
2.2 million attend colleg or univers and an 
addit 5.6 million engag in some kind of train 
program.5 In all, just over half of all veteran tap the 
educ benefit in some form, greatli exceed the 
government’ projections.6 veteran account for a 
mani a 49 percent of all enrol student at colleg 
and universities—and creat demand for growth of a

apprenticeship primarili benefit youth newli enter the workforce. germany’ “dual- 
system” apprenticeship program combin work- and school-bas learn be the 
best known, and prepar student for a success transit to full-tim employment. 
begin in secondari school, student choos a vocat or a college-prepar 
track. traditionally, thi alloc be do through student test scores, but today there be 
more flexibility. vocat student spend part of their time attend high school, learn 
the basic curriculum, and part of their time work and earn at an employer. the system 
offer qualif in a broad spectrum of profess and adapt to the chang need of 
the labor market. 

A major strength of the dual system be the high degre of engag and ownership on 
the part of employers, although a web of check and balanc at the nation and local 
level ensur that the short-term need of employ do not distort broader educ 
and econom goals.118 the system have produc impress results: about one-third of 
german student be educ in the apprenticeship system, which be a wide respect 
career path. 

like germany, switzerland also have a robust apprenticeship pipeline—indeed, nearli 
70 percent of swiss high-school student choos vocat training. In thi track, student 
rotat between school and workplac settings, and receiv a salari throughout their 
training.119 some studi show that student in switzerland who opt into vocat train 
over gener educ on averag attain high lifetim earnings.120 

germany’ apprenticeship system be be emul by other countries. for instance, 
german auto manufactur in the unit state now offer apprenticeship (although the 
program remain small). south korea have adopt the apprenticeship model at scale (see

educ have a role to play in adjust school curriculum for the 
autom age 
while autom will be a major challeng to worker alreadi in jobs, it also will have 
implic for how futur gener of worker be trained, involv adjust to 
school curriculum and educ system more broadly. curricula will need to adapt to 
provid student with the skill necessari for a dynamic, technology- and increasingli 
service-ori labor market, particularli in countri and industri where autom 
technolog be like to be adopt most quickly. sever chang will be required. 

first, demand will increas for worker to develop and deploy technology, or interpret and 
act on the data analyt that these technolog can produce, yet there may not be enough 
worker with the skill to meet thi demand, for instance, for data scientists.121 stem 
subject will be crucial for the workforce. earli educ in subject such a statistics, to 
help student understand an increasingli data-driven world, where experi be a key 
sourc of insight, will be vital. some countri includ estonia and the unit kingdom 
have introduc comput cod into primari and secondari education. code class 
in these countri start a earli a age five or seven, with an introduct to necessari 
fundament concept (such a gain an understand of algorithms) and cod skill 
such a logic and the creation and debug of simpl comput programs.122 however, 
a strong liber art educ to go alongsid the high tech workplac skill could also be 
requir for the “new collar” job of the future.123 

our analysi have show that an increas percentag of activ that worker will do in 
the futur will be in categori such a manag and lead other peopl and interact 
with others, which requir skill such a social and emot sens and reasoning, and 
appli creativ and collabor problem-solving. these skill be often not part of the 
formal curriculum in tradit school programs. anoth find from our research be that 
autom and other factors, includ globalization, independ work, and compani 
cross sector boundaries, will requir all worker to chang what they do over time. thi 
put a premium on a set of meta-skills, around agility, flexibility, grit, and learn how to 
learn. teach such qualiti be a challeng for all educ systems. 

third, educ institut will need to adapt to the evolv demand of the labor market 
to ensur that critic job skill be be taught. unless they becom more respons 
to labor market demands, educ risk creat an ever-larg disconnect between 
educ and employment. thi disconnect be alreadi visibl in some surveys. In a 
mckinsey survey in 2012, onli 50 percent of youth say they believ their post-secondari 
studi improv their employ opportunities, and onli 43 percent of employ 
report be abl to find enough skill workers. moreover, 39 percent of employ say 
a skill shortag be a lead reason for entry-level vacancies. however, a big major of 
educ provid (72 percent) say they believ new graduat be readi to work.124

sever measur can reduc or correct disconnect among educ providers, 
employers, and students. provid action data be one. student need to know that 
curriculum will provid them with relev knowledg and work skills, and be abl to select the 
best cours and institut to achiev their desir educ outcome. In one survey, 
less than 50 percent of student say they have a solid understand of which disciplin 
lead to profess with good job open and wage levels.125 

finally, the digit age itself have brought a multitud of possibl for new way of learning, 
both within the educ system and outside. digit learn resourc be more flexibl 
in term of their time and content than tradit classroom training, and program can 
adjust content for individu student to optim their learn outcomes. for individuals, 
onlin degre can be more advantag from a cost perspect than degre from 
tradit colleg and universities, particularli in the unit state where tuition cost be 
rise faster than overal inflation. some massiv open onlin cours (moocs) be free and 
have help expand access to educ content for those outsid tradit educ 
institutions. At coursera, for example, half of student be from develop countries, and 
about 60 to 70 percent of user be employ but prepar for good jobs, while 15 percent 
be unemployed. most be between age 22 and 45.126 mooc present a promis

intern mobil be a controversi topic in some polit arenas, but the skill 
mismatch we have identifi a a consequ of autom and new labor demand 
will not stop at nation borders. our research on global migrat have found that the 
world’ 247 million cross-bord migrant contribut 9.4 percent of global gdp, or roughli 
$6.7 trillion worldwid in 2015—more than $3 trillion abov their contribut have they 
remain in their home countries.136 more than 90 percent of these cross-bord migrant 
move voluntarily, usual for econom reasons, while refuge and asylum seeker who 
tend to attract the most public attent make up the remainder. 

digit platform can make labor market more transpar and improv 
job match 
digit platform offer an effici way to improv the inform avail to individu 
about job opportunities, and to compani about job candidates. By improv inform 
signals, job platform such a linkedin, indeed.com, and monster.com can speed and 
improv the process of match individu to jobs, therebi foster fluidity. these 
platform allow individu to post their entir resum and showcas their work, display a 
rich set of credenti and skill other than simpli their educ record. but transpar 
cut both ways: other platforms, such a glassdoor.com, enabl prospect employe to 
find out more about their potenti employers, includ salari inform and anonym 
review by current employees. mgi have estim that up to 540 million individu could 
potenti benefit from onlin talent platforms, with a mani a 230 million shorten 
search time between jobs, reduc the durat of unemployment. Up to 60 million peopl 
could find work that more close suit their skill or preferences, and an addit 50 million 
could shift from inform to formal employment.137 

compani can benefit from use digit technolog to transform recruiting, training, 
and manag talent a well. compani that adopt these tool be discov that better- 
inform decis about human capit produc good busi results. On average, our 
analysi find that compani could see a 275 basi point increas in their profit margins.138 
In addition, talent platform could improv signal about the skill that be actual in

skill in the economi could adjust more quickli and accur over time.

displac worker 
the workplac be changing, with the rise of more flexibl form of independ work, 
includ independ contractors, freelancers, self-employ individuals, and peopl 
work in the “gig” or “sharing” economy. mgi find that 20 to 30 percent of the work 
age popul in europ and the unit state alreadi earn incom through independ 
work—and that 70 percent of those say they do so out of preference, not becaus they 
cannot find a tradit job. moreover, the number of peopl choos to work outsid

have document the stagnat in market incomes, and increas wage polarization, 
in mani develop markets.142 both polici maker and busi leader have a role to 
play in support worker a they transit between job to avoid long-term neg

activ support worker in job transit 
A rang of measur can speed the transit of worker between jobs, beyond improv 
labor market dynamism, job matching, and retrain and skill development. most countri 
have labor agenc focu on provid assist to the unemployed. In many, the focu 
be mainli on dole out benefit and reduc fraud. germani provid an exampl of a 
nation that overhaul it labor forc system—and reduc high unemploy a a result. 
In 2003, when the countri be still struggl with the legaci of reunification, it adopt the 
“hartz reforms,” base on recommend of a labor market commission. the lower- 
wage segment of the labor market be liberalized, and a new categori of job be creat 
with employ pay a low flat rate for employees, who work a limit number of hour per 
week, exempt from social secur and tax contributions. 

the move creat million of “mini-jobs,” whose wage be then supplement by welfar 
payments. In addition, the local labor market agenc be restructured. case worker 
be assign to everi unemploy individual, with strong incent to success place 
their client into jobs. skill assess be performed, and train be provid if needed. 
these reform help reduc the unemploy rate from 10 percent in 2003 to below 
4 percent today and, at the same time, increas germany’ share of the working-ag 
popul in employ by 10 percentag points. while these reform have return 
more individu to work, there be controversi over the impact on the post-unemploy 
earn of workers.143 

To ensur that worker develop the skill need for the work world of the future, 
the german labor agenc be now plan to put a great emphasi on counseling. It be 
current pilot innov onlin and offlin counsel servic direct at students, the 
unemployed, but also employe in job which be massiv impact by digitization. the 
hope be that good individu orient about job market trend and futur opportun 
will smooth the transit to a digit economy, without a larg net loss of job and

In denmark, employ and govern work with union to maintain the country’ 
“flexicur system,” which combin activ labor market polici with flexibl rule for 
hire and fire and high level of benefit for unemploy individu (up to 90 percent for 
the low paid workers). they also offer activ job counseling, includ career guidance, 
train or educ to all unemploy individuals, and offer all worker access to 
numer vocat train programs. thi creat a labor market environ of flexibl 
employ and job security. notably, firm and union get togeth to identifi skill needs, 
agre on wage and enshrin right to paid leav for training. some studi suggest that 
similar collabor effort between employ and union can play an import role in 
rais skill levels, includ in the unit states, and be alreadi do so in some cases.144 

neighbor sweden have a system for retrain midcar worker through privat sector 
“job-secur councils.” employ pay into these councils, which provid financi support 
and job counsel to laid-off workers, with the aim of help them get back to work a 
soon a possible. person counselor help worker with their resum and steer them into 
class in their field or other fields.145 

support worker incom may also be necessari 
our research indic that million of individu will like need to transit to new 
occupations—and identifi the risk that wage may becom stagnant or even declin for 
middl and lower-skil occup that have a larg suppli of potenti worker but might 
have reduc demand, particularli in develop economies. support incom in both 
case may have an econom rationale. consid that in 1914, henri ford announc that 
he would begin pay hi employe $5 per day, more than twice the averag wage for 
automakers, and reduc the work day from nine hour to eight, at a time when the 60-hour 
work week be the standard in american manufacturing. He explain that “unless an 
industri can so manag itself a to keep wage high and price low, it destroy itself, for 
otherwis it limit the number of it customers. one’ own employe ought to be one’ own 
best customers.”146 

two form of incom support need consider in the age of automation. first be 
payment such a unemploy insur to provid incom to worker dure train 
or transit between jobs. yet unfortunately, the amount of public resourc devot to 
support worker transitions—includ on unemploy benefits—ha be declin 
in most countri (exhibit 32). given the larg workforc transit we see in the decad 
ahead, re-evalu thi trend could be necessary.

In addition, however, wage may be under pressur in a wide rang of job a economi 
transit to new form of work. A rang of option exist for address these incom 
effects. some employ can choos to pay high wage and good benefits, recogn 
the valu that their worker be producing. In addit to societ responsibility, these 
compani may be motiv by competit for talent and an interest in reduc employe 
turnover. In the unit state some compani have unilater rais minimum wage they 
pay.147 In europe, compani have tradit paid more attent to stakehold such a 
workers, in part becaus of union and regulatori choices; in germany, for example, 
worker repres sit on corpor board under 1976 “codetermination” legisl 
and play an import role in shape wage and benefit policies, a well a overal corpor 
strategy. there be also polici option for provid incom support to worker to ensur 
that they remain activ consumers. minimum wage be wide deploy throughout the 
world, and there be move to rais them, includ in US citi such a seattle.148 while 
some studi have show that increas minimum wage can rais employment, the issu 
be activ debated. other form of incom support, such a “earn incom tax credits” 
and wage subsidies, provid incent for peopl to work. these measur attempt to 
provid incom support without discourag peopl from working. pilot project be 
underway in a number of countri to test the idea of pay a univers basic incom (see 
box 9, “experi with univers basic income”). 

In recent decades, the long-stand correl between rise product and wage 
growth have broken down in some countries, such a the unit states. the caus of thi 
shift be unclear. but polici maker be consid new way to ensur that wage be 
link to rise productivity, so that prosper be share with all. some have suggest 
that minimum wage should be index to measur of productivity. In anoth specif 
example, singapor have a program that support corpor invest in product

In the new era of automation, govern and busi will need to undertak a 
balanc act between embrac the technology, which will boost product and 
econom growth, and at the same time address the complex transit it will create. 
ensur robust demand growth and econom dynam be a priority: histori show that 
economi that be not expand do not gener job growth. upgrad workforc skill 
and creat opportun for midcar job retrain will also be essential, at a time when 
spend on these have be declin in most countries, and labor market will need to 
becom more dynam and adapt to chang work need and pattern of worker 
redeployment. A final prioriti be reassess and strengthen transit and incom 
support for worker caught in the cross-curr of automation. each of these prioriti 
on it own present a challenge, and all togeth may requir a marshal plan-lik initiative,

autom will be a power motor of futur econom growth, but the challeng it 
present for workforc transit be sure to be veri substantial. polici makers, busi 
leaders, and individu worker will need to be flexible, creative, and even visionari a they 
look to har these rapidly-emerg technolog and ensur that the time of autom 
be a product and prosper one. A rang of outcom be possible, from one in which 
econom growth and product grow strongly, creat myriad new jobs, a autom 
be adopt rapidly, to one mark by slow autom adoption, weak econom growth and 
low net job growth. 

face with the scale of worker transit we have described, one reaction could be to tri 
to slow the pace and scope of adopt in an attempt to preserv a much of the statu quo 
a possible. but thi would be a mistake. although slow adopt might limit the scale 
of workforc transitions, it would curtail the contribut that these technolog make 
to busi dynam and econom growth. autom technolog and in particular 
artifici intellig be the key to find solut for mani import societ challeng in 
field rang from climat scienc to health care. We should embrac these technologies, 
but also address the workforc transit and challeng they bring. To do this, there be 
a number of imper and prioriti for governments, business, and individuals. In thi 
conclud chapter, we highlight a number of them. 

govern must make workforc transit and job 
creation A more urgent prioriti 
manag the come workforc transit with foresight be not just a question of smart 
policy. automation’ power to lift the product of nation economi have the potenti to 
acceler product and econom growth and improv lives. govern can support 
the develop and deploy of these technologies, for exampl through invest 
in basic and appli research, a well a through build out digit infrastructure. ensur 
posit employ outcom will requir a laser focu on retool the workforce, 
step up support for worker in transition, and improv how local and nation labor 
market function. societi can choos to transform the come labor market disrupt 
into an opportun rather than a pitfall. 

As daunt a the task may seem, histori show u that governments, across the globe, 
when face with monument challenges, can rise to the occas for the well-b of their 
citizens. As we have seen, the US high school movement and GI bill be instrument in 
rais the educ of the US workforc and countri such a germani have show that 
revamp labor market agenc and support for worker in transit be not onli possibl 
but can also dramat reduc unemployment. such exampl highlight the import 
of execut target polici decis swiftli and clearly. 

yet in the last few decades, invest and polici to support the workforc have eroded, 
not be enhanced. public spend on labor forc train and support have fall in most 
countries. educ model have not fundament chang in 100 years; we still use 
system design for an industri societi to prepar student for a more dynamic, rapidly- 
chang knowledg economy. union be on the decline. govern data collect 
on the grow independ workforc and new way of work be fragmented. It be now 
critic to revers these trends. A new “marshal plan” for the workforc be needed. prioriti

both replac some human activ and—prob more frequently—fundament 
chang them. recent exampl of effect large-scal retrain of midcar worker 
be few and far apart. for the future, more short-term and target train for peopl will 
be needed, especi for those in midcar who will be look to develop new skill 
even if they keep their jobs. 

 modern educ system for the 21st century. our analysi of the 
perform capabl most in demand in the new age of autom show the 
critic import of technolog skills, but also of teamwork, creativity, communication, 
and social and emot skills. school in mani countri continu to adher to 
a cultur of educ that remain root in 19th centuri notion of teach and 
learning. govern and educ can use digit technolog to chang that, for 
exampl creat more individu learn path for students. sever countri includ 
germani and switzerland continu to show that apprenticeship can be a power and 
success approach to teach technic skills. while univers educ have grown 
in popular and lose it elitist reput in mani countries, mani tertiari educ 
institut have not focu suffici on the need of the labor market or of the 
graduat enter it. publish job placement of graduat and similar data could 
help both employ look for recruit and potenti student tri to decid on their 
cours of study. singapor have show through it skillsfutur initi that individu 
can be support and motiv to continu acquir new skills. finally, govern 
could encourage, identify, and co-fin innov pilot program that address know 
skill gap among workers, post-secondari students, and youth—and then scale the 
one that work. 

 expand transit support measur for workers. denmark, germany, and sweden, 
among others, have show the import of focu labor agenc on reemploy 
and the acquisit of new skills, rather than simpli on hand out unemploy 
benefit or control for fraud. best practic requir a cultur shift of sorts, one that 
nudg worker to take a more activ role in their own retrain and provid tool for 
them to be successful. mobil can be an import part of that transit process, and 
in the unit states, at least, it be long prized. however, mobil within border have 
slow in advanc countri includ the unit states, and mobil across border 
face new hurdl global a countri revisit immigr polici and practices. 
reduc the barrier to mobility—which includ legal one alongsid prohibit 
hous costs—wil need to be a polici priority. and govern should not lose sight 
of the cardin import of increas econom mobil and opportun for all 
citizens. that mean univers access to qualiti education, good neighborhoods, and 
basic healthcare. 

 creat incom support measur consist with the new wage realities. 
sinc 1970, market wage and product growth have diverg in some advanc 
economi includ the unit states, and incom inequ have grown. with the 
advent of the new autom age, it be import to begin nation discuss on 
whether we can assum that everyon who work can support a decent standard 
of living. A healthi consum class be essenti for both econom growth and social 
stability. incom supplement program alreadi exist in certain countries, such 
a the earn incom tax credit in the unit states, and some countri be test 
univers basic incom program or rais minimum wages; more could follow suit, to 
provid fact-bas find that can inform the debate.

 make job creation and worker re-deploy a nation priority. A broad rang 
of incent exist for busi to invest in capit and research and development. 
someth similar be need to encourag invest in human capital. In addition, 
govern could ass the impact on job creation of their polici and investments, 
much a they current ass the impact of polici on the environment. compani 
could be encourag to invest in worker train and redeploy through tax and 
other incentives, just a they often be for their research and develop investments; 
in some countries, that will mean reconsid tax code that provid subsidi 
(through interest) for invest in capit while tax labor. the step-up scenario 
in thi report show the valu in job-creat term of rais public—and, with it, 
private—invest in infrastructure, afford housing, and energi effici and 
climat change. such invest will need to go hand-in-hand with other back for 
job creation, includ support entrepreneurship and small busi creation by 
streamlin regul and revisit person bankruptci law that discourag risk- 
taking, for example. 

 modern data collect on the labor market. govern survey of household 
and employ be the gold standard of nation econom data. but these be time- 
consuming. In today’ dynam chang world, govern need to supplement 
these survey with real-tim data on the adopt of autom technologies, 
job openings, labor market dynamism, skill in demand, and how individu be 
cop with job transitions.150 the need for good data amount to an opportun for 
govern statist agenc to collabor with onlin sourc of data, includ 
job boards, profession site such a linkedin, and privat tech companies, to obtain 
a more detail and accur pictur of jobs, skills, wages, and individu mobil and 
career moves. 

busi leader should embrac autom and AI while 
care manag workforc transit 
busi leader also have much to gain by earli adopt of autom technologies, 
enabl perform benefit such a qualiti and speed, a well a great effici and 
product use of all factor of production. but busi will also be on the front line of 
the workplac a it changes. success adopt of autom will requir compani 
to re-imagin their entir busi process to take advantag of automation’ benefits, 
rather than mechan attempt to autom individu activ use current 
processes. As part of that review, they will need to reevalu their talent strategi and 
workforc needs, consid how worker can be redeploy to other jobs, and where 
new talent may be required. mani compani be find that it be in their self-interest— 
a well a import for societ responsibility—to train and prepar worker for a new 
world of work. some compani be alreadi work with extern educ provid or 
conduct in-hous training—but mani more could follow suit. 

 acceler deploy of autom and ai. for ceo in all industri and 
countries, develop an autom and AI strategi should be a priority. So far, few firm 
have deploy at scale. In an mgi survey of 3,000 ai-awar c-level executives, across 
10 countri and 14 sectors, onli 20 percent say they use ani AI relat technolog

 redesign busi process to unlock product gains. sinc the IT 
revolut begin in the 1990 it have be clear that captur the valu from new 
technolog requir reimagin how the busi operates, rather than mechan 
appli autom to the current mix of activ and processes. captur the full 
opportun offer by autom will requir compani to conduct a thorough review 
of busi process and workflow and ass where autom could improv 
perform the most. that in turn requir compani to develop or acquir the talent, 
discipline, and know-how to implement the sort of chang that will be need to 
har the full potenti of automation. 

 rethink organiz design. autom adopt be a process that will not happen 
overnight, and the workplac norm for year to come will be peopl work alongsid 
machines. thi have profound implic for the way compani and their workforc be 
structur and organized. until recently, for example, power manufactur robot that 
can lift or weld have be kept well away from humans, often in cages, becaus of the 
risk of accidents. but today’ robot can work intellig and safe alongsid humans. 
such machine-human and machine-machin environ will becom more pervasive, 
and that in turn will requir workflow to change. success rethink organiz 
design will ensur that work be not onli more product and take advantag of the new 
technic possibl available, but that it will becom more meaning and reward 
for people, a the rote aspect of their job be take over by machines, free them 
to use more innat human qualiti includ social and emot reason and 
person interaction. 

 build core digit and analyt capabilities. compani that success adopt the 
late autom and AI technolog typic alreadi have strong digit capabilities. 
indeed, our analysi show that compani that be earli adopt of AI be also 
digit leaders. there be no shortcut to creat a strong digit base. compani will 
need to build the support digit assets, big data and analyt capabl to make 
autom and AI a success. thi includ build the data ecosystem and adopt 
the right advanc analyt techniqu and tools.152 

 adapt talent strategi and manag workforc transitions. busi leader will 
need to ensur that the talent their compani requir to transit to more autom

professionals, a well a retrain worker to play new roles. determin the right mix 
of current talent, redeploy talent, and new talent from outsid the compani will requir 
care consideration. In the new era, stem talent and data scientist will be increasingli 
important—and could provid a last competit advantage. but fill new technic 
posit be expens and time-consum becaus we have not be turn out

As we note in chapter 5, some compani have begin to establish partnership with 
univers and other educ institut to provid train and skill develop

In other sectors, such a health care and manufacturing, there be mani exampl of

individu must prepar for lifelong learn and

individu will need to be prepar for a rapidli evolv futur of work. acquir new skill 
that be in demand and reset intuit about the world of work will be critic for well- 
being. worker everywher will need to reexamin tradit notion of where they work, 
how they work, and what talent and capabl they bring to that work. 

 embrac a “startup of you” mentality. In the rapidli chang futur of work, 
individu will be in charg of their own destini more than ever. the day of plan 
to have one employ for life be long gone. all individu will need to adopt a more 
entrepreneuri approach to navig through the world of work and manag their 
careers. reid hoffman, a co-found of linkedin, call it the “startup of you” approach.154 
individu will becom more profici and comfort with navig a more digit 
job search and manag their person profiles. 

 acquir the skill that will be in demand and embark on a journey of lifelong 
learning. As machin perform a wider rang and varieti of tasks, individu will need 
to put more focu on develop the skill that human excel at. As we have describ 
in thi report, the activ in nearli all occup will change, with more time spent 
on those activ that requir social and emot skills, team work and collaboration, 
creativity, and high level of commun and logic reasoning. both govern 
and busi have a role to play in provid individu with good inform on the 
skill and job in demand. educ play a part a well. secondari school student in 
most countri receiv inadequ instruct and guidanc on how to plan a career in 
today’ workplace, and even less so for a workplac that be rapidli evolving. ultim it 
will be up to individu themselv to think care about what skill will be need and 
how they can demonstr those skill to employers. 

 prepar for a world of digit job search. digit platform for match peopl with 
job and assess skill be rapidli becom the norm for hiring.155 individu will 
need to use these technolog if they be to be competit in the job market. In the 
short term, thi mean put time and care into build a person onlin presence. 
To stand out, they will need to showcas their experience, establish expertis by join

 consid new way of working. not onli do most peopl now cycl through multipl 
employ throughout their careers, but mani be move beyond the tradit full- 
time (or part-time) job altogether. As mani a 30 percent of worker in the unit state 
and europ earn part or most of their incom through independ work—that is, 
freelanc activities, self-employment, or through rapidli expand digit gig or share 
platforms.156 more than 70 percent of those individu say that they prefer independ

creativ and varieti in their work, and even more secur in their income. roughli half 
of independ worker supplement their incom from tradit job (or pensions) with 
these activities. In a world where wage be depress for peopl without the skill in

ultimately, autom may forc u all to reassess basic notion of work. In capitalist 
economies, individu earn most of their incom through appli their labor; except for 
the disabled, all of u be born with an endow of labor from which to earn income, but 
onli a privileg few be born with capital. In mani decad hence, the valu of thi labor

thi report continu and adapt the methodolog and find of the januari 2017 
mckinsey global institut report, A futur that works: automation, employ and 
productivity. A full methodolog of that work be detail in it technic appendix; we will 
provid onli a brief summari here and how it be appli in thi report. 

In that report, the technic potenti for autom of the global economi and project 
adopt rate be determin by an analysi of the underli work activ for each 
occupation, cover 46 countries. It us databas publish by institut includ 
the world bank and the US bureau of labor statist 2014 o*net databas to break down 
about 800 occup into more than 2,000 activities, and determin the perform 
capabl need for each activ base on the way human current perform them. 
the report further break down activ into 18 capabl and ass their technic 
autom potential. thi framework be inform by academ research, intern expertise, 
and industri experts. our report focu on 2016–30, and thu take the autom 
adopt percentag through 2030. much of the occup data, at the time of origin 
analysis, be harmon through 2014. We adopt the simplif of refer to 2016 
a the start point of the analysis, and project in 2014 data (such a occup mix) 
into 2016 baselin (for example, autom adopt percentages). 

In thi report, we use these find to size the number of job that could be autom 
by 2030. We make an assumpt that each hour of work that could be autom will 
result in proport job loss, for exampl if 10 percent of current work activ hour in an 
occup will be automated, then 10 percent of job in that occup will be displaced. A 
priori, it be unclear if thi assumpt be conserv or aggressive. base on what we have 
see historically, we expect in mani case that the result of activ be autom will 
be a redistribut of effort on other exist or new activities. however, it be also possibl 
that with automation, exist work process could be radic overhaul and reduc 
in complexity, reduc labor demand even further beyond autom potenti of current 
activities. We have not model these countervail effects.

To calcul the work hour autom in 2030, we multipli the autom adopt 
percentag by the size of the labor forc in 2030. By do this, we assum that the 
occup mix of the economi and the underli work activ in each occup in 
2030 be the same a today. thi be a conserv assumption, becaus in reality, we would 
expect that job will not be add back at the same occup mix and that new job will 
be add in less automat sectors. 

To estim the size of the 2030 labor force, we use popul project from the unit 
nations, labor forc particip project from the intern labour organization, 
and the natur unemploy rate for oecd countries. for countri outsid the oecd, we 
use the maximum unemploy rate of either 2007 or 2012 to adjust for the effect of the 
2008 global financi crisi on unemployment. 

2. labor demand driver 
our work examin the labor demand creat by seven catalysts. We select these seven 
from a shortlist of 20 after conduct high-level size calcul to estim their potenti 
to creat labor demand by 2030. 

for catalyst that includ a per caput metric, such a spend on automobil or number of 
health-car professionals, we includ popul growth through 2030 base on project 
from the unit nations. 

We captur direct and indirect job that could be creat from each catalyst, take into 
account the declin in hour work per person, and factor in global of work. our 
model offer a static view of the potenti labor demand that could be creat from the 
seven driver and do not factor in supply-demand dynam and feedback from factor 
such a chang in wage levels. It estim potenti labor demand; whether thi potenti 
be captur will depend on the choic and invest make by businesses, policy- 
makers, and workers. the scenario we construct do not take into account ani sourc of 
labor demand outsid of our seven driver that could play an import role in determin 
the futur of work. We do not model entir new industri and occup that could 
exist in the future, in part enabl by technology; studi have show that on average, 
0.5 percent of the workforc have be work in “new jobs” per year in the past coupl 
of decades.157 We do not take into account sector shift in industri that be not directli 
relat to automation, such a the rise of e-commerc in retail. We also do not model 
chang in work structure, such a the growth of the “gig” economy, or activ within an 
occup that could chang a a result of technolog innovation.

increas prosper be the underli driver of mani (but not all) of the labor demand 
sizings. given the static modular model approach that we have taken, we have take 
gdp per caput growth a an input to our driver models. 

We use the mckinsey global growth model (ggm) projections. the ggm be a global 
macroeconom model that track long term econom trend and gener project 
under a rang of scenarios. for the input to our labor demand modeling, we use the ggm’ 
baselin scenario where available. for countri that the ggm do not model and for 
japan and mexico, we use project from oxford economics. see exhibit A1 for the gdp/ 
caput project in use. 

job multipli 
for driver of labor demand in which we be model an increas in spend, we use job 
multipli from input-output tabl to calcul the number of job creat through each 
addit dollar of spend. In mani driver base on linear regress analysi (for example, 
rise consum spending), the gener size approach for the number of job creat 
increment to 2014 level be captur in the follow formula: 

To take into account project increas in product between 2014 and 2030, we adjust 
2014 job multipli for project product gain (from factor other than automation) to 
creat a 2030 job multiplier. 

for all labor drivers, we calcul indirect job use indirect job multipli from mckinsey 
input-output tabl base on sourc data from the world input-output database, make 
adjust a necessari inform by expert input. 

To avoid double-counting, we remov particular indirect multipli if they may overlap 
with our drivers. for example, we exclud all indirect effect in healthcare, educ and 
construction, sinc we have size these driver independently. thi may undercount job 
creation in these areas.

global of trade 
for driver that includ tradabl good and services, we use data from the intern 
trade organ and ih global insight to model level of import and export in our 46 
countri set. In driver with global trade, we model both locally- and globally-driven labor 
demand. We keep thi model of global trade constant between today and 2030, a shift 
in global be beyond the scope of our analysis. thi approach would result in an 
underestim of job creation in countri whose global export share in 2030 would be 
great than today’ shares, and similarli overestim of job creation in countri whose 
share of global export in 2030 would be low than today’s. 

trendlin and step-up scenario 
for three of our seven drivers—infrastructure, residenti and commerci buildings, energi 
transit and efficiency—w model two scenarios. these be a trendlin scenario, base 
on the observ pattern across countri that vari by factor such a gdp per capita, 
and a step-up scenario, which be base on further chang that could boost labor demand 
abov the trendlin scenario. for our seventh driver, the market of previous unpaid 
work, we have onli model a step-up scenario. We describ the assumpt for these 
scenario in the relev section below. 

catalyst 1: rise incom 
our rise incom driver repres increas in consum spend a well a overal 
spend on health care and educ that result from increas prosper (that is, rise 
gdp per capita) in countries. We have take gdp per caput project a an exogen 
input to our model for all driver relat to chang in spend. 

for consum spending, we use univari regress analysi to identifi spend trend 
by categori use 2014 gdp per caput and 2014 consumpt per caput data for the 
46 countri in our model. while gdp per caput chang from 2014 to 2030 a the 
independ variable, we model chang in spend by categori for accommod and food 
services, automobiles, clothing, financi services, food, household goods, leisur goods, 
leisur services, and utilities. (we exclud some categori of consum spend to avoid 
doubl counting, such a public transport, which could overlap with our infrastructur 
driver). An adjust be make across categori to cap overal consumption, to ensur 
that our regress analysi do not impli a major shift in consumpt per capita. To do 
this, we scale overal consumpt to a low and high scenario, base on consumpt per 
caput project from the ggm. We then multipli the 2014 and 2030 spend by 2014 and 
2030 job multipliers, respectively. the productivity-adjust 2030 job multipli account 
for an increas in productivity, which drive some consumpt categori to have neg 
job growth in countri where product growth outstrip demand growth, such a the 
agricultur sector in india. additionally, we use indirect job multipli to captur the demand 
creat in other sector that suppli to these sectors. 

good and servic model under rise incom be determin to be tradabl or non- 
tradable, and the labor demand for those which be tradabl be distribut accord to 2014 
level of global trade. 

given the discrep between countri in fund model for educ and health care, 
these driver have be size separ from the rest of consum spending, despit some 
proport of educ and health care spend be fund directli by consumers. for 
both these sectors, we model the full sector, which would includ that fund by consum 
a well a public and privat sector funding.

We see a trend toward increas number of job in educ a gdp per caput rises. 
We model thi relationship through univari regress on student-teach ratio and 
gross enrol rate across primary, secondary, and tertiari level use 2014 data for 
all 46 countri in our model. We also captur the effect of age populations; if there be low 
popul growth and the popul be aging, thi decreas educ jobs, and vice 
versa. the gener formula we use is: 

We use thi to model project educ job in 2030, then subtract the number of job in 
2014 to size the increment labor demand in education. We then use indirect job multipli 
to captur job creat in other sector that be supplier to the educ sector. 

catalyst 2: health care: rise incom and age 
In addit to rise incom increas demand for job in health care, age popul 
in mani countri will likewis rais health-car demand. We model these effect of rise 
incom and age togeth to avoid double-count the increas in healthcar jobs. 

the chang in the number of health-car job be model through bivari linear regress 
with 2014 gdp per caput and age (share of popul over 65 in 2014) a independ 
variabl and health-car profession per 1000 peopl in 2014 a the depend variabl 
for all 46 countri in our model. We use thi trendlin to model the increas in health-car 
profession a gdp per caput increas and popul age from 2014 to 2030 levels. 
We includ all part of the health-car deliveri sector includ hospit care, home care, 
nurs homes, and other support roles. We then use indirect job multipli to captur job 
creat in other sector that be supplier to the health-car sector. 

catalyst 3: develop and deploy of new technolog 
We identifi trend between rise gdp per caput and spend on inform technology. for 
enterpris IT spend, we find that a country’ gdp be correl with the amount spent on 
hardware, software, and IT services. for consum technolog spend, we consid onli the 
hardwar and softwar compon of spend, and find that the richer the popul (i.e. 
the high gdp per capita) the high spend on technolog goods. We use univari linear 
regress analysi to find a relationship between 2014 gdp per caput a the independ 
variabl and each categori of IT spend per caput in 2014 (includ consum and 
enterpris spending) a the depend variabl across all 46 countries. these categori 
of IT spend be then multipli by productivity-adjust job multipli for 2014 and 2030 
to calcul net new jobs. all data be base on histor baselin from gartner’ market 
databook publish in the first quarter of 2017.158 finally, we use indirect multipli to 
captur job creat in sector suppli to the IT sector.

As the consum technolog element of rise incom be captur within thi driver, we 
omit it from the rise incom driver. likewise, sinc telecommun and electr 
util be captur in the infrastructur driver, we do not consid increas in technolog 
infrastructur spend a part of our technolog definit in order to avoid double-counting. 
finally, thi driver assum technolog spend growth accord to current trend and thu 
do not consid the scenario of extraordinari technolog spend that be possibl in 
more rapid autom scenarios. 

catalyst 4: infrastructur invest 
In our trendlin scenario for infrastructur investment, we conduct univari regress 
analysi with gdp per caput a the independ variabl and infrastructur spend per 
caput a the depend variabl on 2014 cross-countri data. from this, we estim 
infrastructur spend in 2014 and in 2030, use gdp per caput projections. these 2014 
and 2030 infrastructur spend number be then multipli by 2014 and 2030 job multipli 
for the construct sector, respectively, to estim job in each year. 2030 job multipliers, 
a with other catalysts, be calcul use product growth a discuss below. the 
differ be the increment addit of new infrastructur job between 2014 and 2030. 

In our step-up scenario, we model a step-up in which countri have increas their 
infrastructur stock to a global benchmark of 70.5 percent of total gdp. thi result in 
high run-rat infrastructur spend in order to attain and maintain the infrastructur 
70.5 percent benchmark, account for both gdp growth (acceler in our step-up 
scenario) and depreciation. In all, thi amount to between $4 trillion and $4.5 trillion 
annual spend for econom infrastructur (transport, water, and power) compar 
with $2.1 trillion to $3 trillion in the trendlin scenario. We assum annual non-autom 
product increas rang from 1.5 percent to 4.8 percent in some emerg market 
countri base on histor trend (1.5 percent in china, 4.8 percent in kenya, nigeria, 
and the philippines, and no product increas elsewhere). By the same method a the 
trendlin scenario, we multipli 2014 and 2030 spend by job multipli for the construct 
sector to estim gross new jobs. includ in the rang of our step-up scenario estim 
be addit annual non-autom product increas in the remain emerg 
market countri of 2.5 percent. thi product adjust would good indic the 
rang of possibl outcom in emerg market countries; in advanc economies, give 
low histor growth in productivity, we do not assum non-autom product will 
increas even in the low rang of the step-up scenario. finally, we use indirect job multipli 
to captur job creat in sector that suppli the construct sector. 

catalyst 5: residenti and commerci build 
As with infrastructure, we have model two scenario for residenti and commerci 
buildings. for the trendlin scenario, we again conduct univari regress analyses, 
just a we do for infrastructure. for the step-up scenario, we model an increas of stock 
in structur to a US benchmark of 2.3 time that of total gdp, in line with data from the 
bureau of econom analysis, and adjust downward for double-count with infrastructure, 
inclus of industri structures, and spend on equip outsid of the construct 
sector. thi amount to $8.2 trillion to $9.8 trillion annual spend for build and 
structur (includ residential, commerci and industri structures) compar with 
$3.8 trillion to $5.5 trillion in the trendlin scenario. As with the infrastructur catalyst, we also 
appli 1.5 to 4.8 percent product growth assumpt in select countri in the trendlin 
scenario, and 2.5 percent annual non-autom product increas to remain 
emerg market countri in the low rang of the step-up scenario.

catalyst 6: energi transit and effici 
the energi transit driver captur the potenti job creation due to the shift in mix of 
electr generation. the potenti increas in job in electr power gener due to 
increas in demand for power be captur in the util categori of consum spend 
driven by rise incomes. We avoid doubl count by isol the mix shift effect in 
thi driver. use mckinsey model scenario for gigawatt (gw) capac in 2030, 
we multipli project GW capac by a job per GW multipli across manufacturing, 
decommissioning, fuels, construction/installation, oper and mainten by energi 
type (such a solar, coal, gas). given the rapid and hard-to-predict chang in product 
across the renew valu chain, we model a minimum scenario in which rapid 
product growth continues, and a maximum scenario in which product gain plateau. 
To model a step-up scenario, we increas the GW capac shift more heavili toward 
renew target that could help slow global temperatur increas to two degre 
celsiu abov pre-industri levels. thi increas shift result in great number of job 
creat to chang the energi gener mix by country. 

We model potenti spend on energi effici use estim from the intern 
energi agency’ 2014 world energi invest outlook report. We use two scenario 
that the iea models: a “new polici scenario” and a “450 scenario.” In the new polici 
scenario, which be group with our other trendlin drivers, “energi demand and suppli 
project reflect energi polici and measur that have be adopt a of earli 2014, 
a well a other commit that have be announced, but not implemented, take a 
cautiou view of the extent to which these may be realized.”159 for our step-up analysis, we 
use the iea’ 450 scenario which “plot an emissions-reduct path for the energi sector 
consist with the intern goal to limit the rise to long-term averag temperatur to 
two degre celsius.”160 In both scenarios, we use job multipli to estim the number of 
increment job associ with the increas in spend that the iea project between 2014 
and 2030, and use indirect multipli to captur job creat in other suppli sectors. 

catalyst 7: market of current unpaid work 
We model the market of current unpaid work sole a a step-up labor demand 
driver. We use local time-us survey to understand the amount of time spent in variou 
countri on unpaid domest work includ cooking, cleaning, childcar and elder care. 
We decreas the time spent on these activ in each countri use a linear coeffici 
between the minimum and maximum valu across countries. We then make assumpt 
around product gain in each activ through profession to estim the 
potenti for new labor demand creation. 

3. macroeconom analysi 
We use mckinsey’ global growth model to dynam model the US economy. given 
both the unemploy and product effect of automation, we use the model to 
determin the gdp growth need to return the economi to full employ by 2030. 

Of the autom effect modeled, we directli includ four channel by which autom 
affect the economy: unemploy displacement, capit investment, total factor 
product growth, and reemploy rate. three of the four channel be output from 
the mgi autom model. We take the unemploy displac a the midpoint 
displac directli from the autom model; capit invest a the solut cost 
give in the autom model; and total factor product a the impli product 
growth from autom that would at the minimum result in constant total output. 

159 world energi invest outlook, intern energi agency, 2014. 
160 ibid. 



technic appendix mckinsey global institute138 

besid the output from the autom model, we also includ a fourth channel, 
the reemploy rate, which describ how displac actual translat into 
unemployment. not everi displac worker will enter unemployment; some will have the 
skill and the opportun to quickli transit into a new role. We defin the reemploy 
rate a the percentag of displac worker expect to return to work within the year; the 
remain displac worker enter unemployment. 

On top of the four channels, we model four differ labor market scenarios. each 
of the four scenario use a differ reemploy rate—low, medium, high, or full 
reemployment—to describ condit such a labor market flexibility, labor market slack, 
skill and geograph mismatch, etc. that could influenc the rate at which displac 
worker return to work. for the unit states, we use a 25 percent reemploy rate in 
the low scenario, 49 percent reemploy rate in the medium scenario (the reemploy 
rate of displac worker in januari 2010), 66 percent in the high scenario (the 
reemploy rate of displac worker in januari 2016), and 100 percent reemploy 
in the full reemploy scenario. the model unemploy displac and capit 
invest by countri be held constant in all scenarios. for example, in the unit 
states, the model unemploy displac be 23 percent by 2030, and expect 
autom capit invest $145 billion by 2030. the reemploy rate for each of the 
labor market scenario differ by countri and be estim from literatur and adjust 
for labor market flexibl factors. 

the ggm first forecast a baselin futur without take into account the effect of 
automation. It then us the input unemploy displacement, capit investment, 
total factor product growth, and reemploy rate, and dynam propag these 
effect of autom throughout the model economy. the forecast unemploy 
rate, gdp growth rate, and averag wage rate from the ggm be to be interpret by their 
deviat from the baselin state a a direct rang of scenario for sever possibl 
futur states. 

4. skill and wage analys 
In thi analysis, we look at the net impact of (i) autom and (ii) labor demand creation at 
an occup level, to understand which occup could see high level of demand vs. 
declin by 2030. 

baselin for skill and wage analysi 
the baselin for our skill and wage analysi be the 2014 employ level by occupation, 
adjust for the effect of autom and our labor demand drivers. element of the 
economi in which we have not size growth (such a defense) remain at 2014 level of 
employment; new occup that do not current exist do not show in thi baseline. 

map new labor demand and autom to job 
our autom model be map to each of the 820 occup code use by the 
US bureau of labor statist for all of the 46 countri in our model. We multipli the 
percentag autom adopt rate in 2030 for each occup by the size of each 
occup in 2030 (which be assum to be the same percentag of labor forc a in 2014). 
thi provid u with a project of how the employ level in job will be affect by 
autom in 2030. 



139job lost, job gained: workforc transit in a time of automationmckinsey global institut 

To model the countervail effect on labor demand creation, we map our driver of demand 
accord to a list of associ occup on a driver-by-driv basis. most driver map 
to a specif sector, in which case we alloc increment new job accord to today’ 
mix of job within a specifi sector. In driver that affect a narrow rang of jobs, we 
creat more custom map to reflect reality. for example, for energi transit and 
efficiency, we map potenti labor demand increas to the US bureau of labor statistics’ 
categor of “green jobs” and to the relev job in fuels. base on the sector of each 
direct job added, addit indirect job be creat base on the specifi job multipli 
for a country. indirect job be creat accord to the mix of their sector. 

combin these two calculations, we compar the total job displac by autom 
base on our 2030 baselin (today’ occup mix, scale in proport with the growth 
of labor force) to the job add by our driver to 2030. To calcul a percentag growth or 
decline, we divid thi net chang by today’ employ level for the occupation. 

skill and educ categor 
our analysi take train requir for job a a proxi for skill requirements. the five 
educ categori use in our analysi are: less than secondary, secondary, associ 
degree, bachelor’ degre and advanc degree. these classif map to the five 
job-zon defin by the US bureau of labor statistics’ o*net and take into account 
educ degrees, amount of train required, and year of experi necessari in 
order to qualifi for a give job. associ degre be more common in the unit state 
than in the rest of the world and usual requir two year of study. 

To optim for consist across our model and data quality, we use these educ 
requir from the o*net classif across all 46 countries. thi simplifi 
assumpt be limit in case in which there be discrep among countries, but we 
find that requir be broadli similar: the educ requir to be a doctor be 
typic an advanc degre in most countries. 

wage assumpt 
In our analysi on the effect of autom and new labor demand on wages, we keep 
wage constant at 2014 levels; chemic engineers, economist and lawyer be in the 
high decil of wage earner in 2014 in the unit states, where they remain for our 
analysi in 2030. 

In reality, we would expect wage to adjust to shift in respons to autom and new 
labor demand. there could also be addit econom effect on wages, such a 
baumol’ cost disease, or polici effect such a minimum wage legislation. model 
these effect on wage be beyond the scope of our analysis, so we exclud them in favor of 
keep wage constant at 2014 levels. while we thu cannot say anyth definit about 
wage shift and be limit in ani commentari on inequality, our approach allow u to 
identifi rel shift between high-wag and low-wag occupations.
