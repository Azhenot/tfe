limit efficiency, call the detail balanc limit of efficiency, have be calcul for an ideal case in which 
the cmli recombin. ~echan of hole-electron pair be radi a requir by the principl of detail

calcul with band gap and f. a parameters, the sun and cell be assum to be blackbodi with tem- 
peratur of 6oo0 oK and 30(tk, ~espectively. the maxim~m effici be found to be 30% for an energi gap 
of 1.1. ev and fc= 1: actual junction do not obey the predict current-voltag relationship, and reason for 
the differ and it relev to effici be discussed. 

1. introduct 

M ani paper have be write about the effi-ci of solar cell employ p-n junction in 
semiconductors, the great potenti of the silicon solar 
cell have be emphas by chapin, fuller and 
pearson! in 1954. also in 1954, pfann and van roos- 
broeck2 give a more detail treatment includ ana- 
lytic express optim or match the load. A 
further treatment be give by prince3 in 1955 in 
which the effici be calcul a a function of'th 
energi gap. loferski4 have attempt to predict the de- 
pendenc of effici upon energi gap in more detail. 
review paper have recent appear in two journal 
in thi country.5,6 

the treatment of effici present in these paper 
be base on empir valu for the constant de-

e~ciencies, and predict certain limits. these predic-

and compar with the semi empir limit in fig. 1. 
actual the two limit be not extrem different, the 
detail balanc limit be at most high by about 
50% in the rang of energi gap of chief interest. thus, 
to some degree, thi articl be concern with a matter 
of principl rather than practic values. the differ 
be much more significant, however, insofar a estim 
potenti for improv be concerned. In fact, the 
detail balanc limit may lie more than twice a far 
abov the achiev valu a do the semiempir 
limit, thu suggest much great possibl improve- 
ment (see fig. 1). 

the situat at present may be understood by 
analog with a steam power plant. If the second law of 
thermodynam be unknown, there might still exist 
quit good calcul of the effici of ani give 
configur base on heat of combustion, etc. how- 
ever, a seriou gap would still exist sinc it would be 
~mpossibl to say how much the effici might be 
improv by reduct of bear friction, improv 
heat exchangers, etc. the second law of thermody- 
namic provid an upper limit in term of more funda- 
mental quantiti such a the temperatur of the ex- 
otherm reaction and the temperatur of the heat sink. 
the merit of a give power plant can then be apprais 
in term of the limit set by the second law. 

A similar situat exist for the solar cell, the miss 
theoret effici being, of course, in no way com- 
parabl in import to the second law of thermo- 
dynamics. factor such a seri resist and reflec- 
tion loss correspond to friction in a power plant. there 
be even two temperatures, that of the sun T. and that 
of the solar cell te. the effici of a solar convert 
can in principl be brought to the thermodynam 
limit (t.-tc)jtc by use reflectors, etc. 8 however, a 
planar solar cell, without concentr of radiat 
cannot approach thi limit. the limit it can approach 
depend on it energi gap and certain geometr 
factor such a the angl sub tend by the sun and the

footnot 7) have use the second law of thermodynam in their 
treatment of photovoltage.

angl of incid of the radiation, and certain other 
less basic degrad factors, which in principl may 
approach unity, such a the absorpt coeffici for 
solar energi strike the surface. 

among the factor which may approach unity, at 
least so far a the basic law of physic be .concerned, 
be the fraction of the recombin between hole and 
electron which result in radiation. radi recom- 
binat set an upper limit to minor carrier life- 
time. the lifetim due to thi effect have be calcu- 
late use the principl of detail balance.9 It be thi 
radi recombin that determin the detail 
balanc limit for efficiency.lo If radi recombina- 
tion be onli a fraction fe of all the recombination, then 
the effici be substanti reduc below the de- 
tail balanc limit. 

how close ani exist materi can approach the 
desir limit of uniti for fe be not known. exist 
silicon solar cell fail to fit the current-voltag charac- 
terist predict on the basi of ani of the exist 
recombin models.u the extent of thi discrep 
and one suggest explan be discuss in sec. 6. 

In determin the detail balanc limit of effici- 
ency, the effici '1/ calcul below be defin in the 
usual way a the ratio of power deliv to a match 
load to the incid solar power imping on the cell. 
the follow section present a step-by-step calcula- 
tion of thi effici a a function of the essenti 
variables, includ sever which may reduc the effi- 
cienci below the detail balanc limit. three of these 
variabl have the dimens of energi and can be 
express a temperatures, voltag or frequencies. 
these variabl are: the temperatur of the sun t., 

kt.=gv.; 

the temperatur of the solar cell T e,

with the formula of the planck distribution. We de- 
note by Qs the number of quantum of frequenc great

we shall also introduc the symbol q(vg,ts) in order to 
be abl to repres situat for differ valu of

these author interpret thi result in term of a threshold of 
about 2eg for an electron to produc a pair. however, the data 
can be well fit up to quantum yield great than two by 
assum a threshold of onli slightli more than ii. and assum 
the energi divid equal between the photohol and the pho- 
toelectron. thi effect would slightli increas the possibl quan- 
tum efficiency; however, we shall not consid it further in thi

3. current-voltag relationship 
for A solar cell 

In thi section we shall consid a solar cell sub- 
ject to radiat from the sun, which be consid 
to subtend a small solid angl a repres in fig. 
2 (b). the treatment will be base upon determin 
the steadi state current-voltag condit which pre- 
vail on the basi of requir that hole-electron pair 
be elimin a rapidli a they be produced. In 
order to carri out the calculation, five process must 
be considered: (1) gener of hole-electron pair by 
the incid solar radiation, the rate for the entir 
devic be fs; (2) the radi recombin of 
hole-electron pair with result emiss of photons, 
the rate be fe; (3) other nonradi process 
which result in gener and (4) recombin of 
hole-electron pairs; and (5) remov of hole from the 
p-type region and electron from the n-type region in 
the form of a current I which withdraw hole-electron 
pair at a rate II q. the steadi state current-voltag 
relationship be obtain by set the sum of these 
five process equal to zero. 

consid first the net rate of gener of hole- 
electron pair for the solar batteri of fig. 2 (a) under 
the condit in which it be surround by a blackbodi 
at it own temperature, tc¬•-o. under these condit 
photon with frequenc high than Vo will be incid 
per unit area per unit time on the surfac at a rate 
qe, where qe=q(vy,tc) a give by eq. (2.2). evid 
Qc be a function of the form te3 time a function of 
xol xc. the number of these photon which enter the 
cell and produc hole-electron pair be repres by 

14 for the calculations, numer tabl of the integr in- 
volv be use a give by K. H. bohm and B. schlender, Z. 
astrophysik 43, 95 (1957). We be indebt to A. unsold who 
direct our attent to thi publication. A conveni aid to 
such calcul be a slide rule, manufactur by A. G. thornton, 
ltd., manchester, england. It be describ by W. makowski, 
rev. sci. instr. 20, 884 (1949). 

15 similar conclus have be reach by H. A. muser, Z. 
physik, 148, 385 (1957), who estim approxim 47% for the 
maximum of u(xa), but do not show a curve. result similar 
to those describ abov have also be deriv by W. teutsch, 
in an intern report of gener atom divis of gener 
dynamics, and by H. ehrenreich and E. O. kane, in an intern 
report of the gener electr research laboratories. A curv 
which be quantit nearli the same have also be published, 
sinc the submiss of thi article, by M. wolf (see footnot 6) 
who defin the ordin a "portion of sun' energi which be 
util in pair production," a definit have the same quan- 
tit signific but a differ interpret from our 
quantiti u(xy).

give by

in which the factor fw be a geometr factor, take 
into account the limit angl from which the solar 
energi fall upon the body. t8 be the probabl that 
incid photon will produc a hole-electron pair and 
may differ from te becaus of the differ in the 
spectral distribut of the blackbodi radiat at

flection coeffici or transmiss coeffici for the 
surfac of the battery. 

the geometr factor fw be depend upon the 
solid angl subtend by the sun and the angl of 
incid upon the solar battery. the solid angl sub- 
tend by the sun be denot by W s , where

and D, L are, respectively, the diamet and distanc 
of the sun, take a 1.39 and 149 million km. 

If the solar cell be isotrop (i.e., be itself a sphere) 
then it be evid that fw should be simpli the fraction 
of the solid angl about the sphere subtend by the 
sun, so that

(3.6) 

(3.7) 

It be evid that the rate of gener of hole-electron 
pair by solar photon involv the same factor so that 
thi valu of f", should be use in eq. (3.2). the black- 
bodi radiat from the cell come from an area of 
2ap so that 

(3.8) 

the rate of recombination, with result radiation, 
of hole-electron pair depend upon the disturb 
from equilibrium. for the case in which the batteri be 
in equilibrium, and be surround by a blackbodi at 
temperatur T e, the rate of emiss of photon due to 
recombin must be exactli equal to the rate of 
absorpt of photon which produc recombination. 
As discuss above, thi be give by feo in eq. (3.1). 
To begin with, we shall consid that the onli radi 
recombin of import be direct recombin 
between free hole and electron and be accordingli 
proport to the product of the hole ~nd electro.n 
density, i.e., to the product np. when th1 product 1S 
equal to the thermal equilibrium valu n?, the rate .of 
recombin will be F co. accordingli we may wnte 
for fe, the rate of radi recombin throughout 
the cell, 

F e(v)=f conp/ni2=f cO exp(v lye), (3.9) 

in which V repres the differ in imref or quasi- 
fermi level for hole and electrons, and the product 
np be proport to the boltzmann factor for thi 
differ express a a voltage.i6 V be evid the 
voltag between the termin connect to the p- and 
n-region of the solar celli7 ; I' e stand for ktci q. 

the net rate of increas of hole-electron pair in- 
volves, in addit to generation, correspondi~g ~o f!., 
and recombination, correspond to fe, nonradlatlv 
process and remov of hole-electron pair by current 
to the extern circuit. the nonradi recombin 
and gener process be repres by r(v) and 
r(o) respectively. they will be equal for V =0, the 
thermal equilibrium condition. the algebra sum of 
the rate of increas of hole-electron pair must vanish

o=f.-fe(v)+r(o)-r(v)-i/q (310) 
= fs- F co+[f eo- fe(v)+ r(o) - r(v) J- II q. . 

In eq. (3.10) the quantiti in squar bracket repre- 
sent the net rate of gener of hole-electron pair 
when the cell be surround by a blackbodi at tempera- 
ture te. If the cell be so surrounded, it be evid that 
the term f.-feo vanishes. the steadi state condition, 
under these circumstances, give the current-voltag 
characterist of the cell in the absenc of a disturb 
in the radiat field. On the other hand, if the cell be 
surround by cold space, it will gener a small 
open-circuit revers voltag due to the -feo term. 

In order to describ the current-voltag character- 
istic of the cell we introduc the quantiti fe, which 
repres the fraction of the recombination-gener 
current which be radiative. thi lead to 

for the particularli simpl case, which occur in ger- 
manium p-n junctions, that the nonradi recom- 
binat fit the ideal rectifi equation, we can write 

r(v)=r(o) exp(v ive). (3.12) 

for thi condit fe be a constant independ of 
voltage, and be give by 

(3.13) 

under these condit the current-voltag character- 
istic for the cell in the absenc of radi disturb 
be give by 

where 
I =io[1-exp(vive)], 

io=q[feo+r(o)] 

be the revers satur current. 

(3.14) 

(3.15) 

It be note that thi equat differ in sign from the 
usual rectifi equation, the convent chosen in thi 
paper be that current flow into the cell in what 
be normal the revers direct be regard a positive, 
and voltag across the cell in the normal forward 
direct be also regard a positive. these be the 
polar exist when the illumin cell be furnish- 
ing power to an extern load, so that posit valu 
of I and V correspond to the cell act a a power 
source.

.')oook, Q c be 1.7 X loa cm-2 secl ‚Ä¢ thu per cm2 of sur- 
face the recombin current be 2.7xio-i6 amp. for 
a planar cell with tc= 1 radiat from both side thi 
lead to a contribut to 10 of s.4x1o-16 amp/cm2 of 
junction area, accord to eq. (3.8). As discuss in 
sec. 6, actual cell have current larg by about 10 
order of magnitude, so that je"'" 10-1¬∞. 

In the event that r(v) do not obey eq. (3.12), 
then the quantiti fe must be regard a a function of 



effici OF p-n jcnction solar cell 515 

the voltage, so that [0 must be regard a voltag 
dependent. 

the current-voltag relationship for the cell when 
subject to radiant energi may be obtain by solv- 
ing eq. (3.10) for I. thi lead tol8 : 

1= q(fs- feo)+ (qfeo/ fe)[l-exp(v /ve)j 
= I sh+io[l-exp(v/ve)], 

(3.16) 

in which the symbol i8h repres the short circuit 
current correspond to V = 0, and for the case of a 
planar cell of project area A p be give by 

ish=-q(fs- F co) = qA p(jwt,qs- 2tcqc) 
=qfs=-qa p(fwl,q.). (3.17) 

the last form in eq. (3.17) correspond to the approxi- 
mation that in most condit of interest the solar 
energi fall upon the bodi produc hole-electron 
pair at a rate that be so much larg than would black- 
bodi radiat at the cell' temperatur that the latter 
term can be neglect in comparison with the former. 

the open-circuit voltag vop which the cell would 
exhibit be obtain by solv eq. (3.16) for the case 
of 1=0. thi lead to 

vop= Ve in[(ish/io)+lj 
= Ve in[(fefs/feo)-fe+1]. 

(3.18) 

thi particular solut be valid for the case in which 
R depend upon voltag a give in eq. (3.12). other- 
wise, eq. (3.18) will contain the open-circuit voltag 
in the term 10 on the right side of the equation. 

As discuss in connect with eq. (3.17), for most 
case of interest the solar energi fall on the cell will 
be veri larg compar to blackbodi radiat at the 
temperatur of the cell, and accordingli the term 
which do not involv Fs in eq. (3.18) can be neglect 
in comparison, a long a fe be not too small. thi lead 
to the approxim result 

in which it be see that the geometr and transmiss 
factor togeth with the effect of excess recombin 
over radi recombin may be lump togeth 
in the singl express f, where 

(3.20) 

the factor 2 come from the fact that sunlight fall on 
onli one of the two side of the planar cell. [see 
eq. (3.8).j 

It be thu evid that a far a open-circuit voltag 
be concerned, similar result be produc by ani of the 
four follow variations: (1) reduc the effici of 
transmiss of solar photon into the cell; (2) reduc 

18 equat like (3.16) occur in publish treatment of solar- 
cell efficiency. the differ be that the term in ish due to fco, 
which be small but requir by the principl of detail balance, 
be included, and the coeffici of 10 be relat to the fundament 
minimum revers satur current rather than to a semi- 
empir value.

incid upon the solar cell; or (4) introduc addi- 
tional nonradi recombin processes, thu mak- 
ing small the fraction of the recombin which be 
radiative. 

the maximum open-circuit voltag which may be 
obtain from the cell, in accord with the theori 
presented, be the energi gap vg. thi occur a the 
temperatur of the cell be reduc toward zero. under 
these circumst the quantiti Qe tend toward 
zero and the logarithm in eq. (3.19) to larg values. 
the limit behavior can be understood by note 
that in accord with eq. (2.2) we have 

-lnqe=hvg/ktc+ord of int 
= vu/ve+ord of inte. 

(3.21) 

the term which be of the order Ve int vanish a 
To and Ve approach zero in eq. (3.19), so that 

(3.22) 

At high temperatur the voltag be onli a fraction 
of vg' thi fractionl9 denot by v may be express a 
a function of three of the four variabl discuss in 
the introduct for the import case in which the 
last two term in the In term of eq. (3.18) can be neg- 
lected. the necessari manipul to establish thi 
relationship be a follows:

(3.24) 

where the integrand be each that of eq. (2.2). [for 
case of veri low illumin in which the approxi- 
mation of eq. (3.19) would not hold, v also depend 
explicitli on fe.j

product IV be a maximum. In accord with the 
current-voltag relationship, eq. (3.16), and eq. (3.18)

It be see that the open-circuit voltag be alway

for the "limit convers efficiency." thi curv be in 
agreement with prince3 and loferski4 a report by 
wolf.6 also show be the valu of 14% for silicon solar 
cells, which wolf6 report a the best achiev to date. 

On the basi of the semiempir limit it would 
appear that silicon solar cell might be improv by 
from 14 to 21.7%, an improv of a factor of 1.55. 
On the basi of the detail balanc limit, the improve- 
ment might be 14 to 26% [curv (g)], or a factor of 
1.9. the true physic limit for silicon must lie some- 
where between these two limits.

further in the appendix. the figur also show the 
minimum forward current characterist for a planar

limit set by detail balanc be a true limit determin 
basic by the fact that silicon be element 14 in the

and what process determin it? (2) what determin

effici that the empir data be not in agreement

predict that forward current vari a exp (qv/akt)

to A valu of about two to three at room temperatur 
(see appendix). there be a theori which predict an A 
valu of two over a rang of voltages23 and thi theori 
have recent be confirm for heavili gold-dop 
silicon.24 nevertheless, the calcul of effici 
which give the semiempir curv of fig. 6 be base 
upon the diffus theory. 

the origin of A valu a high a three be at present 
larg a mystery. As discuss in the appendix, two 
explan involv seri resist and surfac 
current can be rejected. 

wolf25 propos that the explan may be intern 
field emiss of the form report by chynoweth and 
mckay.26 such a current will clearli be of the non- 
radi type and will reduc fe. thus, if it occurs, it 
be clear that solar cell can be improv by widen 
the transit region slightli sinc tunnel decreas 
exponenti with the width. If wolf' propos ex- 
planat be correct, therefore, it seem improb 
that it would not have be elimin in the larg 
amount of develop direct toward improv

It be the conjectur of the present author that the 
larg valu of A and larg revers current both aris 
from recombin centers. 

one recent observ which appear to support thi 
view be the find by wolf and prince27 that "optimiza-

cannot be check from the public of wolf and 
prince, who give no data on revers characterist and 
who state, "sinc the solar cell be oper exclus 
in the forward direction, no attent need be paid to 
the revers characterist of the device." thi be not in 
agreement with the view of the present author that 
an attempt should be make to understand a fulli a 
possibl the physic of the p-n junction involved. 

A theori base on recombin center by which 
A valu a high a three may be explain might 
possibl be develop along the follow lines: In a 
forward bia junction the recombin occur pre- 
dominantli in a veri narrow region in which the elec- 
trostat potenti vari by about 2kt / q.23 As the po- 
tential be varied, thi region should move in position. 
If it move into a region of low recombin center 
density, valu of A great than two will arise. If the 
recombin center be highli charged, they may 
be distribut in a veri nonuniform manner through 
the junction.30 ,3! further investigations, which be cur- 
rentli be undertaken, be requir to apprais thi 
theory. If the theori do prove to be correct, import 
improv in solar cell can probabl be make by 
reduc contamin by chemic impurities. 

An exampl of a new area in which a detail balanc 
treatment be need be the propos that a solar cell 
may be improv by add trap to it to absorb the 
longer wavelength radiation.32 It appear to the present 
author that thi may well be equival to shunt 
one cell with a threshold vo=eo/h with anoth cell 
with a threshold much lower. such a combin of 
cell would appear more like to low than to rais 
efficiency. A detail balanc argument, involv onli 
radi transit for the traps, would set an upper 
limit for such a model like that of the curv for fe= 1 
on fig. 5. the present author anticip that trap 
will probabl low thi limit; trap in gener con- 
tribut strongli to recombin becaus they facilit 
deliv energi to phonons. thi impli that trap 
inher have low fe values, so that it be improb 
that they would improv efficiency. 

return briefli to question (1), we may note that 
one inher process which may reduc fe be the auger 
effect, in which the energi of recombin be carri 
off by a hole or an electron.33 anoth mechan that 
may have to be consid be the format of donor 
and acceptor complex at the high dope level em- 
ployed. these may also act a recombin centers. 
In ani junction form at high temperatures, there 
will be certain densiti of vacanc and even disloca-

the reciproc slope (dv /d lnl) of the straight line 
portion of the v-i line be tabul in tabl I a 
v/. [the ratio v//v c correspond to the quantiti A 
in exp(qv / akt) use by other authors. see foot- 
note 11.j 

If the forward current for such cell be repres 
by 

-1 =1* exp(v/v/), 

then the calcul of sec. 5 may be carri forward 
in a straightforward way to obtain an express for 
the effici in term of the same function a in sec. 5. 
the step involv introduc the quantiti 

It then follow that 

j/=qqca/i* 

j*= jc*j",ls/2tc 

vop/vg= (v//vc)v(xg,xc,j*), 

where v be the function of three variabl defin in 
sec. 4. the final express for effici be a function 
of five variables: 

7]* (xy,xc,ts,j*, V / /V c) 
= (t x V / / c) vu(xg)v(xg,xc,j*)m(vxa! xc). 

valu of 1)* calcul for the three cell of fig. 7 
be show in tabl I. the valu for the five variabl 
need for the calcul be a follows: t8=o.97=tc36 ; 
V/ from fig. 6, V c=25.9 mv correspond to 300ok; 
j*= j",j/t./2tc with j",= 1.36x 10-5 in order to give 
100 mw/cm2 on the expos surface; j/=qqcap/i* 
where qqc= 1.6xlo-19 X 1.7 X 103=2.7x 10--16 amp/cm2 ; 
and 1*/ A p be take from fig. 7. 

the fact that the calcul valu of 7]* be about 
twice a larg a the measur valu be evidence, a 
have be point out in the refer cited, of loss 
due to collect efficiency, seri resistance, etc. If 
these loss could be avoided, the cell would have an 
effici of about 14%, which be the high valu 
obtain to date. 6 

thi valu be about half the limit effici of fig. 
6. thu a signific potenti for improv of cell 
appear to exist by improv junction characteristics. 
the first step toward thi improv appear to be 
an understand of the physic behind the high V / 
values.
