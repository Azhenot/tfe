abstract 

In recent years, there have be a huge increas in the number of bot online, vari from 

web crawler for search engines, to chatbot for onlin custom service, spambot on 

social media, and content-edit bot in onlin collabor communities. the onlin world 

have turn into an ecosystem of bots. however, our knowledg of how these autom 

agent be interact with each other be rather poor. bot be predict automaton that 

do not have the capac for emotions, meaning-making, creativity, and social and it be 

henc natur to expect interact between bot to be rel predict and unevent- 

ful. In thi article, we analyz the interact between bot that edit articl on wikipedia. 

We track the extent to which bot undid each other’ edit over the period 2001–2010, 

model how pair of bot interact over time, and identifi differ type of interact trajecto- 

ries. We find that, although wikipedia bot be intend to support the encyclopedia, they 

often undo each other’ edit and these steril “fights” may sometim continu for years. 

unlik human on wikipedia, bots’ interact tend to occur over longer period of time and 

to be more reciprocated. yet, just like humans, bot in differ cultur environ may 

behav differently. our research suggest that even rel “dumb” bot may give rise 

to complex interactions, and thi carri import implic for artifici intellig 

research. understand what affect bot-bot interact be crucial for manag social 

medium well, provid adequ cyber-security, and design well function autonom 

vehicles. 

introduct 

In august 2011, igor labutov and jason yosinski, two phd student at cornel university, let 

a pair of chat bots, call alan and sruthi, talk to each other online. start with a simpl 

greeting, the one-and-a-half-minut dialogu quickli escal into an argument about what 

alan and sruthi have just said, whether they be robots, and about god [1]. the first ever con- 

versat between two simpl artifici intellig agent end in a conflict. 

A bot, or softwar agent, be a comput program that be persistent, autonomous, and reactiv 

[2,3]. bot be defin by program code that run continu and can be activ by 

itself. they make and execut decis without human intervent and perceiv and adapt 

to the context they oper in. internet bots, also know a web bots, be bot that run over the

internet. they appear and prolifer soon after the creation of the world wide web [4]. 

alreadi in 1993, martijn koster publish “guidelin to robot writers,” which contain sug- 

gestion about develop web crawler [5], a kind of bot. eggdrop, one of the first know 

internet relay chat bots, start greet chat newcom also in 1993 [6]. In 1996, fah-chun 

cheong publish a 413-page book, claim to have a current list of all bot avail on 

the internet at that point in time. sinc then, internet bot have prolifer and diversifi 

well beyond our abil to record them in an exhaust list [7,8]. As a result, bot have be 

respons for an increasingli larg proport of activ on the web. for example, one 

studi found that 25% of all messag on yahoo! chat over a period of three month in 2007 

be sent by spam bot [9]. anoth studi discov that 32% of all tweet make by the most 

activ twitter user in 2009 be gener by bot [10], mean that bot be respons 

for an estim 24% of all tweet [11]. further, research estim that bot compris 

between 4% and 7% of the avatar on the virtual world second life in 2009 [12]. A medium ana- 

lytic compani found that 54% of the onlin ad show in thousand of ad campaign in 2012 

and 2013 be view by bots, rather than human [13]. accord to an onlin secur com- 

pany, bot account for 48.5% of websit visit in 2015 [14]. also in 2015, 100,000 account 

on the multi-play onlin game world of warcraft (about 1% of all accounts) be ban 

for use bot [15]. and in the same year, a databas leak reveal that more than 70,000 

“female” bot sent more than 20 million messag on the cheater date site ashley madison 

[16]. 

As the popul of bot activ on the internet 24/7 be grow fast, their interact be 

equal intensifying. An increas number of decisions, options, choices, and servic depend 

now on bot work properly, efficaciously, and successfully. yet, we know veri littl about 

the life and evolut of our digit minions. In particular, predict how bots’ interact 

will evolv and play out even when they reli on veri simpl algorithm be alreadi challenging. 

furthermore, a alan and sruthi demonstrated, even if bot be design to collaborate, con- 

flict may occur inadvertently. clearly, it be crucial to understand what could affect bot-bot 

interact in order to design cooper bot that can manag disagreement, avoid unpro- 

ductiv conflict, and fulfil their task in way that be social and ethic acceptable. 

there be mani type of internet bot (see tabl 1). these bot form an increasingli com- 

plex system of social interactions. Do bot interact with each other in way that be compar

to how we human interact with each other? bot be predict automaton that do not have 

the capac for emotions, meaning-making, creativity, and social [17]. despit recent 

advanc in the field of artifici intelligence, the idea that bot can have moral and cultur 

be still far from reality. today, it be natur to expect interact between bot to be rel 

predict and uneventful, lack the spontan and complex of human social interac- 

tions. however, even in such simpl contexts, our research show that there may be more simi- 

lariti between bot and human than one may expect. focus on one particular human-bot 

community, we find that conflict emerg even among benevol bot that be design to 

benefit their environ and not fight each other, and that bot interact may differ when 

they occur in environ influenc by differ human cultures. 

benevol bot be design to support human user or cooper with them. malevol 

bot be design to exploit human user and compet neg with them. We have classi- 

fie high-frequ trade algorithm a malevol becaus they exploit market in way 

that increas volatil and precipit flash crashes. In thi study, we use data from edit 

bot on wikipedia (benevol bot that gener content). 

We studi bot on wikipedia, the larg free onlin encyclopedia. bot on wikipedia be 

comput script that automat handl repetit and mundan task to develop, improve, 

and maintain the encyclopedia. they be easi to identifi becaus they oper from dedic 

user account that have be flag and offici approved. approv requir that the bot 

follow wikipedia’ bot policy. 

bot be import contributor to wikipedia. for example, in 2014, bot complet about 

15% of the edit on all languag edit of the encyclopedia [18]. In general, wikipedia bot 

complet a varieti of activities. they identifi and undo vandalism, enforc bans, check spell- 

ing, creat inter-languag links, import content automatically, mine data, identifi copyright 

violations, greet newcomers, and so on [19]. our analysi here focu on edit bots, which 

modifi articl directly. We analyz the interact between bot and investig the extent to 

which they resembl interact between humans. In particular, we focu on whether bot 

disagre with each other, how the dynam of disagr differ for bot versu humans, 

and whether there be differ between bot oper in differ languag edit of 

wikipedia. 

To measur disagreement, we studi reverts. A revert on wikipedia occur when an editor, 

whether human or bot, undo anoth editor’ contribut by restor an earli version of 

the article. revert that occur systemat indic controversi and conflict [20–22]. revert 

be technic easi to detect regardless of the context and the language, so they enabl analysi 

at the scale of the whole system. 

our data contain all edit in 13 differ languag edit of wikipedia in the first ten 

year after the encyclopedia be launch (2001–2010). the languag repres edit of 

differ size and editor from divers cultur (see materi and method for details). We 

know which user complet the edit, when, in which article, whether the edit be a revert and, 

if so, which previou edit be reverted. We first identifi which editor be humans, bots, or 

vandals. We isol the vandal sinc their short-liv disrupt activ exhibit differ 

time and interact pattern than the activ of regular wikipedia editors. 

result 

bot constitut a tini proport of all wikipedia editor but they stand behind a signific 

proport of all edit (fig 1A and 1b). there be signific differ between differ lan- 

guag in term of how activ bot are. from previou research, we know that, in small and 

endang languages, bot be extrem activ and do more than 50% of the edits, sometim

up to 100% [19]. their tasks, however, be mainli restrict to add link between articl 

and languages. In larg and activ languages, the level of bot activ be much low but also 

much more variable. 

compar to humans, a small proport of bots’ edit be revert and a small propor- 

tion get revert (fig 1C and 1d). In other words, bot disput other and be disput by oth- 

er to a lesser extent than humans. sinc 2001, the number of bot and their activ have be 

increas but at a slow rate (s1 fig). In contrast, the number of revert between bot have 

be continu increas (fig 2a). thi would suggest that bot interact be not 

becom more efficient. We also see that the proport of mutual bot-bot revert have 

remain rel stable, perhap even slightli increas over time, indic that bot own- 

er have not learn to identifi bot conflict faster (fig 2b). 

In general, bot revert each other a lot: for example, over the ten-year period, bot on 

english wikipedia revert anoth bot on averag 105 times, which be significantli larg 

than the averag of 3 time for human (s1 table). bot on german wikipedia revert each 

other to a much lesser extent than other bot (24 time on average). bot on portugues wiki- 

pedia, in contrast, fight the most, with an averag of 185 bot-bot revert per bot. thi strike 

difference, however, disappear when we account for the fact that bot on portugues wikipe- 

dia edit more than bot on german wikipedia. In general, sinc bot be much more activ

figure). (b) however, bot account for a signific proport of the editori activity. the level of bot activ

their edit reverted, we do not show them in thi figure.

editor than humans, the high number of bot-bot revert do not mean that bot fight more 

than humans. In fact, the proport of bots’ edit that be revert be small for bot than for 

human (fig 1c). thi proport be high for bot in the english and the romance-languag 

edit (spanish, french, portuguese, and romanian). interestingly, although bot in these 

languag revert more often compar to bot in other languages, few of these revert be for 

anoth bot (s2 fig). 

our analysi focu on interact in dyad over time. We model the interact trajecto- 

rie in two-dimension space, where the x-axi measur time and the y-axi measur how 

mani more time the first editor have revert the second compar to the second revert the 

first (fig 3). We analyz three properti of the trajectories: latency, imbalance, and reciprocity. 

latenc measur the averag steep of the interact trajectory, imbal measur the 

distanc between the x-axi and the last point of the trajectory, and reciproc measur the 
trajectory’ jagged (see materi and method below for definitions). 

analyz the properti of the interact trajectori suggest that the dynam of dis- 

agreement differ significantli between bot and humans. revert between bot tend to occur at 

a slow rate and a conflict between two bot can take place over longer period of time, some- 

time over years. In fact, bot-bot interact have differ characterist time scale than 

human-human interact (s3 fig). the characterist averag time between success 

revert for human be at 2 minutes, 24 hours, or 1 year. In comparison, bot-bot interact 

have a characterist averag respons of 1 month. thi differ be like because, first, bot 

systemat crawl articl and, second, bot be restrict a to how often they can make

that have at least one reciproc revert for the period 2001–2010. (a) generally, the number of bot-bot 

revert have be increasing. (b) however, the proport of reciproc revert have not be decreas 

(error bar correspond to one standard error). thi suggest that disagr between bot be not becom 

less common.

edit (the wikipedia bot polici usual requir space of 10 seconds, or 5 for anti-vand 

activity, which be consid more urgent). In contrast, human use automat tool that report 

live chang make to a pre-select list of articl [24,25]; they can thu follow onli a small set 

of articl and, in principle, react instantan to ani edit on those. 

bot also tend to reciproc each other’ revert to a great extent. In contrast, human 

tend to have highli unbalanc interactions, where one individu unilater revert anoth 

one (s4 and S5 figs). 

We quantifi these find more precis by identifi differ type of interact tra- 

jectori and count how often they occur for bot and for humans, a well a for specif 

languages. To thi end, we use k-mean cluster on the three properti of the trajectori 

(latency, imbalance, and reciprocity) and on all bot-bot and human-human interact longer 

than five revert (the result be substant similar without the length restriction). We do 

not claim that the cluster be natur to the data; rather, we use the cluster to compar the 

interact of the differ groups. 

fig 3. typic interact trajectori for bot-bot and human-human pair in english wikipedia in the 

period 2001–2010. the interact trajectori be construct a follows: start from yo = 0, yt = yt-1 + 1 if i 

revert j and yt = yt-1 − 1 if j revert i at time t; the label i and j be assign so that y >= 0 for the major of the 
ij interact time; to compress the extremes, we scale the y-axi to the power of 0.5. the panel show the 

trajectori of 200 pair randomli sampl from those who have exchang more than five reverts. In 

addition, we highlight the four long trajectori in the sampl from each of the four trajectori type we 

identify. compar to human-human interactions, bot-bot interact occur at a slow rate and be more 

balanced, in the sens that revert go back and forth between the two editors.

the algorithm suggest that the data can be best cluster in four trajectori type (s6 fig): 

• fast unbalanc trajectories. these trajectori have low reciproc and latenc and high 

imbalance. they look like smooth vertic line abov the x-axis. 

• slow unbalanc trajectories. these trajectori have low reciproc and high latenc and 

imbalance. they look like smooth diagon line abov the x-axis. 

• somewhat balanc trajectories. these trajectori have intermedi imbal and reci- 

procity. they be somewhat jag and cross the x-axis. 

• well balanc trajectories. these trajectori have low imbal and high reciprocity. 

they be quit jag and center on the x-axis. 

look at the preval of these four type of trajectori for bot and human and across 

languages, we confirm the previou observations: bot-bot interact occur at a slow rate 

and be more balanced, in the sens that revert go back and forth between the two bot (fig 

4). further, we find that bot-bot interact be more balanc in small languag edit of 

wikipedia. thi could be due to the fact that bot be more activ in small edit and 

hence, interact between them be more like to occur. less intuitively, however, thi 

observ also suggest that conflict between bot be more like to occur when there be 

few bot and when, common sens would suggest, coordin be easier. 

discuss 

our result show that, although in quantit differ ways, bot on wikipedia behav and 

interact a unpredict and a ineffici a the humans. the disagr like aris 

from the bottom-up organ of the community, wherebi human editor individu 

creat and run bots, without a formal mechan for coordin with other bot owners.

interact occur at a slow rate and be more balanced, in the sens that revert go back and forth between the two bots. 

further, bot-bot interact be more balanc in small languag edit of wikipedia.

delv deeper into the data, we found that most of the disagr occur between bot that 

special in creat and modifi link between differ languag edit of the encyclo- 

pedia. the lack of coordin may be due to differ languag edit have slightli dif- 

ferent name rule and conventions. 

In support of thi argument, we also found that the same bot be respons for the major- 

iti of revert in all the languag edit we study. for example, some of the bot that revert 

the most other bot includ xqbot, emausbot, siebot, and volkovbot, all bot special in 

fix inter-wiki links. further, while there be few articl with mani bot-bot revert (s7 fig), 

these articl tend to be the same across languages. for example, some of the articl most con- 

test by bot be about pervez musharraf (former presid of pakistan), uzbekistan, estonia, 

belarus, arab language, niel bohr, arnold schwarzenegger. thi would suggest that a sig- 

nific portion of bot-bot fight occur across languag rather than within. In contrast, the 

articl with most human-human revert tend to concern local person and entiti and 

tend to be uniqu for each languag [26]. 

our data cover a period of the evolut of wikipedia when bot activ be growing. evi- 

denc suggest that thi period suddenli end in 2013 (http://stats.wikimedia.org/en/ 

plotspngedithistorytop.htm). thi declin occur becaus at the begin of 2013 mani 

languag edit of wikipedia start to provid inter-languag link via wikidata, which be a 

collabor edit knowledg base intend to support wikipedia. sinc our result be 

larg dictat by inter-languag bots, we believ that the conflict we observ on wikipedia 

no longer occur today. one interest direct for futur research be to investig whether 

the conflict continu to persist among the inter-languag bot that migrat to wikidata. 

wikipedia be perhap one of the best exampl of a popul and complex bot ecosystem 

but thi do not necessarili make it representative. As tabl 1 demonstrates, we have investi- 

gate a veri small region of the botospher on the internet. the wikipedia bot ecosystem be 

gate and monitor and thi be clearli not the case for system of malevol social bots, such 

a social bot on twitter pose a human to spread polit propaganda or influenc public 

discourse. unlik the benevol but conflict bot of wikipedia, mani malevol bot be 

collaborative, often coordin their behavior a part of botnet [27]. however, befor be 

abl to studi the social interact of these bots, we first need to learn to identifi them [28]. 

our analysi show that a system of simpl bot may produc complex dynam and unin- 

tend consequences. In the case of wikipedia, we see that benevol bot that be design 

to collabor may end up in continu disagreement. thi be both ineffici a a wast of 

resources, and inefficacious, for it may lead to local impasse. although such disagr 

repres a small proport of the bots’ editori activity, they nevertheless bring attent to 

the complex of design artifici intellig agents. part of the complex stem from 

the common field of interaction—bot on the internet, and in the world at large, do not act in 

isolation, and interact be inevitable, whether design for or not. part of the complex 

stem from the fact that there be a human design behind everi bot, a well a behind the envi- 

ronment in which bot operate, and that human artifact embodi human culture. As bot con- 

tinu to prolifer and becom more sophisticated, social scientist will need to devot more 

attent to understand their cultur and social life.

content automatically, etc. other bot be non-editing: these bot mine data, identifi vandal- 

ism, or identifi copyright violations. 

In addit to bots, there be also certain autom servic that editor use to streamlin 

their work. for example, there be autom tool such huggl and stiki, which produc a 

filter set of edit to review in a live queue. use these tools, editor can instantli revert the 

edit in question with a singl click and advanc to the next one. there be also user interfac 

extens and in-brows function such a twinkle, rollback, and undo, which also allow 

editor to revert with a singl click. anoth autom servic that be rel recent and 

much more sophist be the object revis evalu servic (ores). It us 

machine-learn techniqu to rank edit with the ultim goal to identifi vandal or low- 

qualiti contributions. 

our research focu on edit bots. our data contain who revert whom, when, and in 

what article. To obtain thi information, we analyz the wikipedia xml dump (https:// 

dumps.wikimedia.org/mirrors.html) of 13 differ languag editions. To detect restor ver- 

sion of an article, a hash be calcul for the complet articl text follow each revis 

and the hash be compar between revis [23]. the data cover the period from the 

begin of wikipedia (januari 15, 2001) until februari 2, 2010 –octob 31, 2011, the last 

date depend on when the data be collect for the particular languag edition. thi time 

period captur the “first generation” of wikipedia bots, a in late years, wikidata take over 

some of the task previous control by wikipedia. the sampl of languag cover a wide 

rang of wikipedia edit in term of size; for example, it includ the four larg edit 

by number of edit and number of editors. In term of cultur diversity, the sampl cover a 

wide rang of geographies. 

wikipedia requir that human editor creat separ account for bot and that the bot 

account name clearli indic the user be a bot, usual by includ the word “bot” (https:// 

en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wikipedia:bot_policy). hence, to identifi the bots, we select all 

account name that contain differ spell variat of the word “bot.” We supplement 

thi set with all account that have current activ bot statu in the wikipedia databas but 

that may not fit the abov criterion (use https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wikipedia:bots/statu 

a of august 6, 2015). We thu obtain a list of 6,627 suspect bots. 

We then use the wikipedia api to check the “user” page for each suspect bot account. 

If the page contain a link to anoth account, we confirm that the current account be a 

bot and link it to it owner. for page that contain zero or more than one link to other 

accounts, we manual check the “user” and “user_talk” page for the suspect bot account 

to see if it be inde a bot and to identifi it owner. the major of manual check account 

be vandal or humans, so we end up with 1,549 bots, each link to it human owner. 

We addit label human editor a vandal if they have all their edit revert by oth- 

ers. thi rule meant that we label a vandal also newcom who becom discourag and 

left wikipedia after all their initi contribut be reverted. sinc we be interest in 

social interact emerg from repeat activity, we do not believ that thi decis affect 

our results. 

use the revert data, we creat a direct two-lay multi-edg network, where owner- 

ship coupl the layer of human editor and the layer of bot [29]. To build the network, we 

assum that a link go from the editor who restor an earli version of the articl (the 

“reverter”) to the editor who make the revis immedi after that version (the “reverted”). 

all link be time-stamped. We collaps multipl bot to a singl node if they be own 

by the same human editor; these bot be usual account for differ gener of the 

same bot with the same function. In the network, revert can be both intra- and inter-layer: 

they occur within the human layer, within the bot layer, and in either direct between the

a revert between a bot and it owner. 

interact trajectori 

We model the interact trajectori in two-dimension space, where the x-axi measur time 

and the y-axi measur the differ between the number of time i have revert j and the 
number of time j have revert i. To construct the trajectories, start from y0 = 0, yt = yt-1 + 1 
if i revert j at time t and yt = yt-1 − 1 if j revert i at time t; the label i and j be assign so that 
y>= 0 for the major of the ij interact time. We analyz three properti of the trajectories: 

• latency. We defin latenc a the mean log time in second between success reverts: 

μ(log10 δt). 

• imbalance. We defin imbal a the final proport of revert between i and j that be 
not reciprocated: |ri − rj| / (ri + rj), where ri and rj be the number of time i revert j and j 
revert i, respectively. 

• reciprocity. We defin reciproc a the proport of observ turn point out of all 

possible: (# turn points) / (ri + rj− 1), where ri and rj be the number of time i revert j 
and j revert i, respectively. A turn point occur when the user who revert at time t be 
differ from the user who revert at time t+1. 

k-mean cluster 

To identifi the number of cluster k that best repres the data, we appli the elbow and sil- 
houett method on trajectori of differ minimum length. the rational behind restrict 

the data to long trajectori onli be that short trajectori tend to have extrem valu on the 

three features, thu possibl skew the results. accord to the elbow method, we would 

like the small k that most significantli reduc the sum of squar error for the clustering. 
accord to the silhouett method, we would like the k that maxim the separ dis- 
tanc between cluster and thu give u the larg silhouett score. 

although the elbow method suggest that four cluster provid the best clustering, the sil- 

houett method indic that the data cannot be cluster well (s8 fig). We do not necessarili 

expect that trajectori cluster naturally; rather, we employ cluster in order to quantifi the 

differ between the interact of bot versu human across languages. We henc ana- 

lyze the cluster with k = 4. thi cluster also have the advantag of yield four type of 
trajectori that intuit make sense.

S1 fig. the number of bots, the number of edit by bots, and the proport of edit do 

by bot between 2001 and 2010. between 2003 and 2008 the number of bot and their activ 

have be increasing. thi trend, however, appear to have subsid after 2008, suggest 

that the system may have stabilized.

S2 fig. for the major of languages, bot be mainli revert by other bots, a oppos to

S3 fig. bot-bot interact have differ characterist time scale than human-human 

interactions. the figur show the distribut of interact for a particular latency, where 

we defin latenc a the mean log time in second between success reverts. (a) bot-bot 

interact have a characterist latenc of 1 month, a indic by the peak in the figure. (b) 

human-human interact occur with a latenc of 2 minutes, 24 hours, or 1 year.

ance, and reciproc for each type of trajectory. the three properti measur the averag 

steepness, the y-valu of the last point, and the jagged of the trajectory, respectively. (a) 
fast unbalanc trajectori have low reciproc and latenc and high imbalance. (b) some-
