majorana fermion be a hypothet particl that be it own antiparticle.w report transport 
measur that suggest the exist of one-dimension chiral majorana fermion 
mode in the hybrid system of a quantum anomal hall insul thin film coupl 
with a superconductor. As the extern magnet field be swept, half-integ quantiz 
conduct plateau be observ at the locat of magnet reversals, give a 
distinct signatur of the majorana fermion modes. thi transport signatur be reproduc 
over mani magnet field sweep and appear at differ temperatures. thi find may 
open up an avenu to control majorana fermion for implement robust topolog 
quantum computing. 

M 
ajorana fermion, propos by ettor 
majorana in 1937 (1), be a put elemen- 
tari spin-1/2 particl with the unusu 
properti of be it own antiparticle. In 
condensed-matt systems, analog of 

majorana fermion can be realiz a quasipar- 
ticl of topolog state of quantum matter, 
such a the n = 5/2 quantumhal state (2), moore- 
read–typ state in the fraction quantum hall 
effect (3), two-dimension (2d) px + ipi spinless 
superconductor (4), strong spin-orbit coupl 
semiconductor-superconductor heterostructur 
(5, 6), and ferromagnet atom chain on a 
superconductor (7, 8). view a a supercon- 
duct analog of the quantum hall state (9), 
a chiral topolog superconductor (tsc) in two 
dimens have a full pair gap in the bulk 
and an odd number N gapless chiral majorana 
fermion mode at the edg (10, 11). the funda- 
mental aspect of the majorana fermion mode 
and their non-abelian braid properti can be 
potenti use to implement topolog qubit 
in fault-toler quantum comput (12–15). 
numer scheme to accommod majorana 

fermion mode in superconductor coupl with 
topolog matter have be propos (16–31). 
the majorana zero mode, a 0D version of the 
majorana fermion, be a charge-neutr bound state 
that exist strictli at zero energy. it exist 
could be spectroscop demonstr by the 
“zero-bia conduct anomalies”modul by 
extern electrical/magnet field (20–27, 32). 
although these observ provid promis 
signatur of majorana bound states, it be difficult 
to energet resolv the contribut from 
other effects, such a kondo correlations, andreev- 
bound states, weak antilocalization, and reflec- 
tionless tunnel (20–22, 33–35). 
In contrast, a recent theoret propos fo- 

cu on the direct transport signatur of the 1D 
majorana fermion mode (16–18). the 1dmajorana 
fermion mode satisfi the propag wave 
equat origin propos by ettor majorana 
(1). A seri of theoret result (16–18, 36) sug- 
gest that a chiral tsc base on a quantum anom- 
alou hall insul (qahi) might be a promis 
host of 1D majorana fermion mode becaus the 
chiral hall state can be achiev without strong 
extern magnet fields, preserv supercon- 
ductivity. To break time-revers symmetry, the 
single-domain phase of the qahi requir an 
extern field of ~0.1 T, which be more than one 
order of magnitud low than the critic field 
of typic superconduct metals. By modu- 
late the extern field, topolog transit 
can lead eventu to the establish of singl 
chiral majorana edg mode (cmems). 
when a superconductor be coupl to a qahi 

thin film—i.e., a magnet topolog insul 
thin film—a revers of the magnet can 
induc a seri of topolog phase transitions. 
the propos scheme be demonstr in fig. 1a, 
(i) to (vii), where a superconduct region be 
introduc in the middl of a qahi channel. the

ing a trivial surfac gap (the chern number C =

and the parabol band component, respective- 
ly. the chern number of the system be C = l / |l| 
for |l| > |m0|, where |c| be equal to the number of 
the chiral edg channels; for |l| < |m0|, C becom 
0. As a result, by adjust the extern magnet 
field, a transit between a normal insul 
(ni) with C = 0 (zero plateau, hall conduct 
sxi = 0) to a qahi with C = ±1 (integ plateau, 
sxi = ±e 

2/h) can be achiev (38, 39). In the middl 
of the qahi bar, the proxim to an s-wave super- 
conductor drive the qahi into a superconduct- 
ing regime, where a finit superconduct pair 
amplitud be induc to the surfac of the qahi, 
and in thi case the system can be describ by

here, m be the chemic potenti and d1,2 be

ciple, each chiral edg state in the quantum hall 
regim be topolog equival to two iden- 
tical copi of cmems, such that the total chern 
number be even (N = 2C in thi case). the key to 
achiev a singl cmem be to induc a topolog 
phase with an odd chern number to separ 
the two copi of cmem (16). when the struc- 
tural symmetri be preserv between the top 
and bottom surfac states—i.e., D = D1 = d2— 
the topolog transit in the tsc region can 
onli occur betweenn = ±2 [fig. 1a, (i) and (vii)] 
and N = 0 (iv), where the qahi region expe- 
rienc a ni-qahi-ni transition, thank to the 
surfac hybridization. the topolog phase tran- 
sition for all three region be synchronized, and 
the two cmem cannot be distinguish from 
each other. however, when the structur inver- 
sion symmetri be broken, the pair amplitud 
of the top and bottom surfac be differ 
(d1 6¼ d2), and phase withn = ±1 [fig. 1a, (ii), 
(iii), (v), and (vi)] emerg (17, 18, 36). the half- 
integ conduct of the system can be de- 
rive from the scatter matrix for the two 
qahi edg state at the entranc and exit of

the tsc, which allow for a calcul of the 
propag of charg and, therefore, the elec- 
trical conduct (see the supplementari 
text). 
To experiment identifi the cmem, we fab- 

ricat a qahi-tsc devic (fig. 1b). the qahi 
bar with dimens of 2 mm by 1 mm be imple- 
ment use a magnet topolog insul 
thin film (cr0.12bi0.26sb0.62)2te3 grown on a 
gaa (111)b substrat by molecular beam epitaxy. 
the fermi level be within the surfac gap without 
the assist of electric-field tune with a gate 
(38). becaus the hybrid gap, m0, be impor- 
tant to control the propos topolog phase 
change, the qahi film thick be precis con- 
troll to be six quintupl layers, i.e., around 6 nm 
(38, 40). across the central part of the qahi bar, 
a superconductor bar (8 mm by 0.6 mm) be depos- 
ited, which contain a 200-nm layer of Nb protect 
by a 5-nm layer of au. A control qahi hall bar of 
the same dimens be also fabric near the 
tsc devic on the same wafer. the field-depend 
total longitudin conduct (s12) be obtain 
by pass an altern current (i12 in fig. 1b) 
through the outer two probe and measur the 
potenti drop across the inner two probe (fig. 1b, 
point 1 and 2). In the control qahi device, trans- 

vers and longitudin resist be obtain 
use the standard hall bar setup (fig. 1b, right). 
the singl cmem correspond to N = ±1 

can be identifi experiment by a uniqu 
transport signatur of a half-integ longitudi- 
nal conduct plateau (0.5 e2/h) dure the re- 
versal of the magnet (17, 18, 36). when the 
extern field be larg enough, the devic fulli 
reach the qahi scheme (C = ±1). In the tsc 
region, both of the two cmem exist, form 
the phase of N = ±2. becaus the two cmem 
be topolog equival to one qahi state 
(C = ±1), all incid edg mode can almost 
perfectli transmit through the device, a show 
in fig. 1a, (i) and (vii) [compar with (viii) in 
the qahi regime], lead to s12 = e 

2/h (to be 
discuss in fig. 2c). when the magnet field 
be reduced, the tsc region experi the first 
topolog phase change, lead ton = ±1, such 
that one of the pair cmem vanishes. becaus 
the qahi region be still in the C = ±1 phase, 
the incid qahi state can transmit onli one 
of the cmem to the tsc region, wherea the 
other cmem be almost perfectli reflected. thi 
lead to the separ between the two cmem 
in the incid qahi state [fig. 1a, (ii) and (vi)], 
such that a half-integ plateau of the longitu- 

dinal conduct would occur (to be discuss 
in fig. 2c). further reduc the magnet field 
drive the qahi region to the NI phase (C = 0), 
where the surfac hybrid gap shut down 
the conduct channel (s12 = 0). although the 
tsc region still experi two more topolog 
transit (N = –1, 0, 1), no current should go 
through in these cases, a show in figs. 1a, (iii), 
(iv), and (v). thus, dure everi revers of the 
magnetization, s12 present a half-integ plateau 
close to the coerciv fields. 
the transport channel form by the cmem of 

N = ±1 be experiment demonstr by the 
longitudin conduct signal of the qahi-tsc 
device. figur 2A illustr the temperature- 
depend upper critic field ðm0h⊥c2þ in the out- 
of-plan direct of the Nb bar use a standard

similar magnet field. these plateau be close 
to the predict valu (0.5 e2/h) where the trans- 
port in the tsc region be domin by the 1D 
channel of the cmem in the N = ±1 phase 
[see fig. 1a, (ii) and (vi)]. despit the fact that 
majorana fermion be charg neutral, the two 
cmem at the two edg of the tscn=±1 con- 
stitut a coher charg basi that transmit 
exactli one-half of the incom charges. At 
20 mk, distinct plateau with the quantiz 
valu of 0.50(±0.06) e2/h be see at both shoul- 
der of the s12 valley (fig. 2c). outsid the half- 
plateau regimes, when the magnet be fulli 
saturated, the conduct reach a quantiz 
valu of 0.98(±0.04) e2/h, indic the C = ±1 / 
N= ±2 phase [see fig. 1a, (i) and (vii)]. On 
the other hand, dure the revers of the mag- 
netization, s12 dip into a valley correspond 
to the NI phase of the qahi region [see fig. 
1a, (iii), (iv), and (v)]. ideally, the NI phase should 
complet shut down the qahi channels, lead- 
ing to zero-conduct plateaus. however, thi 
requir an ultra-smooth sampl such that the 
electrostat fluctuat throughout the devic 
be small than the hybrid gap (~4 mev) 
induc by the coupl between the top and 
bottom surfac state of the qahi thin film. 
thank to the proxim effect, band-bend may 
occur at the Nb cover region, such that the 
devic may not be fulli insul a expected, 
result in a vanishingli small but observ 
residu s12 of ~0.05 e 

2/h observ in the NI phase 
(fig. 2c). furthermore, in thi field range, the 
resist between lead 1 and 2 can increas 
to a high a 10 to 100 MW (or even higher), which 
be compar to the intern resist of the 
lock-in amplifi instrument, make the accur 
measur of s12 veri challenging. consist 
with the phase transit dure the magnet 
reversal, the half-integ plateau (or kinks) occur 
at everi revers of the magnet in the hys- 
teresi loop. such magnet revers can 
also be see in a qahi devic with it hall con- 
ductanc (sxy) plot in fig. 2D align to fig. 
2c, where two intermedi zero plateau (sxi ~ 0) 
induc by the ni-qahi transit occur at the 
coerciv field HC = ~±170mt (38, 40). In these 
half-integ plateau (fig. 2c), the transport in 
the tsc region is, in principle, pure domin 
by a collect of chiral majorana fermion a 1D 
edg modes. thi featur be distinct from the 
“zero-bia conduct anomalies” induc by 
0D majorana bound state (20, 22, 27, 32), and 
be a a hallmark signatur associ with the 
chiral majorana edg transport channel in the 
tscn=±1 phases. 
To further confirm the transport signatur of 

the cmem in then = ±1 phase, we carri out 
measur at high temperatur (fig. 3a). 
with increas temperature, the thermal broaden- 
ing of the transport window gradual smear 
the half-integ plateaus, which becom kink of 
finit slope and then eventu disappear 
abov 400, 470, and 390 mK for devic I (fig. 
3b), II (fig. s2a), and iii (fig. s2b), respectively. 
In all three devices, the kink at high-field re- 
versal be alway narrow than the low-field 

plateaus, and they vanish earli a the temper- 
atur increases. thi discrep between low- 
field and high-field revers may be attribut 
to the magnet field hinder the superconduct- 
ing phase. although the extern magnet field 
be low than the critic field of the Nb bar (a 
show in fig. 2a), the interfaci exchang coupl 
between the Nb and the qahi may provid a 
much larg effect field, which suppress the 
superconduct phase in the tsc region. 
other effect that might lead to the observ 

transport signatures, such a the barkhausen 
effect (41), must be rule out. when domain 
be small and not strongli pin by impurities, 
domain wall abruptli jump dure the magne- 
tizat reversal, and the result stochast 
barkhausen step therefor often appear in 
bunch that be irreproduc dure differ 
magnet field sweeps. these step mainli occur 
at small magnet field (fig. s3), and none of 
them could reach rxx = 2 h/e 

2 (supplementari 
text). In contrast, the cmem-induc half-integ 

plateau in devic I can be reproduc (fig. s4) 
with clear temperatur trace (fig. 3a), and they 
occur both in low-field and high-field case (fig. 
2c). when larg domain be pin by impur- 
iti or defects, some barkhausen step can be 
retrac at larg magnet fields, a show in 
fig. s2a for devic ii. however, these step can 
be strongli suppress with improv sampl 
quality, a show in fig. 3A for devic I and fig. 
s2b for devic iii. among all three devices, onli 
the 0.5 e2/h plateau surviv in all cases, suggest- 
ing that they origin from a fundament 
differ mechanism. onli the backscatt 
origin in the tscn=±1 phase could lead to

could have be connect in seri by a non- 
superconducting, topolog trivial Nb cover 
region. To address thi issue, two addit trans- 
port measur be carri out use devic 
I, a explain below. 
first, s12 be obtain at high magnet field 

a show in fig. 4a, use the same setup a fig. 
1b. after the magnet field elimin the super- 
conduct phase in both layers, s12 inde reach 
~0.5 e2/h, suggest the scenario of two qahi 
connect in seri a expected. thi occur when 
the extern field exce ~4 T, the anticip 
upper critic field of the Nb layer show in fig. 2a. 
thi behavior suggest that the Nb cover region 
be inde in a tscn=2 phase befor s12 start 
to drop back to ~0.5 e2/h. If the half-integ 
plateau below the critic field be induc by 
thi trivial picture, they would have persist all 
the way throughout larg field (fig. s5e). the 
coexist of these 0.5 and 1.0 e2/h plateau in 
fig. 4A rule out thi trivial picture, provid 
again strong evid that the low-field half- 
integ plateau (within ±300mt) have an origin 
differ from that of the high-field one (4 to 7 T) 
and be like associ with cmems. 
second, s13 and s23 be measur between 

electrod 1-3 and 2-3 at 20 mk, respectively, 
use the setup show in fig. 4b. If the tsc 
be a trivial normal metal, the system should 
be equival to a qahi that be directli contact 
with two electrodes. thus, a typic sxx behavior 
of a qahi (fig. 3c) should be observed—i.e., 
both s13 and s23 would exhibit two valley at 
±150 mT (C = 0) and then reach e2/h after the 
magnet satur (C = ±1)—a show in 
fig. s5f. however, the measur (figs. 4, C 
and D) show four peaks, instead of two valleys, in 
both s13 and s23, coincid with the half-integ 
plateau give by the measur of s12. the 
height of these peak reach ~0.9 e2/h, veri 
close to the quantiz valu expect from the 
andreev reflect of a singl cmem (N = ±1) 
(36) (for an elabor theoret explan 
use the laudauer-büttik transport picture, 
see the supplementari text). thi result also dem- 

onstrat that superconduct in the qahi 
layer be inde induc owe to the proxim- 
iti effect; otherwise, the observ peak would 
not occur, and the conduct would remain 
small throughout the magnet field scan. 
the qahi-superconductor system be real- 

ize a a prototyp of the chiral tsc in two 
dimensions; more complex layout could be 
engin to host the bound state of majorana 
fermion in solid state and enabl their manip- 
ulation. the majorana fermion mode be pre- 
dict to be topolog protect and thu may 
becom a build block for robust topolog 
quantum computing.
