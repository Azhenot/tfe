summary. We investig a long-deb question, which be how to creat predict model of 
recidiv that be suffici accurate, transpar and interpret to use for decis making. 
thi question be complic a these model be use to support differ decisions, from 
sentencing, to determin releas on probat to alloc prevent social services. each 
case might have an object other than classif accuracy, such a a desir true posit 
rate tpr or fals posit rate fpr. each (tpr, fpr) pair be a point on the receiv oper 
characterist (roc) curve. We use popular machin learn method to creat model along 
the full roc curv on a wide rang of recidiv predict problems. We show that mani 
method (support vector machines, stochast gradient boost and ridg regression) produc 
equal accur model along the full roc curve. however, method that be design for 
interpret (classif and regress tree and c5.0) cannot be tune to produc model 
that be accur and/or interpretable. To handl thi shortcoming, we use a recent method 
call superspars linear integ model to produc accurate, transpar and interpret 
score system along the full roc curve. these score system can be use for decis 
make for mani differ use cases, sinc they be just a accur a the most power black 
box machin learn model for mani applications, but complet transparent, and highli 
interpretable.

1. introduct 

forecast have be use for criminolog applic sinc the 1920 (borden, 1928; burgess, 
1928) when variou factor deriv from age, race, prior offenc history, employment, grade 
and neighbourhood background be use to estim success of parole. mani thing have 
chang sinc then, includ the fact that we have develop machin learn method that 
can produc accur predict model and have collect larg high dimension data set on 
which to appli them. 

predict of recidiv be still extrem important. In the usa, for example, a minor of 
individu commit the major of the crime (wolfgang, 1987): these be the ‘power few’ of 
sherman (2007) on which we should focu our efforts. We want to ensur that public resourc 
be direct effectively, be they correct facil or prevent social services. milgram 
(2014) recent discuss the critic import of accur predict whether an individu 
who be releas on bail pose a risk to public safety, point out that high risk individu be 
be releas 50% of the time wherea low risk individu be be releas less often than 
they should be. her observ be in line with long-stand work on clinic versu actuari

judgement, which show that humans, on their own, be not a good at risk assess a 
statist model (daw et al., 1989; grove and meehl, 1996). thi be the reason that sever 
US state have mandat the use of predict model for sentenc decis (pew center of 
the states, public safeti perform project, 2011; wroblewski, 2014). 

there have be some controversi about whether sophist machin learn method 
(such a random forests; see for exampl breiman (2001a), berk et al. (2009) and ritter (2013)) 
be necessari to produc accur predict model of recidivism, or if tradit approach 
such a logist regress or linear discrimin analysi would suffic (see, for example, tol- 
lenaar and van der heijden (2013), berk and bleich (2013) and bushway (2013)). random 
forest may produc accur predict models, but these model effect oper a black 
boxes, which make it difficult to understand how the input variabl be produc a predict 
outcome. If a simpler, more transparent, but equal accur predict model could be de- 
veloped, it would be more usabl and defens for mani decision-mak applications. there 
be a preced for use such model in criminolog (steinhart, 2006; andrade, 2009); ridge- 
way (2013) argu that a ‘decent transpar model that be actual use will outperform a 
sophist system that predict good but sit on a shelf ’. thi discuss be captur nice 
by bushway (2013), who contrast the work of berk and bleich (2013) and tollenaar and 
van der heijden (2013). berk and bleich (2013) claim that we need sophist machin 
learn method becaus of their substanti benefit in accuracy, wherea tollenaar and van 
der heijden (2013) claim that ‘modern statistical, data mine and machin learn model 
provid no real advantag over logist regress and lda’, assum that human have do 
appropri preprocessing. In thi work, we argu that the answer to the question be far more 
subtl than a simpl ye or no. 

In particular, the answer depend on how the model will be use for decis making. for 
each use case (e.g. sentencing, parol decis and polici interventions), we might need a 
decis point at a differ level of true posit rate tpr and fals posit rate fpr (see 
also ritter (2013)). each (tpr, fpr) pair be a point on the receiv oper characterist 
(roc) curve. To determin whether one method be good than another, we must consid the 
appropri point along the roc curv for decis making. As we show, for a wide rang 
of recidiv predict problems, mani machin learn method (support vector machin 
(svms) or random forests) produc equal accur predict model along the roc curve. 
however, there be trade-off between accuracy, transpar and interpretability: method 
that be design to yield transpar model (classif and regress tree (cart); c5.0) 
cannot be tune to produc a accur model along the roc curv and do not alway yield 
model that be interpretable. thi be not to say that interpret model for predict of 
recidiv do not exist. the fact that mani machin learn method produc model with 
similar level of predict accuraci indic that there be a larg class of approxim equal 
accur predict model (call the ‘rashomon’ effect by breiman (2001b)). In thi case, there 
may be interpret model that also attain the same level of accuracy. find model that be 
accur and interpretable, however, be comput challenging. 

In thi paper, we explor whether such accur yet interpret model exist and how to find 
them. for this, we use a new machin learn method know a a superspars linear integ 
model (slim) (ustun and rudin, 2015) to learn score system from data. score system 
have be use for mani crimin justic applic becaus they let user make quick predic- 
tion by adding, subtract and multipli a few small number (see, for example, hoffman 
and adelberg (1980), US sentenc commiss (1987) and pennsylvania commiss on 
sentenc (2012)). In contrast with exist tools, which have be built by use heurist 
approach (see, for example, gottfredson and snyder (2005)), the model that be built by

slim be fulli optim for accuraci and sparsity, and can handl addit constraint (e.g. 
bound on the fals posit rate and monoton properti for the coefficients). We use slim 
to produc a set of simpl score system at differ decis point across the full roc curv 
and provid a comparison with other popular machin learn methods. our find show 
that the slim score system be often just a accur a the most power black box machin 
learn models, but transpar and highli interpretable. 

1.1. structur 
the remaind of thi paper be structur a follows. In section 1.2, we discu relat work. 
In section 2, we describ how we deriv six recidiv predict problems. In section 3, 
we provid a brief overview of slim and describ sever new techniqu that can reduc 
the comput that be requir to produc score systems. In section 4, we compar the 
accuraci and interpret of model produc by the nine machin learn method on the 
six recidiv predict problems. We includ addit result that be relat to the accuraci 
and interpret of model from differ method in appendix A. An on-lin supplement 
with addit appendix can be found at http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.07810. 

1.2. relat work 
predict model for recidiv have be in widespread use in mani countri and mani area 
of the crimin justic system sinc the earli 1920 (see, for example, borden (1928), burgess 
(1928) and tibbitt (1931)). the use of these tool have be spur on by continu research 
into the superior of actuari judgement (daw et al., 1989; grove and meehl, 1996) a well 
a a desir to use limit public resourc effici (clements, 1996; simon, 2005; mccord, 
1978, 2003). In the usa, feder guidelin current mandat the use of a predict recidiv 
measur know a the crimin histori categori for sentenc (u sentenc commission, 
1987). besid the usa, countri that current use risk assess tool includ canada 
(hanson and thornton, 2003), the netherland (tollenaar and van der heijden, 2013) and the 
UK (howard et al., 2009). applic of these tool can be see in evidence-bas sentenc 
(hoffman, 1994), correct and prison administr (belfrag et al., 2000), inform releas 
on parol (pew center of the states, public safeti perform project, 2011), determin the 
level of supervis dure parol (barn and hyatt, 2012; ritter, 2013), determin appro- 
priat sanction for violat of parol (turner et al., 2009), and target polici intervent 
(lowenkamp and latessa, 2004). 

our paper focu on binari classif model to predict gener recidiv (i.e. recidiv 
of ani type of crime) a well a crime-specif recidiv (i.e. recidiv for drug, gener violence, 
domest violence, sexual violenc and fatal violenc offences). risk assess tool for gener 
recidiv includ the salient factor score (hoffman and adelberg, 1980; hoffman, 1994), the 
offend group reconvict scale (copa and marshall, 1998; maden et al., 2006; howard 
et al., 2009), the statist inform of recidiv scale (nafekh and motiuk, 2002) and 
the ‘level of service/cas manag inventory’ (andrew and bonta, 2000). crime-specif 
applic includ risk assess tool for domest violenc (see, for example, the spousal 
abus risk assess of kropp and hart (2000)), sexual violenc (see, for example, hanson 
and thornton (2003) and langton et al. (2007)) and gener violenc (see, for example, the 
‘histor clinic and risk management’ tool of webster (1997), or the ‘structur assess 
of violenc risk in youth’ tool of borum (2006)). 

the score system that we present in thi paper be design to mimic the form of risk score 
that be current use throughout the crimin justic system—i.e. linear classif model 



692 J. zeng, B. ustun and C. rudin 

that requir user onli to add, subtract and multipli a few small number to make a predict 
(ustun and rudin, 2015). these tool be uniqu in that they allow user to make quick predic- 
tion by hand, without a computer, calcul or nomogram (which be a visual tool for 
more difficult calculations). current exampl of such tool includ the salient factor score (hoff- 
man and adelberg, 1980), the crimin histori categori (u sentenc commission, 1987) and 
the offenc graviti score (pennsylvania commiss on sentencing, 2012). our approach aim 
to produc score system that be fulli optim for accuraci and sparsiti without ani post- 
processing. In contrast, current tool be produc through heurist approach that primarili 
involv logist regress with some ad hoc post-process to ensur that the model be spars 
and use integ coeffici (see, for example, the method that be describ in gottfredson 
and snyder (2005)). 

our score system differ from exist tool in that they directli output a predict outcom 
(i.e. prison i will laps into crime) a oppos to a predict probabl of the outcom (i.e. 
the predict probabl that prison i will laps into crime be 90%). the predict probabl 
from exist tool be typic convert into an outcom by impos a threshold (i.e. classifi a 
prison a ‘high risk’ if the predict probabl of arrest be great than 70%). In practice, user 
arbitrarili pick sever threshold to translat predict probabl into an ordin outcom 
(e.g. prison i be ‘low risk’, if the predict probabl be less than 30%, ‘medium risk’ if the 
predict probabl be less than 60% and ‘high risk’ otherwise). these arbitrari threshold 
make it difficult, if not impossible, to ass the predict accuraci of the tool effect 
(hannah-moffat, 2013). netter (2007), for instance, mention that ‘the possibl of make 
a predict error (fals posit or fals negative) use a risk tool be probable, but not easili 
determined’. In contrast with exist tools, the score system let user ass accuraci in a 
straightforward way (i.e. through the true posit rate and true neg rate). further, our 
approach have the advantag that it can yield a score system that optim the class-bas 
accuraci at a particular decis point (i.e. produc the model that maxim the true posit 
rate, give a fals posit rate of at most 30%). 

our work be relat to a stream of research that have aim to leverag new method for 
predict model in criminology. In contrast with our work, much of the research to date 
have focu on improv predict accuraci by train power black box model such a 
random forest (breiman, 2001a) and stochast gradient boost (sgb) (friedman, 2002). 
random forest (breiman, 2001a), in particular, have be use for sever criminolog ap- 
plications, includ predict homicid offend recidiv (neuilli et al., 2011), predict 
seriou misconduct among incarcer prison (berk et al., 2006), forecast potenti mur- 
der for crimin on probat or parol (berk et al., 2009), forecast domest violenc and 
help to inform court decis at arraign (berk and sorenson, 2014). We note that not 
all studi in black box model use (berk et al., 2005), for instance, help the lo angel sher- 
iff ’s depart to develop a simpl and practic screener to forecast domest violenc by 
use decis trees. more recent goel et al. (2016) develop a simpl score system to help 
the new york polic depart to address stop and frisk by first run logist regression, 
and then round the coefficients.

each problem be a binari classif problem with N = 33796 prison and P = 48 input 
variables. the goal be to predict whether a prison will be arrest for a certain type of crime 



recidiv predict 693 

within 3 year of be releas from prison. In what follows, we describ how we creat each 
predict problem. 

2.1. databas detail 
We deriv the recidiv predict problem in our paper from the ‘recidiv of prison 
releas in 1994’ database, assembl by the US depart of justice, bureau of justic 
statist (2014). It be the larg publicli avail databas on prison recidiv in the usa. 
the studi track 38624 prison for 3 year follow their releas from prison in 1994. these 
prison be randomli sampl from the popul of all prison releas from 15 US 
state (arizona, california, delaware, florida, illinois, maryland, michigan, minnesota, new 
jersey, new york, north carolina, ohio, oregon, texa and virginia). the popul sampl 
account for roughli two-third of all prison who be releas from prison in the usa in 
1994. other studi that use thi databas includ bhati and piquero (2007), bhati (2007) and 
zhang et al. (2009). 

the databas be compos of 38624 row and 6427 columns, where each row repres a 
prison and each column repres a featur (i.e. a field of inform for a give prisoner). 
the 6427 column consist of 91 field that be record befor or dure releas from prison in 
1994 (e.g. date of birth and effect sentenc length) and 64 field that be repeatedli record 
for up to 99 differ arrest in the 3-year follow-up period (for example, if a prison be 
rearrest three time within 3 years, three record cycl would be recorded). the inform 
for each prison be sourc from record of arrest and prosecut sheet that be kept by state 
law enforc agenc and/or the feder bureau of investigation. A detail descript 
analysi of the databas be carri out by statistician at the US bureau of justic statist 
(langan and levin, 2002). thi studi restrict it attent to 33796 of the 38624 prison 
to exclud extraordinari or unrepres releas cases. To be select for the analysi of 
langan and levin (2002), a prison have to be aliv dure the 3-year follow-up period and 
have to have be releas from prison in 1994 for an origin sentenc that be at least 1 year 
or longer. prison with certain releas types—releas to custody, detain or warrant, absent 
without leave, escape, transfer, administr releas and releas on appeal—wer excluded. To 
mirror the approach of langan and levin (2002), we restrict our attent to the same subset 
of prisoners. 

thi data set have some seriou flaw which we point out below. To begin, mani import 
factor that could be use to predict recidiv be missing, and mani includ factor be 
suffici noisi to be exclud from our preliminari experiments. the inform about 
level of educ be extrem minimal; we do not even know whether each prison attend 
colleg or complet high school. the inform about cours in prison be onli an indic 
of whether the inmat take ani educ or vocat cours at all. also, there be no famili 
histori for each prison (e.g. foster care) and no record of visitor while in prison (e.g. indic 
of care famili member or friends). there be no inform about re-entri programm or 
employ history. although some of these factor exist, such a drug or alcohol treatment 
and in-prison vocat programmes, the data be highli incomplet and therefor have be 
exclud from our analysis. for example, for drug treatment, less than 14% of the prison have 
a valid entry. the rest be ‘unknown’. To includ a mani prison a possible, we chose to 
exclud factor with extrem spars information.

follow-up period. 

tabl 1. We encod each input variabl a a binari rule of the form xij ∈ {0, 1}, j = 1, : : : , P , 
where xij = 1 if condit j hold true about prison i. thi allow a linear model to encod 
non-linear function of the origin variables. We refer to input variabl in the text by use 
ital (e.g. female). all predict problem in tabl 2 and all machin learn method in 
tabl 4 in section 4.1.4 use these same input variables. 

the final set of input variabl be repres of well-known risk factor for recidiv 
(bushway and piehl, 2007; crow, 2008) and have be use in risk assess tool sinc 1928 
(see, for example, borden (1928), hinojosa et al. (2005), berk et al. (2006) and baradaran 
(2013)). they includ 

(a) inform about prison releas in 1994 (e.g. time serv , age at releas and infract 
in prison), 

(b) inform from past arrests, sentenc and convict (e.g. prior arrests�1 and ani 
prior jail time), 

(c) histori of substanc abus (e.g. alcohol abuse) and 
(d) gender (e.g. female). 

(the prior arrest variabl do not count the origin crime for which they be releas from 
prison in 1994; thus, about 12% of the prison have no prior arrest = 1 even though they 
be arrest at least once.) these input variabl be advantag becaus 

(a) the inform be easili access to law enforc offici (all the abov inform 
can be found in state record of arrest and prosecut sheets) and 

(b) they do not includ socio-econom factor such a race, which would directli elimin 
the potenti to use these tool in applic such a sentencing. 

We note that encod the input variabl a binari valu present mani advantages. they 
produc model that be easi to understand (remov the wide rang that be present by 
continu variables), and they avoid potenti confus stem from coeffici of nor- 
maliz input (for instance, after undo the normal for normal coefficients, a small 
coeffici might be highli influenti if it appli to a variabl take larg values). binariza-

optim problem when the data contain onli binari input variabl (a discuss in section 
3.3). In appendix E of the on-lin supplement, we explor the chang in predict accuraci if 
continu variabl be includ and show that the chang in perform be minor for most 
methods. there be some exceptions; for example, the cart and c5.0t method experienc 
an improv of 4:6% for drug and svm radial basi function (rbf) experienc a 7:7% 
improv for fatal violence. yet, even for these methods, no clear improv be see 
across all problems. 

2.3. deriv outcom variabl 
We creat a total of six recidiv predict problem by encod a binari outcom variabl 
yi ∈ {−1, 1} such that yi = 1 if a prison be arrest for a particular type of crime within 3 
year after be releas from prison. for clarity, we refer to each predict problem in the 
text by use courier fount (e.g. arrest). We provid detail on each recidiv predict 
problem in tabl 2. these includ an arrest for ani crime (arrest), an arrest for a drug- 
relat offenc (drug) or an arrest for a certain type of violent offenc (gener violence, 
domest violence, sexual violenc and fatal violence). 

In the data set, all crime type can be broken down into small subcategori (e.g. fatal 
violenc can be broken into six subcategori such a murder and vehicular man 
laughter). We chose to use the broader crime categori for concis and clarity. indeed, the 
studi by langan and levin (2002) also split crime into the same major categories. We note that 
the outcom of violent offenc be mutual exclusive, a differ type of violenc be treat 
differ within the US legal system. In other words, yi = 1 for gener violenc do 
not necessarili impli that yi = 1 for domest violence, sexual violenc or fatal 
violence). 

2.4. relationship between input and output variabl 
tabl 3 list the condit probabl p.y=1|xj =1/ between the outcom variabl y and each 
input variabl xj for all predict problems. use tabl 3, we can identifi strong associ 
between the input and output for each predict problem. these associ can help to 
uncov insight into each problem and also help to valid predict model in section 4.4 
qualitatively. 

consider, for instance, the arrest problem. here, we can see that prison who be releas 
from prison at a late age be less like to be arrest (a the probabl for arrest decreas 
monoton a age at releas increases). thi also appear to be so for prison who be 
first confin (i.e. sent to prison) at an old age (see, for example, age of first confinement). 
In addition, we can also see that prison with more prior arrest have a high likelihood of 
be arrest (a the probabl for arrest increas monoton with prior arrest). 

similar insight can be make for crime-specif predict problems. In drug, for instance, 
we see that prison who be previous arrest for a drug-rel offenc be more like to 
be rearrest for a drug-rel offenc (32%) than those who be previous arrest for ani 
other type of offence. likewise, look at domest violence, we see that the prison 
with the great probabl of be arrest for a domest violenc crime be those with a 
histori of domest violenc (13%). 

3. superspars linear integ model

model that requir user onli to add, subtract and multipli a few small number to make 
a predict (ustun and rudin, 2015). score system be wide use becaus they allow 
user to make quick predictions, without the use of a computer, and without extens train 
in statistics. these model be also use becaus their high degre of sparsiti and integ 
coeffici let user easili gaug the influenc of multipl input variabl on the predict 
outcom (see section 4.4 for an example). In what follows, we provid a brief overview of slim 
and provid sever new techniqu to reduc the comput for problem with binari input 
variables.

and λ0 repres an intercept (i.e. the ‘threshold score’ that must be surpass to predict ŷi =1).

here, the object directli minim the error rate .1=n/σni=1 1.yi �= ŷi/ and directli penal 
the number of non-zero term σpj=1 1.λj �=0/. the constraint restrict coeffici to a finit set 
such a l={−10, : : : , 10}p+1. optionally, one could includ addit oper constraint 
on the accuraci and interpret of the score system desired. 

the object includ a tini penalti on the absolut valu of the coeffici to restrict co- 
effici to coprim valu without affect accuraci or sparsity. To illustr the use of thi 
penalty, consid a classifi such a ŷ= sgn.x1 +x2/. If slim minim onli the misclassifica- 
tion rate and the number of term (the first two term of the objective), then ŷ = sgn.2x1 +2x2/ 
would have the same object valu a ŷ = sgn.x1 +x2/ becaus it make the same predict 
and have the same number of non-zero coefficients. sinc coeffici be restrict to a discret 
set, we use thi tini penalti on the absolut valu of these coeffici so that slim choos the 
classifi with the small (coprime) coefficients, ŷ = sgn.x1 +x2/. 

the c0-paramet repres the maximum accuraci that slim be will to sacrific to 
remov a featur from the optim score system. if, for instance, C0 be set within the rang 
.1=n, 2=n/, we would sacrific the accuraci of one observ to have a model with one few 
feature. given c0, we can set the l1-penalti paramet � to ani valu

so that it do not affect the accuraci or sparsiti of the optim classifi but onli induc the 
coeffici to be coprim for the featur that be selected. 



recidiv predict 699 

slim differ from tradit machin learn method becaus it directli optim 
accuraci and sparsiti without make approxim that other method make for scalabl 
(e.g. control for accuraci use convex surrog loss functions). By avoid these 
approximations, slim sacrific the abil to fit a model in second or in a way that scale 
to extrem larg data sets. In return, however, it gain the abil to fit model that be highli 
customizable, sinc one could directli encod a wide rang of oper constraint in it 
integ program (ip) formulation. In thi paper, we primarili make use of a simpl con- 
straint to limit the number of non-zero coefficients; however, it be also natur to incorpor 
constraint on class-specif accuracy, structur sparsiti and predict (see ustun and rudin 
(2015)). 

In thi paper we train the follow version of slim, which be differ from problem (1) 
in that it includ class weight and have specif constraint on the coefficients:

In thi formulation, the constraint restrict each coeffici λj to an integ between −10 and 10, 
the threshold λ0 to an integ between −100 and 100, the number of non-zero coeffici to at 
most 8 (i.e. within the rang of cognit entiti that human could handle, a per miller (1956)). 
the paramet W+ and W− be class-bas weight that control the accuraci on posit and 
neg examples. We typic choos valu of W+ and W− such that W+ +w− =2, so that 
we recov an error minim formul by set W+ = W− = 1. the c0-paramet be 
set to a suffici small valu so that slim would not sacrific accuraci for sparsity: give 
W+ and w−, we can set C0 to ani valu 

0 <c0 < min{w−, w+}=.np/ 

to ensur thi condition. the �-paramet be set to a suffici small valu so that slim 
would produc a model with coprim coeffici without affect accuraci or sparsity: give 
w+, W− and c0, we can set � to ani valu 0 < �<c0= max σpj=1|λj| to ensur thi condition.

the constraint in express (3a) comput the error rate by set the loss variabl zi = 
1.yiλ 

txi � 0/ to 1 if a linear classifi with coeffici λ misclassifi exampl i (or be close 
to misclassifi it, depend on the margin γ). thi be a big M constraint for the error rate 
that depend on scalar paramet γ and Mi (see, for example, rubin (2009)). the valu of Mi 
repres the maximum score when exampl i be misclassifi and can be set a Mi =maxλ∈l.γ − 
yiλ 

txi/, which be easi to comput sinc L be finite. the valu of γ repres the margin, and 
the object be penal when point be either incorrectli classifi or within γ of the decis 
boundary. how close a point be to the decis boundari (or whether it be misclassified) be 
determin by yiλtxi. when the featur be binary, and sinc the coeffici be integers, γ 
can natur be set to ani valu between 0 and 1. (in other cases, we can set γ =0:5 for instance, 
which make an implicit assumpt on the valu of the features.) the constraint in express 
(3b) set the total penalti for each coeffici to Φj =c0αj + �βj, where αj :=1.λj �=0/ be defin 
by big M constraint in express (3c), and βj :=|λj| be defin by the constraint in express 
(3d). We denot the larg absolut valu of each coeffici a Λj :=maxλj∈lj |λj|. 

restrict coeffici to a finit set result in signific practic benefit for the slim IP 
formulation, especi in comparison with other IP formul that minim the 0–1-loss 
and/or penal the l0-norm. without the restrict of λ to a bound set, we would not have 
a natur choic for the big M constant, which mean that the user choos one that be veri 
large, lead to a less effici formul (see, for example, wolsey (1998)). for slim, the 
big M constant that be use to comput the 0–1-loss in constraint (3a) be bound a 
Mi � maxλ∈l.γ − yiλtxi/, and the big M constant that be use to comput the l0-norm in 
constraint (3c) be bound a Λj �maxλj∈lj |λj|. bound these constant lead to a tighter 
linear program relaxation, which narrow the integr gap, and improv the abil of 
commerci IP solver to obtain a proof of optim more quickly. 

3.3. improv superpars linear integ model integ program formul 
the follow formul provid a tighter relax of the IP which reduc computation. 
It reli on the fact that, when the input variabl be binary, we be like to obtain repeat 
featur valu among observations.

αj ∈{0, 1} j =1, : : : , P .l0-variables/, 
βj ∈r+ j =1, : : : , P .l1-variables/: 

the main differ between thi formul and that in express (3) be that we comput the 
error rate of the classifi by use loss constraint that be express in term of the number of 
distinct point in the data set. here, the set S repres the set of distinct point with posit 
labels, and the set T repres the set of distinct point with neg examples. the paramet 
n (and nt) count the number of time that a point of type s (or t) be found in the origin data 
set so that σsn =σni=11.yi =1/, σtnt =σni=11.yi =−1/ and N =σ n +σt nt . 

the main comput benefit of thi formul be becaus 

(a) we can reduc the number of loss constraint by count the number of repeat row in 
the data set and 

(b) we can directli encod a low bound on the error rate by count the number of point 
s and t with ident featur but opposit label (i.e. x =xt but y =−yt). 

here benefit (a) reduc the size of the problem that we pa to an IP solver, and benefit (b) 
produc a much strong low bound on the 0–1-loss (in comparison with the linear program- 
ming relaxation), which speed up the progress of branch-and-bound type algorithms. It would 
be possibl to use thi formul on a data set without binari input variables, though it would 
not necessarili be effect becaus it could be much less like for a data set to contain repeat 
row in such a setting. 

anoth subtl benefit of thi formul be that the margin for the neg point be 0 
wherea the margin for the posit point be 1. thi mean that, for posit points, we have a 
correct predict if and onli if the score be 1 or greater. for neg points, we have a correct 
predict if and onli if the score be 0 or less. thi provid a slight comput advantag 
sinc the neg point do not need to have score below −1 to be correctli classified, which 
reduc the size of the big M paramet and the coeffici set. for instance, say that we would 
like to produc a linear model that encod ‘predict rearrest unless a1 or a2 be true’. use the 
previou formul with the margin of γ ∈ .0, 1/ on both posit and negatives, the optim 
slim classifi would be ‘rearrest = sgn.1−2a1 −2a2/’. In contrast, the margin of the current 
formul be ‘rearrest = sgn.1 − a1 − a2/’, which us small coeffici and produc a 
slightli simpler model. 

3.4. activ set polish 
On larg data sets, IP solver may take a long time to produc an optim solut or to provid 
user with a certif of optimality. here, we present a polish procedur that can be use to 



702 J. zeng, B. ustun and C. rudin 

improv the qualiti of solut locally. for a fix set of features, thi procedur optim the 
valu of coefficients. 

the polish procedur take a input a feasibl set of coeffici from the slim IP λfeasibl 

and return a polish set of coeffici λpolish by solv a simpler IP formul show 
in express (5). the polish IP optim onli the coeffici of featur that belong to the 
activ set of λfeasible, i.e. the set of featur with non-zero coeffici A :={j :λfeasiblej �=0}. the 
coeffici for featur that do not belong to the activ set be fix to 0 so that λj =0 for j �∈a. 
In thi way, the optim no longer involv featur selection, and the formul becom 
much easi to solve.

the polish IP formul be especi fast to solv to optim for classif problem 
with binari input variabl becaus thi limit the number of loss constraints. say for instanc 
that we wish to polish a set of coeffici with onli five non-zero variables; then there be at most 
|{−1, 1}|× |{0, 1}5|=64 possibl uniqu data points, and thu the same number of possibl loss 
constraints. 

In our experi in section 4, we use the polish procedur on all the feasibl solut 
that we find from the earli formulation. In all cases, we can solv the polish IP problem to 
optim within a few second (i.e. an optim gap of 0.0%). 

4. experiment result 

In thi section, we compar the accuraci and interpret of recidiv predict model 
from slim to model from eight other popular classif methods. In section 4.1, we explain 
the experiment set-up that be use for all the methods. In section 4.2, we compar the 
predict accuraci of the method with the area under the curv valu auc and roc curves. 
In section 4.3 and 4.4, we evalu the interpret of the models. finally, in section 4.5, 
we present the score system that be gener by slim. 

4.1. methodolog 
In what follow we discu cost-sensit classif for imbalanc problem and provid an 
overview of techniques. 

4.1.1. evalu predict accuraci for imbalanc problem 
the major of classif problem that we consid be imbalanc , where the data contain 



recidiv predict 703 

a rel small number of exampl from one class and a rel larg number of exampl 
from the other. 

imbalanc problem necessit chang in the way that we evalu the perform of 
classif models. consider, for instance, a heavili imbalanc problem such a fatal 
violenc where onli p.yi = 1/ = 0:7% of individu be arrest within 3 year of be 
releas from prison. In thi case, a method that maxim overal classif accuraci be 
like to produc a trivial model that predict that no one will be arrest for fatal offences— 
a result that be not surpris give that the trivial model be 99.3% accur on the overal 
population. unfortunately, thi model will never be abl to identifi individu who will be 
arrest for a fatal offence, and therefor it will be 0% accur on the popul of interest. 

To provid a measur of classif model perform on imbalanc problems, we ass 
the accuraci of a model on the posit and neg class separately. In our experiments, we 
report the class-bas accuraci of each model by use the true posit rate tpr, which reflect 
the accuraci on the posit class, and the fals posit rate fpr, which reflect the error rate 
on the neg class. for a give classif model, we comput these quantiti a 

tpr= 1 
N+ 

∑ 
i∈i+ 

1.ŷi =1/, 

fpr= 1 
N− 

∑ 
i∈i− 

1.ŷi =1/, 

where ŷi denot the predict outcom for exampl i, N 
+ denot the number of exampl in 

the posit class I+ = {i : yi = 1} and N− denot the number of exampl from the neg 
class I− ={i : yi =−1}. ideally, a classif model should have high tpr and low fpr (i.e. 
tpr close to 1 and fpr = 0). 

most classif method can be adapt to yield a model that be more accur on the 
posit class, but onli if we be will to sacrific some accuraci on exampl from the neg 
class, and vice versa. To illustr the trade-off of classif accuraci between posit and 
neg classes, we plot all model that be produc by a give method a point on an roc 
curve, which plot tpr on the vertic axi and fpr on the horizont axis. have construct 
an roc curve, we then ass the overal perform of each method by calcul the area 
under the roc curve, auc. (we note that auc be a summari statist that be frequent misus 
in the context of classif problems. It be true that a method with auc = 1 alway produc 
model that be more accur than a method with auc = 0. other than thi simpl case, 
however, it be not possibl to state that a method with high auc alway produc model that 
be more accur than a method with low auc.) A detail discuss of roc analysi in 
recidiv predict can be found in the work of maloof (2003). 

4.1.2. fit model over the full receiv oper characterist curv by use a cost- 
sensit approach

for sentencing, for example, need low fpr to avoid predict that a low risk individu will 
reoffend. model for screening, however, need high tpr to captur a mani high risk individu 
a possible. In our experiments, we use a cost-sensit approach to produc classif model 
at differ point of the roc curv (see, for example, berk (2010, 2011)). thi approach involv 
control the accuraci on the posit and neg class by tune the misclassif cost 
for exampl in each class. In what follows, we denot the misclassif cost on exampl 
from the posit and neg class a W+ and W− respectively. As we increas w+, the cost

of make a mistak on a posit exampl increases, and we expect to obtain a model that 
classifi the posit exampl more accur (i.e. with high tpr). We choos W+ and W− 
so W+ +w− =2. thus, when W+ =2, we obtain a trivial model that predict ŷi =1 and attain 
tpr = 1. when W+ =0, we obtain a trivial model that predict ŷi =−1 that attain fpr = 0. 

4.1.3. choic of classif method 
We compar slim score system with model produc by eight popular classif 
methods, includ those previous use for recidiv predict (see section 1.2) or those 
that rank among the ‘top 10 algorithm in data mining’ (wu et al., 2008). In choos these 
methods, we restrict our attent to method that have publicli avail softwar packag 
and allow user to specifi misclassif cost for posit and neg classes. our final 
choic of method includ the follow methods. 

(a) c5.0 tree and c5.0 rules: c5.0 be an updat version of the popular c4.5 algorithm 
(quinlan, 2014; kuhn and johnson, 2013) that can creat decis tree and rule sets. 

(b) cart : the cart method be a popular method to creat decis tree through recurs 
partit of the input variabl (breiman et al., 1984). 

(c) l1- and l2-penal logist regress be variant of logist regress that penal 
the coeffici to prevent overfit (friedman et al., 2010). l1-penal method be 
typic use to creat linear model that be spars (tibshirani, 1996; hesterberg et al., 
2008). the l2-regular method be call ‘ridge’ regress and be not gener 
sparse. 

(d) random forest be a popular black box method that make predict by use a larg 
ensembl of weak classif trees. the method be origin develop by breiman 
(2001a) but be wide use for predict of recidiv (see, for example, berk et al. (2009) 
and ritter (2013)). 

(e) svm be a popular black box method for non-parametr linear classification. the rbf 
kernel let the method handl classif problem where the decis boundari may 
be non-linear (see, for example, cristianini and shawe-taylor (2000) and berk and bleich 
(2014)). 

(f) sgb be a popular black box method that creat predict model in the form of an 
ensembl of weaker predict model (friedman, 2001; freund and schapire, 1997). 

4.1.4. detail on experiment design, paramet tune and comput 
We summar the methods, softwar and set that we use in our experi in tabl 4. 

for each of the six recidiv predict problem and each of the nine methods, we con- 
struct roc curv by run the algorithm with 19 valu of w+. the valu of W+ 
be chosen to produc model across the full roc curves. By default, we chose valu of 
W+ ∈{0:1, 0:2, : : : , 1:9} and set W− =2−w+. these valu of W+ be inappropri for prob- 
lem with a signific class imbal a all method produc trivial models. thus, for sig- 
nificantli imbalanc problems, such a domest violenc and sexual violence, we 
use valu of W+ ∈ {1:815, 1:820, : : : , 1:995}. for fatal violence, which be extrem 
imbalanced, we use W+ ∈{1:975, 1:976, : : : , 1:995}. 

thi set-up requir u to produc a total of 1026 recidiv predict model (six recidiv 
problem time nine method time 19 imbal ratios). each of the 1026 model be built 
on a train set and their perform be assess out of sample. In particular, a third of 
the data be reserv a the test set. the remain two-third of the data be the train set. 
dure training, we use fivefold nest cross-valid (cv) for paramet tuning. explicitly,

problem specif (see section 4.1.4 for details). 

the train data be split into five folds, and one of those be reserv a the valid fold. 
the valid fold be rotat to select free paramet values, and a final model be train 
on the full train set (two-thirds) with the select paramet valu and it perform be 
assess on the test set (a third). the fold be gener onc to allow for comparison across 
method and predict problems. the paramet be chosen dure nest CV to minim 
the mean weight fivefold CV error on the train set. have obtain a set of 19 differ 
model for each method and each problem, we then construct an roc curv for that method 
on that problem by plot the test tpr and test fpr of the 19 final models. 

We train all baselin method by use publicli avail packag in R 3.2.2 (R core team, 
2015) without impos ani time constraints. In comparison, we train slim by solv IP 
problem with the cplex 12.6 applic program interfac in matlab 2013a. We solv 
each IP through the follow procedure: we train the solver on the formul in section 
3.3 for a total of 4 h on a local comput cluster with 2.7-ghz central processor units. each 
time we solv an IP problem we kept 500 feasibl solut and polish them by use the 
formul in section 3.4. We then use the same nest CV procedur a the other method 
to tune the number of term in the final model. polish all 500 solut take less than 1 min 
of comput time. thus, the total number of optim problem that we solv be 500 
polish IP problem time (five fold plu one final model) time six problem time 19 valu 
of W+ =342000 IP problems.

†each cell contain the test auc. 

We make the follow import observations, which we believ carri over to a larg class 
of problem beyond predict of recidivism. 

(a) all method do well on the gener recidiv predict problem arrest. In thi case, 
we observ onli small differ in predict accuraci of differ methods: all method 
other than cart attain a test auc abov 0.72; the high test auc of 0.73 be achiev 
by sgb, ridg regress and random forests. thi multipl of good model reflect 
the rashomon effect of breiman (2001a). 

(b) major differ between method appear in their perform on imbalanc pre- 
diction problems. We expect differ method to respond differ to chang in the 
misclassif cost and therefor train each method over a larg rang of possibl 
misclassif costs. even so, it be difficult (if not impossible) to tune certain method 
to produc model at certain point of the roc curv (see, for example, problem with 
signific imbalance, such a fatal violence). 

(c) the svm rbfs, sgb, the lasso and ridg regress could produc accur model at dif- 
ferent point on the roc curv for most problems. sgb usual achiev the high auc 
on most problem (e.g. arrest, drug, gener violence, domest violenc 
and fatal violence). the lasso, ridg regress and the svm rbf often produc 
compar aucs. We find that these method respond well to cost-sensit tuning, but 
it be difficult to tune the misclassif cost for highli imbalanc problems, such a 
fatal violence, to obtain model at specif point on the roc curve. 

(d) the c5.0t, c5.0r and cart method could not produc accur model at differ 
point on the roc curv on ani imbalanc problems. We found that these method 
do not respond well to cost-sensit tuning. the issu becom markedli more sever 
a problem becom more imbalanced. for drug and gener violence, for in- 
stance, these method could not produc model with high tpr. for fatal violence, 
sexual violenc and domest violence, these method almost alway pro- 
duce trivial model that predict y = −1 (result in auc of 0.5). thi result may 
be attribut to the greedi natur of the algorithm that be use to fit the trees, a 
oppos to the use of tree model in general. the issu be unlik to be softwar re- 
late a it affect both c5.0 and cart method and have be observ by other (see, 
for example, goh and rudin (2014)). thi problem might not occur if tree be good 
optimized.

fig. 2. risk calibr plot for arrest base on test data: we compar three model chosen at a similar 
decis point, with test fpr � 50%; although it be not a risk assess tool, we see that slim be well 
calibr 

(e) In general, slim produc model that be close to or on the effici frontier of the 
roc curve, despit be restrict to a rel small class of simpl linear model (at 
most eight non-zero coeffici from −10 to 10). even on highli imbalanc problem 
such a domest violenc and sexual violence, it respond well to chang in 
misclassif cost (a expected, by natur of it formulation). 

In addit to predict accuracy, we also examin the risk calibr of the models. fig. 2 
show the risk calibr for arrest, construct by use the bin method from zadrozni 
and elkan (2002). We includ calibr plot for all other problem in an extend version 
of appendix B of the on-lin supplement. We see that slim be well calibrated, even though 
there be no reason whi it should be; it be a decision-mak tool, not a risk assess tool. 
for arrest, the lasso and ridg regress be well calibrated; however, they lose thi qualiti 
onc we consid onli spars model (see appendix D of the on-lin supplement). thi properti 
would also be lose if the lasso and ridg regress coeffici be rounded. 

4.3. trade-off between accuraci and interpret 
In appendix C, we show that the baselin method cannot maintain the same level of accuraci 
a they have in section 4.2 when their model size be constrained. for the lasso, ridg regress 
and slim, model size be defin a the number of featur in the model. for the cart and c5.0 
methods, model size be the number of leaf or rules. In fact, we find that the onli method that 
can consist produc accur model along the full roc curv and also have the potenti 
for interpret be slim and the (non-sparse) lasso.

alli unabl to produc model that attain high degre of accuracy. worse, even for balanc

problem such a arrest, where these method do produc accur models, the model be 
complic and use a veri larg number of rule or leaf (similar behaviour for c5.0t or 
c5.0r be also observ by, for instance, lim et al. (2000)). As we show in appendix C, it be 
not reason possibl to obtain a c5.0r, c5.0t or cart model with at most eight rule or 
eight leaf for almost everi predict problem. 

4.4. On the interpret of equal accur transpar model 
To ass the interpret of differ models, we provid a comparison of predict model 
produc by the slim, lasso and cart method for the arrest problem in tabl 6 and 7 and 
fig. 3. thi set-up provid a nice basi for comparison a all three method produc model at 
roughli the same decis point, and with the same degre of sparsity. for thi comparison, we 
consid ani transpar model with at most eight coeffici (the lasso), eight rule (c5.0r) 
or eight leaf (c5.0t and cart) and have a test fpr of below 50%. We report the model with 
the minimum weight test error. here, neither c5.0r nor c5.0t could produc an accept 
model with at most eight rule or eight leaves, so onli model from the slim, cart and lasso 
method could be displayed. As describ before, it be rare for the lasso and cart method to 
produc model with a similar degre of accuraci to slim when the model size be constrained. 
We make the follow observations. 

(a) all three model attain similar level of predict accuracy. test tpr-valu rang 
between 70% and 79% and test fpr-valu rang between 43% and 48%. there may 
not be a classif model that can attain substanti high accuracy.

(b) the slim model us five input variabl and small integ coeffici (see, for example, 
tabl 6). there be a natur rule-bas interpretation. In thi case, the model impli that, 
if the prison be young (age at releas of 18 to 24) or have a histori of arrest (prior 
arrests�5), he be highli like to be rearrested. In contrast, if he be rel old (age 
at release�40) or have no histori of arrest (no prior arrests), he be unlik to commit 
anoth crime. 

(c) the cart model also allow user to make predict without a calculator. In com- 
parison with the slim model, however, the hierarch structur of the cart model 
make it difficult to gaug the relationship of each input variabl on the predict out- 
come. consider, for instance, the relationship between age at releas and the outcome. 
In thi case, user be immedi awar that there be an effect, a the model branch 
on the variabl age at release�40 and age at releas 18 to 24. however, the effect 
be difficult to comprehend sinc it depend on prior arrest for misdemeanour: if prior 
arrests�5 = 1 and age at releas 18 to 24 = 1 then the model predict ŷ=1; if prior 
arrests�5 = 0 and age at release�40 = 0 then ŷ = 1; however, if prior arrests�5 = 0 
and age at release�40 = 1 then ŷ =1 onli if prior arrest for misdemeanor = 1. such 
issu do not affect linear model such a slim and the lasso, where user can immedi- 
ate gaug the direct and strength of the relationship between an input variabl and 
the predict outcom by the size and sign of a coefficient. the literatur on interpretabil- 
iti in machin learn indic that interpret be domain specific; there be some 
domain where logic model be prefer over linear models, and vice versa (e.g. freita

model that be present here may be suitabl for screen tasks. To obtain a model that be 
suitabl for sentencing, a point on the roc curv with a much high tpr would be needed. 
We note that these model gener well from the data set, which be evid by the close match 
between test tpr/fpr (tabl 5) and train tpr/fpr (tabl 13 in appendix a).

relat offenc if he or she have ever have ani prior drug offences. similarly, the model for 
sexual violenc in tabl 11 effect state that a person will be rearrest for a sexual 
offenc if and onli if he or she have a prior histori of sexual crimes. for completeness, we includ 
comparison with other model in appendix B. 

5. discuss 

our paper merg two perspect on model recidivism: the first be to obtain accur 
predict model by use the most power machin learn tool that be available, and the 
second be to creat model that be easi to use and understand. 

We use a set of featur that be commonli access to polic offic and judges, and 
compar the abil of variou machin learn method to produc model at differ deci- 
sion point across the roc curve. our result suggest that it be possibl for tradit methods, 
such a ridg regression, to perform just a well a more modern methods, such a sgb—a 
find that be in line with the work of tollenaar and van der heijden (2013) and yang et al. 
(2010). further, we found that even simpl model may perform surprisingli well, even when 
they be fit from a heavili constrain space—a find that be in line with work on the 
surpris perform of simpl model (see, for example, daw (1979) and holt (1993, 
2006)). 

our studi show that there may be major advantag of use slim for predict of recidi- 
vism, a it can depend produc a simpl score system that be accur and interpret on 
ani decis point along the roc curve. interpret be crucial for mani of the high stake 
applic where recidiv predict model be be used. In such applications, it be not 
enough for the decis maker to know what input variabl be be use to train the model, or 
how individu input variabl be relat to the outcome; decis maker should know how the 
model combin all the input variabl to gener it predictions, and whether thi mechan 
align with their ethic values. slim not onli show thi mechan but also accommod 
constraint that be design to align the predict model with the ethic valu of the decis 
maker. 

In comparison with current machin learn methods, the main drawback of run slim 
be increas comput involv in solv an IP problem. for this, we propos two new 
techniqu to reduc comput involv in train high qualiti slim score systems: 



recidiv predict 713 

(a) a polish procedur that improv the qualiti of feasibl solut that be found by an 
IP solver and 

(b) an IP formul that make it easi for an IP solver to provid a certif of optimality. 

In our experiments, the time that be requir to train slim be ultim compar with the 
time that be requir to train random forest or sgb. however, it be still signific compar 
with the time that be requir for other method such a the cart, c5.0 method and penal 
logist regression. In theory, the comput that be requir to find an optim solut to the 
slim integ programm be ‘np hard’, mean that the run time increas exponenti with 
the number of features. In practice, the run time depend on sever factors, such a the number of 
samples, the number of dimensions, the underli eas of the classif and how the data be 
encoded. sinc most criminolog problem cannot by natur involv massiv data set (sinc 
each observ be a person), and sinc comput speed of solv million of instruct per 
second also increas exponentially, it be possibl that mathemat program techniqu 
like slim be well suit to criminolog problem that be substanti larg and more 
complex than the problem that be discuss in thi work.

appendix A: addit result on predict accuraci 

To supplement the experiment result in section 4.2, we includ the train and fivefold CV results. 
tabl 13 show the train auc perform for all method on all predict problems, and tabl 14 
show the fivefold CV auc perform for all methods. A tabl of test auc for all method on all 
predict problem can be found in tabl 5. 

appendix B: model-bas comparison 

In section 4, we includ a comparison of transpar model produc for the arrest problem. here, 
we includ a similar comparison for all other recidiv predict problems. 

the model and calibr plot that be show here correspond to the best model that we produc 
by use the lasso and ridg regress (i.e. the model that be plot a point in fig. 1). We omit

contain too mani leaf to be printed. for ani give problem, the model oper at similar decis 
point (tpr) and be constrain to the same fpr-criteria a in section 4.5. 

the calibr plot will appear to be flat for problem with signific class imbalance. typically, a 
well-calibr classifi on a problem without class imbal should fall on the x = y line. however, 
becaus the y-axi be defin a p{y=1|s.x/= s}, where s be the predict score of a model, the slope of the 
graph will be less than p.y=1/ by definition. therefore, for a highli imbalanc problem such a fatal 
violence, where p.i =1/=0:7%, the plot will be flat.

appendix C: addit result on the trade-off between accuraci and

In the experi in section 4, we use slim to fit model from a highli constrain space (i.e. model 
with at most eight non-zero integ coeffici between −10 and 10). here, we present evid to show 
that baselin method cannot attain the same level of accuraci or risk calibr when they be use to fit 
model from a slightli less constrain model space (i.e. a model with at most eight non-zero coefficients, 
eight leaf or eight rules). 

tabl 15 show the test auc of each method when they be use to fit a model with a model size of 8 
or less. trivial model of size 1 have also be omitted. tabl 16 show the percentag chang in test auc 
for the method due to the model size restriction. for all model other than slim, the predict accuraci 
be compromis with the size constraint. We see that c5.0r and c5.0t cannot produc a suitabl spars
