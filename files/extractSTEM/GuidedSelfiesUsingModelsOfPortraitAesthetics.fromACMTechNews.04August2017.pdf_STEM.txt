abstract 
We introduc techniqu enabl interact guidanc for 
good self-portrait photo (“selfies”) use a smartphon cam- 
era. aesthet qualiti be estim use empir model for 
three parameter composit principles: face size, face 
position, and light direction. the model be built use 
2,700 crowdwork assess of highly-control synthet 
selfies. these be gener by manipul a virtual camera 
and light when render a realist 3D model of a human 
to method explor the paramet space. A camera appli- 
cation us the model to estim the aesthet qualiti of a 
live selfi preview base on paramet measur by comput 
vision. the photograph be guid toward a good selfi by 
direct hint overlaid on the live preview. A studi show 
the techniqu provid a 26% increas in aesthet qualiti 
compar to a standard camera application.

smartphon self-portrait photographs, call “selfies”, account 
for more than 30% of pictur take by peopl age 18 to 
24 [15]. however, not everyon have photographi skills, so 
these be often unsatisfi images. visual aesthet can be 
improv after a selfi be take by edit and re-touch [8], 
but thi requir extra effort, reduc realism, may degrad res- 
olution, and aspect like face distort and light direct

be hard to correct. use a “selfi stick” or a smartphon case 
with a built-in ring light [23, 24] can reduc distort and im- 
prove lighting, but use accessori be not alway convenient. 

We introduc a methodolog and techniqu for interact aes- 
thetic guidanc when take a selfi on standard smartphon 
(fig. 1). instead of encod rule-of-thumb photograph prin- 
cipl [26, 27, 33], we deriv quantit aesthet model 
empirically. rather than learn principl from a dataset of 
near-random imag take from the internet (e.g. [18, 10, 36, 9, 
22, 38]), we gener highly-control synthet self-portrait 
photograph use 3D rendering. thi enabl a method ex- 
plorat and valid of underli composit features, 
in our case: face size, face position, and light direction. 

our dataset of synthet selfi be use in 2,700 crowdwork 
assessments. these assess be transform into three 
quantit models, each map a composit featur 
configur to an aesthet score. We then describ a smart- 
phone applic to analys the preview imag with comput 
vision method when take a selfie. with thi analysis, the 
configur of each featur may be calcul and fed to our 
model to find the current aesthet score and direct of 
improvement. correspond direct hint be then over- 
laid on the preview image, guid the photograph to move 
the smartphon to improv one type of aesthet quality. In 
a study, selfi take with our system be rat 26% high 
compar to those take by a standard camera application. 
To make the problem tractable, our focu be on single-person 
selfi without a domin background object. however, our 
system be design so the photograph can select ig- 
nore some guidanc to includ other peopl or compens for 
background like tourist landmarks. We make the follow 
contributions: 

• A systemat assess of three featur of selfi aesthet- 
ics: face position, face size, and light direction. 

• empirically-deriv model to estim the aesthet score 
and direct of improv for each feature.

iti and capabl to increas aesthet quality. 

background and relat work 
although photographi be an art form, rules-of-thumb have 
be propos to make even casual photograph more aes- 
thetic pleasing. child [7] emphas that composit 
be import to attract and keep the viewer’ attent and it 
complement the commun between the viewer and the 
photograph. one of the most common composit rule be the 
rule-of-third [31]. thi be a 3×3 grid form by divid the 
imag horizont and vertic into nine equal portions. the 
grid line intersect point be call “power-points” which 
be commonli consid the best locat to place signifi- 
cant elements. for portrait photography, guid recommend 
how to use the rule-of-third to compos portrait style such a 
“head-and-shoulders”, “three-quarter”, and “full-length” [17]. 
for example, place the eye in the top third for singl person 
portrait [11]. A relat composit principl be the size of 
the subject [22, 25, 29]. In portraiture, some recommend fill- 
ing the frame with the face [11], but face size be also depend 
on the intend portrait style [17]. 

In addit to these spatial composit principles, hurter [17] 
emphas the import of light composition. hurter 
argu light be the domin factor to repres a three- 
dimension realiti in a two-dimension space, “just a a 
sculptor model clay to creat the illus of depth, so light 
model the shape of the face to give it depth and form.” dif- 
ferent rule have be propos for portraitur lighting. some 
suggest a side-light so a pattern of light and shadow defin 
the face [7, 16], other recommend a frontal light to elimin 
shadow and flatten the face [34]. 

comput aesthet 
sinc such rules-of-thumb be imprecis and questionable, 
research have attempt to calcul the aesthet qualiti 
of imag use comput methods. one approach be to 
model aesthet qualiti a a machin learn problem with an 
unconstrain number of features. A larg corpu of imag 
be rat by peopl to establish a ground truth for aesthet 
quality. mani global and local featur be extract from the 
same imag that be rat (typic imag statist relat 
to colour, edges, contours, saliency, etc.). then, machin 
learn algorithm be train use the rate and extract 
featur to automat rate imag for aesthetics. most 
investig use photograph acquir from an ad hoc onlin 
databas [18, 10, 36, 9, 22, 38] sinc larg amount of data be 
need for training. however, model use mani featur 
and with uncontrol train imag often span mani 
class (e.g landscapes, animals, groups, portraits, etc.) make 
it difficult to find underli aesthet rule [25]. 

thi gener approach have also be appli to portrait pho- 
tographs. khan and vogel [20] model aesthet qualiti of 
individu portrait use a small set of featur from photog- 
raphi tutorials, includ face posit and lighting. male 

et al. [27] train on featur they argu be use by profession 
photographers, includ composition, face size, and featur 
relat to light, like contrast, lightness, and highlights. redi 
et al. [33] use featur inspir by photograph guides, includ- 
ing composit rules. chen et al. [6] develop a method to 
extract featur of artist lighting. 

these work valid our focu on face position, face size, 
and lighting, but they still use highli variabl train imag 
from onlin databases. although redi et al.’ [33] result 
suggest portrait aesthet be independ of age, gender, and 
ethnicity, other work suggest otherwise. mazza et al. [29] find 
that dress and gender influenc the percept of “head-shot” 
photograph and Xu et al. [37] found peopl rate photo 
for aesthet qualiti often comment on non-composit 
featur like smile and mood. also, manovich et al.’ “selfi 
city” [28] — a theoretic, artistic, and quantit studi of 
selfi — provid compel evid that age, gender, pose, 
and facial express be link to highli rat photographs. 

thi suggest that rate uncontrol imag to train model 
for composit aesthet qualiti be problematic. In addit 
to non-aesthet confounds, precis extract high-level 
featur like light direct be difficult for arbitrari imag 
and mani featur chang from imag to imag so understand- 
ing whi a rater chose a certain imag be difficult. moreover, 
mani of these work creat featur base on rules-of-thumb, 
but recent work suggest some rules, like the rule-of-thirds, 
may not improv aesthet rate [37, 2]. these factor all 
introduc error and uncertainti into the aesthet model. 

our highli control synthet imag corpu elimin these 
potenti confound when rate aesthetics. In addition, our 
corpu isol composit featur when rating, disentan- 
gling complex interact result from compar rate 
when multipl featur vary. 

realtim aesthet guidanc 
the work abov develop aesthet model to evalu exist 
images. some explicitli use evalu imag a exampl 
to teach amateur photograph method to improv aesthet- 
ic [38], but they do not assist while take a photograph. our 
goal be to model aesthet to creat an interact camera ap- 
plicat with aesthet guidance. thi be complementari to 
guidanc for low level featur like exposure, luminance, and 
motion blur [30, 3]. 

previou system exist for realtim aesthet guidanc for 
photographi and video. Ma et al. [26] develop an aesthet 
model to suggest where to pose a person in a landscap pho- 
tograph (visual by a rectangle). however, the techniqu 
be not implement on a smartphon or test for interact 
use. san pedro and church [35] describ a smartphon cam- 
era applic to guid photograph use 22 composit 
and 7 exposur featur applic to a wide class of imag 
(propos by obrador et al. [31]). feedback us a music 
composit map to featur scores, a small pilot studi be 
inconclus whether aesthet qualiti be improved.

size, face location, and scene brightness, tilt, and stability. A 
relat system by kumano et al. [21] us icon to indic 
when video motion be poor and to suggest when to zoom or 
pan the shot. these two system encod exist videographi 
rules-of-thumb, and neither be formal evaluated. 

there be two direct precursor to our work. A commerci 
app call camera51 [1] “intellig analyz a scene and 
look for lines, shapes, and people” [12] to provid guidanc 
to a single, global optim composition. the underli al- 
gorithm and aesthet rule be unknown, and the user have no 
abil to select improv specif composit principl 
while ignor others. 

Xu et al. [37] develop a realtim guidanc system for portrait 
photographs. face posit and subject size be guid use 
a rule-bas aesthet model deriv directli from the rule- 
of-thirds: the face should be on a grid line or power point, 
and the subject width should be one-third of the image. their 
system requir a special laptop and extern three-camera 
array. A studi conduct outdoor evalu whether the 
system improv aesthet compar to a baselin system 
show onli a static rule-of-third grid. unlik Xu et al., 
our system be specif focu on self-portraits, it work 
on a standard smartphone, it consid light direct in 
addit to face posit and size, our guidanc be base on 
empirically-deriv model deriv from a synthet dataset, 
and our final evalu environ be highly-controlled. 

dataset and aesthet qualiti rate 
our goal be to help novic photograph take self-portrait 
that averag peopl find more aesthet pleasing. We ac- 
complish thi by render hundr of synthet portrait that 
systemat vari three key composit features: face 
size, face position, and light direction. these portrait be 
use to gather aesthet rate in an onlin crowdsourc 
experiment. We explain how these rate be transform into 
model to guid peopl when take selfi in a late section. 

3D render synthet selfi dataset 
all synthet portrait be 3D render of realistic-look 
3D human model in front of a uniform 18% grey background. 
We use 3 femal and 3 male models, with each gender pair 
have caucasian, asian, or black ethnic features. model 
be select to be consist and “average” look with 
neutral facial expressions, typic hair styles, no glasses, and 
similar poses. the arm of our 3D model be not poseable, so 
our synthet selfi do not captur the subject though hold 
the smartphone. however, it be unlik thi small detail alter 
aesthet ratings. By gener portrait across all six models, 
we elimin confound like background, gender, and smile 
when rat for aesthet quality. 

render be gener use blender (www.blender.com), 
an open-sourc 3D model program. virtual camera prop- 
erti be set to simul the front camera of an iphon 6 
(focal length 45mm, field-of-view 54.2◦, aspect ratio 3:4), and 
a parallel light sourc be configur to simul the sun or 
domin indoor light source. ambient light be set to soften 
shadow and simul typic light condit outsid or in 
brightli lit interiors. use a python api, the posit of the 

human model, virtual camera, and parallel light sourc be 
manipul to explor each aesthet featur a explain 
below. 

note that dataset gener and aesthet qualiti rate be 
interleav a the three featur be explor in sequence. 
first, portrait to explor face size be gener and as- 
sessed. these result establish which face size to use when 
gener portrait to explor face position. after face posi- 
tion be assessed, the result be use to select face posit 
and size when explor the light direct feature. 

face size 
face size be an import featur becaus a face in a portrait 
should be larg enough to be the centr of interest, but not 
so close that facial featur distort [13]. We defin face size 
a the ratio between the width of face — twice the distanc 
between the eye — and one-third of the imag width. thi 
ratio normal the featur and relat it to the rule-of-third 
guidelin which suggest subject should be size to one cell 
in a rule-of-third grid. A face size of 1.0 match thi exist 
guideline. 

To gener portrait explor face size, we posit the vir- 
tual camera and human model to render 19 imag with face 
size rang from 0.2 to 2.0 in step of 0.1 (fig. 2). the rang 
of ratio be base on measur real selfi take a close a 
possibl without face crop and a far a possibl use a 
standard “selfi stick.” the face posit and light direct 
be constant: face posit be centred, and the light sourc 
shine straight onto the face. 

figur 2: exampl face size portraits: 0.4, 0.8, 2.0 use asian female. 

face posit 
the rule-of-third be commonli use to posit subject in 
photograph [7, 17] and previou research have employ it 
for aesthet rate [26, 9] and guidanc [37]. We defin 
face posit a the 2D locat of the centroid of the eye 
and parametr it use a subdivid 3×3 rule-of-third grid. 
each grid cell be divid by 4 to construct a 12×12 grid with 
face posit denot a (x,y), where x and y be multipl 
of 112 in term of normal imag position. thi way, face 
posit (4,4), (4,8), (8,8), and (8,4) correspond to rule-of- 
third “power points” assum to be prefer posit [20]. 

base on the distribut of face size aesthet rate (recal 
dataset gener and rate be interleaved), we explor 
face posit use 4 face sizes: 0.3, 0.5, 0.8, and 1.0. for 
each face size, 81 imag be render with the virtual cam- 
era place to creat face posit rang from (2,2) to (10,10) 
— a 9×9 subset of the 12×12 grid parametr that avoid

extrem crop face (fig. 3). the face be kept orient 
toward the camera by align the model’ face direct (rep- 
resent a the normal of a transpar plane) to the camera 
film plane. As in face size images, the light sourc shine 
straight onto the face. 

figur 3: exampl face posit portraits: (4,4), (6,6), (9,2) use asian 
male with face size 0.8. 

light direct 
the domin light sourc be assum to be omnidirect 
with parallel ray like the sun. We defin light direct a 
the light sourc posit in spheric coordin azimuth and 
polar angl (θ,φ), with the origin at the centr of the head. for 
example, the light be directli in front of the face at (0◦,90◦), to 
the right side and half-way abov at (−90◦,45◦), and directli 
abov at (0◦,0◦). 

To reduc the space to explore, we assum light should not 
come from below or behind the face. thi restrict the rang of 
θ to [−120◦,120◦] and φ to [0◦,90◦]. with step size of 30◦ for 
θ and 11.25◦ for φ, each compon have 9 set creat 81 
total combinations. We use aesthet rate result from face 
size and face posit to creat 4 set of light images: size 
0.3, posit (6,2); size 0.5, posit (6,3); size 0.8, posit 
(6,4); and size 1.0, posit (6,4). the virtual camera posit 
be fix to maintain the face size and posit a the light 
sourc partial orbit around the head posit (fig. 4). 

figur 4: exampl of light direct portraits: (-60°,67°), (0°,90°), 
(90°,90°) use black femal with face size 1.0, face posit (6,4). 

aesthet rate 
these set of synthet selfi be rat for aesthet qualiti on 
amazon mechan turk (amt). worker pick a multipl 
best and bad imag for each set of imag portray a 
singl 3D human model for each composit feature. 

particip 
We recruit 2,700 amt worker without ani experience, age, 
or locat criterion (though the major live in the unit 

states). our object be to get aesthet rate from “averag 
people.” worker be paid between $0.10 and $0.30 per task 
(call a hit on amt). the full protocol be approv by a 
research ethic board. 

task and implement 
the task be to view a set of synthet portrait of a singl 
model explor a singl composit feature, and pick at 
least N good and N bad images. for example, pick 8 good 
and 8 bad imag among 81 portrait of the caucasian male 
model with differ face positions. note that compar two 
imag at a time would not be practic — there would be 
3,240 comparison in just one face size imag set. 

user interfac for amt task must be clear and effici to 
encourag worker to complet the task correctli and honestli 
[32]. We iter develop our interfac with these goal 
(fig. 5). thumbnail of imag be arrang in a 9×9 grid 
(for face posit and light direction), or a 1×19 row (for 
face size). click on a thumbnail display it a a full imag 
and select it (when the task begins, a random thumbnail be 
selected). thumbnail can be select and view quickli by 
drag the mous or use cursor keys. 

click on a rate button, or use a shortcut key, classifi 
the select imag and indic the decis with a colour out- 
line: green for ‘good’ (shortcut key ‘1’), blue for ‘undecided’ 
(key ‘2’), and red for ‘bad’ (key ‘3’). An undecid decis 
be automat assign when a thumbnail be select for 
more than 2 seconds, but no good or bad rate provided. the 
worker can chang their rate at ani time. the remain 
number of good and bad rate be show in the rate but- 
tons. onc the minimum number of rate be completed, a 
submit button be enabled. the task be implement a a web 
applic use angularjs.

design 
recal that we gener one set of imag for face size, four 
set of imag for face position, and four set of imag for 
light direction, make nine set in total. each task rate 
imag in one set for one human model: for face size, worker 
have to pick at least 3 good and 3 bad images; for face posit 
and light direction, they have to pick at least 8 good and 
8 bad images. with 9 set and 6 human model there be

9∗6 = 54 task variations. for each task variation, we recruit 
50 workers, requir 2,700 worker in total. 

the procedur be a typic amt hit. when the hit be 
accepted, the worker acknowledg a consent form and then 
view a video demonstr the task interface. instruct 
clarifi that the goal be to “choos good and bad exampl of 
imag when consid them a selfies.” 

result 
To calcul the score of each imag (repres a specif 
configur for one of the principl be evalu with a 
specif model), we sum all rate use the follow 
tally: +1 for each ‘good’, -1 for each ‘bad’, and 0 otherwise. 
each imag talli be then divid by the number of time that 
imag be rat (regardless if ‘good’, ‘bad’, or ‘undecided’) 
to normal score to a rang between -1 and 1. 

To examin the consist of score and actual sampl size 
for each image, we calcul the standard error of the mean 
(sem) and percentag of task each imag be rated. rate 
score be consistent, all sem be less than 0.05. actual 
sampl size be excel for face size, with all imag rat 
by at least 74% of workers, and good for face posit and 
light direct with all imag rat by at least 30% and 
45% of worker respectively. 

face size 
figur 6 illustr the results. the prefer face size be 
0.8 (score 0.33) and 0.5 (score 0.32). the score dip to 0.22 
between those peak and down to 0.13 for the small face 
size 0.2. however, all face size less than 1.4 have a posit 
rating. In contrast, score for larg face size fall sharply, 
decreas to -0.6 for face size 2.0. 

thi suggest peopl prefer face to be 50% of a rule-of-thirds- 
grid cell (16% of imag width) or 80% to 90% of a rule-of- 
third grid cell (27% to 30% of imag width). note that face 
veri far from the camera, approxim less than 30% of a 
rule-of-third grid cell (10% of imag width), be rat lower. 
most pronounc be low rate for face veri close to the 
camera, with neg score when face be larg than 130% 
of a rule-of-third grid cell (43% of the imag width). 

face posit 
figur 6 illustr the results. A mass of posit score 0.7 
or great can be see when the face be roughli horizont 
centred. thi posit mass move vertic up the imag a 
the face size becom smaller. posit near the bottom and 
side be negative, most below -0.3, like due to cropping. 

higher aesthet rate for a centr face break from the ac- 
cept rule-of-third principl [9]. row and column label 
4 and 8 repres rule-of-third “power lines”, and cell at 
posit (4,4), (8,4), (4,8), and (8,8) repres rule-of-third 
“power points.” there be no indic of high rate for 
power-lin or power points. thi add empir support to 
Xu et al.’ [37] inform observations. 

light direct 
the pattern of score for the four set of light direct 
score appear veri similar. figur 6 illustr the score for 

the four set and the aggreg results. A mass of posit 
score can be see when θ be between −30◦ to 30◦ and φ be 
between 67.5◦ to 78.75◦, with a notabl posit extens 
down to φ = 90◦ at θ = 0◦, and out to θ = ±60◦ at φ = 78.75◦. 
higher aesthet rate for light shin directli (or nearli 
directly) on the face reduc shadow and evenli light the 
entir face. thi be exactli the result when use a smartphon 
case with a built-in ring light [23, 24], but it contradict some 
past work [20, 6] suggest that light a face from one side 
be preferable. 

summari 
these rate suggest clear prefer for face size, face 
position, and light when take selfies: face should not 
be too big, face should be centr and near the top without 
get too close to the edge, and light should shine from the 
front. although these may appear elementary, they have not 
be deriv empir before. moreover, have matrix 
of score will enabl our guidanc system to suggest local 
direct of improv (i.e. “move your face right”) which 
be more flexibl for user than simpli suggest the global 
prefer locat (i.e. “move your face here”). 

aesthet model 
In order to use the rate for real-tim guidance, we transform 
the matrix of score into three models. each model estim 
an aesthet score and direct of improv for one com- 
posit featur give the current state of composit 
featur parameters. the main challeng be how to transform 
empir know score at discret paramet set into 
continu function that return a score for ani measur face 
size, face position, and light direction. 

the gener form of each model be (s, d) = f (ω0,ω1, ...,ωn). It 
be a function f which accept composit featur paramet 
{ω0,ω1, ...,ωn} to calcul a score s and a vector d describ 
the direct in composit featur space that will improv 
the score. 

the specif model are: 

• face size: (ss, ds) = fs(r) 
the model us an interpol lookup into the 1×19 row 
matrix of face size scores. given the detect face size 
ratio r, the score s be a linear interpol between the two 
know score at face size defin the interv where r lies. 
If r be outsid the 1×19 row matrix, the s be extrapol 
use the two closest know scores. the one-dimension 
direct of improv d be the direct toward the 
larg interv score. 

• face position: (sp, dp) = fp(x,y,r) 
recal there be four 8×8 matrix of face posit score 
for four face size ratio (0.3, 0.5, 0.8, 1.0). the model 
us a two-step interpol lookup into these four matrices. 
the detect face size ratio r be use to construct an 8×8 
matrix by linearli interpol correspond element of

• light direction: (sl, dl) = fl(u,v) 
unlik face posit or face size, we cannot directli measur 
3D light direct Θ and Φ from a 2D image. instead, 
the model us (u,v), vector compon to repres the di- 
rection and magnitud of the brightest patch of skin around 
the nose. We describ our algorithm to comput (u,v) later. 
these light direct compon be transform into 
the best estim for Θ and Φ by find the near neigh- 
bour to a set of canon compon (u∗,v∗) comput 
use the 3D human model and know Θ and Φ. with Θ 
and Φ, the correspond score can be found in the singl 
aggreg 8×8 light score matrix. the direct dl be 
the 2D direct toward the surround matrix element 
with the high score. 

smartphon applic 
We creat a smartphon “app” that detect the current face 
size, face position, and light direct use comput vi- 
sion techniqu and pass these to the aesthet models. the 
result be use to provid interact guidanc by suggest 
how to move the smartphon to improv aesthetics. our app 
run on an iphon 6 with io 9.3 use opencv 2.4.10 for 
comput vision. 

featur detect and calcul use comput vision 
each frame of the camera preview be captur and downsam- 
plead to 240×320 pixels. the nativ io cidetector be use 
to find the bound box of the face, mouth, and eyes. An 

opencv haar classifi be use to detect the nose, but to im- 
prove speed and robustness, onli the region bound by the 
eye and mouth be searched. face and eye detect run at 
12 fp and nose detect at 8 fps, accept for real time 
photo guidance. these detect featur be use to comput 
model paramet a follows. 

face size (r) and face posit (x,y) 
recal face size and face posit be express rel to 
a rule-of-third grid. the current face size (r) be the ratio 
of twice the distanc between the detect eye posit to 
one-third of the width of the preview image. the current face 
posit (x,y) be the centroid of the eye express in twelfth 
of the preview imag width and height. A low-pass filter [5] be 
appli to stabil the face size and face posit ratio across 
frames. 

light direct (u,v) 
To calcul the light direction, we examin the pattern 
of lumin on and around the nose. the protrud nose 
geometri produc local shadow and highlight that captur 
the global light information. previou work use the pattern 
of light on the nose for 2D track [14]. 

the detect nose region-of-interest (roi) be downsampl 
to 100×100 px and convert to hsv colour space. eight 
9×9 px patch be defin radial around the centr of the 
nose roi, each with a correspond patch direct vector vi 
from nose roi centr to patch centr (figur 7a). the ratio 
of the median lumin of each patch li to the lumin 
at nose roi centr lc be use to scale each correspond 
direct vector: (li/lc)× vi. for robustness, the step abov 
be repeat for patch at radiu from 9 px to 45 px. the final 
light direct vector compon (u,v) be the sum of the

scale vector from all iterations. A low-pass filter [5] be also 
appli to stabil (u,v) across frames. 

figur 7: light direct detection: (a) algorithm illustration; (b) test 
examples. 

We inform test thi algorithm in two stages. first, we 
ran the algorithm on the synthet imag use for the light 
direct ratings. To prevent a confound from imperfect nose 
detection, the nose region be defin in blender by render 
a rectangle. A comparison of the calcul light direct 
with know light direct for differ valu of Φ and 
Θ suggest the algorithm work well when the face be lit from 
the front (Θ ∈ [−90◦,90◦]), but becom noisi when lit from 
behind (Θ ∈ [−120◦,−90◦]∪ [90◦,120◦]) or top (Φ = 0◦). 
second, we ran the algorithm on real photo (1 femal and 2 
males) take at differ orient to the sun (exampl in 
figur 7b). the calcul light direct be consist 
for all three set with similar noisi measur when lit 
from the top and behind. It also appear to be robust to the 
presenc of eyeglass and facial hair. 

In practice, we found it work well insid a well, long a 
there be a reason domin light source. diffus light or 
veri low light introduc some noise, but in those condit 
light direct have no effect. the noisi estim when lit from 
behind or abov will like guid peopl toward some good 
light position, albeit in a less consist direction. 

user interfac design 
the primari interfac compon be the guidanc icon for 
the three composit features. when a face be detected, a 
circl surround the face indic track be work and 
guidanc icon be overlaid for each feature. 

face size guidanc – the direct of small radial arrow 
indic whether the face should be make larg (bi move 
the phone closer) or small (bi move the phone farther 
away) (e.g. figur 8-a). the transpar of the arrow re- 
flect the differ between the current face size score and 
the high possibl face size score. thi mean the arrow be 
veri opaqu when the score be poor, so face size adjust 
appear more strongli suggested. If the arrow disappear, the 
score be near optimal. 

face posit guidanc – the direct of a larg arrow ema- 
nate from the track circl indic the direct to move 
the face. the direct be constrain to 8 cardin compass 
direct for simplicity. face movement be accomplish by 
slightli tilt the phone, for example, if the arrow point nw, 

then slightli tilt the phone SE move the face up (n) and 
left (w). like face size, arrow transpar reflect the rel 
differ between the current face posit score and the best 
possibl score. 

light direct guidanc – arrow be drawn around a sun 
icon locat in the top-left corner. horizont arrow indic 
the phone should be orbit around the head to adjust side- 
light (azimuth, Θ) and vertic arrow indic an up or 
down tilt to adjust polar-angl (φ), In practice, these motion 
be accomplish by fix both the camera and the face and 
rotat or bend the body. for example, arrow point 
up and right indic that the smartphon should be tilt up 
and orbit right to improv light (figur 8-b). As before, 
the transpar of the arrow indic how close the current 
light score be to the optim score. 

onc the face be positioned, the pictur be take by tap a 
circular shutter button (or press either volum button for 
convenience). A debug mode, activ by double-tapping, be 
use for test and demonstration. In thi mode, the guidanc 
visual be augment with track posit for the face, 
eyes, mouth, and nose, the estim light direct vector, 
a well a the numer score for all three features. 

sinc guidanc provid direct of improv for each 
featur rather than a direct path to a singl global maximum, 
the applic indirectli handl selfi other than simpl self- 
portraits. for example, when take a self-portrait in front of 
a tourist landmark like a statu or building, the photograph 
can ignor the posit guidanc to keep that object in frame, 
but still optim the size and light of the face. 

figur 8: guidanc user interface: (left) inward arrow suggest mak- 
ing the face small and arrow around sun icon suggest rotat up 
and right to improv lighting; (right) transpar inward arrow indi- 
cate face size be optimal, light be near optim with some right rota- 
tion possible, and posit can be slightli improv indic by nearli 
transpar upward arrow at the top of face circle. 

evalu 
We evalu our app from two perspectives: usabl and 
effect at improv selfi photograph aesthetics. In 
our study, particip take selfi photo without and with our 
app in an indoor control setting. usabl be evalu 
by examin log usag pattern and subject ratings. 
aesthet effect be evalu by ask amt worker

to rate the best photo take by each particip without and 
with our app. 

although Xu et al.’ [37] system be not design for self- 
ies, we consid use it a a baseline. sinc it ran on a 
landscape-ori “ultrabook pc” with a 3-camera array, 
thi would have requir re-design the visual guidanc to 
work in portrait aspect ratio and creat a simplifi version 
suitabl for a smartphon with a single-camera. thi would 
have significantli alter the goal and fidel of their system, 
but more importantli reduc the comparison to one between 
their rule-of-third model and our data-driven model. Xu et al. 
alreadi discu how rule-of-third do not correl with bet- 
ter photo aesthet and our empir result alreadi provid 
further evid of this. for these reasons, we use a standard 
camera app a our baseline. 

particip 
We recruit 20 particip from a univers campu (mean 
age 24.4, 11 female). recruit be limit to peopl who 
could view a smartphon screen without eye glass (sinc the 
eye detect algorithm be less reliabl with dark-rim eye 
wear). our particip exhibit visibl divers in term 
of skin pigment and facial features. particip have a rang 
of experience: 7 take selfi daili or weekly, 10 monthli or 
yearly, and 3 almost never. onli 1 particip have take a 
cours in photography. 

apparatu 
particip use the smartphon app describ above, con- 
figur to run without and with visibl guidance. regardless 
whether guidanc be shown, the app ran the full composi- 
tional featur analysi and comput the score and direct 
of improvement. these be logged, even when invis to 
the user. thi ensur the refresh rate of the preview mode 
be the same regardless of guidance, and most importantly, 
provid quantit data to test whether aesthet rate (a 
determin by our models) be improv use guidance. A 
launch button provid a timestamp that togeth with a shut- 
ter button or volum button timestamp, enabl calcul of 
picture-tak time. 

instead of conduct the studi outdoor with natur sunlight, 
we built an indoor studio so that light and background be 
control and consist (fig. 9-a). A 2.7 m wide roll of grey 
backdrop paper be hung from the ceil like a curtain to 
creat a circular space 4m in diameter. A bright light simulat- 
ing the sun be place high at one end and 5 addit bulb 
be space around the circl for ambient fill light. To keep 
particip at the centr of the circle, they sat on a swivel 
offic chair throughout the study. note thi make light di- 
rection adjust by swivel somewhat more conveni 
than turn onc bodi while standing. 

task 
the task be to take ten selfi photos. first, five without guid- 
anc (baselin condition) and then, five with guidanc from 
our app (guid condition). the present order be fix 
due to strong carry-ov effect if guidancewa perform first. 
after both part be completed, the particip select their 
best baselin photo and their best guid photo separately. 

design and protocol 
At the begin of the session, particip be ask to fo- 
cu on three composit principles, face size, face position, 
and light direction, but the optimum configur for those 
principl be not conveyed. In each part, they be told to 
take the five best photo they can and that they would pick 
the best one afterwards. To avoid other factor like smile af- 
fect their choic or aesthet quality, we specif ask 
particip to use the same neutral express in all photos. 

At the begin of the second part use the guid condition, 
particip be told they would now be use a camera 
applic with guidanc (they do not know thi before). the 
mean of the guidanc icon be explain without ani 
hint of what the best set be for the three composit 
principles. In fact, they be told they could follow or ignor 
the guidanc to make the evalu realist — if they be 
told to alway follow guidance, everyon would end with 
global optimum set determin by the model. 

finally, A post-experi questionnair gather subject 
score for guid (only) regard eas of learning, eas 
of use, accuraci of guidance, oper speed, and hand 
fatigue. all score be on a continu scale from 1 to 5, 
with 1 be bad and 5 be best. 

thi be primarili a within subject design. depend mea- 
sure for usabl be photo-tak time and composit 
featur score for baselin and guided, a well a subject 
score for guided. the studi take 30 min on average. the de- 
pendent measur for aesthet effect be a score assign 
by amt worker to the best baselin and guid photos. 

result 
given onli two-level independ variables, and all depend 
variabl be continuous, interval, and ordinal, a t-test with .05 
critic valu be use for statist tests. 

photo-tak time 
the photo-tak time be the durat between press the 
“launch” button until the moment the photo be taken. the aver- 
age time for take photo with baselin be 20 s (sd 22), sig- 
nificantli low than 33 s (sd 27) with guid (t(198) = −3.72, 
p < .001). these long time may be an effect of the studi 
setting. regardless, the rel differ indic follow- 
ing guidanc have a time cost. perhap becaus more time be 
spent consid composit option befor take a photo. 
the averag picture-tak time when particip take their 
singl “best” photo support thi theory: the averag time to 
take the best baselin photo be 28 s (sd 28) compar to 36 
sec (sd 36) for guided. A signific differ t(38) = −0.821, 
p < .042, but small in magnitude. 

subject rate of user experi 
sinc particip rat user experi qualiti on a contin- 
uou scale from 1 to 5, we examin mean valu (tabl 1). 
all rate be positive, rang between 3.7 and 4.3. partic- 
ipant comment indic that eas of use and accuraci of 
guidanc be neg affect by flicker arrow for 
light guidance. the score for hand fatigu be affect 
by the need to hold the arm still to read and follow guidance.

featur score 
We compar mean featur score for the best guid and 
baselin photo select by each participant. the score for 
face size and light direct be significantli high for 
guid (valu and t-test in tabl 2). thi indic that our 
app be success in guid particip to improv those 
two featur accord to our aesthet models. thi suggest 
that an increas in overal aesthet quality, when the photo 
be rat in the follow section, may be attribut to our 
app provid use guidance. similar face posit featur 
score be like the result of peopl instinct place their 
face near the centr of the frame. 

aesthet effect 
To measur aesthet effectiveness, we recruit 100 amt 
worker to rate each pair of best photo take by the partic- 
ipants. We do not specifi ani experience, age, or locat 
criterion for the worker (though the major live in the unit 
states). Xu et al. [37] report rate by amt and expert 
photograph follow the same pattern, and our focu be on 
aesthet attract to the gener population. 

the task interfac be model after the one use by Xu et al. 
A pair of photo be display with the best photo present 
randomli on the left or right. the worker select a rate 
between 0 and 100 for each photo use a slider. they be 
also instruct to consid the aesthet qualiti of the face size, 
face position, and light direction, similar to the synthet 
photo rank describ earlier. A text box be avail for 
addit feedback. 

We remov five particip from the set to be rat becaus 
they use veri differ express or pose in their pair of 
photos. for example, they be smile in one and frown 
in the other, or they turn their head to the side in one and 
look straight at the camera in the other. the concern be that 
these pair introduc a “pose and express confound” that 
could alter a worker’ aesthet judgement. In all, 15 pair of 
photo be rat by each worker, total 3,000 ratings. 

result 
tabl 3 summar mean ratings. overall, selfi pho- 
tograph take with guid have significantli high ratings; 
t(2998) = 17.37, p < .0001. the averag rate for guid be 
68.9 compar to 54.8 for baseline, an absolut differ 
of 14.1 — a 26% improv in aesthet quality. the low 
standard error of the mean (sem) and the rel larg 
absolut differ show thi be a larg and stabl effect. the 
pair with the most improv for guid (the “highest pair”) 
improv by 71% and the pair with the least improv (the 
“lowest pair”) decreas by -1%. the sem across all pair 
be low, suggest consist among workers. the sem of 
2.4 for the “lowest pair” be among the high across all pairs, 
suggest thi be the most difficult pair to judge. 

In their addit feedback, worker often cite a central face 
posit and a face lit with even, bright light a reason for 
high ratings. some worker comment that photo appear- 
ing “wash out” be less attractive, and thi be sometim 
caus by frontal light encourag by the guidanc system.

a small one. thi may be relat to the two-peak distri- 
bution for face size discov by the synthet selfi ratings. 
overall, worker feedback support our find in the first 
rate experi and provid evid that worker be 
focu on composit principl for their assessment. 

discuss 
our result show that our methodolog to build highly- 
control aesthet models, our comput vision algorithms, 
and our guidanc interface, combin into a system that be 
effect at help peopl take good selfies. 

limit aesthet style 
It be import to note that system encourag a symmetr 
and plain aesthet style, no doubt due to the limit rang 
of synthet selfi use for aesthet qualiti measurements. 
peopl also appreci selfi with asymmetr compositions, 
dramat lighting, or a tightli crop face [19, 28]. similarly, 
the neutral grey background may have affect how peopl 
rat the synthet selfies. gener and evalu a wider 
rang of synthet selfi could diversifi our system to guid 
peopl also to these more artist type of selfies. 

implic for human-comput interact 
our aesthet rate methodolog reli on a fast, usable, and 
accur interfac for rate a larg set of relat images. We 
believ our solut for rate a synthet dataset have applica- 
tion in other field such a rate option for visual design or 
ground truth dataset creation in machin learning. 

our system reli heavili on effect guidanc visual 
packag in a usabl and respons system. use arrow 
for guidanc be effective, but also make the camera preview 
more clutter and partial obscur the subject. An inter- 
est futur direct be to evalu how subtl thi style of 
feedback can be, while still be effect at commun 
direct of improvement. 

learn about aesthet prefer from the model 
when ponder what the model suggest, one may conclud 
that the recommend be obvious: do not make the face 
too big or too small, put it near the top-centre, and make sure 
it be bright. befor pass judgement, recal that center the 
face contradict the commonli refer rule-of-third and 
there be compet rules-of-thumb for light that suggest 
use side-light to creat shadows. moreover, stretch 
the arm to keep the size from be too larg be not natural, 
but sometim such awkward movement be necessari to 
produc a good qualiti photograph. after all, our goal be to 

discover, and empir validate, what the optimum compo- 
sition rule be for self-portrait photograph a determin 
by “normal people.” 

technic limit 
our system be restrict by comput vision capabilities. face 
detect be constantli improving, but track be lose under 
extrem light or cropping. while our light estim 
algorithm be success at provid guidance, the light 
arrow sometim flicker when the discret model be at 
a threshold position. thi creat oscil between two 
differ recommend directions. ad anti-hysteresi 
method and increas the resolut of the light model 
(more score at intermedi angles) would correct thi small 
issue. 

conclus 
our work contribut a systemat assess of three basic 
featur of selfi aesthet use synthet photograph and 
thousand of ratings. We transform these rate to creat 
interpolation-bas model to estim the aesthet score and 
direct of improv for each feature. with the help of a 
comput vision algorithm to estim the domin light 
direct in a person’ face, we design a smartphon cam- 
era applic to guid novic photograph to take good 
selfies. A control experi valid the usabl of the 
applic and it capabl to increas aesthet quality. 

We see our three composit featur a an initi test of 
our methodolog and guidanc interface. other composit 
featur like colour, texture, and balanc could be included, 
a well a featur like head tilt, facial expression, and back- 
ground contrast. We think scale our model to more featur 
be possible. there be like some inter-featur independ al- 
low some featur to be evalu independently. If not, the 
same “pipeline” approach that we use for posit and light- 
ing can be used: the result of one featur reduc the search 
space of the next. note that although altern machine- 
learn regress techniqu can handl high dimension 
data, they result in a black box prevent u from learn 
about aesthet base on the final models. 

currently, if a photograph wish to take a selfi in front of 
a background object (such a a tourist landmark) they have 
the option to ignor some of our system’ guidanc (such a 
position). An enhanc system could recogn salient back- 
ground object and alter the guidanc accordingly. model 
which consid the composit relationship between the 
face and the object could be empir gener use the 
same methodolog use here. synthet selfi could be gen- 
erat with a gener background object (perhap a sphere) in 
differ composit posit rel to the person and the 
photograph frame. finally, our methodolog could be appli 
to photo of two or more people, specif class of peopl 
(e.g babies, athletes), picture-tak set (e.g. restaurant, 
beach), or entir differ subject (e.g. cars, landscapes). 

We hope our work demonstr how a method and con- 
troll studi of aesthet can lead to usabl and use appli- 
cation which can increas aesthet quality.
