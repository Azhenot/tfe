complex interact geometri offer a uniqu opportun to modifi the strength and sign of the 
casimir force. however, measur have tradit be limit to sphere-pl or plate-pl 
configurations. prior attempt to extend measur to differ geometri reli on either nano- 
fabric techniqu that be limit to onli a few materi or slight modif of the sphere-pl 
geometri due to align difficulti of more intric configurations. here, we overcom thi obstacl to 
present measur of the casimir forc between two gold sphere use an atom forc microscope. 
forc measur be altern with topograph scan in the x-i plane to maintain align of the 
two sphere to within approxim 400 nm (∼1% of the sphere radii). our experiment result be 
consist with lifshitz’ theori use the proxim forc approxim (pfa), and correct to the pfa 
be bound use nine sphere-spher and three sphere-pl measur with sphere of vari radii.

In 1948, hendrik casimir deriv an express for 
the forc between two uncharged, parallel plate result 
from a modif of the quantum electromagnet 
vacuum energi [1]. yet, onli a few measur have 
be perform in the origin plate-pl configur due 
to difficulti in maintain parallel [2,3]. instead, a 
sphere-pl geometri be typic employ [4–8], and 
comparison between experi and theori be perform 
use the proxim forc approxim (pfa) [9] to 
model curv surfac a a seri of parallel plates. 
however, thi approxim fail for sharp edg 
[10,11] and be predict to have perturb correct 
for smooth surfac [12–14]. In some situations, exact 
calcul predict repuls even when the pfa do 
not [15,16]. 
two experiment techniqu have emerg to extend 

casimir forc measur beyond the sphere-pl and 
plate-pl geometries. the first begin with a sphere-pl 
geometri and textur one or both surfac so that the 
align advantag of the sphere-pl configur 
be maintain while effect beyond the pfa be probe 
[17–19]. the second involv fabric two interact 
surfac out of a singl crystal to ensur the align of 
the surfac [20,21]; however, measur be limit to 
materi for which suffici fabric techniqu exist. 
geometri such a the needle-and-hol [15] and sphere- 
sphere [22–25] [fig. 1(a)] requir in situ alignment, make 
detect difficult. recent experi have probe the van 
der waal forc between latex sphere in liquid by align 
the sphere use their optic interfer pattern [26,27], 
but the metal coat necessari for casimir forc

measur prevent optic align use that 
technique. 
here, we present measur of the casimir forc 

between two gold-coat hollow glass sphere use an 
in situ scan techniqu to maintain align of the 
spheres’ center to within ∼1% of their radiu over 24 hour 
of continu measurement. becaus the experi be 
perform in air, we determin (and mitigate) both the 
electrostat and hydrodynam forc through a lock-in 
detect scheme, while track the in-phas and quad- 
ratur compon of the signal. horizont align 
between the two sphere be preserv by altern forc 
measur with topograph scans. finally, we put 
bound on correct to the pfa base on a combin 
of sphere-spher and sphere-pl measur corre- 
spond to differ radii. 
To align the two spheres, we attach one to an afm 

cantilev (mikromasch usa), and it be raster scanned, 
while oscillating, over a second sphere. A piezoelectr 
transduc control the bottom sphere so that the oscil 
amplitud of the cantilever, and thus, the separation, be 
maintain while an imag be record [fig. 1(b)]. We 
perform a fit to the result image, which allow for later 
align of the two sphere to within 400 nm, or about 
0.01 to 0.02 r0, where R0 ¼ ðr−11 þ r−12 þ−1 be the effect 
radiu of the two-spher system. misalign between 
the two sphere result in three primari effect (see 
supplement materi [28]): (1) the absolut separ 
of the two sphere can chang by up to 1 nm, result in a 
total separ uncertainti of �3 nm, (2) the effect 
sensit can chang by up to �0.3%, increas the 
calibr uncertainti to �5.3%, and (3) a discrep on 
the order of 0.05 nm may exist for misalign sphere 
due to motion of the piezo, which be small enough to be 
ignored. We use a commerci afm (cypher, asylum 
research) for the measurements, and the environ be 
maintain at 303.15� 0.05 K and 15� 9% rel 
humidity. 
We measur the spatial deriv of the casimir forc 

(fc0 ¼ ½ð∂fcþ=∂d�) in an ambient environ util 
the procedur develop by de man et al. [7,29]. thi 
process allow u to determin the surfac separ 
and spring constant, while also elimin hydrodynam 
and electrostat forc from the data channel contain 
casimir force. for each sphere-spher configuration, we 
collect data at ∼400 individu separ (from 4 μm to 
30 nm) for each approach and retraction. the measur 
be split into sever steps, a describ below. 
We minim the electrostat contribut to the total 

forc signal at each sphere-spher separ through the 
applic of two appli biases. first, an ac voltage, vac, 
be appli to the top sphere at a frequenc of ωa=2π ¼ 
77 Hz (while the bottom sphere be grounded), which caus 
the cantilev to oscil at an angular frequenc of ωA and 
at high harmon (e.g., 2ωa and 4ωa). the signal at 2ωa 

be use by a feedback loop to control the amplitud of vac to 
maintain a constant amplitud set point for the cantilev 
oscillation. A second voltage, v0, be appli by an addi- 
tional feedback loop to the top sphere in order to minim 
the cantilev oscil signal at ωa, which, in turn, 
minim the electrostat force, akin to a kelvin probe 
feedback loop [29]. data be acquir for each sphere- 
sphere separation. 
while the electrostat interact be minimized, we 

determin the spatial deriv of the remain forc 
(casimir and hydrodynamic) by oscil the bottom 
sphere with an amplitud Δd at frequenc ωpz=2π ¼ 
211 Hz and observ the respons of the cantilev with 
a lock-in amplifier. the phase of the cantilever’ respons be 
use to separ the hydrodynam forc from fc0 [29]. 
the shake amplitud be reduc from 48 to 1 nm on 
approach, to maxim the sensit at larg separations, 
while also minim ani artifact from the nonlinear of 
the casimir force. 
onc the approach and retract run be completed, we 

determin the absolut separ use the separation- 
depend tip-sampl capacitance, cðdþ [30]. the capaci- 
tanc deriv C0 ¼ ½∂c=∂d�, calcul from vac and 
oscil of the cantilev at 2ωa, be fit to the expect 
sphere-spher C0 for an entir approach or retract sequenc 
of measurements. while fit C0 to determin the sepa- 
ration, the bend of the cantilev (< 3 nm) be take into 
account, and the modif of the capacit due to an 
expect water layer of 1.5� 0.75 nm on each surfac be 
includ [31]. after the forc measurements, the top sphere 
again approach and retract from the bottom sphere, 
while electrostat measur be make with vac ¼ 8 V 
to calibr the optic lever sensit and the spring 
constant from the electrostat signal at 4ωa. 

fig. 2. repres measur of the spatial deriv 
of casimir forc for both sphere-pl (blue) and sphere-spher 
(red) measur geometries. result be in agreement with 
calcul valu of the casimir forc deriv for two gold 
sphere with a 4.9 nm rm perturb rough correct 
(black line). gray shade region show the uncertainti in the 
rough correct due to the uncertainti in the orient of 
the sphere [32]. the sphere-pl forc be measur with the 
sphere in fig. 3(a), and the sphere-spher data be collect 
between it and the one in fig. 3(d).

We repeat the topography, forc measurement, and cali- 
bration cycl for 24 hour for each sphere pair result in 
about 50 force-dist measur per sphere-spher 
experiment. A total of nine sphere-spher and three sphere- 
plate measur be recorded, with three differ 
top sphere and three differ bottom sphere (hollow 
glass, trelleborg si-100). the sphere radiu rang from 
29 to 47� 0.3 μm and be epoxi to either a cantilev or 
a silicon substrat and coat (denton e beam) with 
crð3þ=sio2ð50þ=crð3þ=auð100 nmþ. the sio2 layer be 
use to block ion from the glass sphere from diffus into 
the au. the silicon plate be coat with crð5þ=auð100 nmþ. 
We perform measur for both the sphere-spher 

and sphere-pl configur and compar their result 
when use the same top sphere. the forc deriv be 
divid by the effect radius, r0, to compar the differ 
measur (fig. 2). the casimir forc between the gold 
surfac be comput by combin ellipsometri data over 
the rang 0.74–6.3 eV with refer optic data [33] at 

high frequenc and the drude model with ωp ¼ 
8.84 eV and γ ¼ 42 mev at the low frequenc [34]. 
the afm imag of the surfac be then use to estim 
uncertainti in the rough correct to fc0 [32]. A thin 
water layer (describ above) be expect to increas fc0, 
primarili at small separ [35], which be also take into 
account (e.g., at a separ of 50 nm, the water layer 
increas the forc calcul by 5%, but by onli 1.6% 
at 100 nm). 
all sphere-spher measur (nine differ combi- 

nations) be present in fig. 3, show the consist of 
the measurements. At the shortest separations, rough 
caus the forc to increase, and at separ beyond 
200 nm, stray light interfer affect some of the data. 
stray light appear a an artifact that be partial period 
with separ and be proport to δd. even though a 
superluminesc diod be use to minim the stray light 
effect, it be present in some of the sphere-spher data up to 
about 0.5 nm−2 (although it differ between measure- 
ments) and be about half the level of the artifact in the 
sphere-pl data due to increas reflect off the plate in 
that configuration. possibl reason that measur 
with the top sphere in fig. 3(b) show a small forc at 
separ <100 nm be that the sphere have a deform 
not captur by the rough measur [32], or that it 
slightli small spring constant have lead to an increas in the 
separ uncertainty. 
the pfa allow fc0 to be comput from the forc per 

unit area between parallel plates. however, a more com- 
plete theori predict the presenc of deviat from the 
pfa [13,14]. the larg predict correct be propor- 
tional to 1=r0. the combin of sphere-spher and 
sphere-pl measur give effect radiu (r0) that 
vari from 13–46 μm. the wide rang of R0 valu allow 
the procedur of kraus et al. [6] to be use to put bound 
on deviat from the pfa of the form

We combin all twelv measur to put bound on 

correct to the pfa in the form of β0. for each 
measurement, the data be bin at sever separations, 
with bin width that be 2% of the separation; e.g., one bin 
be 100� 1 nm. all twelv fc0 measur at one

separation. then, β0 be calcul from the fit a

; ð3þ 

where m and b be determin from the line fit. 
the estim of β0 be more robust to sever type of error 

than fc0, which make it good suit for explor 
deviat from the pfa. first, systemat uncertainti in 
the separ (due to, for example, a water layer) lead to a 
small error in β0, becaus β0 vari less with separ 
than fc0 [14]. second, the stray light effect, which lead to 
a systemat artifact in ani singl experiment configura- 
tion, be effect random between configurations, and so, 
the total error it impart be reduced. finally, ani overal 
systemat offset in the calibr that be common to all 12 
set of data do not affect the estim of β0. the error in β0 
for each separ be propag from the error on each 
individu forc measurement, which is, in turn, calcul 
from: uncertainti in the separation, uncertainti from 
roughness, uncertainti from calibration, uncertainti in 
the amount of the hydrodynam forc coupl into the 
casimir signal channel, and uncertainti from stray light. 
figur 4(b) show our experiment determin esti- 

mate of β0 for each separation, d. earli theoret work 

predict that β0 would be independ of separ [13], 
and the earli experiment investig of β0 in the 
sphere-pl geometri found that β0 ¼ 0� 0.4. however, 
recent theoret work have show that, for real materi at 
finit temperature, β0 depend on separ and be pre- 
dict to vari between -0.4 and -0.6 in the rang explor 
in thi letter [14]. To put our bound on β0 in a form similar 
to kraus et al., we find that β0 ¼ −6� 27 be within the 2σ 
confid interv of the calcul β0 at all of the 
measur separations. 
stronger bound on β0 will be possibl by extend the 

rang of radiu use in the measurement. the larg possibl 
radiu that can be use be limit by the abil to separ 
the hydrodynam forc from the casimir forc (the former 
scale a r2, the latter a r). the small possibl radiu 
must still be larg enough so that the sphere contribut 
much more to fc0 than the cantilev use to support it. If a 
larg enough rang of radiu be used, it would also be 
possibl to look for higher-ord correct to eq. (1). 
becaus the measur of β0 be less strongli affect by 
systemat error than direct measur of fc0, it should 
facilit comparison between experi and theory. 
In conclusion, we have measur the casimir interact 

between two sphere for separ of 30–400 nm, by 
combin topograph align with fc0 measure- 
ments. the align method can be use to posit 
ani object that may present interest geometri for fc0 
measur in air. further, the techniqu can be adapt 
to liquid or vacuum conditions, though care will be 
necessari to keep the sphere from contact one anoth 
when drag be minimal. onc the object be aligned, ani 
type of forc can be measured: critic casimir, hydro- 
dynamic, magnetic, etc. finally, by combin measure- 
ment from sever experiment configurations, we place 
limit on correct to the pfa. becaus the experi 
be conduct in ambient conditions, we anticip that 
the result and techniqu will be import for incorpo- 
rate geometr control casimir forc into mem 
devices.
