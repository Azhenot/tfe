1. data and method 

use a dataset consist of human-cod imag comparisons, we train a comput vision algorithm to predict 
perceiv safeti of individu street scene (“streetscore”); we then obtain “streetchange” by compar that 
measur across street view imag of the same locat from 2007 (the “2007 image”) and 2014 (the “2014 
image”). 

1.1. the street view imag dataset 

We first describ the street view imag dataset use in thi paper. We obtain 360◦ panorama imag of 
streetscap from five US citi use the googl street view applic program interfac (api). each 
panorama be associ with a uniqu identifi (“panoid”), latitude, longitude, and time stamp (which specifi

the month and year of imag capture). We extract an imag cutout from each panorama by specifi the head- 
ing and pitch of the camera rel to the street view vehicle. We obtain a total of 1,645,760 imag cutout 
for street block in baltimore, boston, detroit, new york, and washington dc, captur in year 2007 (the “2007 
panel”) and 2014 (the “2014 panel”). for the street block that lack imag for either 2007 or 2014, we complet 
the “2007” and “2014” panel use imag from the closest year for which data be available. As a result, 5% 
of the imag in the “2007” panel be from either 2008 or 2009. similarly, 12% of the imag in the “2014” panel 
be from 2013. We match imag cutout from the 2007 and 2014 panel by use their geograph locat 
(i.e. latitud and longitude) and by choos the same head and pitch. thi process give u imag that show 
the same place, from the same point of view, but in differ years. A larg major of imag in our dataset be 
captur between the month of april and august, to avoid a chang of season between the two imag of the 
same location. 

next, we describ the comput vision algorithm use for obtain streetchange—a measur for physic urban 
change—from the 2007 and 2014 imag panels. 

1.2. imag featur extract 

our comput vision algorithm work with a number of structur and unstructur featur of the imag data: 
first, we use the geometr layout algorithm [1] to assign pixel-wis semant label in four geometr classes: 
“ground,” “buildings,” “trees,” and “sky.” next, we extract two differ imag featur separ for the pixel 
of the four geometr classes: 

• We gener a texton dictionari [2] by convolv the imag with a gaussian filter bank and cluster 
their respons together; everi pixel be then assign to the near cluster center, creat a texton map. 
We comput 512-dimension histogram with texton map of the four geometr classes. We call thi 
featur geometr texton histogram (gth). 

• We calcul the gist featur descriptor [3]—a global imag featur that provid a low-dimension 
represent of the spatial layout properti of a scene—for each of the geometr classes. 

1.3. remov of unsuit imag 

A small number of street view imag pair in the sampl be unsuit for comparison. In particular: some 
imag be over-exposed, out of focus, or blurred; other have signific chang in greeneri coverag like 
driven by season chang rather than urban foliag improvements. To elimin these unsuit pairs, we use 
a seri of autom data clean methods: 

• first, we remov over-expos images, which typic result from the sun shin directli into the camera. 
To identifi over-expos pixels, we convert each imag to the cielab color space, in which the L 
channel repres light and a, b channel repres the color. the color channel be combin a 
C = (a, b)t . We comput an over-exposur valuem (between 0 and 1) at each pixel follow method 
introduc by guo et al. [4]: At pixel i, 

Mi = 
1 

2 
· tanh 

( 
δ · 

( 
(li − LT ) + (ct − ||ci||2) 

)) 
, 

with the constant set to δ = 1/60, LT = 80, and CT = 40. We obtain the meanmskyi ofmi over all the 
pixel that belong to the “sky” geometr class, a predict by the geometr layout algorithm [1]. We 
discard the imag pair in which at least one of the imag i hadmskyi > 0.85, indic over-exposure. 
We discard all imag pair contain at least one over-expos image.

figur s1. the streetchang algorithm be robust to larg weather and season changes. In thi example, our algorithm 
assign a small streetchang valu to the imag pairs, even though there be a drastic chang in weather between the two 
images. imag courtesi of google, inc. 

• second, we remov imag that be out-of-focu or contain motion blur. To detect such images, we 
comput the absolut central moment (acmo) of each image, a statist measur that allow a simul- 
taneou optim of both focu and exposur [5]. If the normal valu of acmo be less than 0.2, 
we label the imag a blurred. We discard all imag pair contain at least one blur image. 

• finally, we discard all imag pair in which the number of pixel in the imag occupi by the “tree” object 
class (again, a predict by the geometr layout algorithm [1]) chang by more than 10% between the 
2007 imag and the 2014 image. thi process elimin imag pair in which onli one of the imag have 
signific occlus of build by trees. 

1.4. streetchang calcul 

have remov the imag unsuit for urban chang detection, we predict the “streetscores” of the remain- 
ing imag use a support vector regress model train with comput vision featur and aggreg score 
obtain from the crowdsourc studi by saless et al. [6], a describ next. 

saless et al. [6] creat an onlin crowdsourc game in which particip be show imag of streetscap 
randomli chosen from new york, boston, linz and salzburg. particip be ask to choos one of the two 
imag in respons to three questions: “which place look safer?”, “which place look more upper class?”, and 
“which place look unique?”. In the saless et al. [6] study, 7,872 uniqu particip from 91 countri provid 
186,188 comparison (“clicks”) of imag pair drawn from a pool of 4,109 imag for the question “which place 
look safer?” 

follow naik et al. [7], we convert the 186,188 pairwis comparison for the question “which place look 
safer?” to rank score use a bayesian rank algorithm call trueskil [8]. We call the trueskil perceiv 
safeti score for each imag that image’ streetscore; these images’ streetscor be “true scores” deriv from 
aggreg of human assessments. We use the streetscor obtain from human assess to train a machin 
learn model that us the gth and gist featur of the correspond imag (describ in section 1.2) to 
predict how human would score the perceiv safeti of street view images. As we be onli seek to predict

the human percept of american cities, we restrict the train sampl to the 2,920 human-cod imag from 
new york and boston. 

We use ν-support vector regress (ν-svr) [9] to predict imag streetscores. given a set of train imag 
with featur vector x and streetscor q ∈ R, ν-svr with a linear kernel gener a weight vector w and a bia 
term b under a set of constraints. the two variabl (w, b) be use to predict the streetscor for a new imag with 
featur vector x′ by evalu q′ = w · x′ + b. We measur the accuraci of our predictor use the coeffici 
of determin (r2). We obtain R2 = 0.57 over fivefold cross-valid on the train set. 

In thi paper we drop the geometr color histogram (gch) featur use by naik et al. [7], sinc gch 
featur be more sensit to weather chang than gist and texton histograms. drop the gch features, 
however, do not substanti reduc the predictor accuracy—th R2 drop from 0.5884 to 0.5709. 

next, we use the streetscor predictor to calcul urban chang from imag pairs. As our predictor be a weight 
vector train use imag featur on top of the four geometr class (ground, building, tree and sky), we be 
abl to comput the contribut of each geometr class to the streetscor of each image. We chose to discard the 
contribut of the “trees” and “sky” class sinc their score depend on the season and weather at the time of 
imag capture. note that the “trees” class contain onli larg tree (and not landscaping), allow u to account 
for chang in the built environ due to landscap a part of the “ground” class. figur S1 show exampl 
of imag pair with larg weather and season chang which have be accur score by our algorithm. 

after comput the streetscor for each imag in a 2007–2014 imag pair, we calcul “streetchange” a the 
differ between the 2014 image’ streetscor and the 2007 image’ streetscore. 

1.5. remov erron pair 

while we be abl to comput elimin pair contain over-exposed, blurred, or occlud images, 
we discov two addit sourc of error that make a small number of imag pair invalid for streetchang 
calculation. the first sourc of error be incorrect locat inform for one or both imag in an imag pair. 
for these images, the geograph coordin (latitud and longitude) obtain from googl street view do not

figur s3. the streetchang algorithm be robust to the chang in street view imag qualiti between year 2007 and 2014. 
imag courtesi of google, inc. 

match with the actual geograph coordin of the locat at which the imag be captur (figur s2-(a)). 
the second sourc of error be partial or complet occlus of build by larg vehicl (figur s2-(b)), which 
be not remov by the procedur describ in section 1.3. 

our algorithm calcul a larg posit or neg streetchang valu for imag pair contain location- 
cod or vehicle-occlus errors, sinc the two imag in such pair look veri differ (figur s2). due to 
larg variat in visual appear within and across imag pair that contain these errors, we be unabl to 
automat elimin such imag pair with a comput vision algorithm. therefore, a human oper observ 
imag pair whose streetchang valu be larg than four standard deviat of chang in streetscor (which 
amount to onli 1,849 imag pair out of a total of 822,880—less than 0.23% of the sample). the oper 
manual elimin imag pair which contain location-cod error or vehicle-occlus errors. 

1.6. imag qualiti and streetchang 

We also note that there be a differ in imag qualiti between street view imag captur in year 2007 and 
street view imag from year 2008 or after (due to improv in google’ imag hardware). but the 
streetchang algorithm be robust to chang in imag qualiti from 2007 and 2014 (figur s3) for a few reasons. 
first, a signific fraction of imag in the train set be also from 2007, which help to mitig the effect of 
chang in imag quality. second, we process the imag at a resolut of 400 × 300 pixels; the differ in 
qualiti be not signific at thi resolution. finally, a high fraction of 2007 street view imag (a compar to 
year 2014) tend to be over-exposed; but we discard such imag from our calculations. 

1.7. valid streetchang 

We valid our final streetchang measur use three sources: a survey on amazon mechan turk (amt), 
a survey of graduat student in mit’ school of architectur and planning, and data from boston’ plan and 
develop authority.

figur s4. screenshot of the amazon mechan turk experiment interfac use for valid streetchange. inset 
courtesi of google, inc. 

valid with human observers: for the valid experi on amt, we select 1,565 imag pair 
(roughli 1% of the final sample) use invers transform sampl on streetchanges. We present amt worker 
with two imag pair side-by-sid (figur s4) drawn randomli from the 1,565 imag pair and ask the follow 
question: 

select the imag pair that have the larg chang in buildings, street and sidewalks. pleas ignor 
chang in traffic, tree and weather. If the amount of chang in the pair be similar, select “almost 
the same”. 

We obtain 28,170 pairwis comparison for the 1,565 imag pair from 116 users—36 pairwis comparison on 
average. We convert these pairwis comparison to rank score use the microsoft trueskil algorithm [8]. 
trueskil converg to a stabl estim of rank score after 12–36 comparisons, so we have enough comparison 
to obtain accur scores. We call thi score amt–streetchange. A high valu of amt–streetchang be indic 
of a larg absolut physic chang in the imag pair, a observ by the amt users. 

next, we obtain bin rank between 1 and 30 for both amt–streetchang and the absolut valu of streetchang 
output of our algorithm. compar the two, we found a spearman’ rank correl of 0.72 (p < 1 × 10−5) 
between them. these result indic that the algorithm output on streetchang be consist with human judg- 
ment on chang in urban environment. 

for the valid experi with graduat student in mit’ school of architectur and planning, we present 
the student (number of particip = 3) with 100 imag pairs, where 50 imag pair contain larg neg 
streetchang and 50 imag pair contain larg posit streetchange. We ask them to choos if the imag pair 
show sign of posit change, neg change, or no change, and aggreg their respons with a major 
rule. the student agre with posit streetchang (a score by our algorithm) for 88% of the imag pair and 
they agre with neg streetchang for 59% of the imag pairs. the low agreement in the neg chang 
be a result of student classifi demolit of blight properti a a posit chang (while our algorithm 
tend to classifi them a negative).

between improv in streetscor and improv in infrastructure, use data on new develop in

from the boston plan and develop agenc (bpda). We comput the total new squar footag built 
per squar mile for each censu tract dure the period 2012–2014 and test it relationship with streetchang 
2007–2014. We expect censu tract where more squar footag be built dure 2012–2014 to be associ 
with a high streetchange, due to the physic improv in these neighborhood between the 2007 and 2014 
imag panels. and indeed, we find that infrastructur improv be posit and significantli associ to 
streetchange—on standard deviat increas in log total squar footag correspond to roughli half a standard 
deviat increas in streetchange. We estimate:

these result provid empir evid for the connect between improv in streetscor and improve-

1.8. streetscore: gener perform 

comput vision algorithm might have difficulti gener to out-of-sampl data. sinc we comput streetscor 
for imag from baltimore, detroit, and washington DC use an algorithm train with imag from boston and 
new york, we would like to estim whether the streetscor predictor can gener without a signific drop 
in accuracy. So we perform an experi where we train a streetscor predictor use imag just from new 
york and measur the accuraci of it predict on boston imag in our dataset, and vice versa. We found that 
the R2 drop by onli 0.036 on averag dure cross-citi predict (tabl s2). 

2. regress 

We calcul streetchang for 2007–2014 imag pair sampl uniformli from baltimore, boston, detroit, new 
york, and washington dc. use tract boundari from the 2010 US census, we aggreg 2007 streetscor and 
2007–2014 streetchang across each censu tract. We obtain censu tract characterist data from the 2000 US 
census, adjust to the 2010 censu tract boundari [10]. for summari statistics, see tabl s3.

2.1. Do social characterist predict chang in streetscore? 

We now present the cross-sect demograph and econom correl of the 2007 streetscor and 2007–2014 
streetchang (tabl s4). for each censu tract, we consid the follow socioeconom indic from the 
2000 US census: popul density, level of education, median income, hous price and rental costs, hous 
vacancy, race, and poverty. We find that the socioeconom characterist that best predict high streetscor in 
2007—densiti and education—ar also the best predictor of increas in streetscor between 2007 and 2014. 
these relationship hold regardless of whether we control for the 2007 streetscor or other variables. We find that 
other variables, such a income, hous prices, rent, race, and poverti have littl or no predict power in our 
context. 

2.2. the filter hypothesi of urban chang 

In addit to the invas and tip hypothesi of urban chang discuss in main text, we evalu the filter 
hypothesi [11] of urban change. the filter hypothesi suggest cycl in which neighborhood gradual decay 
until they get upgraded. To test the hypothesi that build age shape streetscap change, we regress the 2007 
streetscor and 2007–2014 streetchang on the share of the build stock (a of the year 2000) built dure 
differ decades. the data group togeth all build erect befor 1939. there be weak support for the 
filter hypothesi in our dataset (tabl s5): we found that neighborhood with newer hous stock score 
high than neighborhood built in the 1950s. however, we cannot rule out the possibl that our find be also 
reflect of differ in the percept of variou architectur styles, a neighborhood built befor 1939 (prior 
to the widespread adopt of modernist architectur in the us) also score highly. 

3. addit exampl and map visual 

figur s5–s7 present addit exampl of posit streetchang from the five citi in our dataset. the exam- 
ple show that streetchang be abl to detect both upgrad and new construction. figur S8 show addit 
exampl of neg streetchange, which be associ with urban blight and declin in upkeep. 

figur s9–s28 present map visual for log popul densiti 2000, share colleg educ 2000,
