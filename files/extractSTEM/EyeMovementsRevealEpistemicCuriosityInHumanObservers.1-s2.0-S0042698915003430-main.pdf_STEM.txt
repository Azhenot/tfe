saccad (rapid) eye movement be primari mean by which human and non-human primat sampl 
visual information. however, while saccad decis be intens investig in instrument con- 
text where saccad guid subsequ actions, it be larg unknown how they may be influenc by 
curios – the intrins desir to learn. while saccad be sensit to visual novelti and visual surprise, 
no studi have examin their relat to epistem curios – interest in symbolic, semant information. 
To investig thi question, we track the eye movement of human observ while they read trivia 
question and, after a brief delay, be visual give the answer. We show that high curios be 
associ with earli anticipatori orient of gaze toward the answer locat without chang in 
other metric of saccad or fixations, and that these influenc be distinct from those produc by 
variat in confid and surprise. across subjects, the enhanc of anticipatori gaze be 
correl with measur of trait curios from person questionnaires. finally, a machin learn 
algorithm could predict curios in a cross-subject manner, reli primarili on statist featur of 
the gaze posit befor the answer onset and independ of covari in confid or surprise, 
suggest potenti practic applic for educ technologies, recommend system and 
research in cognit sciences. with thi article, we provid full access to the annot databas allow 
reader to reproduc the results. epistem curios produc specif effect on oculomotor anticip 
that can be use to read out curios states.

1. introduct 

curios be defin a the intrins motiv to learn and 
acquir information, and play a central role in intellig behavior 
includ in development, learn and explor (berlyne, 
1954; gottlieb, oudeyer, lopes, & baranes, 2013; oudeyer, 
baranes, & kaplan, 2013). psycholog theori formul in 
the 1960 and 1970 distinguish between perceptu curios 
– a desir to obtain new sensori input – and epistem curios 
– an interest in new knowledg or semant inform 
(lowenstein, 1994). more recently, epistem curios be associ- 
ate with cortic and subcort structur in human observers, 
includ activ of reward-rel structur (kang et al., 
2009), and memori enhanc through reward modul 
of hippocamp mechan (gruber, gelman, & ranganath, 2014). 
An open question howev concern the link between curios 
and select attention. attention, along with work memory, be 
critic for learn and select inform process 
(cardoso-leit & bavelier, 2014; gottlieb et al., 2013). In human 
and non-human primates, visual attent and rapid eye move- 
ment (saccades) be the primari mean by which subject sampl 
visual information, and be sensit to valu and motiv 
(gottlieb, 2012; gottlieb, hayhoe, hikosaka, & rangel, 2014; 
tatler, hayhoe, land, & ballard, 2011). while a recent studi have 
show that person measur of trait curios correl with 
the number of saccad and number of region explor dure 
free-view of complex scene (risko, anderson, lanthier, & 
kingstone, 2012), noth be know about the link between eye 
movement and epistem curios – interest in semant 
information. 

In thi report we examin thi question by track the eye 
movement of human observ while they be present a ser- 
y of trivia question that creat high or low epistem curios 
states. becaus curios can covari with other epistem factor 
such a confid and surprise, we ask subject to provid

independ rate of the 3 subject states. We test the 
hypothesi that curios will influenc eye movement control, 
and that these influenc would be suffici specif to allow 
curios to be ‘‘read out” from eye movement use data mine 
algorithms. the result confirm both predictions. We show that 
curios enhanc anticipatori eye movement toward the 
expect locat of the answer and the dwell time on the answer 
after it be presented, without affect other metric of saccad 
or fixations. the ocular signatur of high or low curiosity, confi- 
denc or surpris be suffici specif so that a machin learn- 
ing algorithm could discrimin these level with above-ch 
accuraci across multipl individu observers.

2.1. subject 

twenti subject (11 women) be recruit from the columbia 
univers commun and be compens for their participa- 
tion at the rate of $15 per hour. all the experiment procedur 
be approv by the institut review board of columbia 
univers and write inform consent be obtain for each 
subject. 

2.2. procedur 

dure the experi subject be comfort seat in a 
dimli lit room with their head stabil by a chin-rest at a dis- 
tanc of 54 cm from a comput screen. eye posit and pupil size 
be measur at a sampl rate of 500 Hz use an eye-link 1000 
eye-track system configur for binocular tracking. befor data 
collect began, the subject receiv a task descript and per- 
form a few practic trial that be not includ in the data set. 

In the first part of a session the subject be requir to 
perform a seri of 120 trial in which they read and rat trivia 
question and be subsequ show the answer. the trial 
be evenli divid between 60 one-quest trial in which the 
subject receiv a singl question, and 60 two-quest trials, in 
which they saw two sequenti present question and could 
select the one for which they wish to see the answer. one and 
two-quest trial be signal in advanc by, respectively, 
one or two ‘‘beeps” and be present in randomli interleav 
order in one trial block. A progress bar be display after everi 
trial indic the number of remain questions.

As show in fig. 1 a trial begin when the first question be dis- 
play in the upper part of the screen and subject be ask to 
rate their level of curios and confid use a scale of 1 
(low) to 5 (high) (panel 1). On 2-question trials, thi be follow 
by the present of the second question and it rate (fig. 1, 
panel 2), after which the subject be prompt to select one 
question to which they wish to receiv the answer use an 
up/down key press (fig. 1, panel 3). the trial then progress to 
the answer period dure which we record eye movement a 
describ below (fig. 1, panel 4–5). after view the answer, 
the subject receiv a final rate scale ask them to indic 
their surpris in the answer (fig. 1, panel 6; 1 low, 5 high). one- 
question trial be identical, except that onli one question be 
display and, after give their curios and confid ratings, 
the subject press a button to progress to the answer stage. 

our focu be on the subjects’ eye movement dure a 3 s per- 
iod center on answer presentation. To dissoci the anticipatori 
and reactiv compon of gaze we divid thi period into a 1.5 s 
anticipatori epoch when a rectangular empti box appear at the 
top of the screen indic the forthcom posit of the answer 
(fig. 1, panel 4), and a 1.5 s answer period, when the answer be

ter (for the question and answers) be display in black with a 
lumin low than that of the background, and letter height 
be approxim 0.39 degre of visual angl (dva). 

after complet the trivia questions, the subject complet 
three questionnair develop to ass person trait (110 
question total). the first questionnair measur the tendenc 
to maxim extern or intern sensat on a sensat seek 
scale (zuckerman, 1964). the second questionnair be the curios- 
iti and explor inventori II (kashdan et al., 2009) which mea- 
sure curios and explor use 2 dimensions: interest for 
novelty, challeng and absorpt (full engag in specif 
activities). the third questionnair analyz novelty-seek 
behavior on four subscal base on the origin of the stimulation: 
intern or extern to the body, and cognit versu sensat 
(pearson, 1970).

ment with amplitud larg than 1 degre of visual angl and 
veloc exceed 0.1 deg/s. A fixat be count when eye- 
posit be stabl for a minimum of 100 ms. 

becaus subject have a tendenc to emphas rate of 1 and 
5 for all measur (fig. 2a–c), we focu on compar trial with 
these ratings, which we refer to as, respectively, ‘‘low” or ‘‘high” 
curiosity, confid or surprise. 

To analyz the 3 questionnaires, each of which captur a 
slightli differ aspect of curiosity, we summar the result 
use a subject-specif aggreg curios score. To deriv thi 
score we first normal each subject’ respons to each ques- 
tionnair on a scale from 0 to 100 (i.e., sensat seek scale: 
true = 0, fals = 100; curios and explor inventory: veri 
slightli or not at all = 0; a littl = 25; moder = 50; quit a 
bit = 75; extrem = 100; novelti seek questionnaire: dis- 
like = 0; like = 100), and then comput the averag score across 
the 3 questionnaires.

2005), which be freeli avail at http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ 
~ml/weka, and make the full annot eye movement data set 
publicli avail at: www.gottlieblab.com. reader can reproduc 
our analysi by use weka with paramet –I 250 –K 8 –S 1. 

We conduct the mine analysi separ for predict 
rate of curiosity, confid and surprise. In a first popul 
analysi we use all trial with rate of 1 or 5, pool across all 
observers. becaus ani imbal in the frequenc of high and 
low rate can artifici inflat predict accuracy, we resam- 
plead the pool data set to provid equal number of trial with 
each type of rating, therebi ensur that chanc accuraci be 
50%. after resampl we be left with 990 trial for the analysi 
of curiosity, 1144 trial for confid and 1042 trial for surprise. 
In thi remain data set, the number of trial per subject be too 
low to provid a meaning evalu of how accur a machin 
learn algorithm be for individu subjects. therefore, to verifi 
the consist of the algorithm, we use a standard cross- 
subject valid procedure, wherebi we train the algorithm on 
19 of the 20 subject and test it predict accuraci on the 
remain subject, iter until each subject serv a a test. To 
ass statist signific we test the set of predict 
against 0.5 use non-parametr tests. note that, although the 
train set overlap across the 20 subjects, the result of the test 
phase be base on the individu subject data, and therefor pro- 
duce 20 independ points, satisfi the independ assump- 
tion for statist tests. 

To determin the predict valu of individu eye movement 
featur we use the ‘‘gainratio” tool provid by weka. the tool 
output the inform gain ratio (igr), defin a the reduct 
in entropi achiev by use inform onli from that feature: 

igr ¼ gainrðclass; featureþ 
¼ ðhðclassþ �hðclassjfeatureþþ=hðfeatureþ 

where ‘‘class” refer to the categori to be predict (high or low 
curiosity, confid or surprise) and h() denot the entropi of 
the respect distribut (see witten & frank, 2005). 

2.4.3. eye movement featur 
while tradit data analysi can onli focu on a small num- 

ber of features, data mine techniqu base on machin learn 
can rapidli evalu veri larg set of featur and featur combi- 
nations. therefore, these techniqu can reveal new parametriza- 
tion of the eye movement trace that make effici statist 
predict but may not have be identifi on an a priori basis. 

We parametr the input to the algorithm use a vector of 
183 featur that describ the statist properti of the eye 
movement trace on each trial. A complet list of featur be give 
in supplementari tabl 1 and a gener descript be give below. 

the major of the featur be statist properti of 4 sig- 
nals: (1) the horizont posit of the eye in screen coordinates, 
(2) the vertic posit of the eye in screen coordinates, (3) pupil 
diamet (z-score for each subject by subtract the mean and 
divid by the standard deviat across all the trial give by that 
subject), and (4) the euclidean distanc between the eye and the 
upper left corner of the answer box. each signal be measur 
dure the 1.5 s before-answ and after-answ period at a fre- 
quenci of 500 hz, provid 2 data set of 750 data point each. 

for each of the 8 result data set (4 signal * two epochs), we 
extract a set of 40 basic featur befor the answer and after 
answer onset (listed, respectively, in line 1–40 and 84–123 in 
supplementari tabl 1). these valu be base on statist 
properti of the measurements, includ the minimum, maxi- 
mum, mean, median, variance, rang (max–min), and the first 
quartile, third quartil and interquartil rang (differ between 
the first and second quartiles). In addition, to captur aspect of 
gaze dynam dure the two epochs, we comput a vector of 
local deriv (differ between success time points) 
and extract the mean of the absolut valu of the deriv 
in each epoch. finally, we provid the differ between the ‘‘be- 
fore answer” and ‘‘after answer” valu for the 20 featur charac- 
teriz the distanc to answer and the pupil size (featur 164 to 
183). for measur of pupil size, to mitig nois induc by vari- 
ation in gaze locat or luminance, we extract addit 
descriptor from a subset of trial when the eye be continu- 
ousli insid the answer box dure the interv 0.5 s befor to 
0.5 s after answer onset. the 10 featur extract from the first 
and second half of thi interv (250 sampl each) be list 
in line 74 to 83 (befor answer), and 154 to 174 (after answer). 

finally, we extract featur describ individu saccad 
and fixation: 6 featur for each of the 5 first fixat of epoch 
befor the answer (supplementari tabl 1, line 41 to 70) and after 
the answer display (line 124 to 153). for each fixat we 
extract (1) the time of begin of the fixat (the end of the 
pre-fix saccade), (2) the end of each fixat (the onset of the 
post-fix saccade), (3) fixat durat (differ between 
start and end times), (4) the averag horizont posit dure 
the fixat period in screen coordinates, (5) the averag vertic 
posit dure the fixat period in screen coordinates, (6) the 
averag euclidean distanc between the fixat locat and the 
answer box. If a trial includ few than 5 fixat in either epoch, 
themiss numberswer cod a nan (not a number). finally, we 
comput the time when the eye first enter the answer box (71 
if thi time be before, and line 72 if it be after answer onset) and 
the durat of the first fixat in thi area (line 73).

3.1. rate and choic 

As show in fig. 2a–c, the distribut of rate be not uni- 
form but tend to be concentr on valu of 1 and 5 for curios- 
ity, confid and surprise. thi suggest that subject be 
engag in the task and do not mere settl on a default interme- 
diat rating. becaus of thi asymmetry, we focu our eye move- 
ment analysi on trial with rate of 1 or 5 (which we refer to a 
‘‘low” or ‘‘high”). 

previou investig propos that a key factor drive epis- 
temic curios be an ‘‘inform gap” – a discrep between 
what one know and what one would like to know – and therefor 
that curios should peak when one have a littl bit of knowledge, 
but diminish if a subject know too littl or too much about a topic 
(kang et al., 2009; lowenstein, 1994). consist with thi predic- 
tion, we found that rate of curios be an invert u-shap 
function of confid – peak at intermedi level but becom- 
ing low for the low or the high level of confid 
(fig. 2d). follow the method of kang et al. (kang et al., 2009), 
we transform confid rate to percentag (divid each 
rate by 5 and multipli by 100), and fit the data to the equa- 
tion: curios = b0 + b1 * p + b2 * p * (1 � p), where p be the trans- 
form confid score. the model provid R2 = 0.73 and a 
signific quadrat coeffici (b2 = 30 * 10�4, 95% confid 
interval, [24 * 10�4, 36 * 10�4]) consist with a peak at interme- 
diat values. We obtain equival result whether we use 
the raw or z-score confid ratings. 

rate of curios be posit correl with rate of 
surpris (fig. 2e; r = 0.982, p = 0.003). interestingly, subject could 
have understood their rate of ‘‘surprise” in thi task to indic 
how unlik they believ the answer to be (how much it differ 
from the set of possibl answers) or alternatively, how much 
weight they give to the new information. the high correl

between curios and surpris suggest that subject adopt the 
latter interpret – i.e., the more curiou they be while antic- 
ipat the answer, the more salienc they assign to the answer 
when it be final shown. In the follow analysi we show that, 
despit thi high correl between curios and surprise, the 
two construct have differ oculomotor effects. 

To investig how the subjects’ rate be relat to their 
choic on 2-question trials, we calcul for each trial the abso- 
lute differ between the rate of curios and confid 
assign to the two altern questions. We reason that, if 
the rel rate determin the subjects’ choices, subject 
may tend to choos the question with the high curios or low

As show in fig. 2f, thi hypothesi be confirm and choic 
be determin more strongli by rate of curios than by 
those of confidence. subject almost alway ask for the answer 
to the question that produc the high curiosity, even if the rat- 
ing differ be small (fig. 2f; black trace). while the subject 
also tend to select the question in which they have low confi- 
dence, thi be a weaker effect (fig. 2f, gray). If both question 
elicit a similar level of confid (a differ of 1), choic 
be fulli alloc to the question that elicit high curiosity.

To examin the overal eye movement pattern dure the task, 
we construct time-resolv map of fixat densiti at each

each entri show the averag (sem) of the respect metric in 1-question trials, first averag by subject and then across subjects. for each metric we compar the high and 
low rate trial use a wilcoxon test. while high confid tend to be associ with few saccades, few fixat and larg saccad amplitud dure the 
anticip period, these trend do not reach statist signific (p-valu of, respectively, 0.063, 0.07 and 0.08). for all other comparisons, p > 0.13. 

86 A. baran et al. / vision research 117 (2015) 81–90 
anticip locat of the surpris rate (whose present be 
not includ in fig. 3). 

In addit to thi task-rel pattern, gaze be modul by 
curiosity, confid and surprise. thi can be appreci by com- 
par the top two row of fixat map in each category, corre- 
spond to ‘‘high” and ‘‘low” ratings, and from the subtract 
map on the 3rd row. these display suggest that gaze converg 
sooner and linger longer on the expect answer locat for 
high rel to low curios states. 

To quantit analyz these effect and distinguish them 
from those of confid and surprise, we measur the averag 
euclidean distanc between the eye and the top left corner of the 
answer box a a function of time (fig. 4a). thi distanc be 
significantli small for question with high rel to low curios- 
iti ratings, and thi differ be maintain consist dure 
the entir anticip epoch (p < 10�45, wilcoxon test). therefore, 
subject shift gaze sooner to the answer box if they have high 
curiosity. In contrast, confid have an inconsist effect that 
switch from earli repuls to a slight late attract in high 
versu low confid states, but be not signific over the 
entir interv (fig. 4a, middle). To further confirm that the effect 
of curios be not confound by those of confidence, we carri 
out a second analysi where we comput the effect of curios 
separ in trial with high and low confid ratings. linear 
regress coeffici comput over the 500 m befor answer 
onset be significantli neg in both trial subgroup 
(p < 10�30 in both cases), show that high curios be 
associ with a shorter distanc to the answer independ 
of confid rate (fig. 4b). 
eye movement be also influenc by subject rate after 
answer present – linger longer on the answer for trial 
with high curiosity, low confid and high surpris 
(fig. 4a). however, becaus of the statist associ among 
these rate (fig. 2D and e), these post-answ effect cannot be 
unambigu attribut to a specif factor – a topic to which 
we return in the data mine analysi below. 

As show in tabl 1, curiosity, confid and surpris have no 
signific effect on other gaze parameters, includ the number, 
amplitudes, peak veloc of saccades, or the number and dura- 
tion of fixations, in the epoch that preced or follow the 
answer onset. therefor in high curios states, subject seem 
to have guid their gaze more precis toward the answer box 
without alter the speed or frequenc of saccades. 

3.3. correl with trait curios 

To determin whether the impact of curios on eye move- 
ment correl with measur of trait curios (risko et al., 
2012), we construct an aggreg curios score base on the 
subjects’ answer to 3 questionnair design to measur sensa- 
tion seeking, curios and explor and novelti seek trait 
(see section 2). We found a neg correl between the 
questionnair score and the effect of curios on saccad antici- 
pation (fig. 5a; linear regress coefficient, �0.079; SE = 0.031, 
p = 0.02). By contrast, there be no signific correl 
between questionnair score and the extent to which gaze be 
affect by confid (fig. 5b; linear regress coefficient, 
0.032; SE = 0.246, p = 0.17) or surpris after answer onset

3.4. data mine 

while the analysi we conduct so far show that rate of 
curiosity, confid and surpris affect eye movement patterns, 
in the follow section we ask the convers question: be the 
eye movement effect specif enough to provid a read out of 
the subject’ epistem state? pleas note that these two question 
be mathemat distinct and be expect to provid non- 
redund information. tradit analysi be equival to esti- 
mate the condit probabl of an eye movement pattern 
give an epistem state (e.g., p(ey movement | high or low rating)), 
wherea a data mine approach estim the invers probabl 
– the likelihood of an epistem state give an eye movement pattern 
(e.g., p(high or low rate | eye movement)). In addition, while a 
tradit approach focu on a small set of ‘‘intuitive” featur 
that be believ to be relev base on prior hypotheses, data 
mine algorithm sift through veri larg set of featur and fea-

valu between high and low rate trial for each of the 183 fea- 
ture use for data mine (fig. 7c). comparison of fig. 7B and C 
highlight sever noteworthi points. first, while mani featur 
be modul a a function of rate (show differ abov 
or below 0 in fig. 7c) onli some of these featur have high igr 
(fig. 7b). the featur with high igr be those that modul in a 
manner that be specif enough to allow accur predictions. nota- 
bly, featur describ eye posit befor the answer onset (fea- 
ture 1–30) tend to modul in distinct manner for the 3 
rate (e.g., chang in opposit direct for curios and confi- 
denc and be unaffect by surprise) and have high igr. In con- 
trast, featur describ eye posit after the answer (featur 
84–113) show correl variabl for curios and surpris 
and thu have low igr. thi result illustr how data mine 
techniqu can help interpret empir measur effects, and 
uphold our conclus base on fig. 4 that the anticipatory, rather 
than reactive, compon of gaze can most reliabl distinguish 
between epistem states. 

second, for the anticipatori compon of gaze (featur 1–30), 
data mine assign high igr to featur relat to the variabl 
rather than the central tendenc of the eye posit – includ 
the interquartil range, the absolut range, the maximum valu 
and the standard deviat of the horizont eye posit and 
the distanc to answer (tabl 3). examin of fig. 4 show that 
thi find extend rather than conflict with our initi analy- 
sis. while in our initi analysi (figs. 3 and 4) we focu on the 
averag distanc to answer, the result can be equal well 
describ by varianc statistics: across the anticipatori epoch, 
the rang of distanc between the eye and the answer box be 
larg for low rel to high curios states, due primarili to 
the maximum distanc (at �1500 ms) be larg for the former 
set. indeed, the vast major of the variance-rel featur that 
have high igr also show signific differ between high and 
low curios trial when re-examin in fig. 7c. 

In sum, a expected, the data mine analysi uphold our con- 
clusion that curios state affect the anticipatori compon of 
gaze, and identifi new parameter of the eye movement 
trace that support effici statist classification. 
4. discuss 

In addit to it document abil to enhanc memori and 
motiv (gruber et al., 2014; kang et al., 2009), epistem 
curios influenc attent and gaze. On some level thi find 
seem unsurpris – a it seem natur to look more intent at 
inform that we be more curiou about. however, no studi 
have quantit examin the link between eye movement 
and semant curiosity, and recent studi have remain agnost 
about (gruber et al., 2014) or even argu against such a link 
(kang et al., 2009). our result provid empir data show that 
semant curios affect eye movement control and that these 
effect be specif enough to allow curios to be read out indepen- 
dentli of other epistem variabl such a confid and surprise. 
thi finding, combin with a previou report link trait curios 
with free-view visual explor (risko et al., 2012), suggest 
that curios have multipl influenc on eye movement control. 

An import question concern the relat between curios 
and surprise, becaus novelti and surpris have be show to 
impact eye movement control (baldi & itti, 2010; itti & baldi, 
2009; yang, chen, & zelinsky, 2009), and in our result these two 
rate be significantli correl (fig. 2b). however, wherea 
prior studi focu on visual paradigms, here we focu on 
semant factors. most relev to our work, two paper focu 
on bayesian surpris have defin surpris in a pure bottom-up 
fashion – base on the condit probabl of observ a pixel 
give it local visual context (baldi & itti, 2010; itti & baldi, 2009). 
By thi definition, surpris be veri close relat to visual salienc 
(contrast) – and be clearli distinct from the epistem surpris we 
examin here. second, wherea previou investig focu 
on the reactiv compon of gaze – the propens to look at a 
novel or surpris item – our paradigm reveal a pro-act 
response, wherebi curios enhanc gaze anticip befor 
the subject saw the answer and could rate it ‘‘surprise”. thi 
anticipatori compon – which preced ani effect of surpris 
– be the basi for dissoci the effect of curios from those 
of surpris both in the tradit analysi (figs. 3 and 4) and in the 
data mine approach (fig. 7). 

base on these considerations, we suggest that curios can be 
view a a pro-act process that anticipates, or motiv agent 
to obtain new information, wherea surpris indic a reactiv 
process after have process the information. togeth with 
the inform gap theori that suggest that curios peak at 
intermedi level of knowledg (see fig. 2A and (kang et al., 
2009; lowenstein, 1994)), thi reinforc the view of curios a 
a mechan for activ learning, which allow agent to proac- 
tive choos which question they wish to resolve, and specif 
seek out learnabl task while steer away from unlearn or 
bore inform (gottlieb et al., 2013; oudey et al., 2013). 

the fact that curios influenc eye movement be particularli 
import becaus it provid a possibl handl into it cellular 
mechanisms. In human and non-human primates, oculomotor

decis be thought to be mediat by ‘‘prioriti maps” – popula- 
tion of neuron in the later intrapariet area and the frontal eye 
field that have visuospati recept field and select target for 
attent or gaze, which be sensit to multipl factors, includ 
bottom-up salience, task relev and expect reward (bisley & 
goldberg, 2010; thompson & bichot, 2005). our result suggest 
that epistem curios should be add to the list of factor that 
determin prioriti and attent allocation. the find that epis- 
temic curios specif affect gaze anticip support the 
idea that it act at the oculomotor decis stage rather than low 
level of motor control. thus, the mechan that gener 
curiosity, includ it individu variations, may be read out in 
neuron involv in cognit eye movement control. 

our demonstr that machin learn algorithm can read 
out state of curios from eye movement pattern reinforc 
the conclus that curios produc an oculomotor signatur 
that be distinct from that of partial correl construct of confi- 
denc and surprise. Of the larg number of eye movement featur 
provid to algorithm, onli a small subset be predict of epis- 
temic states, and thi subset support effici classif 
across individu observ (fig. 6c), suggest that the algorithm 
be robust to chang in the precis featur it receiv (e.g., would 
produc similar result if give a slightli differ set of eye move- 
ment features). thi find add to the grow bodi of research 
that appli data mine techniqu to emot recognit (e.g., 
base on facial express (zeng, pantic, roisman, & huang, 
2009), speech inton (oudeyer, 2003) or skin conduct 
(jerritta, murugappan, nagarajan, & wan, 2011)). the abil to 
predict curios state have potenti practic applic in sev- 
eral domains, includ the develop of individu educa- 
tion softwar (clement, roy, oudeyer, & lopes, 2014) where 
onlin readout of curios could be use to custom the content 
of instruct that be show to the learner so a to maxim his/ 
her individu learn progress, and of recommend system 
(rokach, shapira, & kantor, 2011) where track the curios of 
custom may be use to offer person product recommen- 
dations. finally, curios be strongli relat to earli infant learn 
and develop (oudey & smith, in press) and the track of 
curios could becom an import tool in effort to leverag 
non-invas techniqu in research and diagnosi of developmen- 
tal disord such a attent deficit disord and autism (gliga, 
bedford, charman, johnson, & team, in press).
