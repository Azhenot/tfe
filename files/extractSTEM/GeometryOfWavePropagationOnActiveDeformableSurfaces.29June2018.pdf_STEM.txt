fundament biolog and biomimet processes, from tissu morphogenesi to soft robotics, reli on the propag of chemic and mechan 

surfac wave to signal and coordin activ forc generation. the complex interplay between surfac geometri and contract wave dynam 

remain poorli understood, but it will be essenti for the futur design of chemic driven soft robot and activ materials. here, we coupl prototyp 

chemic wave and reaction-diffus model to non-euclidean shell mechan to identifi and character gener featur of chemomechan wave 

propag on activ deform surfaces. our theoret framework be valid against recent data from contractil wave measur on ascidian 

and starfish oocytes, produc good quantit agreement in both cases. the theori be then appli to illustr how geometri and preexist discret 

symmetri can be util to focu activ elast surfac waves. We highlight the practic potenti of chemomechan coupl by demonstr 

spontan wave-induc locomot of elast shell of variou geometries. altogether, our result show how geometry, elasticity, and chemic 

signal can be har to construct dynam adaptable, autonom move mechan surfac waveguides.
