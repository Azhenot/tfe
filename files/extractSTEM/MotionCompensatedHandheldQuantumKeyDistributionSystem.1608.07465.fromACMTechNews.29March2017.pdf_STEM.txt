mobil devic have becom an insepar part of our everyday life. they be use to transmit an ever-increas 
amount of sensit health, financi and person information. thi expos u to the grow scale and 
sophist of cyber-attacks. quantum key distribut (qkd) can provid uncondit and future-proof data 
secur but implement it for handheld mobil devic come with specif challenges. To establish security, 
secret key of suffici length need to be transmit dure the time of a handheld transact (~1s) despit 
devic misalignment, ambient light and user’ inevit hand movements. transmitt and receiv should 
ideal be compact and low-cost, while avoid secur loopholes. here we demonstr the first qkd 
transmiss from a handheld transmitt with a key-rat larg enough to overcom finit key effects. use 
dynam beam-steering, reference-frame-independ encod and fast indistinguish puls generation, we 
obtain a secret key rate abov 30kb/ over a distanc of 0.5m under ambient light conditions. 

guarante by the law of physics, quantum key distribut (qkd)1–3 provid an ultim level of security, and 

uniqu it be the onli technolog know to-dat that can monitor eavesdrop activities. sinc it incept in 1984, 

develop of qkd have be larg focu on secur large-scal infrastructures4–6 use long distanc fibr 

transmission7–11 and free space transmiss between fix terminals12–14 qkd transmiss have also be demonstr 

from larg mobil vehicl such a trucks15, planes16 and air balloons17. today, there be increas demand for secur in 

handheld devic such a mobil phone and wearabl technologies. A qkd protect link between handheld devic and 

the termin would provid the key for encrypt with verifi secur for ani wireless commun system, rang 

from indoor wireless network (e.g. wi-fi) to access control and near field commun (nfc) mobil payment 

applications. thi technolog could also prevent atm skim attacks, where a $2 billion loss worldwid in 201518 be 

estimated, by transmit the quantum encrypt key from the mobil devic secur to the atm terminal. A short- 

rang free-spac implement of qkd could address these secur challeng and provid a high degre of security. 

for a handheld qkd system to be practical, it need to be compact and low-cost19–21, and crucially, it must also be abl to 

transmit a secur key in a time suitabl for a handheld transact (~1s). If the size of the transmit key be too small it be 

not mathemat secure, so dure thi short span of time, a number of qubit larg enough to overcom finit key effect 

must be exchanged22–24. the system must therefor provid a stabl commun link take into account the user’ 

unavoid hand movement, which lead to translat and rotat of the mobil device. previou work by mélen, G. et 

al.21 obtain intermitt key transmiss from a handheld devic by use one-sid beam-steer and mechan 

wavepl rotat in the receiver. here we address these issu by use a novel agil dual-mem mirror-bas beam- 

steer system combin with a refer frame independ (rfi) qkd protocol to provid wider angular, translat 

toler and rotat independ respectively. thi result in the first stabl quantum link from a handheld devic 

abl to transmit a secur key in less than a second. 

In order to compens for hand-held oper instabilities, we characteris typic hand-mov and accordingli 

design a system with optim latenc and tolerance. base on thi evaluation, we implement the system use mem 

mirror for beam-steer at both end of the link. their orient be control by a track system use led beacon 

and posit sens detector (psd) at both end of the steer system. thi implement allow u to obtain a wide 

angular coverag and minimis latency, thu guarante the robust against hand movements. 

the rfi qkd protocol propos by laing, A. et al. 25, and experiment demonstr by wabnig, J. et al.26 allow 

polar encod without the requir of align the polar bases. In thi protocol the qubit be encod 

and measur in three polar base (horizontal-vertical, diagonal-anti-diagonal, circular left-circular right). onli one 

of those base need to have a fix align between the transmitt and the receiver. As the circular basi be unaffect 

by rel rotat of the transmitt and the receiv in polar encoding, it be therefor use to transmit the secret 

keys. the two linear base can have ani rel align and be use to ass the secur paramet of the quantum 

channel. base on thi protocol, we demonstr a practic quantum secur wireless link between a termin and a 

handheld devic use a steerabl optic link. 





result 
qkd transmitt and receiv modules. the rfi qkd transmitt and receiv modul be repres in figs. 1a and 

1b respectively. rfi qkd be base on the transmiss and detect of qubit encod in three bases. here the qubit be 

implement by polar encod faint pulses. In order to produc these 6 optic states, we use 6 resonant-cav light 

emit diod (rcleds, 650nm). the light produc by each of the rcled be collim and transmit through a 

set of polar beam splitter (pbs), non-polar beam splitter (bs) and wavepl (wp). the polar of the 

light produc by each rcled be thu purifi and rotat in order to exit the transmitt in one of the 6 requir 

polar states. the optic signal be then attenu by a neutral densiti (nd) filter to obtain faint pulses. In order to 

avoid side-channel attacks27 the optic state origin from all the rcled must be ident apart from their 

polarizations. thi mean that their spatial, spectral, and time profil should be identical. spatial and spectral 

indistinguish be achiev by use a spatial filter with a diffract limit pinhol and a spectral filter with a 

passband narrow than the sources’ emiss spectrum (see methods). fig. 2a show the result spectrum from the six 

sources. time profil of the light emit by each sourc be measur by a singl photon detector collect photon at 

the output of the transmitter. the result statistics, show on fig. 2b, exhibit a veri good time overlap. 

In the demonstr the rcled be driven by a 6-channel pattern generator. everi 4n (i.e. a 250mhz repetit rate), 

a 1n puls be gener in one of the six channels, thi channel be determin by a pseudo-random pattern. the voltag 

level drive each channel be adjust to ensur that the output power be ident for the 6 polarizations. the power be 

then reduc to 0.07 photon per puls with a neutral densiti (nd) filter. thi valu be chosen to obtain a suffici 

small probabl for a puls to contain more than one photon (see methods).

(e) experiment hold the hand-held transmitter. also show the receiv modul in use. 





the receiv modul (fig. 1b) have a similar structur to the transmitter. first, the light be spectral filter with the same 

passband a the transmitt filter. then, light propag through the same pbs, BS and WP arrang a the transmitter, 

which split the light accord to it polar and distribut it to six differ channels. light be then coupl into six 

lens multimod fibres, which be connect to the silicon avalanch photo-detector (siapd) use for photon counting. 

agil beam-steer module. the beam-steer modul must compens for hand movement, and ensur that the 

angular misalign of the transmitt and receiv remain within the field of view of the qkd commun system. 

the angular fluctuat of typic hand movement be analys by measur the posit of a hand-held laser pointer 

spot a a function of time. fig. 3a show the complementari cumul distribut function (ccdf) of the angl creat 

by hand-movement. thi indic the speed at which ani correct must be make to the field of view of the optic 

system. our receiver’ the field of view, which be set by the numer apertur of the lens multimod fibr and 

associ optics, be 0.1 degree. thi mean that correct must be make within approxim 42ms. 

differ techniqu can be use to allow the termin to locat each other befor communication. the qkd signal be too 

weak for tracking. use wavelength-division-multiplexing, two beacon signal be add to system to allow simultan 

track and qkd operation. To minimis the system latency, a scheme use independ led beacon be use here. 

each termin have a beacon that indic it position, and a posit sensit detector (psd) to measur the locat of 

the beacon on the other terminal. thi dual beacon system allow the two termin to track each other independently, 

result in low-latency. fig. 1c show the system we use for dynam beam-steering. A green led beacon (520nm) 

align with the qkd optic mode be use in the transmitter, to indic it posit to the receiver, allow it to perform 

adjust of it field of view. for the receiv to evalu the transmitter’ position, light from the beacon enter the 

receiv and be divert to a psd via a mem steer mirror. the psd then measur the angl of arriv of the beacon 

light, creat a signal that steer the mem mirror until the beacon light be centr on the psd. thi set the receiv 

mirror angl so that photon come from the direct of the qkd transmitt will be coupl into the lens fibres. the 

receiv also have a co-align infrar led beacon (850nm), which allow the transmitt to orient it mem mirror 

and steer the qkd photon toward the receiver. In operation, coverag of +/-4o be achieved, a show in fig. 3b.

and the photon detections. 



qkd perform evaluation. initi static test be undertaken, for differ steer angles. It be found that the 

optic element in the beam-steer system (and to a small extent the beam splitter insid the transmitt and the receiver) 

introduc an undesir birefring lead to polar rotat of the qkd beams. rfi qkd be toler to 

polar rotations, but not to ellipt alterations, so a WP be add insid the beam-steer modul to compens 

for this. the induc birefring be also depend on the mem mirror angle, which varies, and therefor cannot be 

compens with a static wp, but it be found that the increas in the error rate remain within 3% over the whole 

steer range. 

In order to ensur absolut secreci of the transmit key, the raw key that be transmit with the circularli polar 

photon need to be process use error correct and privaci amplif codes. these reduc the key size to a 

fraction of it origin size, call the secur key fraction. thi secur key fraction be calcul base on correl 

between the number of photon transmit in each polar state and the number of detect in each receiv channel, 

use the method describ in the method section (base on wabnig, J. et al.26). these calcul take into account 

potenti polar impur and non-orthogon and it includ finit key analysis. 

In order to demonstr the robust of our system against axial rotat (i.e. rotat around the transmiss direction) 

we introduc a rotat half-wav plate between the emitt and the receiver, which be equival to a rotat of the 

transmitt by an angl equal to twice the valu of the wavepl angle. the secur key fraction a a function of the 

equival rotat angl be show on fig. 4. here the secur key fraction be calcul for 0.5 key transmissions. We 

can see that not onli transmiss of secur key be possibl for ani angl but the secur key fraction remain between 

40% and 60% over a 360 degre rotation. the secur key fraction be also calcul by use the bb84 protocol with the 

same photon counts, and therefor keep two base out of three to calcul the key fraction. In thi case we can see that 

the system perform would drop veri quickli with the transmitt angle. rfi protocol be superior to bb84 for each 

point except for the angl of 170 degrees. thi be due to the fact that the calcul we use for the bb84 curv assum 

perfect polar orthogonality, while our rfi calcul take the most pessimist possibl without assum 

perfect polarization. 



rotat around the other ax induc small modif of the photons’ polar but with minor effect on the 

secur key fraction. the secur key fraction over the whole possibl rang of deflect of the mirror remain between 

35% and 65%. 

the system oper in normal ambient light condit (>400 lux from incandesc light bulbs). the detector dark count 

rate be 370 counts/ per detector, and the nois due to ambient light be 600 photons/ per detector. the beacon led 

addit contribut approxim 570 photons/ per detector. these number be small compar to the ~1m photons/ 

that be detect for the qkd link, and induc error rate due to these impair be negligible. 

quantum key distribut from a handheld devic be demonstr by hold the transmitt and point it at a static 

receiver. the whole optic assembl includ the qkd and beam steer modul be part of the mobil handheld 

device, while the electr instrument be static and connect to the handheld part by cables. two set of experi 

be performed. first, in order to illustr the fluctuat of the asymptot key rate in real time, measur be 

perform while the experiment hold the devic perform a seri of voluntari movements. To calcul thi 



figur 4 | robust of rfi protocol against axial rotation. the secur key fraction (ratio between the raw key length and the 
error corrected, privaci amplifi key length) be plot a a function of the rel axial angl between the transmitt and the receiver. 

the valu be calcul from a 0.5 data transmiss for each point, for a fix posit of the terminals. the rel axial angl 

between the transmitt and the receiv be simul by rotat a half-wav plate between the terminals. 



asymptot key rate, short (4ms) sampl of qkd transmiss be collect everi 100ms, which be the time requir to 

process the photon arriv times. fig. 5a show the vertic and horizont angl of the two mem mirror a well a the 

axial angle. mirror angl be deriv from the appli voltag while the axial angl be deriv from the photon statistics, 

which depend on the polar angl (see methods). the align system be switch on after 4s, and no data be 

receiv befor thi point. then we can see that the experiment move the transmitt up, down, left, right and final 

perform an axial rotation. 





fig. 5b show the transmiss and error rate a a function of time. the transmiss be defin a the total number of 

detect photon divid by the total number of emit photon (i.e. 0.07 x 250mhz), while the error rate onli take into 

account the photon use for the secur key (i.e. photon transmit and receiv in the Z basis). after start the steer

system, the transmiss stabil at around 3% with a few short drop and the error rate be approxim 6%. fig. 5c 

show an estim of the asymptot key rate a a function of time, indic a rate of approxim 30kb/ with veri 

few drop to zero. fluctuat in thi rate be due to the short measur samples. 

second, in order to demonstr the perform of our system dure a real handheld transaction, includ the finit key 

effects, a seri of 14 separ measur be perform with a durat of 0.5 each, while the experiment be 

hold the transmitt without ani intent movement. the averag valu of the secur key rate, after the finit key 

effect be take into account, be 45kb/ with a standard deviat of 10kb/s. these result show that our system can reliabl 

transmit secret key long enough to overcom the finit key limit in a veri short time. 



discuss 

In thi paper, we have success construct the first quantum wireless prototyp for handheld usag fulfil finit key 

requirements. the beam-steer techniqu use maintain a motion-stabil commun link, which allow 

suffici secur key to be transmit with a high throughput under hand-mov and typic ambient light levels. 

A number of improv be possible. An increas key rate could be achiev by use a decoy state protocol28,29, for 

full mobil devic integration, further miniatur of the emitt could be obtain by fabric the rcled on a 

singl chip and combin the polar with photon waveguid a previous demonstr with vcsels20. the 

steer system could also be miniatur by take advantag of the fast improv and size reduct of laser-bas 

pico-project systems30. 

the success of wireless qkd technolog could introduc an unpreced level of data secur to merchant and 

custom alike. make qkd econom and practic enough be essenti to overcom the adopt barrier befor 

secur threat start to appear with the increas of comput power and effici of hack techniques. thi 

demonstr of handheld quantum wireless prototyp repres a major step toward real-world quantum secur for 

mobil applications. 



method 
fabric of qkd transmitt and receiv modules. the light sourc use in the receiv be reson caviti led (rcleds) 

with a central wavelength of approxim 656 nm and a spectral width of 7nm. In order to ensur ident transmiss spectra, a 
spectral filter with a passband (1.5 nm centr at 658 nm) narrow than the rcled emiss spectrum be use to select the light that 

will be transmitted. the choic of rcled over laser diod or led be import for thi application. first, rcled have a wider 

spectrum than lasers, without multipl mode structure. the dispar between the central wavelength of the differ rc-led be 

small than the spectral width, the light go through a narrow band filter will be similar for each rc-led (fig. 2a). thi be veri 

difficult to achiev with laser becaus they need to be tune with a toler small than their individu modes’ width and filter 

with a narrow filter. second, rcled can be modul faster than leds, make it possibl to transmit a larg number of photon 

compar to the constant detector nois rate and thus, increas the key rate. the spatial filter be compos of a first apertur with a 
1mm diamet follow by a focu len (f=6.24mm) and a second apertur with a 5 micron diamet (compar to the airi disk 

diameter). thi ensur ani differ in mode profil or propag direct between sourc be eliminated. the light be then 

collim with an f=11mm lens. both the transmitt and receiv base plate be fabric use aluminium termin with modifi 

16mm cage plate to hous the spatial filter and to enabl easi integr with the beam-steer system. align of the receiver’ 

lens multimod fibr be achiev use spheric bear to give the degre of freedom required. all compon be fix in 

place use UV cure adhesives. A 10db neutral densiti (nd) filter be add after the transmitt to obtain the requir faint puls 

intensity. wavepl (wp) be add in the transmitt and receiv steer modul to correct for their induc birefringences. the 

WP angl around vertic axi a well a the rel angl of the qkd and steer modul be adjust to obtain perfectli circular 

polar in the Z basis. We also take advantag of the fact that the addit WP act essenti a a quarter wavepl to swap 

the X and Z basi by rotat the qkd receiv modul by 45 degree. thi allow u to have the Z basi (use for the secur key) nearer 

to the receiv input. By construct thi make the detect probabl and the polar puriti high than when the Z basi be at 

the opposit end of the receiver. 

beam-steer module. commerci posit sens detector (psds) and mem mirror (ϕ=4.2mm) be used. for the mirror, larg 

area lead to longer latency, mainli due to the inertia, but lead to a good reliabl by reflect more off-axi beams. thi psd and 

mem mirror combin enabl a low latenc suitabl for an agil correct of hand-movement. diverg beacon led (led 

engin inc. 520nm for transmitt and 850nm for receiver) be used. the wavelength be chosen to ensur enough separ 

between the weak qkd signal at 658nm and the strong beacon signals, and to help aim to the receiv with 520nm visibl light. 

dichroic beam splitter of ff750 and ff562 (semrock inc.) be used. 

qkd secur key rate calculations. our secur analysi take into account that, in real implementations, not onli refer frame of 

the transmitt and the receiv can be rotat with respect to each other, but also that there be alway a degre of misalign within a 



refer frame. thi induc non-orthogon within a basi and mutual bia between bases. our analysi also take into account 

differ detector efficiencies. thi be achiev by use an explicit devic model and minimis the key rate over possibl model 

parameters. the calcul of the secret key fraction can be pose a an infer problem: give the measur and a devic model, 

what be the maximum amount of inform an eavesdropp can poss about the distribut key? 

follow the deriv in wabnig, J. et al.26 we can express the secret key fraction a 

𝑟 = 𝑆𝑚𝑖𝑛 − ℎ ( 
1 − 𝐶𝑍𝑍 + 𝜎𝛿𝐶𝑍𝑍 

2 
). 

We take into account imperfect measur devic that can lead to a larg number of addit parameters, such a non- 

orthogon in the prepar and measur base and detector efficiencies, which can be collect into the vector 𝜶. the usabl 
entropi be obtain a the minimum over all paramet 𝜶, 𝜆1,2 

𝑆𝑚𝑖𝑛 = min 
𝛼,𝜆1,𝜆2 

𝑆𝑈(𝜆1, 𝜆2) . 

the paramet have to obey the constraint impos by the observ 

𝑓𝑖(𝑚) − 𝜎𝛿𝑓𝑖(𝒎) ≤ 𝑓𝑖[𝒒(𝜶, 𝜆1, 𝜆2)] ≤ 𝑓𝑖(𝒎) − 𝜎𝛿𝑓𝑖(𝒎), 

where 𝒎 be a matrix contain all relev detector counts, 𝒒 be the correspond probabl of observ a detector count accord 
to the devic model, the 𝑓𝑖 be the function defin the differ constraints, the 𝛿𝑓𝑖 be their correspond varianc and 𝜎 be chosen 
to give a certain probabl that the estim usabl entropi be too high. In our paramet estim step we use a set of 21 constraint 

consist of 9 correl functions𝐶𝐴𝐵 , 𝐴, 𝐵 = 𝑋, 𝑌, 𝑍, the six probabl that a photon be prepar in a certain polaris 
direct 𝑃𝐴±, 𝐴 = 𝑋, 𝑌, 𝑍 and the six probabl to detect in a certain detector 𝐷𝐵±, 𝐵 = 𝑋, 𝑌, 𝑍. for each function 𝑓𝑖 we can give 
the standard deviat 𝑓𝑖 . To obtain the secret key fraction we need to subtract the observ rel entropi in the key base from the 
usabl entropi 

the full set of measur enabl u to calcul a refer frame independ key rate. from the detector count we can construct 

9 correl function 

𝐶𝐴𝐵 = 
𝑚++ 

𝐴𝐵+𝑚−− 
𝐴𝐵−𝑚+− 

𝐴𝐵−𝑚−+ 
𝐴𝐵 

𝑚++ 
𝐴𝐵+𝑚−− 

𝐴𝐵+𝑚+− 
𝐴𝐵+𝑚−+ 

𝐴𝐵 , 𝐴, 𝐵 = 𝑋, 𝑌, 𝑍, 

where the 𝑚±± 
𝐴𝐵 be the four differ detector count give that the qubit be prepar in direct 𝐴 ± and detect in direct 𝐵 ± . 

In the case of orthonorm prepar and measur bases, these can be directli identifi with the qubit correl functions. 

each prepar and each detector be associ with a direct on the poincaré sphere, give by a unit vector. sinc we aim to use 

the z-basi for the key bit we can identifi two prepar direct with the ± 𝑧 direct on the poincaré sphere, without 
overestim the secret key fraction. each direct be parametris by two variabl (e.g. azimuth and polar angle), result in a total 

of 20 free parameters. differ absorpt may occur in the prepar channels, and similarli detector may have differ efficiencies. 

with six possibl prepar direct and six possibl detect direct thi add anoth set of 12 parameters. the quantum channel 

can be repres by a two paramet two qubit densiti matrix in a simplif over the more commonli employ bell diagon 

densiti matrix. thi result in a model with 34 free parameters. the secret key fraction be then obtain a the minimum over all 

paramet that fulfil the constraint impos by the measurements, e.g. from the correl 𝐶𝐴𝐵; in our case a set of 21 constraints. for 
the number of detector count approach infin the constraint be equalities, but for a finit number of observ the valu can 

lie within an interv determin by the number of count and the desir uncertainty. A small number of count will lead to larg 

uncertainti in the correl function and therefor to low result for the secret key fraction. finally, sinc we don’t use singl photon 

sourc in the transmitter, we need to consid the occasion transmiss of multi-photon pulses, which could be exploit by an 

adversari abl to non-destruct detect those puls and extract one of the photons. accord to poisson statistics, the probabl 

for a puls to contain 1 photon be approxim 0.07 and the probabl to have more than one photon be approxim 0.072/2. thi 

mean that amongst the detect event we use to build the secret key, a proport equal to 0.035 be access by the adversary, which 

be veri small compar to the overal secur key fraction (~0.5). In ani case, privaci amplif and error correct will use a key 
fraction slightli low than the theoret limit to ensur an extra guaranti of secrecy. 

axial angl estimation. the correl defin in the abov section can also be use to estim the rel axial angl between the 

qkd base of the transmitt and the receiver. sever combin of correl can be use to calcul the angle. thi calcul 

base on singl photon count be intrins noisy. In order to reduc thi nois a median of the differ possibl way to retriev the 

angl  be calculated: 

= median ( atan2(cxy,cxx)+45, atan2(cyx,cxx)+ 45, -atan2(cyx,cyy) -135, -atan2(cxy,cyy) -135). 

the 45 degre rotat be due to the rotat of the qkd modul in the receiv a explain in the “fabric of qkd transmitt and 

receiv modules” section of the methods. thi calcul be base on the photon counts, a low transmiss doesn’t allow u to 
retriev an accur angle. thi be whi there be a miss section in fig. 5a around 9.5 seconds. thi correspond to a transmiss drop.
