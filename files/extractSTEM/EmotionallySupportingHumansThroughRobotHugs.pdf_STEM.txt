abstract 
hug be one of the first form of contact and affect human ex- 
perience. due to their preval and health benefits, we want to en- 
abl robot to safe hug humans. thi research strive to creat and 
studi a high fidel robot system that provid emot support 
to peopl through hugs. thi paper outlin our previou work eval- 
uat human respons to a prototype’ physic and behavior 
characteristics, and then it lay out our ongo and futur work.

1 introduct 
hug give an individu social support, relief stress, lower 
blood pressure, and increas oxytocin level [2]. becaus of hug- 
ging’ health benefits, roboticist have tri to artifici creat thi 
gesture. disalvo et al.’ the hug be a plush comfort object, whose 
shape mimic a child’s; it work in pair to provid user “tele-hugs” 
[3]. while it stomach glows, vibrates, and play a melodi when 
receiv a hug, it lack the abil to wrap it arm tighter around 
the human, and it requir an addit human partner. stiehl et 
al.’ teddi bear robot, the huggable, us sensor under a layer of 
silicon and fur to detect where and how it be be touch [9]. It 
provid companionship to and monitor child in the hospital. 
while it can move it head and arms, becaus of it small size, it 
can be hug but cannot activ hug back. 

shiomi et al. ran two experi with a larg teddi bear robot, 
find that user who hug the robot interact with it longer, 
provid more self-disclosure, and afterward be more inclin 
toward prosoci behavior [8] [7]. miyashita and ishiguro use an 
autonom wheel invert pendulum humanoid robot to hug in 
a three-step process, while maintain it balanc [5]. determin 
the hug durat be not described. It appear the robot us the 
human to balanc itself, which be a potenti uncomfort tactil 
experi for humans, a it be make of metal.

william and bargh show that human associ positive/warm 
person trait with warm physic contact, and vice versa; here 
subject briefli held a cup of warm or ice coffe and be then 
ask to judg a target person’ person [10]. thi result be 
replic when park and lee alter the skin temperatur of a 
dinosaur robot [6]. they found user percept of the sociabl 
of the robot increas with warmth. 

2 completedwork 
My initi work on thi topic address the research question, “how 
should robot hug?” We hypothes that a soft, warm, touch- 
sensit humanoid robot would provid satisfi hug to human 
by match their hug pressur and duration. I conduct a 
30-particip studi where user experienc 12 hug from willow 
garage’ person robot 2 (pr2): the first group of 3 hug vari the 
physic conditions, and the second group of 9 hug vari the be- 
havior conditions. the present order of the hug be vari 
within each group, and the user complet a survey after each hug. 

three differ physic condit be tested, a show in 
fig. 1: a hard-cold, a soft-cold, and a soft-warm robot. A hard-warm 
robot be not test becaus the heat element somewhat soften 
the robot and divulg the thermal experiment variabl to users. 
hard-cold: the robot have no addit pad layers. soft-cold: 
the robot wear a layer of foam, a layer of cotton, then a layer of 
purpl fluffi polyester. soft-warm: the robot wear the same a 
the soft-cold condit with add heat elements: the wire from 
an electr blanket cover the robot’ chest and back. A heat pad 
be place on the chest. chemic warm pack be place on the 
robot’ upper arm and forearms. the robot outfit be design to 
be gender neutral to be more univers accept and to limit the 
number of experiment variables. 

nine differ behavior condit be tested, vari the 
pressur and the durat of the hug. We custom three distinct 
pressur level for the robot to hug each user: “too loose,” “just right,” 
and “too tight”. use flexibl sensor [1] to detect user contact on 
the robot’ back, we program the robot to termin the hug 
“too soon” (not use user input, releas 1 second after the arm 
close), “just right” (immedi upon human release), and “too late” 
(releas 5 second after the human released).

figur 3: A comparison of the respons to the survey question 
after the first three hugs, chang physic conditions. the grey 
repres the hard-cold condit (hc), the purpl color repres 
the soft-cold condit (sc), and the pink color repres the soft- 
warm condit (sw). black line with star at the top of the graph 
indic where there be a statist signific differ found. 

subject complet a 15-question open survey base on their 
initi impress of the robot, and they answer the same ques- 
tion at the end of the experiment. these subject measur be 
use for evalu becaus we be interest in user preference, 
attitude, and opinion. We plan to includ object measur such a 
heart rate and facial express in futur experiments. these result 
be analyz use a pair t-test comparison, and we found that 
user felt understood by, trusted, and like the presenc of the robot 
significantlymor after the experi (p < 0.05). As show in fig. 2, 
peopl also found robot to be nicer to hug, easi to use, and more 
of a social agent than they initi anticipated, after the experiment. 

all post-trial survey respons be analyz in matlab 2017a 
use a repeat measur analysi of varianc with a tukey’ 
posthoc multipl comparison test to determin which condit 
differ significantly. As can be see in fig. 3, the perceiv safeti 
of the robot increas in both soft conditions, while onli the soft- 
warm condit improv the users’ comfort. 

while signific differ be not notic in the survey 
between the three tight factors, write and verbal comment 
make to the experiment indic user prefer for “veri tight 
hugs”. As can be see in fig. 4, user thought the robot be more 
social, more caring, and make them feel happier and more com- 
fort when it releas them immedi or held on to them too 
long. written and verbal comment indic a prefer for an 
immedi releas from the hug, though a signific differ be 
not notic between these two level in the surveys.

I plan to expand and refin thi project over the cours of my doc- 
torate. first, we will creat a new robot platform, custom for

figur 4: A comparison of the respons to the survey question 
after the last nine hugs, chang behavior conditions. thi row 
repres the three level of the durat factor. shade indic 
the level, from shortest (light) to long (dark). 

social-phys interact with humans. after an extens search, 
we have chosen to use two kinova jaco arm becaus of their slen- 
der design, quietness, fluid movement, and their built-in safeti fea- 
tures. We will cover the arm and chest in a layer of foam, thermal 
conduct fabric, and electr conduct fur for softness, heat- 
ing, and touch sensing, respectively. thi new robot will match the 
hug pressur of the human user, and it will use torqu and/or 
tactil sensor to determin when the subject want to be released. 

next, we aim to enabl peopl to send custom hug to each 
other through thi new platform, to discov the extent to which 
person connect can be reinforc at a distance. We plan to cre- 
ate an onlin forum for peopl to custom the hug they would like 
to send, includ set a duration, upload a voic recording, 
and add a rub or pat on the receiver’ back. 

A final area we be interest in investig be equip thi 
robot with emot intelligence. use machin learning, we will 
enabl the robot to sens a person’ mood base on facial expres- 
sionsmeasur use a camera-bas emot track tool, and the 
way a person hug the robot, which be a form of haptic intellig 
onli peopl current possess. 

applic for thi research rang from help allevi stu- 
dent stress on colleg campu to bring happi to resid 
of nurs homes. As research progresses, it could also be adapt 
for use by peopl undergo rehabilit or childrenwith autism.
