We investig the gener uncertainti principl (gup) correct to the entropi content 
and the inform flux of black holes, a well a the correct to the sparsiti of the hawk 
radiat at the late stage of evaporation. We find that due to these quantum graviti motiv 
corrections, the entropi flow per particl reduc it valu on the approach to the planck scale due 
to a good accuraci in count the number of microstates. We also show that the radiat flow 
be no longer spars when the mass of a black hole approach planck mass which be not the case for 
non-gup calculations. 

I. introduct 

sinc the 1970 it be know that it be possibl to appli 
thermodynam tool to black holes. the fact that black 
hole not onli absorb but also emit radiat when quan- 
tum mechan be take into account be first propos 
by hawk [1, 2]. thi mechan of black hole evapo- 
ration reli on the semiclass approach, so appli the 
method of quantum field theory. hawk calcul the 
emiss from black holes, be thermal (call hawk 
radiation), and the associ temperatur from which 
the correspond thermodynam entropi be obtain 
[3]. the import of thi result lie in the issu that 
consid an initi pure state black hole, when it evap- 
orat (thermally), the final state be a mix state [4]. 
such evolut impli a nonunitari process which be not 
allow in the standard quantum mechanics. thi im- 
pli loss of inform dure the evolut and be com- 
monli call the black hole inform puzzle. thi 
problem have be one of the first point of discuss con- 
cern black hole dure decad and be still unsolved. 
there exist mani differ propos that tri to solv it. 
some of them consid that we should forget about a uni- 
tari process, others, assum unitary, tri to find where 
the inform of the process be lose and how to recov 
it. for more details, see refs. [5–15]. 

the thermodynam entropi be associ with the lack 
of information. In thi sense, we be interest in what be 
the entropi flux in the hawk radiat and what we 
can learn about hidden inform in the correl 
that we decid not to see becaus of the coarse-grain 
we consid [16]. specifically, in thi paper, we be in-

terest in how thi radiat be modifi when we take 
into account effect come from pure quantum gravity. 

recent in [17–20], one of the author of thi paper, 
quantifi the inform budget in black hole evapora- 
tion. the start point be the calcul of the bud- 
get of entropi for a black body, where the entropi flux be 
compens by hidden inform in the correlations, 
due to the emiss process be unitary. thi argument 
be extend for black holes, demonstr that the as- 
sumption of unitar can lead to a perfectli reason 
entropy/inform budget. It be show that dure 
the evapor process bekenstein entropi of a black 
hole be adiabat transfer into the clausiu entropi 
of the hawk radiat field, hold dure the whole 
evapor process that the initi bekenstein entropi 
be equal to the increas clausiu entropi of the radi- 
ation field and the decreas bekenstein entropy. thi 
studi be do consid classic and quantum en- 
tropi and directli provid also that the total number 
of particl be proport to the initi entropi of a black 
hole. 

anoth interest aspect to note, be the (extreme) 
sparsiti of the hawk radiat dure the evapor 
process [21–25]. the averag time between emiss of 
success hawk quanta, be mani time larg than 
the natur timescal set by the energi of the emit 
quantum themselves. 

At the late stage of the hawk evapor pro- 
cess, one should take into account the strong effect com- 
ing from the underli theori of quantum graviti that 
can modifi hawk temperatur [1] and bekenstein en- 
tropi [3]. these modif express in term of gen- 
eral uncertainti principl (gup) have be investi- 
gate in the context of string theori [26–30], loop quan- 
tum graviti [31, 32], modifi dispers relat and 
from black hole physic [34, 36–45]. As a consequ of 
these modifications, black hole do not evapor com- 
plete and be left with a remnant of order of planck size

with finit entropy. It be suggest that these planck 
size remnant store inform [14, 33–35] which give a 
possibl solut to the inform puzzle. 

It be possibl to have two differ kind of correct 
of the entropy. first of them come from the quan- 
tum correct in count microstates, keep fix 
the horizon area (microcanon corrections) [41]. these 
correct will reduc the entropi a a consequ of 
the reduct of the uncertainti over the underli mi- 
crostates. the second kind of a correct be not relat 
to the fundament degre of freedom, but correct the 
entropi by consid thermal fluctuat on the hori- 
zon area (canon corrections) [42]. contrari to the 
former one, in thi latter case, the entropi increases, a 
one add uncertainti to the system. In thi paper we 
be interest in the quantum correct when the black 
hole reach the planck scale, so we will consid onli the 
microcanon correct (that can also be understood 
a more fundamental). We investig how these cor- 
rection modifi the inform flow and sparsiti of the 
hawk radiation. these correct be express by 
the gup and first of all they influenc the bekenstein 
entropi and the hawk temperature, then extend 
onto other relat quantities. 

In sec. II we review the key result about the informa- 
tion content of black hole a give in refs. ([17–20]). In 
sec. iii we discu the gup correct to the flow of in- 
format in black hole when they approach the planck 
mass. In sec. IV we studi the gup modif to the 
frequenc of emiss of hawk quanta. the summari 
of our result be give in sec. V. 

ii. entropi OF black hole per 
emit quanta 

In ref. [17] the averag entropi releas dure the 
standard thermodynam process of burn a lump of 
coal in a blackbodi furnac be calculated. It be use to 
present thi entropi in a dimensionless fashion, express 
in unit of nat or bits. henceforth, the entropi in nat 
be Ŝ = s/kb , and the entropi in bit be just defin a 

ŝ2 = s/(kb ln 2), where kB be the boltzmann constant 
and S the origin (dimensionfull) entropy. the explicit 
result for an averag entropi flow in black bodi radiat 
be obtain to be 

〈ŝ2〉 = 
π4 

30ζ(3)ln2 
bits/photon ≈ 3.90 bits/photon. (1) 

the standard deviat of eq. (1) be 

σŝ2 =

− 
( 

π4 

30ζ(3) 

)2 
bits/photon 

≈ 2.52 bits/photon, (2) 

where ζ(n) be the riemann zeta function. 

thi reason be then extend to the black 
hole evapor process, determin the flux of en- 
tropy/inform emit in the form of radiat (as- 
sum an exact planck spectrum a first approxima- 
tion) [18, 19]. for the case of a schwarzschild black 
hole with mass M , the bekenstein entropi loss per emit- 
ted massless boson be found to be equal to the entropi 
content per photon in black bodi radiation. In addition, 
after calcul the gain of entropi in the hawk flux, 
one find that all the inform emit by a black hole 
be perfectli compens by the entropi gain of the radi- 
ation, so that the inform be complet transmit 
from the hole to the extern radiat [18, 19]. 

one can also estim the total number of emit 
quantum in term of the origin bekenstein entropi a 
be equal to [18, 19] 

N = 
30ζ(3) 

π4 
ŝ2 ≈ 0.26 ŝ2. (3) 

accord to these results, it be shown, semiclassi- 
cally, how it be possibl to describ the evapor 
process of a black hole with an explicit and continu 
flux of entropi (from the hole into the radiation), where 
each photon carri an amount of entropi that should be 
compens by inform hidden in correl (as- 
sum that the evapor be a unitari process). 

iii. gup correct TO the entropi 
OF black hole 

the calcul involv hawk radiat be usu- 
alli perform use semiclass methods, but when the 
size of a system approach the planck scale, they ceas 
to be valid and it be the full theori of quantum graviti 
which should be applied. As still there be no complet 
theori of quantum gravity, what one usual consid 
be some correct to the classic theori come from 
the quantum natur of spacetime. In our case of interest, 
we will investig the correct in the hawk tem- 
peratur and the bekenstein entropy. these correct 
be first suggest in string theori [28, 29] and in loop 
quantum graviti [31, 32]. In fact, it be possibl to di- 
rectli appli the gener uncertainti principl (gup) 
to describ such correct [34, 41]. they be appli in 
order to accur count the number of microst that 
describ a black hole, and thi translat into quantum 
correct to microcanon entropy. 

the gup modifi the heisenberg principle, in pres- 
enc of a gravit field, at the planck energi 
into [34–44] 

∆x∆p = ~

] 
, (4) 

where x be the position, p the momentum, and 

α = α0

with α0 a dimensionless constant, lpl the planck length, 
~ the planck constant, and α a constant with the dimen- 
sion of invers momentum i.e. kg−1m−1s. the valu 
of α0 have be larg discuss in the literatur and it 
depend on the correct we want to appli to our sys- 
tem [34, 40–42, 46–48]. In the case that concern u it 
have a neg valu due to the microcanon correc- 
tion we consid (a it be detail in the introduction) 
and be of order uniti on the theoret basi (show 
onli our ignor of the exact correct to the uncer- 
tainti principl from quantum gravity) [34, 41]. recently, 
some investig be discuss observ bound 
over the valu of α0 [46–49]. there have even be also 
claim that α0 be not a pure number, but depend on the 
ratio mp/m where M be the black hole mass and mp be 
the planck mass [47]. the gup correct should be 
appli to a black hole evapor process at it final 
stage (when the size of a black hole be of the magnitud 
of the planck scale) and so they impli a modif of 
the information/entropi carri by the emit particl 
a it be explain below. 

follow [34], we can write hawk temperatur of a 
black hole by use the uncertainti relat ∆p∆x ≈ ~; 
and near the horizon of a black hole, the posit uncer- 
tainti have a minimum valu of ∆x = 2lp, where for the 
case of a schwarzschild black hole, lp = 2gm/c

lead to an energi uncertainti

where, m2p = ~c/g, G be the newton’ gravit con-

we can deriv tgup . for thi purpose, one can express 
∆p in term of ∆x from eq. (4) and it give 

∆p =

. (9) 

again by the same argument abov and use ∆x = 2lp = 
4gm/c2 and includ the calibr factor into each 
term, we get

use thi modifi hawk temperature, tgup , we ob- 
tain a gener formula for bekenstein entropi that 
take into account the gup corrections. for thi pur-

such a correct make sens consid that the final 
state of evapor be a remnant of the planck size. 

iv. sparsiti OF hawk radiat 
modifi BY gup 

An interest characterist of the hawk flux be 
that it be veri spars dure the whole evapor pro- 
cess. In order to probe this, one can use sever dimen- 
sionless quantiti that give the ratio between an averag 
time between the emiss of two consecut quantum and 
the natur time scale [21]. 

In the first approxim one assum the exact 
planck spectrum and it result in a gener express 
for the minkowski spacetime, that should be specifi de- 
pend on a dimensionless paramet η (for a detail 
discussion, see ref. [21]) give by 

η = C 
λ2thermal 
gA 

, (22) 

where the constant C be dimensionless and depend on 
the specif paramet (η) we be choosing, g be the spin 
degeneraci factor, A be the area and 

λthermal = 2π~c/(kbt ) (23) 

be the “thermal wavelength.” 
for a schwarzschild black hole the temperatur in the 

thermal wavelength be give by the hawk tempera- 
ture and the area should be replac by an effect area 
(that correspond to the univers cross section at high 
frequencies) give by aeff = 27/4a, where A be a horizon 
area of a black hole. In thi case, the relev factor in 
ani dimensionless paramet result in 

λ2thermal 
aeff 

= 
64π3 

27 
∼ 73.5...� 1, (24) 

for massless bosons. consequently, ani of the dimen- 
sionless paramet be much larg than uniti (contrari 
that emitt under normal laboratori conditions, where 
η � 1). thi impli that the gap between success 
hawk quantum be on averag much larg than the nat- 
ural timescal associ with each individu emit 
quantum, so the flux be veri sparse. It be interest to 
note that the mass M of a black hole drop out dure 
the calculations. 

what be relev here be that both the area and the 
“thermal wavelength” be gup-modifi when the sys- 
tem approach the planck scale. thi result in modi- 
fy the frequenc of emit quantum from a black hole. 

We obtain that the new gener by gup effect

It be worth emphas again that the dimensionless 

paramet 
λ2thermal 
aeff 

|gup depend on the initi mass of 
the black hole M and the gup paramet α. At earli 
stage of the hawk evapor process, thi be not 
relev (due to the huge mass of a black hole) and 
thi dimensionless paramet be much great than one. 
however, when a black hole approach the planck mass 
at the late evapor time, the paramet approach 
uniti and final becom less than one. note that for 
high valu of α, thi dimensionless paramet start 
decreas for small valu of mass, that be for earli 
phase of an evapor process. thi result indic 
that the hawk flux be no longer spars when the black 
hole approach the planck mass, and that thi regim 
depend of the specif gup parameter, although the 
qualit result be the same for all valu of α. In [50] 
a similar result from calcul the sparsiti of hawk 
flux close to the planck scale, use correct come 
from backreact effect have be studied. It be in- 
terest to note that how differ approach for that 
scale lead to qualit similar results, which reassert 
the behavior of the hawk flux at the final stage of 
evaporation. 

V. summari 

We have investig quantum graviti modif 
to the entropi and temperatur of an evapor black 
hole express by the gener uncertainti principl 
(gup), that will be relev when it approach the 
planck size. In thi process, gup prevent complet 
evapor leav a final remnant of the planck size. 
We have show that these modif chang the flow 
of inform from black hole when they approach the 
planck mass, and also influenc amount of the sparsiti 
of the hawk radiation. 

We have consid microcanon correct that 
be take into account in order to more accur count 
the microst that describ a black hole. thi proper 
count of microst allow to reduc the uncertainty, so 
the entropi be diminish in comparison to the semiclas- 
sical calculation. 

the first import result we have obtain be that 
the radiat flux, although continuous, do not alway 
carri the same amount of information. onc the evap- 
orat reach it final stage (that is, the black hole 
size approach the planck length), the entropi budget 
carri by escap particl reduc drastically, there- 
fore the hidden inform in the system also reduces. 
In addit be also interest to note how also the total 
number of emit particl be reduced, what be consist 
with the presenc of a final remnant. 

the second import result be that although the 
hawk radiat flux be extrem spars dure the 
evapor onc the semiclass regim be considered, 
when we take into account the gup modif thi be 
no longer the case and the radiat ceas to be spars 
when the process reach it last stage which be close 
to the planck scale. 

these result help to understand the behaviour of the 
flux of hawk particl and the inform loss from 
the black holes. they show how modif com- 
ing from quantum graviti (here- the gup corrections) 
chang the semiclass pictur of the entropi flux, when 
a black hole approach last stage of their evapor 
processes.
