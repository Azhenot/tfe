abstract 
An unpreced human mobil have driven the rapid urban- 
izat around the world. In china, the fraction of popul 
dwell in citi increas from 17.9% to 52.6% between 1978 and 
2012. such large-scal migrat pose both signic challeng 
for policymak and import question for researchers. 

To investig the process of migrant integration, we employ 
a one-month complet dataset of telecommun metadata in 
shanghai with 54 million user and 698 million call logs. We nd 
systemat dier between local and migrant in their mobil 
commun network and geograph locations. for instance, 
migrant have more divers contact and move around the citi with 
a larg radiu than local aer they sel down. By distinguish 
new migrant (who recent move to shanghai) from sel mi- 
grant (who have be in shanghai for a while), we demonstr 
the integr process of new migrant in their rst three weeks. 
moreover, we formul classic problem to predict whether 
a person be a migrant. our classi be abl to achiev an f1-score 
of 0.82 when distinguish sel migrant from locals, but it 
remain challeng to identifi new migrant becaus of class im- 
balance. yet we show that an increas fraction of new migrant 
be classi a local week by week.

1 introduct 
In a big citi like l.a. you can spend a lot of time surround by 

hundr of peopl yet you feel like an alien or a ghost or something. 
— morley 

million of peopl migrat to citi to realiz their urban dreams, 
rang from pursu potenti job opportun to embrac an 
open dynam cultur [28]. ese migrant contribut to the pros- 
periti of citi by constitut a substanti part of the workforc 
in the cities, strengthen the polit and econom statu of the 
cities, and bring divers cultur to the cities. 

despit the great benet brought by migration, policymak 
and scholar have well recogn that the fast rate of migrat 

pose great challeng [3, 28]. segreg and social inequ 
have becom signic issu in the migrat process. for in- 
stance, migrant may sel in slum with health hazard [6]; they 
tend to be overwork but underpaid [39]; their child may be 
exclud from school [19]. ese problem might be even more 
salient in china, a develop countri with an unpreced speed 
of urban [3]. It be thu an import research question to 
understand how migrant integr into a city. 

furthermore, the life of migrant be in constant ux. some mi- 
grant may eventu sel down in the city, while other may go 
back to their hometown or dri to anoth city. i process resem- 
ble users’ behavior in onlin commun [2, 12, 13, 27, 33, 45], but 
present more complex dynam becaus move oin requir 
consider more eorts. accur model and predict of 
migrant integr can potenti inform urban policymaking. 

In thi work, we be interest in two central compon of 
migrant integration: the locat where a migrant life and move 
around, and the peopl that a migrant interact with and befriend. 
first, becaus citi be divid into neighborhood with vari 
characteristics, there may exist systemat dier between 
local and migrant in where they live. for example, figur 1 show 
the geograph distribut of local and migrant compar 
to the overal averag in shanghai. somewhat surprisingly, local 
be more activ in the peripheri of the city, wherea migrant 
rel concentr in the center of shanghai. i observ 
echo previou nding that exist resid ee from central 
cities, know a “white ight” [17]. It yet remain an open question 
how migrants’ activ area evolv a they integr into the city. 

anoth import aspect of migrant integr be how mi- 
grant build their person networks. As human be social animals, 
whether a migrant can success develop a person network be 
crucial in her integr process [20]. In particular, yue et al. [53] 
show that migrant-resid tie be signicantli associ with 
migrant integration. however, it remain unclear how a migrant 
make initi friend and then slowli build a person network in a 
new city. It be also unknown what characterist dierenti the 
social network of migrant from those of locals. 
organ and highlight of thi work. In order to investi- 
gate the abov two aspects, we conduct a case studi of shanghai, 
one of the big citi in china, and present the rst large-scal 
quantit explor of migrant integration. We employ a one- 
month complet dataset of telecommun metadata from china

figur 1: geograph distribut of locals, settl migrant (who have be in a new citi for a while), and new migrant 
(who recent move to a new city) in shanghai. each person be repres by the center of their activ area (formal def- 
init will be present in section 3). figur 1(a) show the log probabl of all user in each region and thi probabil- 
iti constitut a comparison point for the other gures. each of the right three gure show the log odd ratio of each 
group compar to the overal averag in figur 1(a), i.e., log pgroup − log P , where P be the overal averag in figur 1(a) and 
pgroup, group ∈ {locals, sel migrants, new migrants} be the probabl to fall in a region within that particular group of people. 
intuitively, a red region in the right three gure suggest that thi group of peopl be disproport frequent in that 
region. settl migrant tend to be in the central part of the city, while local be in the periphery. new migrant be similar 
to settl migrant by and large, but have a few dark area on the periphery. e darkest point in figur 1(d) correspond to 
songjiang univers town, a hub of universities. 

telecom,1 which contain 698 million call log between 54 million 
mobil user in shanghai. To identifi a comparison point of mi- 
grants, we den local a the person that be born in shanghai, 
the counterpart of migrants. As migrant may undergo dier 
stage in their integration, we further dierenti migrant that 
have be in a new citi for a while, sel migrants, from migrant 
that recent move to a new city, new migrants. We present detail 
of the dataset in section 2. 

first, we explor how locals, sel migrants, and new migrant 
dier in their mobil commun network and geograph 
locat in section 3. We nd interest dier between these 
three groups. for instance, in term of commun networks, a 
substanti fraction of new migrants’ contact be fellow townsmen, 
peopl who be born in the same province. i paern suggest 
that townsman be essenti for new migrant to build their initi 
person network in a new city. surprisingly, sel migrant 
have an even high fraction of townsman contacts, indic that 
they may have grown their townsman network a they stay longer 
in shanghai. In term of locations, in addit to the dier in 
figur 1, we nd that sel migrant tend to have a larg radius. 

second, we use the call log over dier time period to 
give a brief dynam view of the integr process in section 4. 
despit the short time span, we observ that new migrant becom 
increasingli similar to sel migrant in most characteristics, 
while featur of sel migrant and local tend to be stabl over 
time. i contrast suggest that the featur that we employ can 
inde reect the integr process to some extent. meanwhile, 
we observ that the integr slow down in the nal week. one 
possibl explan be that not all new migrant eventu becom 
1china telecom corpor be a chines state-own telecommun compani 
and the third larg mobil servic provid in china. 

sel migrant and the slow integr be due to the one that 
encount diculti ing into the city. i hypothesi be worth 
further investigation. 

finally, we formul predict task to distinguish migrant 
from local in section 5. use the featur that we propose, we be 
abl to build a classi that signicantli outperform the baselin 
and achiev an f1-score of 0.82 on sel migrants, indic 
that it be not a dicult predict task to separ sel migrant 
from locals. We also observ that if we appli thi classi to 
new migrants, an increas fraction of new migrant be classi 
a local over time. however, it remain challeng to identifi 
new migrant becaus the number of new migrant be veri small 
compar to sel migrant and locals. 

our work be a rst step toward understand migrant integra- 
tion and inform urban policymakers. i challeng problem 
necessarili involv eort from a wide rang of disciplines, in- 
clude anthropology, comput science, economics, sociolog and 
urban planning. We thu provid an overview of relat work on 
thi issu in section 6 and oer some conclud discuss in 
section 7. 

2 experiment setup 
In thi section, we introduc our dataset and the framework that 
we use to studi mobil commun network and geograph 
inform of local and migrants. 

2.1 dataset 
We use a dataset that contain complet telecommun record 
between mobil user use china telecom in shanghai, span 
a month from septemb 3rd, 2016, to septemb 30th, 2016 (four 



weeks). e data be provid by china telecom, the third larg 
mobil servic provid in china. our dataset consist of about 54 
million user and 698 million call log between them. A call log be 
record a long a it be make in shanghai and either the caller 
or the calle be a user of china telecom (some of the 54 million 
user use other mobil services). each call log contain the caller’ 
number, the callee’ number, the start time, and the end 
time. sinc person identic be requir to obtain a mobil 
number, we be abl to retriev person aributes, includ age, 
sex, and birthplace, for user of china telecom that open their 
account in shanghai.2 In addition, we have the gp locat of the 
correspond telecommun tower use dure the call for 
user of china telecom, which roughli approxim the locat 
of them. our dataset be anonym by china telecom for privaci 
concerns. roughout the paper, we report onli averag statist 
without reveal ani identi inform of individuals. 

2.2 framework 
We categor user in our dataset into three group base on their 
birthplac and thi categor constitut the basi for our 
comput framework. We refer to peopl that be born in 
shanghai a locals. e rest peopl who be not born in shanghai 
be migrants. To ass dier stage of migrant integration, 
we separ migrant that have no call log in the rst week (new 
migrants), from migrant that have at least one call log in the rst 
week (sel migrants). We further requir each local and sel 
migrant to have call log at everi week, and each new migrant to 
have call log at each of the last three weeks, to make sure that these 
user live in shanghai dure our four-week span. We ltere 
around 15, 000 user that have abnorm high degrees, who like 
correspond to fraudsters, deliveri persons, or custom servic 
accord to a user type list provid by china telecom. In the end, 
we have 1.7m locals, 1.0m sel migrants, and 22k new migrants. 
mobil commun networks. one core compon of our 
studi be a weekli mobil commun network base on the 
call logs. group by week allow u to account for variat 
between weekday and weekends. formally, we build a direct 
graphgt = (vt ,et ) for each week t (t ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4}), wherevt be the 
set of users, and each direct edg ei j ∈ E indic that vi call 
vj (vi ,vj ∈ Vt ). note that onli a subset of user invt be label a 
locals, sel migrant or new migrant (in total around 3 million 
users). i subset be the focu of our study. 
geograph locations. anoth compon be the geograph 
locat that a person be activ at. specically, for each call a person 
makes, we have access to the gp locat from the correspond 
telecommun tower. We use each week a a window and 
collect all the locat that a person make call in that week, 
and refer to thi order list of locat for user v at week t a 
ltv = [l1, . . . , ln ], where li contain the latitud and the longitude. 
We have geograph locat for the subset of user with label 
sinc they be all user of china telecom by denition. 

We will den comput featur base on these two com- 
ponent in section 3.

their mean sum up to 1, except for demograph of contact and fraction of reciproc call (they all natur fall between 
0 and 1). error bar repres standard errors, and they be tiny. 

join china telecom (week 2) in thi section. We will focu on 
the integr process in section 4, in which we also show that 
most featur do not chang for local and sel migrant in fu- 
ture weeks. tabl 1 provid an overview of the featur that we 
consider. demograph of users’ friends,3 ego-network features, 
and call behavior deriv from the mobil commun networks, 
while geograph featur come from locat information. In the 
following, we will explain the motiv and relat theori of 
each feature. 
demograph of contact (figur 2(a)). A person’ mobil 
commun network can reason approxim her social 
network. local like maintain veri dier social network 
from migrant sinc they have grown up in thi city. also, a a 
person sel down in a new city, her social network may chang 
dramatically. exist studi suggest that kin relationship play an 
import role in determin the destin of migrat [20] and 
relationship with local be crucial for migrant integr [32]. We 
look at the demograph of contact in age, sex, and birthplaces. 
homophili in sex and age. It be well recogn that peopl tend 
to make friend with those who be similar to themselves, also 

3note that although we do not have demograph inform for user use other 
servic providers, we have demograph inform for a much larg set than the 
one label locals, sel migrant or new migrant becaus we requir these user 
to be activ in each week. 

know a homophili [34]. We observ interest contrast regard- 
ing homophili of age and sex. local show the strong homophili 
in sex, i.e., local have the larg fraction of contact with the same 
sex. surprisingly, in term of the absolut fraction, new migrant 
have more contact with a dier sex than with the same sex 
(onli around 40%). In contrast, local be less like to have contact 
at similar age than sel migrants, but more than new migrants. 
birthplaces. e most strike dier lie in that around 70% of 
a local person’ contact be also locals. i number be much low 
for sel migrants, and the low for new migrants. townsmen, 
peopl who share the same hometown, be an import compon 
of a new migrant’ initi network (30% of new migrants’ contact 
be townsmen). i observ echo exist nding regard 
kin relationship. In comparison, sel migrant have an even 
high fraction of townsman in their contacts, which suggest that 
new migrant get to know more peopl from the same hometown 
a they integr into a city. ese observ be consist with 
homophily, but they also indic that urban migrant maintain a 
rel separ person network from locals. 
ego-network characterist (figur 2(b)). As expected, new 
migrant have the small degre and weight degree. however, 
sel migrant tend to have the larg degree, larg than locals. 
i indic an interest transit that migrant may undergo. 
mayb becaus of homophily, neighbor of sel migrant also 



have the larg averag degree, and neighbor of new migrant 
have the small averag degree. 

cluster coecient measur the fraction of triangl in the 
ego-networks. It roughli reect how connect a person’ contact 
be to each other. interestingly, new migrant present the larg 
cluster coecient, while sel migrant have the lowest. It 
may suggest that new migrant start with a close-knit group when 
they move to a big citi like shanghai. connect with our previou 
observations, thi close-knit group tend to come from the same 
provinc a the new migrants. It be worth note that thi could 
also relat to that new migrant have the small ego-networks. 
call behavior (figur 2(c)). e durat of call may reect 
the natur of the relat between a person and her contacts. call 
of long durat like involv intim relat or be driven by 
substanti businesses, while call of short durat tend to be quick 
check-in or relat to small incidences. our data show that local 
and sel migrant have similar level of averag call duration, 
much larg than new migrants. similar trend show up in the 
varianc of call duration. 

regard the divers of provinc in a person’ contacts, set- 
tled migrant have the most divers group of contacts, while local 
have the lowest. i paern reson with previou observ 
that local have about 70% of contact that be also locals. 

finally, we nd that local and sel migrant be more like to 
have reciproc relationship with their contacts, while the fraction 
of reciproc call be the low for new migrants. i again show 
that the person network of new migrant be still nascent. note 
that the dier be much less dramat than that in call duration. 
geograph pattern (figur 2(d)). e mobil of peopl in 
dier group can be reect by their locat over time. As 
we have discuss in the introduction, both sel migrant and 
new migrant tend to move around the central part of shanghai, 
while local be more disproport frequent in the periphery. 
regard the radiu of a person’ movement around her own 
center, we observ that sel migrant have the larg radiu 
both in term of max radiu and averag radius. i suggest that 
although new migrant start with a small activ area than locals, 
sel migrant move in an even larg area than locals. 

total move distanc be correl with the total number of 
call that a person makes. We thu discov the same order a in 
weight degree. however, local tend to move the most distanc 
between call on average, while new migrant move the shortest 
distance. i further suggest that new migrant have a small 
activ area than locals. 
summary. compar sel migrant to locals, we observ 
that sel migrant have more activ and divers behavior pat- 
tern both in mobil commun network and in geograph 
movements. meanwhile, new migrant present dier character- 
istic from both sel migrant and locals. i suggest that new 
migrant go through signic chang in their commun 
network and geograph locat a they slowli sel down. 

4 integr OF newmigr 
given the dier between locals, sel migrant and new 
migrant that we have observed, we now investig the integr 
process of new migrants. sinc a subset of new migrant eventu 

local > sel > new, 
local < sel < new 

new migrant be move toward lo- 
cal and sel migrant be in the 
middl of thi process. 

new > local > seled, 
new < local < sel 

new migrant move toward local ini- 
tially, but eventu move away from 
them and remain dier from local 
aer they sel down. 

local > new > seled, 
local < new < sel 

sel migrant and local be dier- 
ent, and new migrant never move to- 
ward locals. 

tabl 2: all possibl order of featur valu between 
locals, settl migrants, and new migrant and their corre- 
spond implications. 

becom sel migrants, we hypothes that the featur of new 
migrant will grow more similar to those of sel migrant in 
week 3 and week 4. indeed, we nd that new migrant be slowli 
“becoming” sel migrant in most features. figur 3 present 
how some featur of locals, sel migrant and new migrant 
chang over the four week (new migrant onli move to shanghai 
in week 2). although exist studi have argu that dier 
gener of migrant can exhibit dier characterist [11, 37], 
our observ show that the featur that we propos be robust 
to gener dierences, or shanghai be too young a citi to observ 
gener gap from telecommun records. 

e more interest comparison be with locals. one possibl 
way to evalu migrant integr be whether they becom more 
similar to local over time. depend on how the featur of local 
compar to new migrant and sel migrants, we can observ 
sever possibl trajectori a show in tabl 2. 

An ideal integr process suggest that new migrant becom 
more similar to locals, and sel migrant be a middl state in 
thi process, i.e., the order should follow local > sel > new 
or local < sel < new, and we should observ that the featur 
of new migrant move toward sel migrant in week 3 and 
week 4. some featur inde show consist trajectori with thi 
ideal integr process, includ fraction of same-sex contacts, 
fraction of local contacts, call duration, durat variance, and 
averag move distance. It make sens that migrant be probabl 
never go to match local in fraction of local contacts, but such 
match may happen in averag move distanc and call duration. 

however, for the major of features, we observ that although 
new migrant initi move toward locals, they may eventu 
becom further away from local aer sel down. ese featur 
includ degree, weight degree, averag degre of neighbors, clus- 
tere coecient, fraction of friend with similar age, fraction of 
reciproc calls, max radius, averag radius, total move distance. 
In particular, all featur in ego-network characterist follow thi 
trajectory, suggest that new migrant eventu build quit 
dier commun network from locals. 

It be rare that new migrant do no move toward local at all but 
becom more dier from local in the integr process. i

figur 3: integr process of new migrants. each gure present how the valu of a featur evolv over the four week 
for locals, settl migrants, and newmigrants. We choos four sampl in the rst two row becaus there be more than four 
featur that belong to those categories. error bar repres standard errors. 

onli happen in provinc divers and townsmen.4 both point to 
the fact that new migrant start with a more divers commun 
network in term of birthplac than locals, and their network get 
even more divers over their stay in shanghai. note that there be a 
declin in provinc divers for new migrant in week 4 but they 
be still closer to sel migrant than to locals. 

interestingly, in some features, we observ that the integr 
slow down or converg in week 4 for new migrants. i be 
like due to the fact that not all new migrant be go to becom 
sel migrants. As a result, we can alreadi see that the integr 
process stop or slow down in week 4 for a subset of these people. 
In addit to these summari statistics, geographically, we also 
observ that the center of new migrant be expand over time, 
a show in figur 4. 
discussion. overall, we nd that new migrant be sel down 
and gradual becom sel migrants, and thi observ be 
robust with potenti gener gaps. however, in a substanti 
fraction of the features, although new migrant be temporarili

shanghai and alway have 0 in thi feature. 

move toward locals, they be probabl go to becom dier 
from local a sel migrant do. In other words, despit sel 
down, sel migrant remain fairli dier from locals. 

5 difficulti OF distinguish 
migrant 

We set up two predict task to ass the diculti of distin- 
guish migrant from local with the featur that we propose. 
sinc the number of new migrant be much small compar to 
sel migrant and local (22k vs. 1.0m and 1.7m), we employ two 
formul in thi section. first, we propos a binari classica- 
tion task to distinguish sel migrant from locals. We then appli 
thi binari classi to new migrant to evalu how oen a new 
migrant would be mistakenli thought of a a local by our classier. 
i misclassic rate can reect how well new migrant have 
integrated, at least in term of fool our classier. second, we 
work on the more challeng three-way classic problem to 
identifi new migrants, sel migrants, and locals.

week. We randomli draw 50% of user and use their call log in 
week 2 to train the classier. We use the remain data to test the 
classi (50% of data in week 2, and 100% of data in week 3 and 
week 4). base on the call log of a give user, we extract all fea- 
ture list in tabl 1 except “townsmen”, a measur the fraction 
of townsman reli on the user’ label (the user’ birthplace). We 
use precision, recall, and f1-score for evaluation, with the minor 
class (i.e., migrants) a the target class. for the classier, we use 
`2-regular logist regression. We choos the best `2 penalti 
coecient use 5-fold cross-valid in train data. 

5.1 settl migrant vs. local (binari 
classication) 

predict perform (figur 5(a)). It turn out to be rel- 
ativ easi to distinguish sel migrant from locals. We can 
achiev an f1-score of 0.82 with all the featur that we propose. 

We further analyz the contribut of each type of featur by 
remov them one by one. In the rst remov step, we nd that 
geograph featur be the most inuenti featur set, i.e., F1 
drop the most (0.11) if we remov geograph featur (-g in 
figur 5(a)). demograph be the most import in the second 
step (-gd in figur 5(a)). In the third step, remov ego-network 
featur be the choice, leav u with a classi that onli us call 
behavior (-gde in figur 5(a)). F1 drop almost 50% to 0.43 aer 
remov these three type of features. In addition, the predict 
perform of the binari classi be robust over time: f1-score 
on each week vari lil (<0.0007).5 

integr of new migrant (figur 5(b)). one way to evalu- 
ate the integr of new migrant be to measur how oen thi 
binari classi would mistakenli classifi a new migrant a a lo- 
cal. We present the fraction of misclassi local among sel 

5we do not show the plot in the interest of space. 



migrant a a comparison point. overall, sel migrant be more 
like to be misclassi a local than new migrant (e.g., 15.2% 
v 13.6% in week 2). however, we observ an increas trend for 
new migrant over the three weeks. In week 3, the misclassi 
fraction of new migrant increas to 14.4%, suggest that they 
becom similar to local over time. e growth slow down in week 
4, which be consist with our nding in section 4. To our sur- 
prise, the faction of sel migrant misclassi a local slightli 
decreas over time. i suggest that some sel migrant could 
have stop integr with local aer sel down, but build 
their own commun and keep their own lifestyl instead. 

5.2 identifi new migrant (ree-way 
classication) 

e three-way classic problem be challeng due to the rela- 
tive small number of new migrant (about 0.8% of all instances). 
e classi onli achiev an f1-score of 0.1 on identifi new 
migrant and thi perform drop over time, while the perfor- 
manc on sel migrant and local remain similar to the binari 
classic task (figur 5(c)). We nd that more new migrant 
be classi a sel migrant or local incorrectli by the clas- 
sier over time. i be consist with the observ that new 
migrant be becom similar to sel migrant or local in most 
characterist despit the short time span, while sel migrant 
and local tend to stay constant. 

6 relatedwork 
e urban process pose signic challeng for the societi 
that requir eort from variou disciplines. We review relev 
studi in the follow four aspects. 
migrant integration. migrant integr be a well-recogn 
research question in mani disciplines, includ anthropology, eco- 
nomics, sociolog and urban plan [9]. most relev to our 
work be the studi of urban migrat [7, 8, 16, 18, 19, 41–43, 49]. 
In addit to the eect of nation-st and demograph (ethnic 
groups, rural vs. urban) on urban migrant integration, schiller 
and çauglar [41] argu that the role of migrant in the citi de- 
pend on the rescal of the citi themselves. govern polici 
and agenda-se also play an import role in the integr 
process [43]. beyond our scope, immigr (migrant to a new 
country) and refuge (a subgroup of immigrants) have also re- 
ceiv signic interest [4, 5, 23, 44, 48]. 
urban migrant in china. e unpreced speed of devel- 
opment and the huge popul in china have spark a baeri 
of studi on urban migrant in china [1, 10, 25, 31, 32, 47, 50–54]. 
ere be at least three perspect a suggest in [25]: those of 
the migrant themselves, of the urban employers, and of the gov- 
ernment. our work present the perspect of migrant base on 
their telecommun paerns. It be worth note that a central 
topic in public polici regard migrant in china be the impact of 
the “hukou” system, a household registr system that limit the 
benet and social welfar of migrant [1, 51, 52]. finally, although 
satisfi migrants’ need be among the challeng that bai et al. 
[3] highlight in the chines government’ urban strategy, 
lil aent be paid to the social integr of migrants. 

urban computing. data-driven studi relat to citi have 
gain import recent and lead to a new term, urban comput 
[1, 15, 21, 24, 38, 40, 55, 56]. ese studi combin heterogen 
data sources, includ locat data, social medium activ data, 
mobil phone data and survey data, to propos metric for citi 
develop and potenti guid urban policies. for instance, 
zheng et al. [56] employ gp data from taxicab to evalu trans- 
portat system in beijing, while De nadai et al. [14] use mobil 
phone data to extract human activ and propos metric to mea- 
sure urban diversity. recently, twier have also be use a a tool 
for demograph studi in understand the global mobil 
paern [15]. 
tempor social network and onlin communities. our 
work be also relev to studi on the evolut of network [22, 26, 
29, 30, 35, 36, 46]. use data from onlin social media, these studi 
explor the connect between individu behavior and global 
network properties. for instance, viswanath et al. [46] nd that 
link in the activ network tend to come and go rapidli over time, 
and the strength of tie exhibit a gener decreas trend a the 
social network link age on facebook. leskovec et al. [29] develop 
a triangle-clos model to explain network evolution. In addition, 
studi have investig the process of new user integr in 
onlin commun [2, 12, 13, 27, 33, 45]. In particular, mcauley 
and leskovec [33] examin the process of how a new user becom 
an expert on review websites. 

7 conclud discuss 
We present the rst large-scal studi on migrant integr base 
on telecommun metadata. We demonstr the dier 
between locals, sel migrants, and new migrants, and show how 
characterist of a migrant’ commun network and geo- 
graphic locat evolv in the integr process. for instance, 
although migrant build connect with local in the integr 
process, townsman becom increasingli import in their net- 
works. We also nd that migrant increas the size of their activ 
area and their move distanc in the citi over time. overall, in 
most features, we be abl to observ how new migrant gradual 
becom sel migrants, but that do not necessarili indic that 
they becom more similar to locals. 

We further formul predict problem to distinguish mi- 
grant from locals. A classi base on the featur that we pro- 
pose can achiev a high f1-score on sel migrants, around 0.82. 
i conrm that migrant be still fairli dier from local in 
their behavior paerns, support studi on the segreg of 
migrants. meanwhile, we also observ that a larg fraction of new 
migrant be classi a local over time, partli document the 
integr process. 

our work be limit by the data that we have access to. one 
month be too short to captur the full integr process of migrants. 
also, people’ life be much richer and more dynam than what 
we be abl to captur use telecommun metadata. job 
situations, health records, and daili interact can all potenti 
oer u a more in-depth understand of migrant integration. In 
addition, it be challeng to address the imbal problem between 
the three group for realist applic becaus new migrant 
be the minor by denition. last but not least, although china 



telecom be a major servic provid and shanghai be an import 
global city, the select bia present in our data may limit the 
generaliz of our ndings. 

As urban be happen at an unpreced rate and data 
collect becom ubiquit in smart cities, there be tremend 
opportun for data-driven approach to understand and 
improv migrant integration. for instance, it would be use to 
identifi migrant that have troubl ing into the citi and provid 
time and use support. We hope that our studi can encourag 
more research in our commun to examin thi problem from 
dier perspect and eventu lead to methodolog and 
applic that benet policymak and million of migrants.
