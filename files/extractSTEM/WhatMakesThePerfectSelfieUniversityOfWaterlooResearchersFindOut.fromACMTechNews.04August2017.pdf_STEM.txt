your grandma might suck at take selfi — that doesn’t mean you should too. 

univers of waterloo research agree, and have make it easi than ever to take the perfect solo shot for social media. 

comput scienc professor dan vogel and former master’ student qifan Li develop an app that direct the user where to posit the camera for the most visual appeal 
selfie. 

“selfi be all around us; we see our friend on social medium take selfies,” say vogel. “not all selfi be equal — light be poor, or the face be off centred.” 

look through not-so-good selfi on vogel’ own facebook feed motiv him to figur out what make these photo attract or unattract to onlin audiences. 

“there’ noth wrong with improv the visual esthet of our world,” he said. “much like we alreadi do with our home and what we’r wearing.” 

the research bought 3D digit scan of what be consid “average” look people. they then take thousand of virtual selfi by write code to control a virtual 
smartphon camera and computer-gener lighting. use these tools, they explor composition, light direction, face posit and face size. 

then, thousand of people, through a crowdsourc service, vote on which of the virtual selfi they thought be best. vogel and Li use math to model vote patterns, 
develop an algorithm and app prototyp to guid peopl to take perfect selfies. 

To test the algorithm, they have real peopl take selfi with their smartphon camera and with the app. base on onlin ratings, they found a 26 improv in selfi take with 
the app. 

so, what make a perfect selfie? 

befor you get too excited, the end result is, in vogel’ words, unremarkable. 

“don’t make you your face too close or far away to the camera, make sure light fill your face and centr your head in the top end of the frame,” he said. 

what’ more import be that the research demonstr how a subject concept can be measured, turn into a highli control data set, and crunch into an algorithm. 

“thi be just the begin of what be possible,” vogel said, add the variabl can be expand to consid what make the best selfi hairstyle, background, smile type, outfit or 
head tilt. the concept could be appli to other type of photos, like group shots, and esthetics. 

the app prototyp be uniqu in that it direct the selfie-tak where to posit the camera, instead of do it automat for them after the photo be taken. In thi way, the user 
actual learn how to make their photo better. 

research aren’t plan to commerci the app — a time-consum and costli process. 

“the app be a proof-of-concept,” vogel said. “get it readi for public releas go beyond our main mission.”
