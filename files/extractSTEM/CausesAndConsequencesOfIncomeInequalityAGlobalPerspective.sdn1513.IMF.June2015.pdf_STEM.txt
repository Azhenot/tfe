“we should measur the health of our societi not at it apex, but at it base.” andrew jackson 

widen incom inequ be the defin challeng of our time. In advanc economies, the gap 
between the rich and poor be at it high level in decades. inequ trend have be more mix 
in emerg market and develop countri (emdcs), with some countri experi declin 
inequality, but pervas inequ in access to education, health care, and financ remain. not 
surprisingli then, the extent of inequality, it drivers, and what to do about it have becom some of 
the most hotli debat issu by policymak and research alike. against thi background, the 
object of thi paper be two-fold. 

first, we show whi policymak need to focu on the poor and the middl class. earlier imf work 
have show that incom inequ matter for growth and it sustainability. our analysi suggest 
that the incom distribut itself matter for growth a well. specifically, if the incom share of the 
top 20 percent (the rich) increases, then gdp growth actual declin over the medium term, 
suggest that the benefit do not trickl down. In contrast, an increas in the incom share of the 
bottom 20 percent (the poor) be associ with high gdp growth. the poor and the middl class 
matter the most for growth via a number of interrel economic, social, and polit channels. 

second, we investig what explain the diverg trend in inequ develop across 
advanc economi and emdcs, with a particular focu on the poor and the middl class. while 
most exist studi have focu on advanc countri and look at the driver of the gini 
coeffici and the incom of the rich, thi studi explor a more divers group of countri and 
pay particular attent to the incom share of the poor and the middl class—th main engin 
of growth. our analysi suggest that 

 technolog progress and the result rise in the skill premium (posit for growth and 
productivity) and the declin of some labor market institut have contribut to inequ in 
both advanc economi and emdcs. global have play a small but reinforc role. 
interestingly, we find that rise skill premium be associ with widen incom dispar in 
advanc countries, while financi deepen be associ with rise inequ in emdcs, 
suggest scope for polici that promot financi inclusion. 

 polici that focu on the poor and the middl class can mitig inequality. irrespect of the 
level of econom development, good access to educ and health care and well-target 
social policies, while ensur that labor market institut do not excess penal the poor, 
can help rais the incom share for the poor and the middl class. 

 there be no one-size-fits-al approach to tackl inequality. the natur of appropri polici 
depend on the underli driver and country-specif polici and institut settings. In 
advanc economies, polici should focu on reform to increas human capit and skills, 
coupl with make tax system more progressive. In emdcs, ensur financi deepen be 
accompani with great financi inclus and creat incent for lower inform 
would be important. more generally, complementar between growth and incom equal 
object suggest that polici aim at rais averag live standard can also influenc the 
distribut of incom and ensur a more inclus prosperity. 



inequality: caus and consequ 

intern monetari fund 5 

I. context 
1. rise inequ be a widespread concern. inequ within most advanc and emerg 
market and develop countri (emdcs) have increased, a phenomenon that have receiv 
consider attention—presid obama call widen incom inequ the “defin challeng 
of our time.” A recent pew research center (prc 2014) survey found that the gap between the rich 
and the poor be consid a major challeng by more than 60 percent of respond worldwide, 
and pope franci have spoken out against the “economi of exclusion.” indeed, the prc survey found 
that while educ and work hard be see a import for get ahead, know the right 
person and belong to a wealthi famili be also critical, suggest potenti major hurdl to 
social mobility. not surprisingli then, the extent of inequality, it drivers, and what to do about it 
have becom some of the most hotli debat issu by policymak and research alike. 

2. whi it matters. equality, like fairness, be an import valu in most societies. irrespect of 
ideology, culture, and religion, peopl care about inequality. inequ can be a signal of lack of 
incom mobil and opportunity―a reflect of persist disadvantag for particular segment of 
the society. widen inequ also have signific implic for growth and macroeconom 
stability, it can concentr polit and decis make power in the hand of a few, lead to a 
suboptim use of human resources, caus investment-reduc polit and econom instability, 
and rais crisi risk. the econom and social fallout from the global financi crisi and the result 
headwind to global growth and employ have heighten the attent to rise incom 
inequality. 

3. thi note. the object of the note be two-fold. first, it show whi policymak need to 
focu on the poor and the middl class. build on earli imf work which have show that incom 
inequ matter for growth, we show that the incom distribut itself matter for growth a well. 
In particular, our find suggest that rais the incom share of the poor and ensur that there 
be no hollowing-out of the middl class be good for growth through a number of interrel 
economic, social, and polit channels. second, we investig what explain the diverg trend in 
inequ develop across advanc economi and emdcs, with a particular focu on the 
poor and the middl class. In that context, we be fill a gap in the literatur sinc exist studi 
typic focu onli on advanc economi or a small sampl of emdcs. thi approach allow u 
to suggest polici implic depend on the underli drivers, and country-specif polici and 
institut settings. 

4. roadmap. section II provid an overview of the macroeconom implic of high 
inequ of outcom and opportun and show whi policymakers’ focu on the incom share 
of poor and the middl class can prove growth-enhancing. section iii provid a rich document 
of recent trend in both monetari and nonmonetari indic of inequ across advanc 
economi and emdcs, while section IV investig the driver of the rise in inequality, includ 
from an empir perspective. section V conclud and discu polici implications.

ii. macroeconom consequences: whi WE care 
5. outcom and opportunities. the discours on inequ often make a distinct 
between inequ of outcom (a measur by income, wealth, or expenditure) and inequ of 
opportunities―attribut to differ in circumst beyond the individual’ control, such a 
gender, ethnicity, locat of birth, or famili background. inequ of outcom aris from a 
combin of differ in opportun and individual’ effort and talent. At the same time, it be 
not easi to separ effort from opportunity, especi in an intergener context. for instance, 
parent income, result from their own effort, determin the opportun of their child to 
obtain an education. It be in thi spirit that rawl (1971) argu that the distribut of opportun 
and of outcom be equal import and inform to understand the natur and extent of 
inequ around the world. 

6. Is inequ a necessari evil? some degre of inequ may not be a problem insofar a 
it provid the incent for peopl to excel, compete, save, and invest to move ahead in life. for 
example, return to educ and differenti in labor earn can spur human capit 
accumul and econom growth, despit be associ with high incom inequality. 
inequ can also influenc growth posit by provid incent for innov and 
entrepreneurship (lazear and rosen 1981), and, perhap especi relev for develop 
countries, by allow at least a few individu to accumul the minimum need to start 
busi and get a good educ (barro 2000). 

7. whi be rise inequ a concern? high and sustain level of inequality, especi 
inequ of opportun can entail larg social costs. entrench inequ of outcom can 
significantli undermin individuals’ educ and occup choices. further, inequ of 
outcom do not gener the “right” incent if it rest on rent (stiglitz 2012). In that event, 
individu have an incent to divert their effort toward secur favor treatment and 
protection, result in resourc misallocation, corruption, and nepotism, with attend advers 
social and econom consequences. In particular, citizen can lose confid in institutions, erod 
social cohes and confid in the future. 

8. incom distribut matter for growth. previou imf studi have found that incom 
inequ (a measur by the gini coefficient, which be 0 when everybodi have the same incom and 
1 when one person have all the income) neg affect growth and it sustain (ostry, berg, 
and tsangarid 2014; berg and ostri 2011). We build on thi analysi by examin how 
individuals’ incom share at variou point in the distribut matter for growth draw on a larg 
sampl of advanc economi and emdc (tabl 1).2 A high net gini coeffici (a measur of 


2 thi analysi be base on a sampl of 159 advanced, emerging, and develop economi for the period 1980– 
2012 use a simpl growth model (with time and countri fix effects) in which growth depend on initi incom

determinants, such a human and physic capital, do not affect our main findings. see annex for data sources.

inequ that net out tax and transfers) be associ with low output growth over the medium 
term, consist with previou findings. more importantly, we find an invers relationship between 
the incom share accru to the rich (top 20 percent) and econom growth. If the incom share of 
the top 20 percent increas by 1 percentag point, gdp growth be actual 0.08 percentag point 
low in the follow five years, suggest that the benefit do not trickl down. instead, a similar 
increas in the incom share of the bottom 20 percent (the poor) be associ with 0.38 percentag 
point high growth. thi posit relationship between dispos incom share and high growth 
continu to hold for the second and third quintil (the middl class). thi result surviv a varieti 
of robust checks, and be in line with recent find for a small sampl of advanc economi 
(oecd 2014). In the remaind of thi section, we discu potenti channel for whi high incom 
share for the poor and the middl class be growth-enhancing.

9. inequ affect growth drivers. 
whi would widen incom dispar matter 
for growth? higher inequ lower growth by 
depriv the abil of lower-incom 
household to stay healthi and accumul 
physic and human capit (galor and moav 
2004; aghion, caroli, and garcia-penalosa 
1999). for instance, it can lead to under- 
invest in educ a poor child end 
up in lower-qu school and be less abl to 
go on to college.3 As a result, labor product 
could be low than it would have be in a 
more equit world (stiglitz 2012). In the 
same vein, corak (2013) find that countri 
with high level of incom inequ tend to 
have low level of mobil between 
generations, with parent’ earn be a more import determin of children’ earn 
(figur 1). increas concentr of incom could also reduc aggreg demand and 
undermin growth, becaus the wealthi spend a low fraction of their incom than middle- and 
lower-incom groups.4 

10. inequ dampen investment, and henc growth, by fuel economic, financial, and 
polit instability. 

 financi crises. A grow bodi of evid suggest that rise influenc of the rich and 
stagnant incom of the poor and middl class have a causal effect on crises, and thu directli 
hurt short- and long-term growth.5 In particular, studi have argu that a prolong period of 
high inequ in advanc economi be associ with the global financi crisi by 
intensifi leverage, overextens of credit, and a relax in mortgage-underwrit 
standard (rajan 2010), and allow lobbyist to push for financi deregul (acemoglu 
2011). 

 global imbalances. higher top incom share coupl with financi liberalization, which itself 
could be a polici respons to rise incom inequality, be associ with substanti larg 


3 widen incom dispar can depress skill develop among individu with poorer parent educ 
background, both in term of the quantiti of educ attain (for example, year of schooling) and it qualiti (that 
is, skill proficiency). educ outcom of individu from richer backgrounds, however, be not affect by 
inequ (cingano 2014). 
4 see carvalho and rezai (2014) for a discuss of the empir and theoret underpin of thi assertion. 
5 In a theoret setting, kumhof and rancier (2010) and kumhof and other (2012) show that rise inequ 
enabl investor to increas their hold of financi asset back by loan to workers, result in rise debt-to- 
incom ratio and thu financi fragility. the latter can eventu lead to a financi crisis.

extern deficit (kumholf and other 2012). such larg global imbal can be challeng for 
macroeconom and/or financi stability, and thu growth (bernank 2011). 

 conflicts. extrem inequ may damag trust and social cohes and thu be also associ 
with conflicts, which discourag investment. conflict be particularli preval in the 
manag of common resourc where, for example, inequ make resolv disput 
more difficult; see, for example, bardhan (2005). more broadly, inequ affect the econom 
of conflict, a it may intensifi the grievanc felt by certain group or can reduc the 
opportun cost of initi and join a violent conflict (lichbach 1989). 

11. inequ can lead to polici that hurt growth. In addit to affect growth drivers, 
inequ could result in poor public polici choices. for example, it can lead to a backlash against 
growth-enhanc econom liber and fuel protectionist pressur against global and 
market-ori reform (claessen and perotti 2007). At the same time, enhanc power by the 
elit could result in a more limit provis of public good that boost product and growth, 
and which disproportion benefit the poor (putnam 2000; bourguignon and dessu 2009). 

12. inequ hamper poverti reduction. incom inequ affect the pace at which growth 
enabl poverti reduct (ravallion 2004). growth be less effici in lower poverti in countri 
with high initi level of inequ or in which the distribut pattern of growth favor the non- 
poor. moreover, to the extent that economi be period subject to shock of variou kind that 
undermin growth, high inequ make a great proport of the popul vulner to 
poverty. 

iii. styliz facts: what DO WE know about 
inequ OF outcom and opportunities? 
13. measur inequality. incom inequality—th most wide cite measur of inequ of 
outcomes—i typic measur by the market (gross) and net (after tax and transfer from social 
insur programs) gini, and by track chang in the incom share of the popul (for 
example, by decile/quintile). inform on the asset held by the wealthi offer a 
complementari perspect on monetari inequality. inequ of opportun be often measur 
by track health, educ and human develop outcom by incom group, or by examin 
access to basic servic and opportunities. In thi section, we document recent trend in both 
monetari and nonmonetari indic of inequ across a larg sampl of advanc and emdcs. 

inequ of outcomes: incom 

14. global inequ remain high. global inequ rang from 0.55 to 0.70 depend on 
the measur use (figur 2). the high level of global inequ reflect sizeabl per caput incom 
dispar across countries, which account for around three quarter of global inequ (milanov 
2013). some measur of global inequ exhibit a declin trend in the last few decad in 
respons to rise incom for those live in china and india, where hundr of million of peopl 
have be lift out of poverty. however, other measur of global incom inequality—adjust for

note: unweight inter-countri inequ (blue line) be calcul across gdp obtain from household survey of all 
countri in the world, without population-weighting. the population-weight inter-countri inequ (red line) take into 
account popul weights. finally, the global inequ concept (green dot line) focu on individuals, instead of 
countries. the calcul be base on household survey with data on individu incom or consumption. 


15. globally, the middl class and the top 1 percent have experienc the larg gains. 
examin chang in real incom between 1998 and 2008 at variou percentil of the global 
incom distribution, lakner and milanov (2013) show that the larg gain acru for the global 
median incom (50th percentile) earner and for the top 1 percent. thi coincid with the rapid 
growth of the middl class in mani emerg market economies, and the concentr of top 
earner in advanc economies, respectively. moreover, incom gain rapidli decreas after the 
50th percentil and becom stagnant around the 80th–90th global percentil befor shoot up 
for the global top 1 percent (krugman 2014). In what follows, we focu on recent trend in within- 
countri inequ which drive these global developments. 

16. widen incom inequ within countries. measur of inequ base on gini 
coeffici of gross and net incom have increas substanti sinc 1990 in most of the 
develop world (figur 3). inequality, on average, have remain stabl in emdcs, albeit at a much 
high level than observ in advanc economies. however, there be larg dispar across 
emdcs, with asia and eastern europ experi mark increas in inequality, and countri in 
latin america exhibit notabl declin (although the region remain the most unequ in the 
world).6 redistribution, gaug by the differ between market and net inequality, play an 
important, albeit partial, role in cushion market incom inequ in advanc economies. dure

17. incom decil under the microscope. chang in incom inequ across advanc 
economi and emdc have be driven by differ develop in incom share by deciles. 
figur 4 show that rise incom inequ (posit number on the vertic axes) in most 
advanc and mani emerg market economi have be driven primarili by the grow incom 
share of the top 10 percent (see also piketti and saez (2003) for the unit states). indeed, the top 
10 percent now have an incom close to nine time that of the bottom 10 percent. these effect have 
be magnifi by the crisi (oecd 2014). the stori be somewhat differ in emdcs. rise 
inequ for thi group of countri be primarili explain by a shift in incom of the “upper 
middl class to the upper class” (for example, in china and south africa). figur 4 show that in 
emdc with fall inequ (neg number on the vertic axis), the main beneficiari (that is, 
with the larg increas in their incom shares, show on the horizont axis) be those at both 
the bottom and the middl of the incom distribut (for example, peru and brazil). 

18. top 1 percent on the rise. the top 1 percent now account for around 10 percent of total 
incom in advanc economies. (figur 5; piketti and saez 2011; alvadero and others, 2013). while 
data on top incom share be scant for most emdcs, avail evid suggest that the share of 
top incom have risen in china and india. the grow share of the top 1 percent in advanc 
economi reflect both high inequ in labor incom a well a capit gains—return from

have be the declin share of middle-skil occup rel to low- and high-skil

middl class squeez in some countri reflect incom polar (duclos, esteban, and ray 2004;

23. inequ be more extrem in wealth 
than income. In both advanc economi and 
emdcs, incom ginis, on average, be half the 
size of wealth gini (figur 11). possibl 
explan for the high wealth gini includ 
stagnant wage growth, which make it difficult 
for middle- and lower-incom worker to set 
asid money for saving, and a low propens 
to consum by the rich.8 while mani studi 
suggest that grow wealth inequ in

area in china to inequ among class and

24. inequ in health outcom be widespread in develop economies. while health 
outcom be broadli similar across incom group in advanc countries, larg dispar exist in

in the rich household (in term of wealth) in emerg market economies. similarly, femal 
mortal rate tend to be disproportion high for lower-incom groups. 

25. inequ in health care access and use be more pervas in develop countries. 
commonli use indic to gaug access and use of health care be gener favor in 
advanc countries, irrespect of the incom level of the population. for emdcs, however, data on

educ outcom remain much bad for disadvantag groups, partli becaus of pro-rich

technolog chang can disproportion rais the demand for capit and skill labor over 
low-skil and unskil labor by elimin mani job through autom or upgrad the skill 
level requir to attain or keep those job (card and dinardo 2002; acemoglu 1998). indeed, 
technolog advanc have be found to have contribut the most to rise incom inequ in 
oecd countries, account for nearli a third of the widen gap between the 90th and the 10th 
percentil earner over the last 25 year (oecd 2011). evid from larg emerg market 
economi also show a similar trend of a grow earn gap between high- and low-skil 
worker despit a larg rise in the suppli of highli educ labor (which should reduc the gap). 


30. trade globalization: two side of a coin. trade have be an engin for growth in mani 
countri by promot competit and enhanc efficiency. nonetheless, high trade and 
financi flow between countries, partli enabl by technolog advances, be commonli cite a 
drive incom inequ (figur 16). In advanc economies, the abil of firm to adopt labor- 
save technolog and offshor have be cite a an import driver of the declin in 
manufactur and rise skill premium (feenstra and hanson 1996, 1999, 2003). trade open 
could potenti have mix effect on the wage of unskil labor in advanc countries. It rais 
the skill premium, but could also increas real wage by lower (import) price (munch and 
skaksen 2009). At the same time, increas trade flow could low incom inequ in emdc by 
increas demand and wage for abund lower-skil workers. thus, disentangl the impact of 
trade on inequ be challeng a it depend on rel factor abund and product 
differ across countries, and the extent to which individu obtain incom from wage or

31. financi globalization. financi global can facilit effici intern 
alloc of capit and promot intern risk sharing. At the same time, increas financi 
flows, particularli foreign direct invest (fdi) and portfolio flow have be show to increas 
incom inequ in both advanc and emerg market economi (freeman 2010). one potenti 
explan be the concentr of foreign asset and liabil in rel high skill- and 
technology-intens sectors, which push up the demand for and wage of high skill workers. 
In addition, fdi could induc skill-specif technolog change, be associ with skill-specif 
wage bargaining, and result in more train for skill than unskil worker (willem te veld 
2003). moreover, low-skill, outward fdi from advanc economi may in effect be rel high- 
skilled, inward fdi in develop economi (figini and görg 2011), thu exacerb the demand 
for high-skil worker in recipi countries. financi deregul and global have also 
be cite a factor underli the increas in financi wealth, rel skill intensity, and wage in 
the financ industry, one of the fast grow sector in advanc economi (phillipon and 
reshef 2012; furceri and loungani 2013). 

32. financi deepening. financi deepen can provid household and firm with great 
access to resourc to meet their financi needs, such a save for retirement, invest in 
education, capit on busi opportunities, and confront shocks. financi deepen 
accompani by more inclus financi system can thu low incom inequality, while improv

develop could benefit the rich in the earli stage of development, but the benefit becom 
more broadli share a economi develop (greenwood and jovanov 1990). indeed, some studi 
have found that financi development, measur a the rel share of the bank and stock 
market sector in the economy, boost top incom the most in the earli stage of develop 
(roine, vlachos, and waldenström 2009). moreover, inequ can increas a those with high

increas the skill premium, and potenti the return to capit (claessen and perotti 2007).

more flexibl labor market institut can foster 
econom dynam by realloc resourc to 
more product firm and enabl firm 
restructuring. however, great flexibl can 
pose challeng for workers, especi those 
with low skills, and henc play an import role 
in explain inequ develop (alvadero 
and other 2013). A declin in trade union 
membership (union rate) could reduc the 
rel bargain power of labor, exacerb 
wage inequ (frederiksen and poulsen 2010; 
wilkinson and pickett 2010; figur 17).9 jaumott 
and osorio-buitron (2015) and forthcom imf 
work find that a reduct in the minimum wage 
rel to the median wage be associ with high inequ in advanc economies, while a 
declin in union rate be strongli associ with the rise of top incom shares. moreover, 
some studi have point to the role of wage dispers and a high share of part-tim and 
temporari employ in drive inequ in labor earn in some advanc economi (oecd 
2012). for mani labor market policies, such a reform to employ protect legislation, the 
impact on inequ be less clear cut a they affect both the dispers of earn and the level of 
employ in sometim conflict ways.10 In mani emdcs, the combin of rigid hire and 
fire and employ protect regul and weak incom protect system often 
encourag informality, fuel wage inequality. however, evid from a larg sampl of countri 
suggest that de facto labor market regul (such a minimum wages, unionization, and social 
secur contributions), on average, tend to improv the incom distribut (calderón and chong 
2009; oecd 2011). 

34. redistribut policies. govern in advanc economi have histor mitig 
inequ through public policy—primarili progress tax and social transfer such a public 
retir benefit (cbo 2011). however, mani advanc countri have now see an increas in 
net incom inequality, indic gap in exist tax-and-transf system to counteract rise 
market inequality. the progress of tax system have declin in some advanc economi over 
the past few decades, with the result be that high-incom household and corpor now face 


9 there be a differ between coverag rate of collect bargain agreement and union densiti becaus in mani 
advanc economi multi-employ bargain and public polici extend the negoti contract to 
nonorgan firm guarante coverag rate in excess of densiti rates. 
10 stronger labor market institut could increas unemploy rates, reduc the wage differenti between high- 
skill and low-skil workers, and affect the labor share of income. the overal impact on incom inequality, however, 
can be ambiguous: they increas unemployment, which tend to rais inequality, they can reduc wage dispersion, 
which tend to low it, and they increas the wage share, which can have an ambigu effect on inequality.

size and progress of these transfers. 

35. education. educ can play an 
import role in reduc incom inequality, 
a it determin occup choice, access 
to jobs, and the level of pay, and play a 
pivot role a a signal of abil and product in the job market. from a theoret perspective, 
the human capit model of incom distribut (mincer, 1958; becker and chiswick, 1966) suggest 
that while there be an unambigu posit associ between educ and incom 
inequality, the effect of increas educ attain on incom inequ could be either 
posit or neg depend on the evolut of rate of return to educ (that is, the skill 
premium). moreover, there can be oppos forc at play stem from “composition” (that is, 
increas the share of high-wag earners) and “wage compression” (that is, declin in the return to 
high educ rel to low levels) effects. overall, the evid suggest that the inequ 
impact of educ depend on variou factors, such a the size of educ invest by 
individu and govern and the rate of return on these investments. It be in thi spirit that rajan 
(2015) note that “prosper seem increasingli unreach for many, becaus a good education, 
which seem to be today’ passport to riches, be unafford for mani in the middl class.”

approach with year and countri fix effects, we investig the driver of within countri chang in 
incom inequ for a sampl of almost 100 advanc economi and emdc over the period 
1980–2012 (see box 1 for empir specification). In contrast to other studies, we focu on a larg 
group of countri to ass whether the determin of inequ vari across advanced, emerg 
market and develop economies, and across differ measur of inequality. In addit to the 
gini coeffici of both market and net inequality, we build on our earli result that the incom 
distribut itself matter for growth by examin the determin of the dispos incom 
share (after tax) of the poor (bottom 10 percent), the middle-class (fifth decile), and the rich (top 10 
percent). thi allow u to focu on the factor drive incom concentr in recent years, 
especi chang in the incom share of the poor and the middl class. 

37. driver of gross and net inequality. tabl 2 (column 1 and 2) present the result of the 
regress analysi for gross and net inequality. our result on the role of global and 
technolog progress in drive inequ be broadli in line with the find in the literature. In 
particular, trade open be associ with low inequ (albeit not in a statist signific 
way), while great financi open and technolog progress be associ with rise incom 
inequality, like reflect the fact these disproportion benefit high-tech and labor-skil 
sectors. indeed, we find that financi global and technolog progress be associ with an 
increas in the top 10 percent dispos incom share across all countri (column 3). 

38. differenti impact of financi deepen across countri groups. the impact of 
financi deepening, a proxi by the ratio of privat credit to gdp, on both market and net 
inequ vari across advanc economi and emdcs, in line with roine, vlachos, and 
waldenström 2009. In particular, our result 
suggest that financi deepen be associ 
with high incom inequ in emdcs. thi 
like reflect the fact that while financi 
deepen have acceler over the past two 
decades, the record on financi inclus 
may not have kept apac in these countries. 
indeed, figur 19 indic that financi 
deepen be associ with high market 
and net incom inequ in countri with 
low level of financi inclus (typic 
emdcs), possibl reflect that larg 
amount of credit be often concentr 
among the larg firm and wealthier 
households. By contrast, financi deepen 
be associ with less of an increas in 
market inequ (and low net inequality) 
in advanc economies, reflect easi 
access to credit for household and firms.

take the valu of 1 for advanc economies, and zero otherwise. given data limitations, and in line with

world econom forum that measur the extent by which regul govern fire and hiring, collect

between incom differenti and the quantiti of skill in these countries, like reflect larg 
differ in factor endow and capac to absorb new technolog across emdc (behar

40. eas of labor market regul be associ with high market inequ and 
incom share of the top 10 percent. In particular, a declin in organ labor institut and the 
result eas of labor market measur by an increas in labor market flexibl index by 8½ 
percent—from the median to 60th percentile—i associ with rise market inequ by 1.1 
percent. the relationship between the top 10th percentil incom share and eas of labor market 
regul be also posit and statist signific (column 3) for our sampl of countries, like 
reflect the fact that labor market flexibl benefit the rich and reduc the bargain power of 
lower-incom workers. thi result confirm jaumott and osorio-buitron (2015) and forthcom 
imf work which find that weaken of union be associ with a high top 10 percent incom 
share for a small sampl of advanc economies.14 indeed, empir estim use more 
detail data for oecd countri (not report here, but avail upon request) suggest that, in 
line with jaumott and osorio-buitron (2015) and forthcom imf work, more lax hire and fire 
regulations, low minimum wage rel to the median wage, and less preval collect 
bargain and trade union be associ with high market inequality. the impact of labor 
market institut on inequality, however, be somewhat blunt by govern action a show by 
the statist insignific coeffici in the net gini regress (tabl 2, column 2). 

41. govern action can contribut to great equality. In particular, we find that an 
increas in our proxi for govern redistribut spend rel to total spend by 7.1 
percent (that is, a shift from the median valu to the 60th percentile) be associ with a 0.6 percent 
decreas in incom inequality. while total govern spend can be a poor proxi for the 
progress of tax-transf systems, thi result continu to hold for other measur of 
redistribut for a small sampl of oecd countri (not report here, but avail upon 
request), suggest that the composit of govern spend be import for reduc 
inequality.15 moreover, healthier societies, a proxi by a low femal mortal rate, tend to have 
low incom inequality. while causal be difficult to establish, the latter find suggest that 
great and more equal access to qualiti health servic allow peopl to be more productive, thu 
lower incom disparities. 

42. overal contributor to chang in inequality. base on the estim models, the 
contribut of the variou factor to the chang in the market gini coeffici can be calculated.16 


14 thi find be also in line with recent research that find that wage inequ fall dure period when union 
densiti be increas and rise when union membership be in declin (world bank 2013). 
15 joumard, pisu, and bloch (2012) look at the role of tax and transfer while oecd (2012b) look at how educ

intern monetari fund 27 

We find that less-regul labor markets, financi deepening, and technolog progress larg 
explain the rise in market incom inequ in our full sampl over the last 30 year (figur 20). 
global (that is, financi openness) have play a small but reinforc role, while 
improv in health outcom mitig around ½ percent of the almost 3 percentag point 
averag increas in the gini coefficient. the rel import of the skill premium, globalization, 
technolog progress, and financi deepen in drive inequality, however, vari across 
advanc economi and emdcs. 


43. what have be drive incom share of the poor and the middl class? given the 
import of the poor (bottom 10 percent) and the middl class for boost growth, we 
investig what explain chang in the incom share for these incom group across differ 
countries. On average, the incom share of the poor and the middl class have risen much more 
slowli than that of the top 10 percent, which explain the rise incom inequ observ in mani 
countries. look more close into the determin (tabl 2, column 4 and 5, and figur 21), we 
find: 

 better access to educ (a captur by declin educ inequality), improv health 
outcomes, and redistribut social polic help rais the incom share of the poor and the 
middl class irrespect of the level of econom develop of a country.17 By contrast, 
eas of labor market regul and technolog progress dampen the incom share of the 
poor and the middl class, consist with other studies. thi result be not surprising, sinc the 
poor be often disproport employ in lower-pay and less secur job (often in the 
inform sector) and tend to benefit more from labor market regul such a minimum 
wage and fire restrictions. thi point to the polici role of make educ more access 
(bruckner, dabla-norris, and gradstein 2015), while ensur that chang in labor market

 there be import differ in inequ driver between advanc economi and emdcs, 
suggest the need to tailor polici to country-specif conditions. In particular, we find that 
financi deepen have play a role in rais the incom share of the poor and the middl

and the extent of financi inclusion. In contrast, reduc gap in access to educ have be 
one of the most import driver of high incom share for the bottom 10 percent and the 
middl class in emdcs. A complementari way to look at the incom share of the poor be to 
examin the driver of the interplay between inequ and the poverti rate—defin a the 
popul live below $2 a day (box 2). our find suggest that great equal in access to 
educ lift the poverti elast of econom growth. 

 financi global and a high skill premium have account for a more signific share of 
the widen incom gap between the top 10 percent and the poor and the middl class in

box 2. driver of poverti 

anoth way to look at the incom share of the poor be to examin the driver of poverti rate—defin a the 
popul live below $2 a day (ppp-adjusted)—and look at the interplay between poverti and inequality. 
the literatur point to variou sourc for poverti reduction, includ high econom growth (kraay 2006) 
and a rise in the incom share of the poor (ravallion 2004). A larg strand of the literatur also explor how 
inequ affect poverti reduct via it growth impact; see for example, bourguignon (2003) and fosu 
(2010). 

use a sampl of almost 100 emdc for the period 1985–2010, we investig what be behind the declin 
share of peopl live below the $2 a day poverti line over the last 30 years. follow bourguignon (2003), we 
first investig the import of inequ and growth on poverti reduction. our result suggest that while 
the impact of the chang in inequality, a measur by the gini, do not appear to be signific per se, 
high initi inequ lower the growth elast of poverti reduct (tabl 3, column 1). moreover, a 
high initi level of educ inequ dampen the growth elast of poverty, while a high 
employ growth in manufacturing, a see in emerg market economi in asia for instance, be 
associ with a low share of the popul live below the poverti line (column 2). We also find that 
great trade open can amplifi the growth elast of poverty, albeit not in a statist signific way, 
while financi open amplifi it in a signific way (column 3).

44. caveats. We should of cours be cautiou about draw definit polici implic from 
cross-countri regress analysis, a differ polici be like to have vari effect across 
countri and at differ point in time. measur limit in compar inequ across 
time and countri also need to be considered. In addition, it be hard to go from the sort of 
correl present in the note to firm statement about causal a there can be a two-way 
causal run from growth-to-incom inequality. indeed, in-depth country-specif analysi 
suggest that a number of inter-rel factor drive growth, the incom level, and incom inequality. 
despit these limitations, our analysi point to a polici role for tackl inequality. 

V. polici discuss and final remark 
45. No one-size-fits-all. policymak around the world need to consid polici to tackl 
inequality. rais the incom share of the poor, and ensur that there be no hollowing-out of the 
middl class be actual good for growth. our empir analysi also suggest that the driver of 
inequ and their impact differ across countri for differ incom groups. As such, the natur of 
appropri polici would necessarili vari across countries, and would also need to take into 
account country-specif polici and institut settings, and capacity/implement constraints. 
recent work by the world bank (2015) also highlight the import of adopt a psycholog 
and social perspect on policymak that take into account what polici be implement and 
how. 

46. squar equiti and effici concerns. lower incom inequ do not need to 
come at the cost of low efficiency. previou imf work have show that there do not need to be a 
stark efficiency-equ tradeoff (ostry, berg, and tsangarid 2014). redistribut through the tax 
and transfer system be found to be posit relat to growth for most countries, and be neg 
relat to growth onli for the most strongli redistribut countries. thi suggest that the effect of 
redistribut on enhanc opportun for lower-incom household and on social and polit 
stabil could potenti outweigh ani neg effect on growth through a damp of incentives. 

47. fiscal polici can be an import tool for reduc inequality. fiscal polici play a 
critic role in ensur macrofinanci stabil and can thu help avert/minim crisi that 
disproportion hurt the disadvantag population. At the same time, fiscal redistribution, carri 
out in a manner that be consist with other macroeconom objectives, can help rais the incom 
share of the poor and middl class, and thu support growth. fiscal polici alreadi play a signific 
role in address incom inequ in mani advanc economies, but the redistribut role of 
fiscal polici could be reinforc by great relianc on wealth and properti taxes, more progress 
incom taxation, remov opportun for tax avoid and evasion, good target of social 
benefit while also minim effici costs, in term of incent to work and save (imf 2014a). 
In addition, reduc tax expenditur that benefit high-incom group most and remov tax 
relief—such a reduc taxat of capit gains, stock options, and carri interest—would increas 
equiti and allow a growth-enhanc cut in margin labor incom tax rate in some countries. In 
emdcs, good access to educ and health services, well-target condit cash transfer and 
more effici safeti net can have a posit impact on dispos incom of the poor (bastagli, 
coadi and gupta 2012). In mani cases, thi increas public spend would need to be 



inequality: caus and consequ 

intern monetari fund 31 

undertaken in tandem with rise revenu mobilization, reduc tax loopholes, and tax evasion, and 
low less- well-target spend (such a oil subsidies). 

48. educ polici be key. In a world in which technolog chang be increas 
product and simultan mechan jobs, rais skill level be critic for reduc the 
dispers of earnings. improv educ quality, elimin financi barrier to high 
education, and provid support for apprenticeship program be all key to boost skill level in 
both tradabl and nontrad sectors. these polici can also help improv the incom prospect 
of futur gener a educ individu be good abl to cope with technolog and other 
chang that directli influenc product levels. In advanc economies, with an alreadi high 
share of secondari or tertiari graduat among the working-ag population, polici that improv 
the qualiti of upper secondari or tertiari educ would be important. In develop countri 
with current low level of educ attainment, polici that promot more equal access to basic 
educ (for example, cash transfer aim at encourag good attend at primari schools, 
or spend on public educ that benefit the poor) could help reduc inequ by facilit 
the accumul of human capital, and make educ opportun less depend on socio- 
econom circumstances. 

49. foster financi inclus safely. financi deepen in emdc need to be 
accompani by great inclus to make a dent in inequality. govern have a central role to 
play in allevi impedi to financi inclus by creat the associ legal and regulatori 
framework (for example, protect creditor rights, regul busi conduct, and overse 
recours mechan to protect consumers), support the inform environ (for example, 
set standard for disclosur and transpar and promot credit information-shar system 
and collater registries), and educ and protect consumers. countri experi also 
suggest that polici such a grant exempt from oner document requirements, 
requir bank to offer basic accounts, and allow correspond bank be use in foster 
inclusion. the promot of credit without suffici regard for financi stability, however, can result 
in crises, a evid by the subprim mortgag crisi in the unit states, with disproportion 
advers effect on the poor and the middl class. moreover, it illustr the broader point that deep 
social issu cannot be resolv pure with an infus of credit. polici thu need to strike a 
balanc between foster prudenc stability, and inclusion, while encourag innov and 
creativity. 

50. well-design labor market polici and institut can reduc inequality, and, at the 
same time, not be a drag on efficiency. polici that reduc labor market imperfect and 
institut failur that affect job creation can help support poor and middle-incom workers. for 
instance, appropri set minimum wages, spend on well-design activ labor market polici 
aim at support job search and skill match can be important. better use of in-work benefit 
for social benefit recipi also help reduc incom disparities. moreover, polici that reduc labor 
market dualism, such a gap in employ protect between perman and temporari 
workers—especi young worker and immigrants—can help to reduc inequality, while foster 
great market flexibility. more generally, labor market polici should attempt to avoid either 
excess regul or extrem disregard for labor conditions. labor market rule that be veri 



caus and consequ OF inequ

weak or program that be nonexist can leav problem of poor information, unequ power, and 
inadequ risk manag untreated, penal the poor and the middl class (world bank 
2012). In contrast, excess stringent regul can compound market imperfect with 
institut failures, and weigh on job creation and efficiency. 

51. In emdcs, make labor market more inclus and creat incent for lower 
inform be a key challenge. worker in these countri often lack equal access to product job 
opportun and do not benefit evenli from econom growth. mani individu with low skills, in 
particular, remain trap in precari jobs, often in the inform and unregul economy. In 
such jobs, even full-tim employ tend to be insuffici to lift household out of poverty. thus, 
creat accessible, productive, and reward job be key to escap poverti and reduc 
inequality. inform worker need to have the necessari legal, financial, and educ mean to 
access formal sector employment. higher formal sector employ also requir good incent 
for firm to becom formal. polici to reduc tax, financial, and regulatori constraint can expand 
formal sector employ by reduc the incent for firm to oper informally, both by 
increas the benefit of particip in the formal sector and by reduc the cost of do so 
(dabla-norri and inchaust 2008). 

52. complementar between growth and incom equal objectives. reform aim at 
rais averag live standard can also influenc the distribut of income. indeed, tackl 
inequ go beyond the remit of labor, social welfare, financi inclusion, and tax policies. the key 
to minim the downsid of both global and technolog chang in advanc economi 
be a polici agenda of a race to the top, instead of a race to the bottom—an agenda that includ 
polici to encourag innovation, reduc burdensom product market regul that stifl 
competit and technolog diffusion, move good produc upward in the valu chain, and 
ensur that thi rise benefit everyone. In develop countries, rais agricultur productivity, 
rapid accumul of capital, and technolog diffus in labor-intens sector can substanti 
lift growth and ensur that the fruit of prosper be more broadli share (dabla-norri and other 
2013). sustain growth in emerg market economi will requir more intens pattern of 
growth, great flexibl to shift resourc within and across sectors, and the capac to appli 
more knowledg and skill-intens product techniques. polici to improv skill for all, to 
ensur that a nation’ infrastructur meet it needs, and to encourag innov and technolog 
adopt be thu all essenti to drive growth and ensur a more inclus prosperity.
