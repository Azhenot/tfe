or the moment, microwav photon be 

the key to mani quantum computers: 

physicist use them to program, read 

out, and otherwis manipul the ma- 

chines’ quantum bits. but microwav 

technolog be bulky, and it quantum 

state don’t last veri long. now, sever 

group be explor a new way to talk to 

a quantum computer: with tini vibrations, 

normal carrier of peski heat and noise. 

the bud disciplin of quantum acous- 

tic could shake up embryon quantum 

comput by miniatur technolog 

and produc longer-last quantum mem- 

ories. “we’r right on the cusp” of control 

quantum vibrations, say andrew cleland, a 

physicist at the univers of chicago in il- 

linois, whose group present it late work 

last week here at the annual march meet 

of the american physic society. 

wherea an ordinari comput flip bit 

that can be set to either zero or one, a quan- 

tum comput us qubit that can be set 

to zero, one, or, bizarrely, zero and one at 

the same time—potenti enabl huge 

boost in speed. compani such a googl 

and ibm be race to demonstr the su- 

perior of quantum comput for certain 

task (science, 2 decemb 2016, p. 1090), 

and mani be bet on qubit make of 

superconduct metal circuit on chips. 

To control or read out a superconduct 

qubit, research make it interact with a 

microwav resonator—typ a strip of 

metal on the qubit chip or a finger-s cav- 

iti surround it—which ring with micro- 

wave photon the way an organ pipe ring 

with sound. By adjust the energi of the 

qubit, research can shuttl it quantum 

state into the resonator, so that a zero-and- 

one state of the qubit can be store a a state 

of the reson in which a photon be both 

present and absent. but some physicist

that could be begin to change. In 

2016, the world health organ add 

lassa fever to it new list of prioriti patho- 

gen of epidem potential, call for more 

research. and last week, the recent cre- 

ate coalit for epidem prepared 

innovations, know a cepi, award it 

first grant for develop of a lassa fever 

vaccin to themi bioscienc in vienna. 

lassa fever be discov in 1969, 

when two missionari nurs die of a 

mysteri diseas in the remot town of 

lassa in borno state in northeastern ni- 

geria. when a third nurs fell ill, she be 

evacu to a hospit in new york city— 

along with a thermo full of blood and 

other sampl from all three nurses, bound 

for yale university’ then-new arboviru 

research unit. there, a team lead by jordi 

casals-ariet isol a novel viru from the 

samples. (he, too, almost die in the pro- 

cess, save onli by an infus of antibody- 

rich plasma from the third 

nurse, who recovered.) 

the caus be now know 

to be an arenavirus, one 

of a class of rodent-born 

pathogens. it natur res- 

ervoir be a multimamm 

rat, so-cal for it row 

of mammari glands, that 

be ubiquit across west 

africa. case peak in the 

dri season, when farmer 

burn the bush in prepa- 

ration for spring plant- 

ing and rat scurri into 

hous in search of food. the rodent shed 

the viru in their urin and droppings, and 

peopl contract it by touch contamin 

surfaces, inhal viral particles, or eat 

contamin food (includ the rats). like 

ebola, the viru can also be spread through 

contact with bodili fluid from an infect 

person. such human-to-human transmiss 

be thought to be rare for lassa, unlik ebola, 

except in hospit set without proper 

infect control. however, “the real rate of 

human-to-human transmiss be unknown,” 

say augustin augier, secretari gener of 

alima in paris, which have just launch 

a lassa fever research program with the 

french medic institut inserm. 

No one know the true incid of the 

disease. “most case we have found be in 

place where there be hospit and labs,” 

günther says. “there be good reason to as- 

sume there be case that be be over- 

looked.” and becaus the rat vector life 

across a broad swath of the continent, 

the diseas might also be endemic, but 

unrecognized, outsid of west africa, 

where it could be respons for un- 

diagnos fevers. 

initi symptom be easili mistaken for 

malaria or typhoid fever—bodi aches, sore 

throat, fever, nausea, diarrhea—befor the 

diseas progress to organ failure, shock, 

and sometim intern hemorrhaging. By 

the time doctor suspect lassa fever, it’ of- 

ten too late to save the patient. there be no 

rapid test; accur diagnos the dis- 

eas requir a real-tim polymeras chain 

reaction technique, but just three lab in 

nigeria have that capability. 

for now, the onli treatment be a non- 

specif antivir drug, ribavirin. If it’ ad- 

minist dure the first 6 day of the 

illness, it seem to improv a patient’ prog- 

nosis, but “no one arriv befor day 7,” 

augier says. nor be everyon convinc that 

ribavirin work in lassa fever, a the onli 

data come from the 1980s, augier says. 

sever potenti drug be on the horizon, 

in addit to the vaccine. christian happi 

at redeemer’ univers in ede, nigeria, 

and the irrua specialist 

teach hospit be de- 

velop a rapid diagnos- 

tic test with colleagu at 

tulan univers in new 

orleans, louisiana; the 

broad institut in cam- 

bridge, massachusetts; 

and zalgen, a compani in 

germantown, maryland. 

happi’ group and it 

partner be also sequenc- 

ing the viru “around the 

clock,” he says, and tri 

to figur out whether the 

genet chang they have see could have 

make it more transmiss or virulent. 

for happi, who diagnos sierra le- 

one’ first case of ebola, the new attent 

to lassa hasn’t come a moment too soon. 

“I use to scream and scream that lassa 

be important, but no one listened,” he says. 

“I write so mani grants” that be turn 

down. “lassa fever be a diseas of the poor 

… it be confin to a part of west africa, 

and it be not view a a global threat.” 

As research scale up, the govern 

and it partner be focu on train 

health care worker and provid the ba- 

sic need for infect control, a well

safeti precautions.

see advantag to replac the microwav 

reson with a mechan one that ring 

with quantiz vibrations, or phonons. 

that effort may seem daft, a such vi- 

bration constitut heat, which obliter 

delic quantum states. but when work- 

ing at temperatur near absolut zero, 

a well-design acoust reson could 

ring longer than a microwav one does, en- 

abl it to act a a sort of quantum mem- 

ory, say robert schoelkopf, a physicist at 

yale university. the vibrat also have 

wavelength less than a thousandth a 

long a microwav of the same frequency, 

so the reson can be far more compact, 

he says. 

first, physicist must learn to control 

quantum vibrations. they take a first step 

in 2010, when cleland, then at the univer- 

siti of california, santa barbara (ucsb), si- 

phone everi phonon out of an oscil 

cantilev etch from aluminum nitride, 

leav it in it least energet quantum 

ground state. however, that simpl quan- 

tum state persist for just 5 nanoseconds, 

too littl time to put the devic into more 

complex quantum state of motion. 

To push further, sever group be ma- 

nipul rippl call surfac acoust 

wave (saws), which travel along a mate- 

rial’ surface. On top of a microchip, the 

research etch two grate of metal 

stripe just micromet apart. In the gap 

between the gratings, the research trig- 

ger a wave by appli a voltag to a comb- 

shape devic call a transducer, which 

caus the materi to contract. the grat- 

ing act a mirrors, reflect saw of par- 

ticular wavelength back and forth so that 

they reson in the gap. and by connect- 

ing the transduc to a superconduct 

qubit, research link it quantum state 

to the saws. 

use that approach, cleland and kevin 

satzinger, a ucsb graduat student, fash- 

ion a reson on a lithium niobat chip 

that rang for up to 150 nanoseconds. they 

show they could creat ani desir com- 

binat of zero and one phonon in the 

resonator, satzing told the meeting. “we 

can watch the energi go back and forth” 

between qubit and cavity, he says. 

research in schoelkopf ’s group be 

focu not on wave trap on a chip’ 

surface, but on vibrat travel through 

the chip’ bulk material. they exploit vibra- 

tion that can bounc between the upper 

and low surfac of the half-millimeter- 

thick chip beneath their qubit. 

use that geometry, the research- 

er kept vibrat in their sapphir chip 

ring for up to 60 microseconds, yale’ 

yiwen chu told the meeting. moreover, the 

research could feed up to seven quantum 

of vibrat one by one into the resonator, 

she reported. make more complex quan- 

tum state be “realli the next step,” chu 

says. for example, she says, they might tri 

to put the reson into a schrödinger cat 

state, in which it would contain a macro- 

scopic sound wave, compris mani vi- 

bration quanta, and at the same time be 

devoid of vibrations. 

acoust reson could offer more flex- 

ibil in quantum circuit designs. In some 

circuits, multipl qubit be link to the 

same microwav resonator, which act a 

a conduit for the qubit interactions. but 

most microwav caviti can onli host pho- 

ton of a singl frequency. In that case, all 

the qubit must interact with one anoth 

in an interconnect tangle, say konrad 

lehnert, a physicist at jila, an institut 

run jointli by the univers of colorado in 

boulder and the nation institut of stan- 

dard and technology. 

In contrast, acoust reson can en- 

abl qubit to interact with vibrat of 

a few different, close space frequencies. 

that should make it possibl to tailor the 

interact among the qubits, so that, for 

example, onli near neighbor interact— 

desir for model certain abstract 

quantum systems, lehnert says. He and hi 

colleagu have take a step toward such 

control, jila’ bradley moor told the 

meeting, by show that they could simul- 

taneous coupl a singl qubit to saw of 

sever frequencies. 

quantum acoust might also help solv 

a major problem for emerg quantum 

technologies. microwav cabl can shuttl 

inform within a quantum computer. To 

move it to other experi or distant loca- 

tions, however, those signal will like need 

to be convert from microwav to optic 

photons, which can travel great distanc 

in optic fibers. acoust wave rippl at 

microwav frequenc have wavelength 

similar to those of optic photons. So in prin- 

ciple, they could serv a a bridg to translat 

between the two, research say, although 

nobodi yet know exactli how to do it. 

acoust reson might even test the 

bound of the quantum realm. quantum 

theori allow tini thing like atom or pho- 

ton to be in two place at once, but nobodi 

have ever see such behavior in a macroscop 

materi object. some theorist argu that a 

yet-unknown principle, perhap involv 

gravity, would prevent it from happen 

for larg objects. but chu say it might be 

possibl to make her group’ sapphir chip 

simultan vibrat in opposit direc- 

tions. that would put ten of microgram 

of materi in two slightli differ place 

at the same time—and test whether quan- 

tum weird extend almost to the human 

scale. “you don’t know until you try.” j 

micrometer-s acoust 

reson (orange) 

trap vibrat that can 

control quantum bits.
