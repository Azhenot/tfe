rat be nimbl navigators, abl to find their way around, under, and over obstacles, and through the tightest spaces. roboticist 

have long dream of give their creation similar navig skills. To be use in the real world, robot must be abl to find their 

way around on their own. some be alreadi learn to do that in 

, 

, 

, and 

—and in the case of 

, entir cities. despit that progress, robot still struggl to perform the task for which they’r design even under mildli 

challeng conditions.

At the , in brisbane, australia, 

and hi collabor have spent the past 14 year hone a robot 

navig system model on the brain of rats. thi biologically-inspir approach, they hope, could help robot navig dynam 

environ without requir advanced, costli sensor and computationally-intens algorithms.
