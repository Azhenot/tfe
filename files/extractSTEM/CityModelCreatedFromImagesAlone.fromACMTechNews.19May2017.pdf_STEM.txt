eth scientist have combin million of imag and video into a 
three-dimensional, live model of the citi of zurich. the new 
technolog have mani possibl applic – for example, it can 
analys where and when pedestrian be on the move and park 
space becom free.

research at eth zurich have develop a technolog platform with 
which they can creat 3D citi model use imag data alone. the 
platform, know a "varcity", be so versatil that it can use, evaluate, and 
automat combin all possibl kind of imag sources: aerial 
photographs, 360-degre panoram imag take with special vehicles, 
and even standard photo such a those publish by tourist on social 
network and internet platforms. the technolog also us video materi 
from sourc like youtub and public webcams. 

thank to machin learn algorithms, the technolog can recognis 
imag content such a buildings, window and doors, streets, bodi of 
water, people, and cars. without human assistance, the 3D model 
"knows", for example, what pavement be and – by evalu webcam 
data – which street be one-way only. 

"bring citi model to life" 
"the whole thing go so far that we can perform a highli detail analysi 
of traffic flow on the street and also measur pedestrian traffic, even in 
real time depend on the application," explain hayko riemenschneider, 
a postdoc and varciti project manag in the group lead by luc van gool, a 
professor at eth zurich' comput vision lab. thi make count 
traffic extrem easy: it can be do exclus with camera and no 
longer requir sensor to be instal on the road. 

use machin learn algorithms, the 

model can differenti between build- 

ings, streets, vegetation, and bodi of 

water. (visualisation: eth zurich) 

the model also recognis façad

"our technolog be dynamic. It bring life, peopl and vehicl to 3D citi 
models, which be one of it major advantag over well-known applic 
such a googl street view," say riemenschneider. the technolog be 
also devis in line with the principl of "privaci by design", with the 
algorithm gener anonymis inform base on imag data. 
pedestrian flow and vehicl traffic can be show by avatars, make 
varciti compat with data privacy. 

larg volum of data evalu 
the research develop the comput algorithm for the model over the 
past five year a part of a european research council (erc) project (an 
erc advanc grant receiv by eth professor van gool). To showcas 
their work, they have creat a 3D model of the citi of zurich, which they 
be now present in a video a they wrap up the project on schedule. 

the varciti technolog be base on the evalu of huge volum of 
data. "the more imag and video the platform can evaluate, the more 
precis the model becomes," say kenneth vanhoey, a postdoc in van 
gool' group. "the aim of our project be to develop the algorithm for 
such 3D citi models, assum that the volum of avail imag and 
video will also increas dramat in the year ahead." 

the scientist use triangul to creat a three-dimension model from 
imag data. thi requir sever pictur of an object from variou 
angles; an analysi of the distanc and angl in the variou imag then 
allow the corner point of the object to be precis locat in the relev 
space. 

simpl park manag technolog 
the research be not offer the model themselv a an application, 
but the technolog behind them have mani possibl applications, includ 
in urban and transport planning. the project particip have found 
sever startup to market these applications: spectando offer virtual 
build inspect for the real estat market, while casalva perform 
virtual damag analysi on build for insur companies, for 
exampl after extrem weather event such a hailstorms. No special

devic be requir for these applic – standard smartphon photo 
be sufficient. 

eth spin-off parquery, that have emerg from the varciti project, also 
us thi technology. the compani develop a park manag 
system that work exclus with camera instal near park space 
and do not requir park space sensors. the comput evalu the 
video data in real-tim and recognis cars, so it know which park 
space be free and also whether a car have be mistakenli park 
across two spaces. thi system be first use in the swiss citi of locarno, 
with further project in over 30 citi in switzerland and abroad. 

the eth spin-off uniqfe us the method to identifi perimet 
advertis and individu player dure televis broadcast of sport 
events, allow it to calcul how long they be visibl dure the 
broadcast and to personalis the perimet ad for variou user groups.
