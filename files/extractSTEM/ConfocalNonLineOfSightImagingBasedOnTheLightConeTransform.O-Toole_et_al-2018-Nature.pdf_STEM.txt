confoc non-line-of-sight imag base on the 
light-con transform 
matthew o’toole1, david B. lindell1 & gordon wetzstein1 

how to imag object that be hidden from a camera’ view be a 
problem of fundament import to mani field of research1–20, 
with applic in robot vision, defence, remot sensing, 
medic imag and autonom vehicles. non-line-of-sight 
(nlos) imag at macroscop scale have be demonstr by 
scan a visibl surfac with a puls laser and a time-resolv 
detector14–19. wherea light detect and rang (lidar) system 
use such measur to recov the shape of visibl object from 
direct reflections21–24, nlo imag reconstruct the shape and 
albedo of hidden object from multipli scatter light. despit 
recent advances, nlo imag have remain impract owe 
to the prohibit memori and process requir of exist 
reconstruct algorithms, and the extrem weak signal of 
multipli scatter light. here we show that a confoc scan 
procedur can address these challeng by facilit the deriv 
of the light-con transform to solv the nlo reconstruct 
problem. thi method requir much small comput and 
memori resourc than previou reconstruct method do and 
imag hidden object at unpreced resolution. confoc 
scan also provid a sizeabl increas in signal and rang when 
imag retroreflect objects. We quantifi the resolut bound 
of nlo imaging, demonstr it potenti for real-tim track 
and deriv effici algorithm that incorpor imag prior and a 
physic accur nois model. additionally, we describ success 
outdoor experi of nlo imag under indirect sunlight. 

lidar system use time-resolv sensor to scan the three- 
dimension (3d) geometri of objects21–24. such system acquir rang 
measur by record the time requir for light to travel along a 
direct path from a sourc to a point on the object and back to a sensor. 
recently, these type of sensor have also be use to perform nlo 
tracking12,13 or imaging14–20 of object ‘hidden around corners’, where 
the posit and shape of the object be comput from indirect light 
paths. the light travel along indirect path scatter multipl time 
befor reach a sensor and may scatter off object outsid a camera’ 
direct line of sight (fig. 1). recov imag of hidden object from 
indirect light path involv a challeng invers problem becaus 
there be infinit mani such path to consider. with applic in 
remot sens and machin vision, nlo imag could enabl capa- 
biliti for a varieti of imag systems. 

the challeng task of imag object that be partial or fulli 
obscur from view have be tackl with approach base on time- 
gate imaging2, coher gating3, speckl correlation4,5, wavefront 
shaping6, ghost imaging7,8, structur illumination9 and intens 
imaging10,11. At macroscop scales, the most promis nlo imag 
system reli on time-resolv detectors12–20. however, nlo imag 
with time-resolv system remain a hard problem for three main 
reasons. first, the reconstruct step be prohibit comput 
demanding, in term of both memori requir and process 
cycles. second, the flux of multipli scatter light be extrem low, 
requir either extens acquisit time in dark environ or a 

suffici high-pow laser to overcom the contribut of ambient 
light. finally, nlo imag often requir a custom hardwar system 
make with expens components, thu prevent it widespread use. 

confoc nlo (c-nlos) imag aim to overcom these 
challenges. wherea previou nlo acquisit setup exhaust illu- 
minat and imag pair of distinct point on a visibl surfac (such a a 
wall), the propos system illumin and imag the same point (fig. 1) 
and raster-scan thi point across the wall to acquir a 3D transient 
(that is, time-resolved) image14,25–27. c-nlo imag offer sever 
advantag over exist methods. first, it facilit the deriv of 
a closed-form solut to the nlo problem. the propos nlo 
reconstruct procedur be sever order of magnitud faster and 
more memory-effici than previou approaches, and it also produc 
higher-qu reconstructions. second, wherea indirectli scatter 
light remain extrem weak for diffus objects, retroreflect object 
(such a road signs, bicycl reflector and high-vis safeti apparel) 
consider increas the indirect signal by reflect light back to it 
sourc with minim scattering. thi retroreflect properti can onli 
be exploit by confoc system that simultan illumin 
and imag a common point and may be the enabl factor toward 
make nlo imag practic in certain applic (such a 
autonom driving). third, lidar system alreadi perform con- 
focal scan to acquir point cloud from direct light paths. our 
prototyp system be built from the ground up, but commerci lidar 
system may be capabl of support the algorithm develop here 
with minim hardwar modifications. 

similarli to other nlo imag approaches, our imag format 
model make the follow assumptions: there be onli singl scatter 
behind the wall (that is, no inter-reflect in the hidden part of the 
scene), light scatter isotrop (that is, the model ignor lambert’ 
cosin terms), and no occlus occur within the hidden scene. our 
approach also support retroreflect materi through a minor 
modif of the imag format model. 

c-nlo measur consist of a two-dimension set of tempor 
histograms, acquir by confoc scan point x′ , y′ on a planar 
wall at posit z′ = 0. thi 3D volum of measurements, τ, be give by

the element of volum ρ along the z axis, and the transform R t non- 
uniformli resampl and attenu the measur τ along the time

We refer to equat (2) a the light-con transform (lct).

rτ∈ + 

n n nx y t be the vector represent of the measurements, and 
rρ∈ +

surface. the process of discret each function involv defin a 
finit grid and integr the function over each cell in the grid. the 
matrix R∈ +

operation, and the matrix R∈ +

repres the transform oper appli to the tempor and 
spatial dimensions, respectively. We note that both transform 
matrix be independ appli to their respect dimens and 
can therefor be appli to large-scal dataset in a comput 
and memory-effici way. similarly, the 3D convolut oper H 
can be comput effici in the fourier domain. together, these 
matrix repres the discret lct. 

By treat nlo imag a a spatial invari 3D deconvolut

wiener filter with a constant α inaccur assum that the trans- 
form measur contain white noise. therefore, we also deriv 
an iter reconstruct procedur that combin the lct with a 
physic accur poisson nois model (supplementari information). 

figur 2 illustr the invers lct appli to indirect measur 
of a bunni model simul with a physic base ray tracer30. the 
process involv evalu equat (3) in three steps: (i) resampl 
and attenu the measur τ with the transform rt, (ii) appli 
the wiener filter to the result, and (iii) appli the invers transform 
−rz 

1 to recov ρ. these three step be effici in term of memori and 
number of oper required. the most costli step be the applic 
of the wiener filter, which requir o(n3logn) oper for the 3D 
fast-fouri transform and have memori requir of o(n3), where 
N be the maximum number of element across all dimens in space- 
time. In comparison, exist backprojection-typ reconstructions15–17 
requir o(n5) operations, and method base on invers be much 
more cost ly b ot h in t he i r memor y and pro ce ing 
requirements17,18,20. 

In addit to improv runtim and memori efficiency, a primari 
benefit of the lct over backprojection-bas approach be that 
the invert solut be accurate. In fig. 3, we compar the recon- 
struction qualiti of the backproject algorithm and the lct for 
a retroreflect traffic sign. the dimens of the hidden sign be 
0.61 m × 0.61 m and the diffus wall be sampl at 64 × 64 locat 
over a 0.8 m × 0.8 m region. the total exposur time be 6.8 min (that 
is, 0.1 s per sample) and the runtim for matlab to recov a vol- 
ume of 64 × 64 × 512 voxel be 1 s on a macbook pro (3.1-ghz intel 
core i7). To compar the reconstruct qualiti of the two methods, 
we comput the backproject result use the lct, which be just a 

effici a invert the problem with the lct. even though unfil- 
tere backproject could be slightli sharpen by linear filters, such 
a a laplacian15, backproject method do not solv the invers 
problem (see supplementari inform for detail comparisons). 
In supplementari information, we also show a varieti of reconstruct 
exampl scenes, a well a result for nlo tracking11–13 of retrore- 
flectiv object in real time. 

appli nlo imag outdoor requir the indirect light from 
the hidden object to be detect in the presenc of strong ambient 
illumination. To accomplish this, c-nlo imag take advantag 
of the high light throughput associ with retroreflect objects. 
figur 3 present an outdoor nlo experi under indirect sunlight 
(approxim 100 lx). the dimens of the hidden retroreflect 
object be 0.76 m × 0.51 m, with 32 × 32 sampl locat over a 
1 m × 1 m area. the exposur be 0.1 s per sample, with a total exposur 
time of 1.7 min. matlab reconstruct a volum of 32 × 32 × 1,024 
voxel in 0.5 s. 

the fundament bound on the resolut of nlo imag 
approach coupl the full-width at half-maximum of the tempor

recov a volum contain 1,024 × 1,024 × 1,024 voxels. figur 4 
show the target geometri in grey and the recov shape overlaid in 
green. the error map indic a median absolut reconstruct error 
of 2.5 mm (mean absolut error 15.1 mm, mean squar error 2.7 mm). 
occlus and higher-ord bounc of indirect illumin be not 
model by ani exist nlo imag method, includ ours, which 
may lead to violat in the imag format model and error in 
the reconstruct volume. for example, the right ear of the bunni be 
not accur recov owe to self-occlus by the left ear in the 
measurements. We note that the convent approach of discret 
and invert the imag format model at thi resolut would 
requir an excess of 9 petabyt of memori just to store a spars 
represent of the linear system. 

the co-design of a confoc scan techniqu and a computa- 
tional effici invers method facilit fast, high-qual recon- 
struction of hidden objects. To achiev real-tim frame rate with 
c-nlo imaging, three improv to our current prototyp be 
required. first, to reduc acquisit time, a more power laser be 
needed. for eye-saf operation, thi laser may need to oper in the 
short-wav infrar regime11,12,22. second, for retroreflect objects, 
the measur of multipl histogram can be perform in parallel, 
with minim crosstalk. thi properti could enabl a single-photon 
avalanch diod (spad) array and a diffus laser sourc to acquir the 
full c-nlo imag in a singl shot. third, to improv the comput 
time, our highli paralleliz algorithm could be implement in a 
graphic process unit or a field-programm gate array. 

the propos techniqu thu enabl nlo imag with con- 
vention hardwar at much high speeds, with a small memori 
footprint and low power consumption, over a longer range, under 
ambient light and at high resolut than ani exist approach 
of which we be aware.
