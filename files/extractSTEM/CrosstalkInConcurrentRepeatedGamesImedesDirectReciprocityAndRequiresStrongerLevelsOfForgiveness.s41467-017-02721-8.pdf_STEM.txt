direct reciproc be a mechan for cooper among humans. mani of our daili 

interact be repeated. We interact repeatedli with our family, friends, colleagues, 

member of the local and even global community. In the theori of repeat games, it be a tacit 

assumpt that the variou game that a person play simultan have no effect on each 

other. here we introduc a gener framework that allow u to analyz “crosstalk” between a 

player’ concurr games. In the presenc of crosstalk, the action a person experi in 

one game can alter the person’ decis in another. We find that crosstalk imped the 

mainten of cooper and requir strong level of forgiveness. the magnitud of the 

effect depend on the popul structure. In more dens connect social groups, 

crosstalk have a strong effect. A harsh retaliator, such a tit-for-tat, be unabl to counteract 

crosstalk. the crosstalk framework provid a unifi interpret of direct and upstream 

reciproc in the context of repeat games.

social dilemma be situat where mutual cooper isbett than mutual defect and yet there be an incent todefect1,2. cooper be normal oppos by natur 
select unless mechan for the evolut of cooper be 
in place3. one such mechan be direct reciprocity, which be 
base on repeat interact between the same two players4,5. 
In repeat social dilemmas, human often learn to use adapt 
rules, tell them when to cooperate, when to defect, and how to 
motiv other to cooperate6–8. cooper can be achiev if 
peopl adopt condit cooper strategi such a tit-for- 
tat5, gener tit-for-tat9,10, or win-stay, lose-shift11,12. 
condit cooperation, pair with some amount of generosity, 
can maintain a healthi level of cooperation13–21. It can evolv 
even if initi rare22–26. 

most previou model of direct reciproc (with a few notabl 
exceptions27–30) have either assum that (i) individu onli 
engag in one repeat game at a time or that (ii) an individual’ 
action in one game be independ of all it other interactions. 
becaus human often engag in mani game simultaneously, the 
first assumpt seem to be violat in most practic scenarios. 
moreover, evid from experiment studi suggest that also 
the second assumpt of independ may not alway 
apply31–38. We say that a player’ decis be subject to “crosstalk” 
when an interact that a player have in one repeat game 
influenc how the veri same player behav in anoth repeat 
game (fig. 1a). for example, consid the interact in a group 
of three individuals, “alice”, “bob”, and “charlie” (fig. 1b). sup- 
pose that after a seri of previou encounters, bob be prompt 
for a decis whether to cooper with alic in the next round. 
In her last interact with bob, alic have cooperated. therefore, 
bob who us tit-for-tat, would now cooper with alice. but 
bob’ last interact have occur with charli and in that 
interact charli have defected. crosstalk now mean there be 
some chanc that bob defect with alic although direct 
reciproc would mandat bob to cooperate. bob’ state with 
respect to charli influenc hi decis with respect to alice. 

such crosstalk can result from variou psycholog processes. 
for example, experi on upstream reciproc suggest that 
subject who have receiv help in their previou interact 
often conscious choos to “pay it forward”22,31–33. alternatively, 
crosstalk may also occur when subject have limit work 
memory34–36. In that case, subject may confus their co-players’ 
past actions, which may in turn lead them to reward the wrong 
person for past cooper behaviors. We propos a mathema- 
tical framework that allow u to quantifi how crosstalk affect 
the cooper dynam within a population. We show that, in 
the presenc of crosstalk, a singl defector can lead to the com- 
plete breakdown of cooper in an arbitrarili larg group of 
condit cooperators. nevertheless, cooper can prevail if 
the popul be structur and if subject be suffici for- 
giving. for our model, we do not need to specifi the particular 
psycholog process at work: the result behavior dynam 
be independ of whether crosstalk be the result of a consciou 
decis (a in upstream reciprocity), or the consequ of a 
subconsci error (a when individu confus the past action 
of their co-players). however, the interpret of our result will 
often depend on the specif psycholog mechan that give 
rise to crosstalk. We revisit thi matter in the “discussion” section. 

result 
framework for crosstalk between concurr repeat games. 
We consid a group of N individuals. each individu play a 
pairwis repeat prisoner’ dilemma (pd) with each interact 
partner. these repeat game occur concurrently. At each time 
step, we choos a random pair of player for a singl interact 

(fig. 1b). each player us a reactiv strategy, defin by two 
parameters, p and q, which denot the probabl to cooper if 
the same co-play in the previou round have either cooper or 
defected, respectively. the class of reactiv strategi includ 
mani well-known examples, such a always-cooper (allc), 
always-defect (alld), tit-for-tat (tft: supplementari fig. 1b), 
and gener tit-for-tat10 (gtft: supplementari fig. 1d). 
reactiv strategi can be implement by stochast two-stat 
automata39–42. the two state be label C and D (see 
supplementari fig. 1a). In the next interaction, a player 
cooper if she be in state C and defect if she be in state 
D. cooper pay a cost c for their co-play to receiv a benefit 
b>c. defector do not incur a cost and their co-play do not 
receiv a benefit. the player’ strategi determin how the 
player’ state be updat after an interact have take place. 

In our setup, each player us a specif strategi for all of her 
interactions, but have distinct automaton to hold the game with all 
of her differ co-play in memori (supplementari fig. 2). for 
example, a player use tft can be in differ state (C or D) 
with differ co-players, but us the same strategi to updat her 
state against all of her co-players. the separ automaton enabl 
player to rememb previou interact and to react in futur 
round accord to their respect histori with each co-player. 

crosstalk between two repeat game occur if a player’ state 
with respect to one interact partner displac the player’ state 
with respect to anoth player (supplementari fig. 2). specifi- 
cally, we assum that, befor each interaction, there be a 
probabl γ that the players’ state with respect to the current 
co-play be replac by the state with respect to the previou co- 
player (other variant of crosstalk will be discuss below). the 
crosstalk rate γ ∈ [0, 1] specifi how often crosstalk occurs. In the 
special case of no crosstalk, γ = 0, player perfectli distinguish 
between all their opponents, and we recov the scenario 
consid in previou studi of direct reciprocity2,5. for posit 
crosstalk rates, cooper and defect behavior can cascad in 
the players’ social network: a player’ action in one game can 
affect how the co-play act in a differ game, which in turn 
may influenc again other game (fig. 1). therefore, crosstalk 
caus rippl that propag in social networks. the overal effect 
of crosstalk depend on the structur of the population. We 
repres thi structur by arrang player on a graph43–45, 
where edg between player denot interact (fig. 2; 
“methods” section). while our framework be applic to 
arbitrari popul structures, we illustr the effect of 
crosstalk use four regular network (fig. 3a), rang from a 
circl (where each player have exactli two interact partners) to 
the complet graph (where all player interact with everyon else). 

cooper and defect behavior spread across population. 
We util stochast comput simul to studi the coop- 
erat frequenc in a popul over time, and deriv 
mathemat recurs to calcul the long-run payoff in the 
steadi state (“methods” section). To illustr how crosstalk lead 
to the spread of defect in a gener cooper society, we 
place a singl alld player in a network of N − 1 condit 
cooper player (figs. 2 and 3a). when the condit 
cooper player use tft (which be give by p = 1, q = 0) and 
crosstalk occurs, γ> 0, the alld player can turn all remain 
player into defector eventu (fig. 2a), independ of the 
popul structur and the crosstalk rate (supplementari 
fig. 3). the spread of defect can be prevent if the 
cooper player use more gener strategies, with p = 1 and 
0< q< 1. We refer to such strategi a gtft. the impact of 
differ q valu will be discuss below. At first, we choos 
q = 1/3. If the singl alld player be place among gtft players,

cooper frequenc converg to a posit valu (fig. 2b), 
with the eventu equilibrium rate depend on the popul 
structur and on the crosstalk rate (supplementari fig. 3). We 
can also observ the opposit effect: a singl allc player can 
increas the cooper rate in a popul of stochast tft 
player use p = 1 − ϵ and q = ϵ (supplementari fig. 4c). 

compar the effect of differ popul structures, we find 
that a gtft popul can maintain cooper more easili if 
player be arrang on a circl instead of a complet graph 
(fig. 3a, b, supplementari fig. 5). for a popul size of N = 16, 
the cooper obtain a high averag payoff than the defector 
for crosstalk rate up to γ = 0.85 on a circle, and for up to γ = 0.41 
on a complet graph. In network with a low degree, player be 
more like to give the adequ respons with respect to their 
current co-player, because, if crosstalk occurs, the current co- 
player be more like to coincid with the previou co-play such 
that crosstalk becom inconsequential. for thi reason, all other 
explor popul structur exhibit crosstalk threshold 
between the circl and the complet graph (fig. 3b). 

To investig the recoveri properti after a mistake, we 
comput the amount of time that a popul of condit 
cooper with strategi (1, q) and q> 0 need to return to full 
cooper after a singl defect event. We find that crosstalk 
lead to a significantli faster recoveri (supplementari fig. 6). 
intuitively, when the crosstalk rate be high, a player’ automaton be 
updat more frequent (onc befor the interact take place, 
and onc after the interaction). becaus the player appli 
strategi with p = 1 and q> 0, each updat event be bia 
toward increas cooperation: everi cooper act put the co- 
player into a cooper state, wherea defect act be forgiven 
with probabl q. moreover, we show that the recoveri time be 
monoton increas with the averag degre (k) of the 
popul structur and monoton decreas with the

probabl to cooper after defect (q; see supplementari 
note 1 for more details). 

crosstalk requir the right level of forgiveness. We calcul 
the generos paramet q of gtft to optim cope with 
crosstalk. To thi end, we consid two differ optim cri- 
teria. first, we calcul the most gener strategi that be abl to 
resist invas by a singl alld player. that is, for a fix 
popul structur and a give crosstalk rate, we deriv the 
reactiv strategi (1, qm) with maximum qM such that N − 1 
player with thi strategi get at least the same averag payoff a 
the singl defector. analyt calcul for the complet graph 
and numer result for all other popul structur show 
that high crosstalk rate and high network degre (that be a 
high number of neighbors) requir the cooper player to be 
less gener (fig. 3c, “methods” section). for the second 
optim criterion, we calcul the cooper strategi with the 
most robust level of generos qR such that N − 1 player with 
strategi (1, qr) have the high rel payoff advantag com- 
par to the singl alld player. the most robust level of gen- 
eros exhibit a non-monoton depend on the crosstalk 
rate (fig. 3d). In the absenc of crosstalk, γ = 0, the perfectli 
reciproc tft strategi be most robust against invas of alld. 
As the crosstalk rate increases, the most robust level of generos 
qR first increases, but then decreas again. intuitively, for the 
robust of a condit cooper popul against 
alld, high valu of the generos paramet q have two 
oppos effects. On one hand, high valu of q make it less like 
that the defectors’ action propag through the network. On the 
other hand, high valu of q also let the player be more forgiv 
against the defector, and henc increas the payoff of the alld 

player. when crosstalk be rare, condit cooper can 
prevent the spread of defect by choos a small valu for q. 
onc crosstalk be suffici frequent, however, player can no 
longer fulli prevent defect from spreading. instead, they rather 
need to keep the defector’ payoff low, by choos a small q 
value. these result confirm that in the presenc of crosstalk, γ> 
0, subject should show some amount of generos (q> 0), but 
not too much; we find q< qm, with qM depend on the crosstalk 
rate and on the popul structure. onli for the circle, coop- 
erat can prevail even when crosstalk be abund (fig. 3d). 

the abov analysi be base on a comparison between 
condit cooper and a specif invader, alld. more 
generally, we find that condit cooper strategi (1, q) 
with q< qM in fact resist invas by all possibl invad 
strategi (pʹ, qʹ) for the complet graph. thi analysi also reveal 
that there be three class of strategi in total that be stabl 
against arbitrari invad (supplementari note 1). the first class 
consist of the condit cooper strategi just described. 
the second class consist of uncoop strategi (p, 0), with p 
suffici small (see supplementari note 1 for the exact 
condition). In particular, thi class contain alld. when 
adopt by all player in a population, strategi of thi class 
eventu lead to full defection. finally, the third class consist of 
strategi (p, q) analog to equal strategi of direct 
reciprocity46–49. when appli by all resid in the population, 
equal strategi guarante that the payoff of a singl invad be 
independ of the invader’ strategy. 

crosstalk imped the evolut of cooperation. these result 
rais the question to which extent subject themselv would 
learn to appli cooper strategi with a sustain degre of

generosity. To explor that question, we implement a simpl 
model of cultur evolut where player be allow to adopt 
new strategi over time, base on their current strategy’ success 
(“methods” section). accord to thi process, strategi that 
yield a compar high payoff be more like to be imit by 
other players50,51. In addition, player may occasion also 
experi with new stochast strategies, which introduc novel 
behavior into the population. these two events, imit and 
exploration, take the role of select and mutat in model of 
biolog evolution. We show that a birth-death process a use 
in mani biolog applic yield the same result (supple- 
mentari note 1). We simul the evolutionari dynam for 
variou popul structur and crosstalk rates, assum that 
experiment event be rel rare23. In the plane of 
reactiv strategies, we observ that for most of the time, player 
either appli defect strategi with p ≈ q ≈ 0, or cooper 
strategi with p ≈ 1 and 0< q< qM (fig. 4a–c). none of these 
strategi be evolutionarili stable52. instead, when resid 
appli one of these strategies, neutral or nearli neutral mutant 
can often invad and pave the way for mutant of anoth 
strategi class42. the rel weight of these two strategi class 
depend on the crosstalk rate and on the popul structur 
(fig. 4d). while cooper strategi readili evolv on the cycl 
even for substanti crosstalk rates, they becom less abund a 
the popul structur chang to a squar lattice, or to a 
complet graph. 

To understand the effect of crosstalk in more detail, we 
analyz how easili other strategi fix in a resid popul 
that either consist of alld player or gtft player (supple- 
mentari fig. 7). without crosstalk, gtft be much more 
success in resist mutant invasions. On average, more 
mutant need to be introduc until the first mutant fixes. 
moreover, success mutant typic have a strategi that be veri 
similar to gtft (wherea alld be typic invad by tft-like 
strategi rather quickly). however, a the crosstalk rate increases, 
the invas time into gtft drop considerably, and success 
mutant no longer need to be cooper themselves. 

interestingly, we find that crosstalk favor the stabil of 
extortion strategies. with an extortion strategy, player can 
guarante that they never get a low payoff than their co-player, 
while simultan act such that it be in the co-player’ best 
interest to cooper unconditionally47. In classic model of 
direct reciprocity, extortion strategi be unstabl and they 
can onli succeed if the popul size be small18,19,53. In contrast, 
extortion strategi can thrive even in larg popul when 

crosstalk be suffici abund (supplementari fig. 8). how- 
ever, thi success come at a cost. By becom stable, 
extortion strategi lose one of their most appeal properties: 
when crosstalk be abundant, a rare invad in an extortion 
popul do no longer benefit from be uncondit 
cooperative. instead, the best respons be to be extortion a well 
(see supplementari note 1 for details). 

To analyt understand the impact of crosstalk on the 
evolutionari dynamics, we explor a determinist model of 
evolut in well-mix populations54–56. the singular strategi 
of these dynam consist exactli of the three strategi set that 
resist invas by rare mutant that we describ in the previou 
section: condit cooperators, defectors, and equalizers. which 
of these strategi class be reach in the cours of evolut now 
depend on the initi popul (supplementari fig. 9a). As the 
crosstalk rate increases, the number of initi popul that 
eventu end up in a condit cooper state decreas 
(supplementari fig. 9b). In thi determinist model, crosstalk 
thu act by reduc the basin of attract of the cooper 
equilibria. 

altern model of crosstalk. So far, we have analyz one 
particular model of crosstalk: when prompt for the next deci- 
sion, a player instead react to her most recent interaction, and 
thi interact could have be with someon else. but other 
implement be conceivable. 

for example, the memori state that a player hold for her 
current co-play could be replac by the memori state of a 
random co-player, who may not coincid with the current or the 
most recent co-player. In thi case, when decid what to do for 
the next round in a particular game, the player us with 
probabl γ the state of a random game that she be hold in 
memory. We find that thi altern implement of 
crosstalk differ in it short-term dynam but converg to the 
same steadi state a our origin model (supplementari fig. 10).

well. 

alternatively, a player’ decis could depend not onli on the 
previou interact with one particular opponent. instead, the 
player might consid an averag across her recent experi 
with all her co-players. We therefor introduc aggreg reactiv

co-play with weight 1 − γ and the averag cooper rate 
across all co-players’ last action with weight γ. the obtain 
score be then compar to an exogen cooper threshold τ. 
player cooper with probabl p if the weight cooper 
score exce τ; otherwis they cooper with probabl q. In 
particular, if the crosstalk rate γ be zero, these strategi again 
correspond to the classic reactiv strategi of direct recipro- 
city2,10. We explor the effect of γ and τ by consid a singl 
defector in a popul of condit cooperators. the 
condit cooper appli a strategi with p = 1, q = 1/3 and 
some valu τ, a strategi to which we refer to a aggreg 
gener tit-for-tat (agtft). while the cooper dynam 
of thi model be qualit differ from our previou results, 
we again find that high crosstalk rate imped the stabil of 
cooper across all popul structur (supplementari 
figs. 11 and 12). 

discuss 
classic model of direct reciproc requir that player provid 
a target respons to each of their co-players2,5. experiment 
result and everyday experi indic that players’ decis 
can be affect by unrel event that occur in their interact 
with others31–38. crosstalk aris when a player have simultan 
repeat interact with sever opponents. importantly, 
crosstalk be differ from previou approach that combin 
direct and indirect (downstream) reciprocity. In model of 
downstream reciprocity, a player’ strategi depend on the co- 
player’ reputation, and henc on the co-players’ interact with 
others38,57–64. A combin of direct reciproc and down- 
stream reciproc can promot cooper becaus a singl 
defect in one game may lead sever unaffect co-play to 
retali against the defector27–29. however, downstream reci- 
prociti make strong assumpt on the inform player 
have when make their decision. It requir a player to observ 
other players’ interact or reput to respond accordingly. 
In contrast, crosstalk be a much more elementari mechanism. It 
occur “within” each player and do not reli on addit 
extern inform about independ interact of 
unrel players. our notion of crosstalk be general: it 
captur that a player’ decis in one game can be affect by 
the player’ previou experi in anoth game, but it do not 
depend on the psycholog process respons for thi 
interdependency. 

depend on the specif process at work, crosstalk be 
amend to differ interpretations. our framework can be 
take a a model of upstream reciproc in the context of 
repeat games. under thi interpretation, cooper or 
defect receiv from one person be sometim conscious 
“paid forward” to anoth person. previou analyt model have 
either focu on direct reciproc or on upstream reciproc 
separately2,65,66. the framework of crosstalk allow u to explor 
the consequ when both mode of reciproc act simulta- 
neously, and possibl interfer with each other. We recov 
previou results65–67 that upstream reciproc alon be most 
like to yield cooper when the popul be highli struc- 
tured. however, our result suggest that cooper can even be 
maintain in well-mix popul when upstream reciproc 
be suffici coupl with direct reciproc (i.e., when the 
crosstalk rate γ be suffici small). 

alternatively, crosstalk can serv a a model of individu with 
limit work memory. accord to thi interpretation, 
crosstalk occur when individu confus their variou co-play- 
ers, which introduc a type of behavior nois into the coop- 
erat dynamics. thi nois be differ from simpl 
implement error consid in previou 

models2,9,18,19,36,68,69. implement error onli affect the 
repeat game in which they occur (supplementari fig. 4a, b). 
but crosstalk spread from one game to anoth and therefor 
through the popul (supplementari fig. 4). onli in the 
presenc of crosstalk, a singl defector can turn a whole popu- 
lation of tft player into defectors. 

We consid upstream reciproc and confus a differ 
psycholog process which independ can give rise to 
crosstalk. although these two process be subject to differ 
interpretations, accord to the abov discuss implementation, 
they lead to the same cooper dynam within a population. 
high degre of upstream reciprocity, just a high degre of 
confusion, undermin the abil of direct reciproc to sustain 
cooperation. 

crosstalk provid a gener framework with applic 
beyond the exampl studi here. futur model could explore, 
for example, crosstalk between independ game that differ in 
their payoff structure70, or when subject engag in simultan 
game that involv more than two players. similarly, one may 
studi interact in which the crosstalk rate itself depend on 
exogen parameters, such a the number of neighbors, or the 
benefit of cooperation. finally, we explor a model in which 
player aggreg across their last experi with all co-players. 
further gener be conceivable. for example, player may 
defect against all their co-play a long a at least one of their 
automaton be in the D state, or they may rememb more than their 
co-player’ last action26,71. under crosstalk, the players’ indivi- 
dual game be no longer consid in isolation, but they be 
emb into the context of all concurr ongo interac- 
tions. crosstalk requir strong mechan for forgiv 
especi in a more highli connect world. A harsh retali 
such a tit-for-tat be particularli unabl to deal with crosstalk. 
thi be an interest messag for our current society. 

method 
comput simulations. To simul the effect of crosstalk on the cooper 
dynam among player with fix strategies, we consid a popul of size N 
play a repeat prisoner’ dilemma (pd). the popul be give by a graph 
where the node repres the players, and the edg reflect all possibl interact 
between players. onli player connect by an edg can be pair to play the pd. 
player use separ two-stat automaton for each of their neighbor on the inter- 
action graph41. the two state of each automaton be label C (cooperation) and 
D (defection). these state be updat accord to the player’ reactiv strategi 
(p, q), see supplementari figs. 1 and 2. the paramet p denot the probabl to 
move to state C if the co-play have cooper in the previou game (wherea the 
complementari probabl 1 − p give the likelihood to move to state d). similarly, 
q denot the probabl to move to state C if the co-play have defect (and 1 − q 
be the respect probabl to move to state d). 

In each round, an edg of the interact graph be chosen uniformli at random. 
A singl PD be play among the two player adjac to the chosen edge. with 
probabl 1 − γ a player act accord to the respect automaton state 
associ with thi co-player; with probabl γ crosstalk occur and the player 
refer to the state of the automaton updat in her last interact instead. after 
the game, the automaton state be updat accord to the game outcom and the 
players’ strategies. thi elementari step be then iter for a larg number of 
rounds. for the simul result depict in supplementari fig. 5, we simul 
4000 game per realiz (on averag 500 game per player) and averag across 
104 realiz to obtain the stationari payoff of gtft and alld player for a 
give popul structur and crosstalk rate. 

So far, we assum that everi edg in the interact graph be chosen with the 
same probability. however, some interact can occur with a high frequenc 
than others. To investig the effect of differ interact frequencies, we 
studi the spread of defect behavior in a popul of gtft player 
popul a 5 × 5 lattic (supplementari fig. 13). We increas the interact 
probabl of all player on the central horizont line by 10-fold (see orang edges) 
and observ how defect behavior spread much faster along the horizont axi 
than along the vertic axis. within the analyt framework, interact 
probabl wij be give by the connect matrix W (see next section for 
details). 

In the second studi type of crosstalk, again with probabl γ crosstalk occur 
and the player refer to the state of a random automaton, chosen from all her 
interact partner with equal probabl (supplementari figs. 2 and 10).

analyt deriv of steady-st payoffs. To deriv an explicit repre- 
sentat for the payoff that player receiv in the long run, we suppos that each 
player i adopt some fix reactiv strategi (pi, qi). the popul structur be 
give by an N ×N connect matrixw = (wij). the entri wij give the probabl 
that the next interact in that popul occur between player i and j. In 
particular, the connect matrixw be symmetr wij =wji, and satisfi wii = 0 andp 

i<j wij ¼ 1. As in the comput simulations, we focu on network in which each 
link be play with equal probability. that is, if player i and j be connected, then 
wij = w for some constant w> 0 that depend on the network structure, but be 
independ of the player i and j. for example, becaus there be n(n − 1) / 2 
differ link in a complet graph, well-mix popul can be repres by a 
connect matrix with wij = 2 / (n(n − 1)) for all i ≠ j. As anoth example, 
popul on a cycl be repres by wij = 1/n if i and j occupi neighbor 
sites, and wij = 0 for all other i, j.

We note that thi method appli to gener crosstalk rate γ, gener popul 
structures, and gener popul composit (e.g., popul with more than 
two differ strategi present). As show in supplementari fig. 5, these 
analyt deriv payoff be in excel agreement with the comput 
simulations. In the supplementari note 1, we show how eqs. (2) and (3) can be 
further simplifi for well-mix populations. In that case, we can also provid 
explicit express for how gener cooper strategi of the form (1, q) be 
allow to be to resist invas of alld (a depict in fig. 3c, d). 

setup of the evolutionari simulations. To explor the evolut of strategi 
under crosstalk, we consid a simpl model of cultur evolution, the pairwis 
comparison process50,51. As common in studi on the evolut of strategi in 
repeat games10–25,40,41, we assum a separ of time scales: the time it take 
individu to play their repeat game be short compar to the evolutionari 
timescal at which individu adopt new strategies. thi assumpt allow u to 
use the players’ stationari payoffs, a give by eq. (3), when simul the evo- 
lutionari trajectori of a population. 

for the evolutionari simulations, we consid a popul with fix 
popul structur and fix crosstalk rate γ. In each evolutionari time step, there 
be two possibl events, imit or random strategi exploration. To model 
imit events, we assum that two individu be randomli drawn from the 
population. We refer to these two individu a the “learner” and the “role model”, 
respectively. herein, we aim to compar the effect of crosstalk across differ 
popul structures. To allow for a fair comparison, we assum that, while 
payoff be calcul for the give popul structure, strategi updat occur 
globally. As a consequence, the learner and the role model do not need to be 
neighbor in the direct interact network. with thi assumption, we rule out the 
format of cooper clusters, which would addit favor the evolut of 
cooper in network with a low degree44. after select the learner and the 
role model, their payoff πL and πR be calcul accord to eq. (3). We assum 
that the learner adopt the role model’ strategi with probabl ρ = [1 + exp(−s(πr 
− πl))]−1. the paramet s ≥ 0 measur the strength of selection. when select be 

weak, s � 1, payoff be larg irrelev for imit and the imit 
probabl approach 1/2, irrespect of the players’ strategies. when select be 
strong, s � 1, player tend to adopt onli those strategi that yield a high payoff 
than their own strategy. In addit to these imit events, we allow for random 
strategi exploration. when such an explor event occurs, one player be 
randomli drawn from the population. thi player then adopt a new strategi (p, q), 
which be uniformli drawn from all reactiv strategies. follow the approach of 
imhof and nowak23, we assum that these explor event be rare. As a 
consequence, the popul be homogen most of the time. onli occasionally, a 
mutant strategi enter the popul due to random strategi exploration. thi 
mutant strategi than either go extinct or fix befor the next explor event 
occurs. By simul thi process over a long timespan, we can record how often 
the popul appli certain strategi (p, q), and we can comput the result 
averag cooper rate over an evolutionari timescale. In fig. 4, we show 
correspond result for the cycle, the squar lattice, and for the complet graph, 
assum paramet valu of popul size N = 16, benefit b = 10, cost c = 1, and 
select strength s = 1. other paramet valu lead to qualit similar results, 
provid that select be suffici strong and that the benefit of cooper be 
suffici high to allow for the evolut of cooperation. In the supplementari 
note 1, we show that analog result appli when we consid a birth-death 
process instead of the pairwis imit process consid herein.
