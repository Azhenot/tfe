weight between 
preferenti attachment: A new 
mechan explain social 
network format and evolut 
alexandru topirceanu1, mihai udrescu1 & radu marculescu 2 

the dynam of social network be a complex process, a there be mani factor which contribut to 
the format and evolut of social links. while certain real-world properti be captur by the 
degree-driven preferenti attach model, it still cannot fulli explain social network dynamics. 
indeed, import properti such a dynam commun formation, link weight evolution, or degre 
satur cannot be complet and simultan describ by state of the art models. In thi 
paper, we explor the distribut of social network paramet and central and argu that node 
degre be not the main attractor of new social links. consequently, a node between prof to 
be paramount to attract new link – a well a strengthen exist link –, we propos the new 
weight between preferenti attach (wbpa) model, which render quantit robust 
result on realist network metrics. moreover, we support our wbpa model with a socio-psycholog 
interpretation, that offer a deeper understand of the mechan behind social network dynamics. 

despit the widespread use of the gaussian distribut in scienc and technology, mani social, biological, and 
technolog network be good describ by a power-law (zipf) distribut of node degre (the node degre 
be the number of link incid to a node). the barabasi-albert (ba) model, base on the degree-driven prefer- 
ential attachment, gener such scale free network with a power-law distribut of node degre p(k) = k−λ. 
In fact, degre preferenti attach (dpa) be wide consid to be one of the main factor behind complex 
network evolut (the scale-fre topolog gener with the BA model be abl to captur other real-world 
social network properti such a a low averag path length l)1,2. however, recent research challeng the idea 
that the scale free properti be preval in complex networks3. additionally, the degree-driven preferenti attach- 
ment model have well-known limit to accur describ social network (i.e., complex network where 
node repres individu or social agents, and link repres social tie or social relationships), owe to the 
follow considerations: 

• peopl be physic and psycholog limit to a maximum number of real-world friendships; thi 
impos a satur limit on node degree4,5. conversely, in the BA model no such limit exists. 

• peopl have weight relationships, i.e., not all tie be equal important: an averag person know roughli 
350 persons, can activ befriend no more than 150 peopl (dunbar’ number)4, and have onli a few veri 
strong social tie (links)6. the BA model do not account for such link weights7. 

• the structur and dynam of commun in social network be not accur describ with dpa7–11. 

To address these issues, recent research have combin the dpa model with properti deriv directli from 
empir data. for instance, there exist propos which add the small-world properti to scale-fre model 
(e.g., holme-kim model12, evolv scale-fre networks13) or the power-law distribut to small-world (e.g., 
the watts-strogatz model with degre distribution14, multistag random grow small-worlds15, evolv 
small-worlds16, random connect small-worlds17). other research propos extend milgram’ experiment18,

e.g., static-geographic19 and cellular20 models. however, all these model be still not accur enough when com- 
par against real-world social networks. 

To good understand the real-world accuraci problem, we perform a topolog analysi on a varieti of 
real-world network dataset and show that node between (which express the node qualiti of be “in 
between” communities) be power-law distribut and–at the same time–correl with link weight distributions. 
our empir find align well with previou research in some particular cases11,21. such empir piec of 
evid suggest that, for social networks, the node degre be not the main driver of preferenti attachment; 
therefor other central may be good attractor of social ties. We conclud that node betweenness–a oppos 
to node degre or ani other central metric–i the key attractor for new social ties. 

consequently, a the main theoret contribution, we introduc the new weight between preferenti 
attach (wbpa) model, which be a simpl yet fundament mechan to replic real-world social net- 
work topolog more accur than other state-of-the-art models. more precisely, we show that the wbpa 
model be the first social network model that be abl to replic commun structur while it simultaneously: (i) 
explain how link weight evolve, and (ii) reproduc the natur satur of degre in hub nodes. 

finally, we further interpret wbpa from a socio-psycholog perspective, which may explain whi node 
between be such an import factor behind social network format and evolution. 

result 
central statistics. We investig the distribut of node between on a varieti of social network 
datasets: facebook user (590 nodes), googl plu user (638 nodes), weight co-authorship in network sci- 
enc (1589 nodes), weight onlin social network (1899 nodes), weight bitcoin web of trust (5881 nodes), 
unweight wikipedia vote (7115 nodes), weight scientif collabor network (7343 nodes), unweight 
condens matter collabor (23 K nodes), weight mathoverflow user interact (25 K nodes), 
unweight hep citat (28 K nodes), pok social network (29 K nodes), unweight email interact (37 K 
nodes), imdb actor (48 K nodes), brightkit osn user (58 K nodes), facebook - new orlean (64 K nodes), 
respect epinion (76 K nodes), slashdot (82 K nodes) and timik (364 K nodes) on-lin platforms. To improv 
the robust of our analysis, we ensur data divers by consid network dataset with differ sizes, 
weight and unweighted, and repres variou type of social relationship (see methods). 

our first observ be that, in all datasets, node degree, node betweenness, link betweenness, and link 
weight (for dataset with weight links) be power-law distributed. moreover, the power-law slope of degre 
distribut be steeper in comparison with node between distribution. more precisely, a present in fig. 1a, 
the averag degre slope be γdeg = 2.097 (standard deviat σ = 0.774) and the averag between slope be 
γbtw = 1.609 (σ = 0.431), mean that γdeg be typic 30.3% steeper than γbtw across all dataset (detail in si.1. 
social network dataset statistics). also, for all consid dataset there be a signific non-linear (polynomi 
or exponential) correl between node between and node degre (see fig. 1b); thi further suggest that 
node between may be the sourc of imbal in node degre distribution. the statist for the entir dataset 
collect be present in si.1. 

the second observ be that–unlik node degree–nod between be significantli more correl with 
the weight of the incid links. after assess the correl between both node between and node degre 
with the weight sum of all adjac links, we argu that between act a an attractor for strong ties. for 
example, for the co-authorship weight network with 1589 nodes23, the top 5% link accumul 27.4% of the 
total weight in the graph; these top 5% link be incid to node which amass 80.2% of the total node between- 
ness, but onli 14.9% of the total node degre (see fig. 2–further numer detail in si.1, tabl 2). In all analyz 
weight datasets, node between correl with incid link weight by ratio that be 2.5–9 time high 
than node degree–link weight associ (addit detail in si.1, fig. 2). 

the first observ indic a signific correl between node degre and node between but it 
do not necessarili impli causation. however, the second observ be that between attract strong link 
which, in turn, trigger more imbal in degre distribution; thi suggest that node between be behind

show that, in social networks, degre and between have a power-law distribut (with a steeper slope for 
degree), and that there be a non-linear correl between the two centralities.

network evolution, while the power-law degre distribut be onli a by-product. the import of node 
between be further support by the analysi of central dynamics. To thi end, we provid the exampl of 
an on-lin social network, upt.social, which be intend to facilit social interact between student and 
member of faculti at univers politehnica of timişoara, romania24. right after it launch in 2016, upt.soci 
attract hundr of users, and the entir dynam process of new link format be record a snapshot 
of the first 6 week (t0 − t5). As exemplifi in fig. 3 (and further detail in si.3, fig. 6), the node with high 
between becom the princip attractor of new social ties; we also note that the top 3 node attract new 
edg at time snapshot T2 be the one which maxim their between beforehand, and then trigger a sub- 
sequent degre increase. As shown, onc node degre begin to satur (t3 − t5), node between drops, a 
node fulfil their initi bridg potential. 

between preferenti attach (bpa). In what follows, we propos the between preferenti 
attach model (bpa) and conjectur that–for social networks–it be more realist than the degre preferenti 
attach (dpa) model. the fundament differ between the degree-driven and betweenness-driven pref- 
erenti attach be illustr in fig. 4; the upper panel show that, under the dpa rule, the node with high 
degre (color in orange) gain an even high degree. In contrast, the low panel in fig. 4 show that, under the 
bpa rule, the node with high between (orange) attract more link and increas their degrees; in turn thi 
decreas their between via a redistribut process, thu limit the number of new link for high-degre 
node a a second order effect. thi may explain why, in real-world networks, the number of new link be limit 
for high degre node (i.e., degre saturation). 

wbpa model. besid valid the bpa mechanism, we also realiz that all the empir network data gath- 
ere in a real-world context be weighted, even if the inform about link weight be not alway available. for 
example, there be no link weight inform in our facebook and googl plu datasets, yet these network be 
clearli part of a weight social context in which each link have a distinct social strength. realist network evolv 
accord to a mechan which consid link weights, therefor we develop the weight bpa (wbpa) algo- 
rithm to character the social network evolution.

and (b) in the co-authorship network (1589 nodes, 2742 links). the betweenness/degre ratio (b/d) rang 
between 2.5–9, highlight that top link weight be predominantli incid to high between nodes, rather 
than high degre nodes.

the wbpa algorithm for link weight assign accord to the fitness-weight correl be give in fig. 5 
and discuss below. In the case of wbpa, the fit f be node betweenness. note that even though link weight 
wij be not use directli dure the growth phase, they have a signific second order impact: between 
depend on the shortest path in the graph, which in turn be highli depend on link weights. link weight 
be updat in step 3 of the wbpa algorithm, and whenev a weight becom ≤0, the correspond link be 
removed. 

weight bpa algorithm (wbpa). 

1) distribut weights: begin with an arbitrarili connect graph G with node V and bidirect link E 
(i.e., for ∀eij ∃ eji). A weight wij be add for each link eij in the graph, so that wij be proport to fit fj of 
the target node vj. for each node vi, all incid link weight wij be normal so that the outgo weight- 
ed degre be 1. 

2) growth (bpa): At everi step, a new node vk be introduced; the new node tri to connect to n (1 ≤ n ≤ V) 
exist node in G. the probabl pi that vk becom connect to an exist node vi be proport to 
fit fi. therefore, we have = ∑ ∈p f f/i i j V j where the sum be make over all node in the graph. 

3) dynam weight redistribution: onc a new node vk becom connect to an exist node vi, weight wki 
and wik be initi with the normal fit fi and fk respectively. As the weight outgo degre 
of node vi increas by wik, everi other weight wij be rescal with −wik/n, where n be the previou number 
of neighbor of node vi.

attach (bpa) depict in term of acquir new link and limit the (excessive) accumul of degre 
over time. In dpa, node with high degre attract even more links, and thu node degre increas ad infinitum. 
conversely, in bpa, node attract new link becaus of their high between will eventu lose their 
between in favor of their neighbor nodes, thu limit the acquir degree.

assess the realism of wbpa. wbpa defin complex interact between link weight and node 
centralities, henc we expect emerg phenomenon such a n-order effects. therefore, a mathemat analysi of 
wbpa would be cumbersom and beyond the scope of our paper. instead, a valid strategy, we test wbpa 
against sever preferenti attach (pa) model to explor which one produc the most realist social net- 
work topology. To thi end, we quantifi preferenti attach accord to a fit function f which express 
the capabl of individu node to attract new connect (e.g., if f be chosen to be node degre deg, then we 
reproduc the classic BA model2). We consid f a one of the follow network centralities: degre deg (dpa 
model), between btw (wbpa model), eigenvector central EC (ecpa model), close cl (clspa model), 
and cluster coeffici CC (ccpa model). each node central be defin in the method section. the com- 
parison between synthet and real-world network be do through topolog similar assess support 
by the statist fidel metric25, alongsid standard deviat and p-values. fidel take valu ϕ ∈ [0, 1] with 
1 repres a network that be ident with the refer network (see the method section for more details). 

We also make use of the follow graph metric to character and compar networks: averag degre (ad), 
averag path length (apl), averag cluster coeffici (acc), modular (mod), graph diamet (dmt), and 
graph densiti (dns). We start by measur the distribut of these six metric on the 18 select real-word 
datasets. To ass which central be the most appropri a fit function, we start by gener network 
accord to each PA model, of increas sizes: N = {1k, 2k, 5k, 10k, 50k, 100k} nodes; the full statist result 
be present in si.2. best fit for preferenti attachment. aggreg the statist result from si.2–fig. 4 
(real-world data) and fig. 5 (pa networks), we provid an intuit visual comparison in fig. 6 between the 
averag evolut of the six graph metric on the real-world data (N = 590 to N = 364 K nodes), and on the 
degree-driven and betweenness-driven PA networks. 

To good illustr the comparison between the synthet PA network and the real-world datasets, we present 
the trend line for each graph metric in fig. 6; for the real-world data network the trend line be green-dotted, for 
btw fit network be blue, and for deg fit network be red. On close inspection, we uncov the following: 

• AD in real data evolv differ than in PA networks. 
• apl evolut in real data resembl btw network much good than deg networks. We measur a statisti- 

cal fidel of ϕbtw = 0.925 and ϕdeg = 0.853. 
• acc evolut in real data resembl btw more than deg, with statist fidel of ϕbtw = 0.665 and 

ϕdeg = 0.515. 
• mod evolut in real data resembl both network veri well, with statist fidel of ϕbtw = 0.814 and 

ϕdeg = 0.812 (a slight advantag for the btw networks). 
• dmt evolut in real data resembl deg more than btw. even though we see the same type of increase, 

deg produc longer diamet a see in the major of real-word data. the measur statist fidel 
be ϕbtw = 0.796 and ϕdeg = 0.836. 

• dn evolut in real data resembl both networks, with statist fidel of ϕbtw = 0.634 and 
ϕdeg = 0.634. 

for simplicity, fig. 6 includ onli deg and btw PA network in the comparison with real-world data; the full 
numer data–with all PA network models–ar detail in tabl 1. all these result demonstr the superior 
realism provid by the wbpa in comparison to the classic dpa principle, a well a in comparison to PA driven 
by other node central such a eigenvector, close or cluster coefficient. 

We strengthen our analysi by present sever direct comparison between real network and synthet PA 
networks, gener with the same node size a the real-world refer networks. the comparison be make

outgo weight be 1. (b) new node v6 connect to exist one v1–v5 base on probabl that be

(c) onc v6 and v1 connect, node v1 assign a weight w1−6 on the new link that be proport to fit f6. As 
such, a proport weight ratio of w1−6/4 be subtract (indic with a minu sign) from the four alreadi 
exist links. If ani of the newli result weight drop below 0, the correspond link be remov from node

the mechan of preferenti attach which we adopt in our paper be a fundamental, yet gener and 
simpl framework. state of the art studi which be specif aim at creat realist topolog propos 
algorithm with a far increas complexity. therefore, intuitively, it be expect that state of the art model like 
cellular (cell)20, home-kim (hk)12, toivonen (tv)26, or watts-strogatz with degre distribut (wsdd)14 
etc., will gener more realist topolog in term of the six discuss graph metrics. To test thi hypothesis, we 
further gener such synthet network of size N = 10,000 and compar them with wbpa, dpa network and 
sever real-world datasets. the result be provid in tabl 3, show that not onli be wbpa superior to dpa 
and PA model driven by other central but, in most case (i.e., 10 out of 13), it outperform the other synthet 
model in term of topolog fidel a well. for readabl purpos we do not add inform about the 
standard deviat of each synthet model here; thi inform may be found in si.4, tabl 4 and 5. 

To offer the divers requir by a robust test of our model, we also includ unweight network in our col- 
lection. A fair comparison between wbpa network (which be all weighted) and the larg and unweight 
exampl networks, requir that all weight on our wbpa algorithm output be discarded. In thi comparison, we 
start by gener wbpa network of 10,000 nodes, then make all weight >w 0ji becom 1, thu obtain 
unweight bpa networks. 

the upper half of tabl 3 contain the averag fidel of wbpa, dpa and the two null model networks, 
toward the real-world refer networks. the low half of tabl 3 contain the other state of the art synthet 
networks. our wbpa obtain the high fidel toward most empir references, e.g., 13–68% high ϕfb, 
21–81% high ϕosn, 4–47% high ϕtk than all other synthet models. As such, we prove the increas realism 
of our model in comparison with some elabor state-of-the-art model (briefli describ in si.4, and quanti- 
fie in si.4, tabl 4). compar to dpa, our model produc network with high fidel values; when averag 
over all empir network we obtain: 0 831btwφ = . and 0 777degφ = . . 

We note that the wbpa model produc a specif distribut of the betweenness/degre (b/d) ratio. To 
thi end, we measur b/d distribut on all dataset (weight and unweighted), a well a on our synthet

closer to 0 repres a more uniform dispers of data) to evalu data dispersion27. the gini valu obtain 
on the empir data be give in tabl 4: all empir datasets, whether weight or unweighted, have their gini 
coeffici within a similar range, i.e., the averag real-world gini be greal = 0.5193 ± 0.071. indeed, for wbpa 
network with 10,000 nodes, we have an averag gini coeffici of gwbpa = 0.4962 ± 0.0282, which be veri close 
to the real-world b/d gini valu (−4.5%). additionally, we gener 10 of each random, small world, and PA 
network of 10,000 nodes. for these synthet network we obtain the correspond gini valu in tabl 4. the 
PA network (except wbpa) produc an averag gpa = 0.7784 ± 0.0128, wherea the random network produc 
an averag gini grand = 0.9374 ± 0.0013. these result point out two key aspects: (i) the b/d dispers in other PA 
and other state-of-the-art synthet model differ significantli from real-world social networks, and (ii) wbpa 
produc network with b/d distribut that be closer to the real-world. 

two specif b/d distribut be exemplifi in fig. 7a,b for the googl plu and pok user networks, 
respectively. figur 7c,d present the b/d distribut for the dpa and wbpa networks. the visual similar 
inspect reveal wbpa a the onli synthet model capabl of reproduc the real-world b/d ratio (see si.1, 
fig. 3 for addit examples). 

the wbpa realism be also back up by the central distribut analysis. the power-law slope for degre 
and between distribut in wbpa (γdeg = 1.391 and γbtw = 1.171) be veri similar to the real-world dis- 
tribut from the central statist section (see fig. 1) and si.1, tabl 1, mean that the degre slope be 
steeper than the between slope (with 18.8%). similar to the real-world cases, we obtain a polynomi fit for 
the node betweenness-degre correl in wbpa (y = 0.246x2 + 329.8x − 3569.4, with correl coeffici 
R2 = 0.9977).

on qualit perceptions30. In light of the qualiti over quantiti hypothesi propos by social psychology31, we 
argu that node between be a far good indic of social attract than node degree, becaus the qualiti 
of be “in between” can be easili and quickli perceived, due to the fact that human be good at observ 
qualit aspect (e.g., differ and diversity) than quantit ones32. thi idea be support by an experi- 
mental studi on how peopl favor invest in few qualit social ties, rather than numer low qualiti 
ties32. our result indic that wbpa provid a more accur social network topolog model, be abl 
to reproduc real-world commun structur a well a to explain degre satur and link weight evolution. 

We believ that the wbpa model transcend the mere topolog perspect on social relationship evolu- 
tion. As such, in the field of social psychology, individu be perceiv a social creatur who strive for social 
recognition, validation, approv and fame7,19,33,34. indeed, individu tend to connect to two type of other 
nodes: individu who be popular in their commun (i.e., typic they have high degree), and individu 
who connect multipl commun (have high betweenness). while the former type of interconnect be 
mostli relat to the popular of individu within local communities, it appear to be an epiphenomenon of 
the latter. 

also, state of the art have previous identifi that social network have appar (degree) assort mixing, 
while, technolog and biolog network appear to be disassort in nature34,35. the studi in35 explain 
thi a most network have a tendenc to evolve, unless otherwis constrained, toward their maximum entropi 
state–which be usual disassortative. A similar debat be introduc by borondo et al. base on the concept of 
meritocraci versu topocracy36. the author discu the critic point at which social valu chang from be 
base on person merit, to be base on social position, status, and acquaintances. In the context of social net- 
works, we interpret thi issu a follows: in our ego-network the balanc between friend with less influenc and 
one with more influenc than u translat into between assortativity. indeed, connect to person with 
high between and increas our tie strength with them (through, say, a stabl social relationship), we our- 
self become, in turn, more influenti social bridges. thi propag of influenc determin other persons, 
with low betweenness, to interact with u and direct more tie strength toward us. 

toward thi end, we introduc the concept of social evolut cycle, which revolv around between assor- 
tativ rather than degre assortativity34,35,37. accord to our approach, individu becom more influenti 
over time by increas their own betweenness. therefore, the exhibit of one individual’ desir to increas his/ 
her between be two-fold: it attract new tie (i.e., increas in degree), and it creat strong tie (i.e., increas 
in link weight); thi process continu for the next gener of individu who aspir to climb the social ladder. 
As shown, thi conclus be support by the evolut of network gener with wbpa. 

We envis two way of improv an individual’ social status. the first choic reli on forc tie strength 
insid the exist neighborhood to increas first, follow by an increas in influence. the second choic reli 
on increas influenc first by broaden the neighborhood to influenti agent (bpa principle), which will in 
turn trigger an increas in tie strengths. We consid the second choic a the more plausibl social process, a 
detail and explain in fig. 8. 

We conclud that the wbpa model be quantit more robust than dpa, a it can reproduc more accu- 
rate a wide rang of real-world social networks. such a conclus mean that node degre be not the main 
driver in social network dynamics. instead, node between be a much good indic of social attractiveness, 
becaus it drive the format of new social bonds, a well a the evolut of social statu of individuals. from a

assess network fidelity. In order to ass the structur realism of the gener social networks, 
we use the statist fidel ϕ, which be proven to offer reliabl insight on complex network topologies25. the 
fidel metric ϕ numer captur the similar between ani graph topolog G* with respect to anoth ref- 
erenc graph G (i.e., a complex network G = (v, e)). more precisely, by measur and compar their common 
individu graph metrics, a maximum fidel of 1 repres complet similarity, while a minimum fidel of 0 
repres complet dissimilar between the two compar topologies. Of note, the fidel be not depend 
on the choic of metric of interest, howev it be customiz to allow a weight comparison. depend on 
the context of the problem, ani numer valu (i.e. metric) that be repres for the model can be used. the
