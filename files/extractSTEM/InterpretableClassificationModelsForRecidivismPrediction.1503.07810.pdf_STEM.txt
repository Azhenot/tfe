†these author contribut equal to thi work. 

summary. We investig a long-deb question, which be how to creat predict model of re- 
cidiv that be suffici accurate, transparent, and interpret to use for decision-making. thi 
question be complic a these model be use to support differ decisions, from sentencing, to 
determin releas on probation, to alloc prevent social services. each case might have an 
object other than classif accuracy, such a a desir true posit rate (tpr) or fals posit 
rate (fpr). each (tpr, fpr) pair be a point on the receiv oper characterist (roc) curve. We 
use popular machin learn method to creat model along the full roc curv on a wide rang of 
recidiv predict problems. We show that mani method (svm, sgb, ridg regression) produc 
equal accur model along the full roc curve. however, method that design for interpret 
(cart, c5.0) cannot be tune to produc model that be accur and/or interpretable. To handl thi 
shortcoming, we use a recent method call superspars linear integ model (slim) to produc ac- 
curate, transparent, and interpret score system along the full roc curve. these score system 
can be use for decision-mak for mani differ use cases, sinc they be just a accur a the 
most power black-box machin learn model for mani applications, but complet transparent, 
and highli interpretable.

1. introduct 

forecast have be use for criminolog applic sinc the 1920 (borden, 1928; burgess, 1928) when 
variou factor deriv from age, race, prior offens history, employment, grades, and neighborhood back- 
ground be use to estim success of parole. mani thing have chang sinc then, includ the fact that 
we have develop machin learn method that can produc accur predict models, and have collect 
larg high-dimension dataset on which to appli them. 

recidiv predict be still extrem important. In the unit states, for example, a minor of indi- 
vidual commit the major of the crime (wolfgang, 1987): these be the “power few” of sherman (2007) 
on which we should focu our efforts. We want to ensur that public resourc be direct effectively, be they 
correct facil or prevent social services. milgram (2014) recent discuss the critic impor- 
tanc of accur predict if an individu who be releas on bail pose a risk to public safety, point 
out that high-risk individu be be releas 50% of the time while low-risk individu be be releas 
less often then they should be. her observ be in line with longstand work on clinic versu actuari 
judgment, which show that humans, on their own, be not a good at risk assess a statist model 
(daw et al., 1989; grove and meehl, 1996). thi be the reason that sever u.s. state have mandat the use 
of predict model for sentenc decis (pew center of the states, public safeti perform project, 
2011; wroblewski, 2014). 

there have be some controversi a to whether sophist machin learn method (such a random 
forests, see e.g., breiman, 2001b; berk et al., 2009; ritter, 2013) be necessari to produc accur predict 
model of recidivism, or if tradit approach such a logist regress or linear discrimin analysi 
would suffic (see e.g., tollenaar and van der heijden, 2013; berk and bleich, 2013; bushway, 2013). random 
forest may produc accur predict models, but these model effect oper a black-boxes, which 
make it difficult to understand how the input variabl be produc a predict outcome. If a simpler, more 
transparent, but equal accur predict model could be developed, it would be more usabl and defens 
for mani decision-mak applications. there be a preced for use such model in criminolog (steinhart, 
2006; andrade, 2009); ridgeway (2013) argu that a “decent transpar model that be actual use will 
outperform a sophist system that predict good but sit on a shelf.” thi discuss be captur nice 
by bushway (2013), who contrast the work of berk and bleich (2013) and tollenaar and van der heijden

(2013). berk and bleich (2013) claim we need sophist machin learn method due to their substanti 
benefit in accuracy, wherea tollenaar and van der heijden (2013) claim that “modern statistical, data mine 
and machin learn model provid no real advantag over logist regress and lda,” assum that 
human have do appropri pre-processing. In thi work, we argu that the answer to the question be far 
more subtl than a simpl ye or no. 

In particular, the answer depend on how the model will be use for decision-making. for each use case 
(e.g., sentencing, parol decisions, polici interventions), one might need a decis point at a differ level of 
true posit rate (tpr) and fals posit rate (fpr) (see also ritter, 2013). each (tpr, fpr) pair be a point on 
the receiv oper characterist (roc) curve. To determin if one method be good than another, one must 
consid the appropri point along the roc curv for decision-making. As we show, for a wide rang of 
recidiv predict problems, mani machin learn method (support vector machines, random forests) 
produc equal accur predict model along the roc curve. however, there be trade-off between 
accuracy, transparency, and interpretability: method that be design to yield transpar model (cart, 
c5.0) cannot be tune to produc a accur model along the roc curve, and do not alway yield model 
that be interpretable. thi be not to say that interpret model for recidiv predict do not exist. the 
fact that mani machin learn method produc model with similar level of predict accuraci indic 
that there be a larg class of approximately-equally-accur predict model (call the “rashomon” effect 
by breiman 2001a). In thi case, there may exist interpret model that also attain the same level of 
accuracy. find model that be accur and interpretable, however, be comput challenging. 

In thi paper, we explor whether such accurate-yet-interpret model exist and how to find them. To 
thi end, we use a new machin learn method know a a superspars linear integ model (slim; ustun 
and rudin, 2015) to learn score system from data. score system that have use for mani crimin justic 
applic becaus they let user make quick predict by adding, subtract and multipli a few small 
number (see e.g., hoffman and adelberg, 1980; u.s. sentenc commission, 1987; pennsylvania commis- 
sion on sentencing, 2012). In contrast to exist tools, which have be built use heurist approach (see 
e.g., gottfredson and snyder, 2005), the model built by slim be fulli optim for accuraci and sparsity, 
and can handl addit constraint (e.g., bound on the fals posit rate, monoton properti for the 
coefficients). We use slim to produc a set of simpl score system at differ decis point across the 
full roc curve, and provid a comparison with other popular machin learn methods. our find show 
that the slim score system be often just a accur a the most power black-box machin learn 
models, but transpar and highli interpretable. 

1.1. structur 
the remaind of thi paper be structur a follows. In section 1.2, we discu relat work. In section 2, we 
describ how we deriv 6 recidiv predict problems. In section 3, we provid a brief overview of slim 
and describ sever new techniqu that can reduc the comput requir to produc score systems. 
In section 4, we compar the accuraci and interpret of model produc by the 9 machin learn 
method on the 6 recidiv predict problems. We includ addit result relat to the accuraci and 
interpret of model from differ method in the appendix. 

1.2. relat work 
predict model for recidiv have be in widespread use in differ countri and differ area of 
the crimin justic system sinc the earli 1920 (see e.g., borden, 1928; burgess, 1928; tibbitts, 1931). 
the use of these tool have be spur on by continu research into the superior of actuari judgment 
(daw et al., 1989; grove and meehl, 1996) a well a a desir to effici use limit public resourc 
(clements, 1996; simon, 2005; mccord, 1978, 2003). In the u.s., feder guidelin current mandat 
the use of a predict recidiv measur know a the crimin histori categori for sentenc (u.s. 
sentenc commission, 1987). besid the u.s., countri that current use risk assess tool includ 
canada (hanson and thornton, 2003), the netherland (tollenaar and van der heijden, 2013), and the u.k. 
(howard et al., 2009). applic of these tool can be see in evidence-bas sentenc (hoffman, 1994), 
correct and prison administr (belfrag et al., 2000), inform releas on parol (pew center of the 
states, public safeti perform project, 2011), determin the level of supervis dure parol (barn 



interpret classif model for recidiv predict 3 

and hyatt, 2012; ritter, 2013), determin appropri sanction for parol violat (turner et al., 2009), 
and target polici intervent (lowenkamp and latessa, 2004). 

our paper focu on binari classif model to predict gener recidiv (i.e., recidiv of ani type 
of crime) a well a crime-specif recidiv (i.e., recidiv for drug, gener violence, domest violence, 
sexual violence, and fatal violenc offenses). risk assess tool for gener recidiv include: the salient 
factor score (hoffman and adelberg, 1980; hoffman, 1994), the offend group reconvict scale (copa 
and marshall, 1998; maden et al., 2006; howard et al., 2009), the statist inform of recidiv scale 
(nafekh and motiuk, 2002), and the level of service/cas manag inventori (andrew and bonta, 
2000). crime-specif applic includ risk assess tool for domest violenc (see e.g., the spousal 
abus risk assess of kropp and hart, 2000), sexual violenc (see e.g., hanson and thornton, 2003; 
langton et al., 2007), and gener violenc (see e.g., histor clinic and risk manag tool of webster 
et al. 1997, or the structur assess of violenc risk in youth tool of borum 2006). 

the score system that we present in thi paper be design to mimic the form of risk score that be 
current use throughout the crimin justic system – that is, linear classif model that onli requir 
user to add, subtract and multipli a few small number to make a predict (ustun and rudin, 2015). these 
tool be uniqu in that they allow user make quick predict by hand, without a computer, calculator, 
or nomogram (which be a visual tool for more difficult calculations). current exampl of such tool 
include: the salient factor score (sfs) (hoffman and adelberg, 1980), the crimin histori categori (chc) 
(u.s. sentenc commission, 1987), and the offens graviti score (ogs) (pennsylvania commiss on 
sentencing, 2012). our approach aim to produc score system that be fulli optim for accuraci and 
sparsiti without ani post-processing. In contrast, current tool be produc through heurist approach that 
primarili involv logist regress with some ad-hoc post process to ensur that the model be spars 
and use integ coeffici (see e.g., the method describ in gottfredson and snyder, 2005). 

our score system differ from exist tool in that they directli output a predict outcom (i.e., prison 
i will recidivate) a oppos to an predict probabl of the outcom (i.e. the predict probabl that 
prison i will recidiv be 90%). the predict probabl from exist tool be typic convert into 
an outcom by impos a threshold (i.e., classifi a prison a “high-risk” if the predict probabl of 
arrest > 70%). In practice, user arbitrarili pick sever threshold to translat predict probabl into 
an ordin outcom (e.g., prison i be “low risk,” if the predict probabl be < 30%, “medium risk” if the 
predict probabl is< 60%, and “high risk” otherwise). these arbitrari threshhold make it difficult, if not 
impossible, to effect ass the predict accuraci of the tool (hannah-moffat, 2013). netter (2007), 
for instance, mention that “the possibl of make a predict error (fals posit or fals negative) use 
a risk tool be probable, but not easili determined.” In contrast to exist tools, the score system let user 
ass accuraci in a straightforward way (i.e., through the true posit rate and true neg rate). further, 
our approach have the advantag that be can yield a score system that optim the class-bas accuraci at a 
particular decis point (i.e., produc the model that maxim the true posit rate, give a false-posit 
rate of at most 30%). 

our work be relat to a stream of research that have aim to leverag new method for predict model 
in criminology. In contrast to our work, much of the research to date have focu on improv predict 
accuraci by train power black-box model such a random forest (breiman, 2001b) and stochast 
gradient boost friedman (2002). random forest (breiman, 2001b), in particular, have be use for 
sever criminolog applications, including: predict homicid offend recidiv (neuilli et al., 2011); 
predict seriou misconduct among incarcer prison (berk et al., 2006); forecast potenti murder 
for crimin on probat or parol (berk et al., 2009); forecast domest violenc and help inform court 
decis at arraign (berk and sorenson, 2014). We note that not all studi in use black-box models: 
berk et al. (2005), for instance, help the lo angel sheriff’ depart develop a simpl and practic 
screener to forecast domest violenc use decis trees. more recently, (goel et al., 2015), develop a 
simpl score system to help the new york polic depart address stop and frisk by first run logist 
regression, and then round the coefficients. 

2. data and predict problem 

each problem be a binari classif problem with N = 33, 796 prison and P = 48 input variables. 
the goal be to predict whether a prison will be arrest for a certain type of crime within 3 year of be

releas from prison. In what follows, we describ how we creat each predict problem. 

2.1. databas detail 
We deriv the recidiv predict problem in our paper from the “recidiv of prison releas in 
1994” database, assembl by the u.s. depart of justice, bureau of justic statist (2014). It be the 
larg publicli avail databas on prison recidiv in the unit states. the studi track 38,624 
prison for 3 year follow their releas from prison in 1994. these prison be randomli sampl 
from the popul of all prison releas from 15 u.s. state (arizona, california, delaware, florida, 
illinois, maryland, michigan, minnesota, new jersey, new york, north carolina, ohio, oregon, texas, and 
virginia). the sampl popul account for roughli two-third of all prison that be releas from 
prison in the u.s. in 1994. other studi that use thi databas include: bhati and piquero (2007); bhati 
(2007); zhang et al. (2009). 

the databas be compos of 38,624 row and 6,427 columns, where each row repres a prison and 
each column repres a featur (i.e. a field of inform for a give prisoner). the 6,427 column consist of 
91 field that be record befor or dure releas from prison in 1994 (e.g., date of birth, effect sentenc 
length), and 64 field that be repeatedli record for up to 99 differ arrest in the 3 year follow-up period 
(e.g., if a prison be rearrest three time with 3 years, there would be three record cycl recorded). the 
inform for each prison be sourc from record-of-arrest-and-prosecut (rap) sheet kept by state 
law enforc agenc and/or the fbi. A detail descript analysi of the databas be carri out 
by statistician at the u.s. bureau of justic statist (langan and levin, 2002). thi studi restrict it 
attent to 33,796 of the 38,624 prison to exclud extraordinari or unrepres releas cases. To be 
select for the analysi of langan and levin (2002), a prison have to be aliv dure the 3 year follow-up 
period, and have to have be releas from prison in 1994 for an origin sentenc that be at least 1 year 
or longer. prison with certain releas type – releas to custody/detainer/warrant, absent without leave, 
escape, transfer, administr release, and releas on appeal – be excluded. To mirror the approach of 
langan and levin (2002), we restrict our attent to the same subset of prisoners. 

thi dataset have some seriou flaw which we point out below. To begin, mani import factor that could 
be use to predict recidiv be missing, and mani includ factor be noisi enough to be exclud from 
our preliminari experiments. the inform about educ level be extrem minimal; we do not even 
know whether each prison attend college, or complet high school. the inform about cours in 
prison be onli an indic of whether the inmat take ani educ or vocat cours at all. also, there be 
no famili histori for each prison (e.g., foster care) and no record of visitor while in prison (e.g., indic 
of care famili member or friends). there be no inform about reentri program or employ history. 
while some of these factor exist, such a drug or alcohol treatment and in-prison vocat programs, the 
data be highli incomplet and therefor exclud from our analysis. for example, for drug treatment, less than 
14% of the prison have a valid entry. the rest be “unknown.” To includ a mani prison a possible, 
we chose to exclud factor with extrem spars information. 

2.2. deriv input variabl 
We provid a summari of the P = 48 input variabl deriv from the databas in tabl 1. We encod each 
input variabl a a binari rule of the form xij ∈ {0, 1}, j = 1 . . . , P , where xij = 1 if condit j hold true 
about prison i. thi allow a linear model to encod nonlinear function of the origin variables. We refer 
to input variabl in the text use italic font (e.g., female). all predict problem in tabl 2 and all 
machin learn method in tabl 4 use these same input variables. 

the final set of input variabl be repres of well-known risk factor for recidiv (bushway 
and piehl, 2007; crow, 2008) and have be use in risk assess tool sinc 1928 (see e.g., borden, 
1928; ricardo H. hinojosa et al., 2005; berk et al., 2006; baradaran, 2013). they include: 1) inform 
about prison releas in 1994 (e.g., time served, age at release, infract in prison); 2) inform from 
past arrests, sentencing, and convict (e.g., prior arrests≥1, ani prior jail time);1 3) histori of substanc 
abus (e.g., alcohol abuse) 4) gender (e.g., female). these input variabl be advantag because: a) the 

1the prior arrest variabl do not count the origin crime for which they be releas from prison in 1994; thus, 
about 12% of the prison have no prior arrest =1 even though they be arrest at least once. 



interpret classif model for recidiv predict 5 

inform be easili access to law enforc offici (all abov inform can be found in state 
rap sheets); b) they do not includ socioeconom factor such a race, which would directli elimin the 
potenti to use these tool in applic such a sentencing. 

We note that encod the input variabl a binari valu present mani advantages. they produc 
model that be easi to understand (remov the wide rang present by continu variables), and they 
avoid potenti confus stem from coeffici of normal input (for instance, after undo the 
normal for normal coefficients, a small coeffici might be highli influenti if it appli to a 
variabl take larg values). binar be especi use for slim a we can fit slim model by 
solv a slightli easi discret optim problem when the data onli contain binari input variabl 
(a discuss in section 3.3). In appendix E, we explor the chang in predict accuraci if continu 
variabl be includ and show that the chang in perform be minor for most methods. there be some 
exceptions; for example, cart and c5.0t experienc an improv of 4.6% for drug and svm rbf 
experienc a 7.7% improv for fatal violence. yet even for these methods, no clear improv 
be see across all problems. 

2.3. deriv outcom variabl 
We creat a total of 6 recidiv predict problem by encod a binari outcom variabl yi ∈ {−1,+1} 
such that yi = +1 if a prison be arrest for a particular type of crime within 3 year after be releas 
from prison. for clarity, we refer to each predict problem in the text use typewrit font (e.g., arrest). 
We provid detail on each recidiv predict problem in tabl 2. these include: an arrest for ani 
crime (arrest); an arrest for a drug-rel offens (drug); or an arrest for a certain type of violent offens 
(gener violence, domest violence, sexual violence, fatal violence). 

In the dataset, all crime type can be broken down into small subcategori (e.g., fatal violenc 
can be broken into 6 subcategori such a murder, vehicular manslaughter, etc.). We chose to use 
the broader crime categori for the sake of concis and clarity. indeed, the studi by langan and levin 
(2002) also split the crime into the same major categories. We note that the outcom of violent offens be 
mutual exclusive, a differ type of violenc be treat differ within the u.s. legal system. In other 
words, yi = +1 for gener violenc do not necessarili impli yi = +1 for domest violence, 
sexual violence, fatal violence).

becaus a prison could be arrest for multipl type of crime at one time (e.g., both drug and public

2.4. relationship between input and output variabl 
tabl 3 list the condit probabl P (y = 1|xj = 1) between the outcom variabl y and each input 
variabl xj for all predict problems. use thi table, we can identifi strong associ between the input 
and output for each predict problem. these associ can help uncov insight into each problem and 
also help qualit valid predict model in section 4.4. 

consider, for instance, the arrest problem. here, we can see that prison who be releas from 
prison at a late age be less like to be arrest (a the probabl for arrest decreas monoton a 
age at releas increases). thi also appear to be the case for prison who be first confin (i.e., sent to 
prison or jail) at an old age (see e.g., age of first confinement). In addition, we can also see that prison 
with more prior arrest have a high likelihood of be arrest (a the probabl for arrest increas 
monoton with prior arrest). 

similar insight can be make for crime-specif predict problems. In drug, for instance, we see that 
prison who be previous arrest for a drug-rel offens be more like to be rearrest for a drug- 
relat offens (32%) than those who be previous arrest for ani other type of offense. likewise, look 
at domest violence, we see that the prison with the great probabl of be arrest for a do- 
mestic violenc crime be those with a histori of domest violenc (13%).

3. superspars linear integ model 

A superspars linear integ model (slim) be a new machin learn method for creat score system – 
that is, binari classif model that onli requir user to add, subtract and multipli a few small number 
to make a predict (ustun and rudin, 2015). score system be wide use becaus they allow user 
to make quick predictions, without the use of a computer, and without extens train in statistics. these 
model be also use becaus their high degre of sparsiti and integ coeffici let user easili gaug 
the influenc of multipl input variabl on the predict outcom (see section 4.4 for an example). In what 
follows, we provid a brief overview of slim, and provid sever new techniqu to reduc the comput 
for problem with binari input variables. 

3.1. framework and optim problem

here, λ1, . . . , λP repres the coeffici (i.e. the “points” for input variabl j = 1, . . . , P ), and λ0 repre- 
sent an intercept (i.e. the “threshold score” that have to be surpass to predict ŷi = +1). 

the valu of the coeffici be determin from data by solv a discret optim problem that 
have the follow form:

∑P 
j=1 1 [λj 6= 0]. the constraint restrict coeffici to a finit set such a L = 

{−10, . . . , 10}p+1. optionally, one could includ addit oper constraint on the accuraci and 
interpret of the desir score system. 

the object includ a tini penalti on the absolut valu of the coeffici to restrict coeffici to 
coprim valu without affect accuraci or sparsity. To illustr the use of thi penalty, consid a classifi 
such a ŷ = sign (x1 + x2). If slim onli minim the misclassif rate and the number of term 
(the first two term of the objective), then ŷ = sign (2x1 + 2x2) would have the same object valu a 
ŷ = sign (x1 + x2) becaus it make the same predict and have the same number of non-zero coefficients. 
sinc coeffici be restrict to a discret set, we use thi tini penalti on the absolut valu of these 
coeffici so that slim choos the classifi with the small (coprime) coefficients, ŷ = sign (x1 + x2). 

the C0 paramet repres the maximum accuraci that slim be will to sacrific to remov a featur 
from the optim score system. if, for instance, C0 be set within the rang (1/n, 2/n), we would sacrific 
the accuraci of one observ to have a model with one few feature. given c0, we can set the `1-penalti 
paramet � to ani valu 

0 < � < 
min(1/n,c0)

∑P 

j=1 |λj | 

so that it do not affect the accuraci or sparsiti of the optim classifier, but onli induc the coeffici to 
be coprim for the featur that be selected. 

slim differ from tradit machin learn method becaus it directli optim accuraci and spar- 
siti without make approxim that other method make for scalabl (e.g., control for accuraci 
use convex surrog loss functions). By avoid these approximations, slim sacrific the abil to fit a 
model in second or in a way that scale to extrem larg datasets. In return, however, it gain the abil to 



10 zeng, ustun, and rudin 

fit model that be highli customizable, sinc one could directli encod a wide rang of oper constraint 
into it integ program formulation. In thi paper, we primarili make use of a simpl constraint to limit 
the number of non-zero coefficients, however, it be also natur to incorpor constraint on class-specif 
accuracy, structur sparsity, and predict (see ustun and rudin, 2015). 

In thi paper we train the follow version of slim, which be differ than (1) in that it includ class 
weights, and have specif constraint on the coefficients:

λj ∈ {−10, . . . , 10} for j = 1...p 
λ0 ∈ {−100, . . . , 100}. 

(2) 

In the formul above, the constraint restrict each coeffici λj to an integ between −10 and 10, the 
threshold λ0 to an integ between −100 and 100, the number of non-zero to at most 8 (i.e., within the rang 
of cognit entiti human could handle, a per miller, 1956). the paramet W+ and W− be class-bas 
weight that control the accuraci on posit and neg examples. We typic choos valu of W+ and 
W− such thatw++w− = 2, so that we recov an error-minim formul by settingw+ = W− = 1. 
the C0 paramet be set to a suffici small valu so that slim would not sacrific accuraci for sparsity: 
give W+ and w−, we can set C0 to ani valu 

0 < C0 < min{w−,w+}/(n × P ) 

to ensur thi condition. the � paramet be set to a suffici small valu so that slim would produc a 
model with coprim coeffici without affect accuraci or sparsity: give w+, W− and c0, we can set � 
to ani valu 0 < � < c0/max 

∑P

3.2. gener slim IP formul

a cplex, gurobi, or cbc. In general, we use the follow IP formul to recov the solut to the

the margin γ). thi be a big-m constraint for the error rate that depend on scalar paramet γ and Mi 
(see e.g., rubin, 2009). the valu of Mi repres the maximum score when exampl i be misclassified, 
and can be set a Mi = maxλ∈l(γ − yiλtxi) which be easi to comput sinc L be finite. the valu of γ 
repres the margin, and the object be penal when point be either incorrectli classified, or within 



interpret classif model for recidiv predict 11 

γ of the decis boundary. how close a point be to the decis boundari (or whether it be misclassified) be 
determin by yiλtxi. when the featur be binary, and sinc the coeffici be integers, γ can natur 
be set to ani valu between 0 and 1. (in other cases, we can set γ = 0.5 for instance, which make an implicit 
assumpt on the valu of the features.) the constraint in (3b) set the total penalti for each coeffici to 
Φj = c0αj + �βj , where αj := 1 [λj 6= 0] be defin by big-m constraint in (3c), and βj := |λj | be defin 
by the constraint in (3d). We denot the larg absolut valu of each coeffici a Λj := maxλj∈lj |λj |. 

restrict coeffici to a finit set result in signific practic benefit for the slim IP formulation, 
especi in comparison to other IP formul that minim the 0–1-loss and/or penal the `0-norm. 
without the restrict of λ to a bound set, we would not have a natur choic for the big-m constant, 
which mean the user choos one that be veri large, lead to a less effici formul (see e.g., wolsey, 
1998). for slim, the big-m constant use to comput the 0–1 loss in constraint (3a) be bound a Mi ≤ 
maxλ∈l(γ− yiλtxi), and the big-m constant use to comput the `0-norm in constraint (3c) be bound a 
Λj ≤ maxλj∈lj |λj |. bound these constant lead to a tighter LP relaxation, which narrow the integr 
gap, and improv the abil of commerci IP solver to obtain a proof of optim more quickly. 

3.3. improv slim IP formul 
the follow formul provid a tighter relax of the IP which reduc computation. It reli on the 
fact that when the input variabl be binary, we be like to get repeat featur valu among observations.

the main differ between thi formul and the one in (3) be that we comput the error rate of the 
classifi use loss constraint that be express in term of the number of distinct point in the dataset. 
here, the set S repres the set of distinct point with posit labels, and the set T repres the set of 
distinct point with neg examples. the paramet n (and nt) count the number of time a point of type 
s (or t) be found in the origin dataset so that 

∑

∑ 
t nt = 

∑N 
i=1 1 [yi = −1], and 

N = 
∑ 

s n + 
∑ 

t nt. 
the main comput benefit of thi formul be due to the fact that: (i) we can reduc the number 

of loss constraint by count the number of repeat row in the dataset; and (ii) we can directli encod a 
low bound on the error rate by count the number of point s, t with ident featur but opposit label 
(i.e., x = xt but y = −yt). here (i) reduc the size of the problem that we pa to an IP solver, and (ii) 
produc a much strong low bound on the 0–1 loss (in comparison to the LP relaxation), which speed up 
the progress of branch-and-bound type algorithms. note that it would be possibl to use thi formul on a 
dataset without binari input variables, though it would not necessarili be effect becaus it could be much 
less like for a dataset to contain repeat row in such a setting. 

anoth subtl benefit of thi formul be that the margin for the neg point be 0 while the margin 
for the posit point be 1. thi mean that for posit points, we have a correct predict if and onli if the 



12 zeng, ustun, and rudin 

score ≥ 1. for neg points, we have a correct predict if and onli if the score ≤ 0. thi provid a 
slight comput advantag sinc the neg point do not need to have score below -1 to be correctli 
classified, which reduc the size of the big-m paramet and the coeffici set. for instance, say we would to 
produc a linear model that encode: “predict rearrest unless a1 or a2 be true.” use the previou formul 
with the margin of γ ∈ (0, 1) on both posit and negatives, the optim slim classifi would be: “rearrest 
= sign(1− 2a1 − 2a2).” In contrast, the margin of the current formul is: “rearrest = sign(1− a1 − a2)”, 
which us small coefficients, and produc a slightli simpler model. 

3.4. activ set polish 
On larg datasets, IP solver may take long time to produc an optim solut or provid user with a 
certif of optimality. here, we present a polish procedur that can be use to improv the qualiti of 
solut locally. for a fix set of features, thi procedur optim the valu of coefficients. 

the polish procedur take a input a feasibl set of coeffici from the slim IP λfeasible, and return 
a polish set of coeffici λpolish by solv a a simpler IP formul show in (5). the polish IP 
onli optim the coeffici of featur that belong to the activ set of λfeasible: that is, the set of featur 
with nonzero coeffici A := 

{ 
j : λfeasiblej 6= 0 

} 
. the coeffici for featur that do not belong to the 

activ set be fix to zero so that λj = 0 for j /∈ A. In thi way, the optim no longer involv featur 
selection, and the formul becom much easi to solve.

the polish IP formul be especi fast to solv to optim for classif problem with binari 
input variabl becaus thi limit the number of loss constraints. say for instanc that we wish to polish a 
set of coeffici with onli 5 nonzero variables, then there be at most |{−1,+1}| × |{0, 1}5| = 64 possibl 
uniqu data points, and thu the same number of possibl loss constraints. 

In our experi in section 4, we use the polish procedur on all of the feasibl solut we find 
from the earli formulation. In all cases, we can solv the polish IP to optim within a few second 
(i.e. a mipgap of 0.0%). 

4. experiment result 

In thi section, we compar the accuraci and interpret of recidiv predict model from slim to 
model from 8 other popular classif methods. In section 4.1, we explain the experiment setup use 
for all the methods. In section 4.2, we compar the predict accuraci of the method with the auc valu 
and roc curves. In section 4.3 and 4.4, we evalu the interpret of the models. finally, in section 
4.5, we present the score system gener by slim. 

4.1. methodolog 
In what follow we discu cost-sensit classif for imbalanc problems, provid an overview of 
techniques. 

4.1.1. evalu predict accuraci for imbalanc problem 
the major of classif problem that we consid be imbalanced, where the data contain a rel 
small number of exampl from one class and a rel larg number of exampl from the other. 



interpret classif model for recidiv predict 13 

imbalanc problem necessit chang in the way that we evalu the perform of classif 
models. consider, for instance, a heavili imbalanc problem such a fatal violenc where onli p(yi = 
+1) = 0.7% of individu be arrest within 3 year of be releas from prison. In thi case, a method 
that maxim overal classif accuraci be like to produc a trivial model that predict no one will be 
arrest for fatal offens – a result that be not surpris give that the trivial model be 99.3% accur on the 
overal population. unfortunately, thi model will never be abl to identifi individu that will be arrest 
for a fatal offense, and therefor be 0% accur on the popul of interest. 

To provid a measur of classif model perform on imbalanc problems, we ass the accuraci 
of a model on the posit and neg class separately. In our experiments, we report the class-bas 
accuraci of each model use the true posit rate (tpr), which reflect the accuraci on the posit class, 
and the fals posit rate (fpr), which reflect the error rate on neg class. for a give classif 
model, we comput these quantiti a 

tpr = 
1 

N+ 

∑ 
i∈i+ 

1 [ŷi = +1] and fpr = 
1 

N− 

∑ 
i∈i− 

1 [ŷi = +1] , 

where ŷi denot the predict outcom for exampl i, N+ denot the number of exampl in the posit 
class I+ = {i : yi = +1}, and N− denot the number of exampl from the neg class I− = {i : yi = 
−1}. ideally, a classif model should have high tpr and low fpr (i.e., tpr close to 1 and fpr = 0). 

most classif method can be adapt to yield a model that be more accur on the posit class, 
but onli if we be will to sacrific some accuraci on exampl from the neg class, and vice-versa. 
To illustr the trade-off of classif accuraci between posit and neg classes, we plot all model 
produc by a give method a point on a receiv oper characterist (roc) curve, which plot the tpr 
on the vertic axi and the fpr on the horizont axis. have construct an roc curve, we then ass 
the overal perform of each method by calcul the area under the roc curv (auc).2 A detail 
discuss of roc analysi in recidiv predict can be found in the work of maloof (2003). 

4.1.2. fit model over the full roc curv use a cost-sensit approach 
differ applic requir predict model at differ point of the roc curve. model for sentencing, 
for example, need low fpr in order to avoid predict that a low-risk individu will reoffend. model 
for screening, however, need high tpr in order to captur a mani high-risk individu a possible. In 
our experiments, we use a cost-sensit approach to produc classif model at differ point of the 
roc curv (see e.g., berk, 2010, 2011). thi approach involv control the accuraci on the posit and 
neg class by tune the misclassif cost for exampl in each class. In what follows, we denot 
the misclassif cost on exampl from the posit and neg class a W+ and w−, respectively. 
As we increas w+, the cost of make a mistak on a posit exampl increases, and we expect to obtain a 
model that classifi the posit exampl more accur (i.e. with high tpr). We choos W+ and W− 

so that W+ + W− = 2. thus, when W+ = 2, we obtain a trivial model that predict ŷi = +1 and attain 
tpr = 1. when W+ = 0, we obtain a trivial model that predict ŷi = −1 that attain fpr = 0. 

4.1.3. choic of classif method 
We compar slim score system to model produc by eight popular classif methods, includ 
those previous use for recidiv predict (see section 1.2) or those that rank among the “top 10 
algorithm in data mining” (wu et al., 2008). In choos these methods, we restrict our attent to 
method that have publicly-avail softwar packages, and allow user to specifi misclassif cost for 
posit and neg classes. our final choic of method includes: 

• c5.0 tree and c5.0 rules: c5.0 be an updat version of the popular c4.5 algorithm (quinlan, 2014; 
kuhn and johnson, 2013) that can creat decis tree and rule sets. 

2we note that auc be a summari statist that be frequent misus in the context of classif problems. It be true 
that a method that with auc = 1 alway produc model that be more accur than a method with auc = 0. other 
than thi simpl case, however, it be not possibl to state that a method with high auc alway produc model that be 
more accur than a method with low auc.

• classif and regress tree (cart): cart be a popular method to creat decis tree 
through recurs partit of the input variabl (breiman et al., 1984). 

• L1 and l2-penal logist regression: variant of logist regress that penal the coeffici 
to prevent overfit (friedman et al., 2010). l1-penal method be typic use to creat linear 
model that be spars (tibshirani, 1996; hesterberg et al., 2008). the L2 regular method be call 
“ridge” and be not gener sparse. 

• random forests: A popular black-box method that make predict use a larg ensembl of weak 
classif trees. the method be origin develop by breiman (2001b) but be wide use for 
recidiv predict (see e.g., berk et al., 2009; ritter, 2013). 

• support vector machines: A popular black-box method for non-parametr linear classification. the 
radial basi function (rbf) kernel let the method to handl classif problem where the decision- 
boundari may be non-linear (see e.g., cristianini and shawe-taylor, 2000; berk and bleich, 2014). 

• stochast gradient boosting: A popular black-box method that creat predict model in the form 
of an ensembl of weaker predict model (friedman, 2001; freund and schapire, 1997). 

4.1.4. detail on experiment design, paramet tuning, and comput 
We summar the methods, software, and set that we use in our experi in tabl 4. 

for each of the 6 recidiv predict problem and each of the 9 methods, we construct roc curv by 
run the algorithm with 19 valu ofw+. the valu ofw+ be chosen to produc model across the full 
roc curves. By default, we chose valu of W+ ∈ {0.1, 0.2, . . . , 1.9} and set W− = 2−w+. these valu 
ofw+ be inappropri for problem with a signific class imbal a all method produc trivial mod- 
els. thus, for significantli imbalanc problems, such a domest violenc and sexual violence, we 
use valu of W+ ∈ {1.815, 1.820, . . . , 1.995}. for fatal violence, which be extrem imbalanced, 
we use W+ ∈ {1.975, 1.976, . . . , 1.995}. 

thi setup requir u to produc a total of 1,026 recidiv predict model (6 recidiv problems× 9 
method × 19 imbal ratios). each of the 1,026 model be built on a train set and their perform 
be assess out-of-sample. In particular, 1/3 of the data be reserv a the test set. the remain 2/3 of 
the data be the train set. dure training, we use 5-fold nest cross-valid (5-cv) for paramet 
tuning. explicitly, the train data be split into 5 folds, and one of those 5 be reserv a the valid 
fold. the valid fold be rotat in order to select free paramet values, and a final model be train on 
the full train set (2/3) with the select paramet valu and it perform be assess on the test set 
(1/3). the fold be gener onc to allow for comparison across method and predict problems. the 
paramet be chosen dure nest cross valid to minim the mean weight 5-cv valid error 
on the train set. have obtain a set of 19 differ model for each method and each problem, we then 
construct an roc curv for that method on that problem by plot the test tpr and test fpr of the 19 
final models. 

We train all baselin method use publicli avail packag in R 3.2.2 (R core team, 2015) without 
impos ani time constraints. In comparison, we train slim by solv integ program problem 
(ip) with the cplex 12.6 api in matlab 2013a. We solv each IP through the follow procedure: (i) 
we train the solver on the formul in section 3.3 for a total of 4 hour on a local comput cluster 
with 2.7ghz cpus. each time we solv a IP we kept 500 feasibl solutions, and polish them use the 
formul in section 3.4. We then use the same nest cross-valid procedur a the other method 
to tune the number of term in the final model. polish all 500 solut take less than one minut of 
comput time. thus, the total number of optim problem we solv be 500 polish ip’ × (5 
fold + 1 final model) × 6 problem × 19 valu of W+ = 342,000 integ program problems.

We make the follow import observations, which we believ carri over to a larg class of problem 
beyond recidiv prediction: 

• all method do well on the gener recidiv predict problem arrest. In thi case, we observ 
onli small differ in predict accuraci of differ methods: all method other than cart at- 
tain a test auc abov 0.72; the high test auc of 0.73 be achiev by sgb, ridge, and rf. thi 
multipl of good model reflect the rashomon effect of breiman (2001b). 

• major differ between method appear in their perform on imbalanc predict problems. 
We expect differ method to respond differ to chang in the misclassif costs, and 
therefor train each method over a larg rang of possibl misclassif costs. even so, it be 
difficult (if not impossible) to tune certain method to produc model at certain point of the roc 
curv (see e.g., problem with signific imbalance, such a fatal violence). 

• svm rbf, sgb, lasso and ridg be abl to produc accur model at differ point on the roc 
curv for most problems. sgb usual achiev the high auc on most problem (e.g., arrest, 
drug, gener violence, domest violence, fatal violence). lasso, ridge, and svm rbf 
often produc compar aucs. We find that these method respond well to cost-sensit tuning, but it 
be difficult to tune the misclassif cost for highli imbalanc problems, such a fatal violence, 
to get model at specif point on the roc curve. 

• c5.0t, c5.0r and cart be unabl to produc accur model at differ point on the roc curv 
on ani imbalanc problems. We found that these method do not respond well to cost-sensit tun- 
ing. the issu becom markedli more sever a problem becom more imbalanced. for drug 
and gener violence, for instance, these method could not produc model with high tpr. for 
fatal violence, sexual violence, and domest violence, these method almost alway pro- 
duce trivial model that predict y = −1 (result in auc of 0.5). thi result may be attribut to 
the greedi natur of the algorithm use to fit the trees, a oppos to the use of tree model in general. 
the issu be unlik to be software-rel a it affect both c5.0 and cart, and have be observ by 
other (see e.g., goh and rudin, 2014). thi problem might not occur if tree be good optimized. 



16 zeng, ustun, and rudin 

• In general, slim produc model that be close to or on the effici frontier of the roc curve, despit 
be restrict to a rel small class of simpl linear model (at most 8 non-zero coeffici from - 
10 to 10). even on highli imbalanc problem such a domest violenc and sexual violence, 
it respond well to chang in misclassif cost (a expected, by natur of it formulation). 

In addit to predict accuracy, we also examin the risk calibr of the models. figur 2 show the 
risk calibr for arrest, construct use the bin method from zadrozni and elkan (2002). We 
includ calibr plot for all other problem in appendix B. We see that slim be well-calibrated, even 
though there be no reason it should be; it be a decision-mak tool, not a risk assess tool. for arrest, 
lasso and ridg be well-calibrated; however, they lose thi qualiti onc we consid onli spars model (see 
appendix d). thi properti would also be lose if the lasso and ridg coeffici be rounded.

4.3. trade-off between accuraci and interpret 
In appendix C, we show that the baselin method be unabl to maintain the same level of accuraci a they 
have in section 4.2 when their model size be constrained. for lasso, ridg and slim, model size be defin 
a the number of featur in the model. for cart and c5.0, model size be the number of leaf or rules. In 
fact, we find the onli method that can consist produc accur model along the full roc curv and 
also have the potenti for interpret be slim and (non-sparse) lasso. 

tree and rule-bas method such a cart, c5.0t and c5.0r be gener unabl to produc mod- 
el that attain high degre of accuracy. worse, even for balanc problem such a arrest, where these 
method do produc accur models, the model be complic and use a veri larg number of rule or 
leaf (similar behavior for c5.0t/c5.0r be also observ by, for instance, lim et al., 2000). As we show in 
appendix C, it be not reason possibl to obtain a c5.0r/c5.0t/cart model with at most 8 rule or 8 
leaf for almost everi predict problem. 

4.4. On the interpret of equal accur transpar model 
To ass the interpret of differ models, we provid a comparison of predict model produc 
by slim, lasso and cart for the arrest problem in figur 3–5. thi setup provid a nice basi for 
comparison a all three method produc model at roughli the same decis point, and with the same degre 
of sparsity. for thi comparison, we consid ani transpar model with at most 8 coeffici (lasso), 8 
rule (c5.0r) or 8 leaf (c5.0t, cart) and have a test fpr of below 50%. We report the model with the 
minimum weight test error. here, neither c5.0r nor c5.0t could produc an accept model with at most 
8 rule or 8 leaves, so onli model from slim, cart and lasso could be displayed. As describ before, it 
be rare for lasso and cart to produc model with a similar degre of accuraci to slim when model size be 
constrained. We make the follow observations: 

• all three model attain similar level of predict accuracy. test tpr valu rang between 70-79% 
and test fpr valu rang between 43-48%. there may not exist a classif model that can attain 
substanti high accuracy. 

• the slim model us 5 input variabl and small integ coeffici (see e.g., figur 3). there be a natur 
rule-bas interpretation. In thi case, the model impli that if the prison be young (age at releas of 18 to 24) 
or have a histori of arrest (prior arrests≥5), he be highli like to be rearrested. On the other hand, if he be 
rel old (age at release≥40) or have no histori of arrest (no prior arrests), he be unlik to commit 
anoth crime. 

• the cart model also allow user to make predict without a calculator. In comparison to the slim 
model, however, the hierarch structur of the cart model make it difficult to gaug the relationship of 
each input variabl on the predict outcome. consider, for instance, the relationship between age at releas 
and the outcome. In thi case, user be immedi awar that there be an effect, a the model branch 
on the variabl age at release≥40 and age at releas 18 to 24. however, the effect be difficult to compre- 
hend sinc it depend on prior arrest for misdemeanor: if prior arrests≥5 = 1 and age at releas 18 to 24 
= 1 then the model predict ŷ = +1; if prior arrests≥5 = 0 and age at release≥40 = 0 then ŷ = +1; how- 
ever, if prior arrests≥5 = 0 and age at release≥40 = 1 then ŷ = +1 onli if prior arrest for misdemeanor 
= 1. such issu do not affect linear model such a slim and lasso, where user can immedi gaug 
the direct and strength of the relationship between a input variabl and the predict outcom by the size 
and sign of a coefficient. the literatur on interpret in machin learn indic that interpret 
be domain-specific; there be some domain where logic model be prefer over linear models, and vice 
versa (e.g., freitas, 2014).

4.5. score system for recidiv predict 
We show a slim score system for each of the predict problem that we consid in figur 6–10. 
the model be chosen at specif decis points, with the constraint that 5-cv fpr≤ 50% except for 
sexual violence, which be chosen at 5-cv fpr≤ 20%. the model present here may be suitabl for 
screen tasks. To obtain a model suitabl for sentencing, a point on the roc curv with a much high tpr 
would be needed. We note that these model gener well from the dataset, evid by the close match 
between test tpr/fpr (tabl 5) and train tpr/fpr (tabl 6). 

mani of these model exhibit the same “rule-like” tendenc discuss in section 4.4. for example, the 
model for drug in figur 6 predict that a person will be arrest for a drug-rel offens if he/sh have 
ever have ani prior drug offenses. similarly, model for sexual violenc in figur 9 effect state that 
a person will be rearrest for a sexual offens if and onli if he/sh have prior histori of sexual crimes. for

5. discuss 

our paper merg two perspect on recidiv modeling: the first be to obtain accur predict model 
use the most power machin learn tool available, and the second be to creat model that be easi to 
use and understand. 

We use a set of featur that be commonli access to polic offic and judges, and compar the 
abil of differ machin learn method to produc model at differ decis point across the roc 
curve. our result suggest that it be possibl for tradit methods, such a ridg regression, to perform just 
a well a more modern methods, such a stochast gradient boost – a find that be in line with the work 
of tollenaar and van der heijden (2013) and yang et al. (2010). further, we found that even simpl model 
may perform surprisingli well, even when they be fit from a heavili constrain space – a find that be 
in line with work on the surpris perform of simpl model (see e.g., dawes, 1979; holte, 1993, 2006). 

our studi show that there may be major advantag of use slim for recidiv prediction, a it can 
depend produc a simpl score system that be accur and interpret on ani decis point along the 
roc curve. interpret be crucial for mani of the high-stak applic where recidiv predict 
model be be used. In such applications, it be not enough for the decision-mak to know what input 
variabl be be use to train the model, or how individu input variabl be relat to the outcome; 
decision-mak should know how the model combin all the input variabl to gener it predictions, 
and whether thi mechan align with their ethic values. slim not onli show thi mechanism, but 
also accommod constraint that be design to align the predict model with the ethic valu of the 
decision-maker. 

In comparison to current machin learn methods, the main drawback of run slim be increas com- 
putat involv in solv an integ program problem. To thi end, we propos two new techniqu 
to reduc comput involv in train high qualiti slim score systems: (i) a polish procedur that 
improv the qualiti of feasibl solut found by an IP solver; and (ii) an IP formul that make it easi 
for an IP solver to provid a certif of optimality. In our experiments, the time requir to train slim be 
ultim compar to the time requir to train random forest or stochast gradient boosting. however, 
it be still signific compar to the time requir for other method such a cart, c5.0 and penal 
logist regression. In theory, the comput requir to find an optim solut to the slim integ pro- 
gram be np-hard, mean that the runtim increas exponenti with the number of features. In practice, 
the runtim depend on sever factors: such a the number of samples, the number of dimensions, the un- 
derli eas of the classification, and how the data be encoded. sinc most criminolog problem cannot 
by natur involv massiv dataset (sinc each observ be a person), and sinc comput speed of solv 
mip be also increas exponentially, it be possibl that mathemat program techniqu like slim be 
well-suit for criminolog problem that be substanti larg and more complex than the one discuss 
in thi work.

B. model-bas comparison 

In section 4, we includ a comparison of transpar model produc for the arrest problem. here, we 
includ a similar comparison for all other recidiv predict problems. 

the model and calibr plot show here correspond to the best model we produc use lasso and 
ridg (i.e., the one that be plot a point in figur 1). We omit cart and c5.0 model be show 
becaus all model that be produc be either trivial or contain too mani leaf to be printed. for 
ani give problem, the model oper at similar decis point (tpr), and be constrain to the same fpr 
criterion a in section 4.5. 

note that the calibr plot will appear to be flat for problem with signific class imbalance. typi- 
cally, a well-calibr classifi on a problem without class imbal should fall on the x = y line. however, 
becaus the y-axi be defin a P (y = +1|s(x) = s), where s be predict score of a model, the slope of 
the graph will be less than P (y = +1) by definition. therefore, for a highli imbalanc problem such a 
fatal violence, where P (y = +1) = 0.7%, the plot will be flat.

C. addit result on the trade-off between accuraci and interpret 

In the experi in section 4, we use slim to fit model from a highli constrain space (i.e., model with 
at most 8 non-zero integ coeffici between -10 and 10). here, we present evid to show that baselin 
method cannot attain the same level of accuraci or risk calibr when they be use to fit model from a 
slightli less constrain model space (i.e, model with at most 8 non-zero coefficients, 8 leaf or 8 rules). 

tabl 8 show the test auc of each method when they be use to fit a model with a model size of 8 
or less. trivial model of size 1 be also omitted. tabl 9 show the percentag chang in test auc for 
the method due to the model size restriction. for all model other than slim, the predict accuraci be 
compromis with the size constraint. We see that c5.0r and c5.0t be unabl to produc a suitabl spars 
model for some of the problem sinc their implement do not provid control over model sparsity. note 
that we have omit result for ridg becaus it could not produc a model with few than 8 coeffici for 
all predict problem (see section 4.4 for explanation).

E. On the predict accuraci of baselin method with continu input variabl 

In our experi in section 4, we ran all method with a dataset compos exclus of binari input 
variables. that is, for each featur in the origin databas (e.g., prior arrests), we deriv binari variabl 
(e.g., no prior arrests, prior arrest ≥ 1 and so on) and train each method use these binari variables. 
It be possibl that machin learn method could potenti be hinder by thi remov of information. 
here, we investig how the predict accuraci of the baselin method would have be affect have we run 
these method use continu input variabl (appendix e.1) or both binari and continu input variabl 
(appendix e.2). In both cases, we find that the chang in variabl encod result in a minor differ in 
performance. 

e.1. chang in predict accuraci use onli continu input variabl 
instead of use 48 input variables, we now have 25 continu variables. tabl 10 summar the test auc 
for all method on all predict problem when we use onli continu input variables. tabl 11 show the 
percentag chang in test auc due to thi chang in encod (i.e. from binari input variabl to continu 
input variables). the larg increas in predict accuraci be 4.6% for cart and 7.7% for svm rbf, 
while the big decreas in accuraci be −19.6% for rf. 

our result suggest that there be no uniform gain/loss in perform for most of the methods: for ani 
give method, the test auc increas slightli for at least one problem, and decreas slightli for at least 
another. among the methods, cart saw the most uniform improvement, perform slightli good on 5 out 
of the 6 problem when continu variabl be use (though cart still perform poorli compar to other 
methods).

e.2. chang in predict accuraci use both binari and continu input variabl 
instead of the origin 48 variables, we now use a combin of 66 binari and continu variables. tabl 12 
summar the test auc for all method on all predict problem when we use both binari and continu 
input variables. tabl 13 show the percentag chang in test auc due to thi chang in encod (i.e., from 
binari input variabl to both binari and continu input variables). most method saw a slight auc increas 
due to the addit of continu variables, rang from 0.2–6.3%. the most signific increas be 3.3% 
for cart and 6.3% for c5.0t, while the larg decreas be −16.0% for rf. In addit to rf, ridg and

F. associ rule 

We produc insight more extens than those in section 2.4 by mine associ rules. associ rules, 
also know a “if-then” rules, be small predict model that can be produc use search techniqu or 
optim techniques. 

f.1. terminolog 
high qualiti associ rule be character by larg valu of support, confidence, and lift. To defin 
thi terminology, consid a rule such a “if a then b.” We denot thi rule also a a → b. the support of 
a → b be the empir probabl P̂ (a and b), that is, the proport of observ where the condit a 
and b be both satisfied. the confid of a → b be the empir probabl P̂ (b|a), that is, the proport 
of observ for which condit b be satisfi give a be satisfied. the lift of a → b be the ratio P̂ (b|a) 

P̂ (b) 
. 

lift measur the abil of condit a to “target” the popul where condit b be satisfied: if the lift of 
a → b be equal to 1, then outcom b could be predict equal well if we have assum that a and b be 
independent; if the lift of a→ b great than 1 then event a have some effect on predict event b. 

To illustr these concepts, consid the follow associ rule: 

IF age at releas 18 to 24 and prior arrests≥5 then y = +1. 
the support of thi rule be 0.07, which mean that 7% of prison be releas from prison between the 
age of 18 to 24, have at least 5 prior arrests, and be arrest within 3 year of be releas from prison. 
the confid of thi rule be 0.83, which mean that if a prison be releas from prison between the age 
of 18 to 24 and have at least 5 prior arrests, then there be an 83% chanc that thi person would be arrest 
within 3 year of be releas from prison. lastly, the lift of thi rule be 1.41, which mean that prison 
releas from prison between the age of 18 to 24 and have at least 5 prior arrest have a high chanc of 
be rearrest than other prisoners, i.e., the prison age at releas and arrest histori make the condit 
probabl of arrest 1.41 time high than if arrest be independ of these conditions. 

f.2. rule mine 
We list 24 interest associ rule for the arrest problem in tabl 14. these rule be gener with 
the apriori method in the arul packag in R 3.1.1 (hahsler et al., 2014). note that the choic of packag 
do not matter, a mine rule through search techniqu be deterministic, so all packag produc the same 
rules. 

here, the IF condit be formul use combin of input variabl (i.e. xj = 1 and xk = 1) and 
the then condit be that a prison be arrest within 3 year of be releas from prison (i.e. a posit 
outcom y = +1). the rule in tabl 14 have the high level of lift and confid with a minimum support 
of 5% (i.e., the rule appli to at least 1690 of the 33796 prison in our dataset). thi threshold valu be 
chosen so the rule do not reflect spuriou correlations. rule A – E be produc by mine the most 
power single-vari predictor for arrest. rule A – E attain the high lift among one-vari rule 
with a support of at least 5% and a confid of at least 0.70. rule F – X be produc by mine two- 
variabl rule that use at least one of the input variabl from rule A – E that attain the high possibl lift, 
a well a support at least 5% and confid at least 0.75. out of all these rules, rule F perform the best with 
a confid of 0.83 and a lift of 1.41. As it turn out, rule F be often exploit by some of the best model 
we find for arrest, a we often find pattern similar to “age at releas 18 to 24 and prior arrests≥5” in 
our predict model (see e.g., figur 5 in section 4.4). 

interest observ can also be make from the discov rules. recal that jail be a much less sever 
punish than prison. consid rule L and rule M in tabl 14, we can see that prison with multipl 
jail time and have ani past probat or fine be just a like to be arrest a those with multipl jail time 
and multipl prior prison record – despit multipl prior prison time be a indic of much more sever 
past action than ani prior probat or fine. 

f.3. fall rule list for imbalanc problem 
As we discu in section 4.2, it be difficult to use tradit tree and rule-bas method to creat non-trivi 
model on imbalanc classif problem such a sexual violence. thi be possibl becaus these

algorithm employ greedi split and prune procedures. here, we aim to show that there exist rule-bas 
model that perform well on such problem by train fall rule list (wang and rudin, 2015). 

fall rule list be order list of if-then rules. the confid of each rule decreas a we go 
down the list. In thi way, the high rule appli to the group of individu that have the high risk, the 
second high rule appli to a group of individu with the second high risk, and so on. the algorithm 
that produc fall rule list global optim the list, without greedi split and pruning. 

We present a fall rule list for the arrest problem in tabl 15, learn from the algorithm of wang 
and rudin (2015). thi model be train use rule with at most two input variabl and a support of at 
least 5%. the rule list within thi model have the form “if a then b” where b denot a posit outcom 
y = +1. In tabl 15, support refer to the percentag of remain exampl that satisfi the IF condit and 
probabl refer to percentag of these exampl where the outcom variabl be positive. thi model show 
that the high risk prison be those who be releas between age 18 and 24, and who have at least 
5 prior arrest – thi be align with the associ rule (rule F) that we found in section f.2. onc those 
individu be removed, the second high risk prison be 25–29 year old with at least 5 prior arrests, 
etc. the risk of each group decreas a one move down the rules. rule 15 repres the default rule. If an 
individu do not fall under ani of risk group determin by rule 1-14, then his/her risk of arrest be 0.21.

G. the impact of race 

As discuss earlier, we chose not to includ race a an input variabl in our predict problems. some 
studi have show that race be import for accur recidiv predict (petersilia and turner, 1987; 
berk, 2009). 

We want to know the answer to two questions. first, whether includ race a a featur would lead to 
more accur predictions. second, whether we could predict race from the featur that we alreadi had. If 
we could predict race well from our current set of features, thi would show that race inform could be 
implicitli includ in ani model we might construct. the result that follow show: (i) includ race do not 
substanti increas predict accuraci for our problems, and (ii) race can be predict fairli well from the 
featur we alreadi have. these result indic that most of the inform necessari to predict recidiv 
be alreadi includ in the featur we have, and these featur also includ relev inform for predict 
race. 

To address whether race provid an increas in accuraci for predict recidivism, we re-ran all method 
other than slim on all new version of each predict problem that includ three addit race-rel 
input variables: white, black, hispanic. An overview of these variabl can be see in tabl 16. tabl 17 
present the models’ test auc when race-rel indic variabl be included. tabl 18 repres the 
percentag increas in auc when compar to 5. As shown, the differ for most method be negligible. 
In the case of svm rbf and ridge, the accuraci increas slightly. In the case of rf, includ race 
decreas accuraci (most like becaus it exacerb the overfit problem). 

To determin whether race could be predict from the current variables, we use three differ race 
option (white, black, and hispanic) a outcom and predict each race a a function of our features. roc 
plot be provid in figur 17, show that race can be predict much good than random guessing. thi be 
not a surprise, a we alreadi know that black tend to have longer crimin histori than whites. On the other 
hand, we remark that we could not predict race perfectli with the featur we have - in fact, our predict 
(for all methods) be far from perfect. thi mean that not all of the inform about race be contain in 
the featur we have.
