all-opt oper hold promis a the futur of comput technology, and key com- 

ponent includ miniatur waveguid (wgs) and coupler that control narrow band- 

widths. nanowir (nws) offer an ideal platform for nanoscal wgs, but their util have 

be limit by the lack of a comprehens coupl scheme with band selectivity. here, we 

introduc a NW geometr superlattic (gsl) that allow narrow-band guid in Si nw 

through coupl of a mie reson with a bound-guid state (bgs). period diamet 

modul creat a mie-bgs-coupl excit that manifest a a scatter dark state 

with a pronounc scatter dip in the mie resonance. the frequenc of the coupl mode, 

tunabl from the visibl to near-infrared, be determin by the pitch of the gsl. use a 

combin gsl-wg system, we demonstr spectral select guid and optic 

switch and sens at telecommun wavelengths, highlight the potenti to use 

NW gsl for the design of on-chip optic components.

optic interconnect and logic element oper on thenanomet scale could enabl the leap into all-opticalcomput technology, which would allevi the band- 
width and energi consumpt limit of current technolo- 
gies1. for instance, dielectr waveguid (wgs) make on silicon- 
on-insul (soi) platform have be wide explor for car- 
ry and modul optic signals2; however, they be confin 
to a planar geometry, and coupl light into and out of these 
structur reli on convent grate coupler that be often 
order of magnitud larg in size than the wgs3,4. nanowir 
(nws)5 offer an altern platform on which to design dielectr 
wg at exactli the diffract limit in an optim cylindr 
geometry6–9. nw enabl the guid of light in flexible, non- 
planar, three-dimension geometries, and permit the addit of 
conform clad materi includ dielectr and metals10. 
despit these advantages, in-coupl of light to NW wg 
remain problemat and have reli on scatter at NW end 
facets6,7 or end-on parallel coupl to the nws8,9 becaus there 
be no comprehens light coupl scheme for a NW geometry. 
moreover, exist method be not spectral selective, limit 
their util for applic where mode-select be important. 
given that nw be also well know to exhibit strong mie 
resonances11,12, there have be effort to explor the connect 
between mie reson and guid modes13. however, becaus 
of momentum mismatch, guid mode be by their natur 
inaccess optic bound states14 under normal incid light, 
leav the opportun for interplay between a mie and guid 
mode a yet obscure. 

nanoscal system often exhibit uniqu light-matt interac- 
tions15 when the geometr and composit design of a system 
caus complex wave interfer effects, which can includ fano 
resonances16, electromagnet induc transpar (eit)17, 
and scatter dark states18,19. A fano reson aris from 
weak coupl between two reson with differ damp 

rates, creat an abrupt spectral featur in the optic response. 
eit and scatter dark state origin from oppositely-ori 
radi reson that destruct interfer with each other in 
the far field17–21. the same optic effect can occur in system 
with a near-field interact between a super-radiant, bright 
mode and a sub-radiant, dark mode22,23. In thi case, an exchang 
of energi between the mode result in a coupl excit of the 
bright and dark state, caus an abrupt fano-lik or eit-lik 
featur in the optic response. far-field and near-field interac- 
tion be usual interchang framework that can describ 
the same phenomenon with a differ basi set18,24. these spectral 
featur be often gener through geometr perturb of a 
nanostructur to break spatial symmetry, caus a previous 
dark state to be accessed17,22,25,26. 

here, we show that a NW geometr superlattic (gsl), which 
break the infinit translat symmetri of a nw, can coupl a 
mie reson with a bound-guid state (bgs) of the nw. 
complementari to report on bound state in the continuum 
(bic)14, which describ the appear of bound state abov the 
light cone, we select access one normal inaccess bg 
from a continuum of convent bound state below the light 
cone by precis modul the NW geometry. As a result, a 
sharp, fano-lik featur that can be assign a a scatter dark 
state appear in the mie scatter spectrum at the wavelength of 
the bgs. the geometr depend of both the mie reson 
and bg provid broadband tune of the effect from visibl 
through near-infrar wavelengths. We experiment demon- 
strate the appear of scatter dark state from NW gsl and 
show select guid of light up to telecommun wave- 
length with a fourier-transform-limit bandwidth. thi report 
be the first demonstr of mie-bg coupl and select 
narrow-band guid in a NW WG system. In addition, we show 
that the coupl wavelength be highli sensit to the local

mie-bg coupl in a NW gsl. the geometri of a NW gsl, 
illustr in fig. 1a, be uniqu defin by three geometr 
parameters, the pitch (p), outer diamet (d), and etch diamet 
(e), and be compos of equal space cylindr segment of 
modul diamet (δ= d− e), where each segment have an axial 
length of p/2. We consid thi structur illumin at normal 
incid under TM polar with the magnet (h) and 
electr (e) field perpendicular and parallel, respectively, to the 
NW axis. figur 1b schemat illustr coupl between the 
two eigenmod in a NW geometry, a mie reson that 
strongli coupl with a free-spac plane wave and a bg select 
from the continuum. here, we consid the criterion for an ideal 
bound state to be absenc of loss, absenc of extern coupling, 
and time invari of energi within the structure. thus, for a 
NW system, the ideal bg refer to a stand wave with 
amplitud Ag form by the superposit of two counter- 
propag guid modes, ag= [ar(x,z)b(y)exp(ikg,l(y- 
y0) − iωgt)+ al(x,z)b(y)exp(−ikg,l(y− y0)− iωgt)], with the 
same angular frequenc (ωg) and longitudin wavevector (kg,l), 
where y be spatial posit along the NW axis, y0 be the spatial 
origin chosen to coincid with the center of a gsl segment, ar(x, 
z) and al(x,z) be the cross-sect amplitud of right- and left- 
propag guid modes, respectively, (with ar=al, for an 
ideal bgs), b(y) be the longitudin envelop function (with b(y) 
= constant, for an ideal bgs), i be the imaginari unit (i2=−1), 
and t be time. note that thi express will also describ a con- 
vention guid mode if either Ar or Al be zero. for a perfect 
cylind (δ= 0), the mie and bg mode be orthogon and 
incap of coupl to one another. for a gsl (δ > 0), we 
consid a non-zero coupl frequency, ωc, between a mie 
reson center at ωm and a bg center at ωg. for normal 
incid illumination, the coupl be non-zero onli for the ωg 
with a kg,l that match the geometr defin p (i.e., kg,l= 
2πm/p, where m= 1, 3, 5, …) becaus these frequenc experi- 
enc coher amplif wherea mismatch one vanish. 
thus, the structur behav a a fourier selector in which onli the 
spatial frequenc components, includ high mth order odd 
harmon (supplementari fig. 1), match to the structur be 
coupl to a bgs. 

figur 1c show numer calcul scatter effici 
(qsca, see method for details) spectrum (solid lines) and 
analyt calcul spectrum (dash lines) deriv from 
tempor coupled-mod theori (tcmt)18,27 for a uniform NW 
(label p∞) and three NW gsl of vari p. the domin 
peak in the uniform NW spectrum correspond to the 
fundament tm11 magnet dipolar mie reson (directli 
relat to the he11 guid mode13) center at ωm. for the gsl, 
in contrast, a sharp and pronounc scatter dip (label ωg for 
p420) be observ within the mie resonance. the calcul field 
profil at ωg (fig. 1f) exhibit a stand wave with antinod 
center on each cylindr segment (see also a time-laps 
anim in supplementari movi 1). thi stand wave profil 
correspond to the bgs. for shorter (p360) and longer (p500) 
valu of p, the scatter dip shift to the blue or red of ωm, 
respectively; nevertheless, the same stand wave profil be 
observ at the scatter dip for all valu of p (supplementari 
fig. 2). the peak to the blue and red of the scatter dip in 
fig. 1c (label ω+ and ω−, respectively, for p420) exhibit mode 
profil (fig. 1d, e) with antinod center onli on the small or 
larg diamet segments, respectively, and these profil be also 
preserv for everi valu of p (supplementari fig. 2). 

substanti larg valu of p shift ωg off the mie reson 
envelope, caus the scatter dip to disappear and no power to 
be transfer to the bg (supplementari fig. 3). In addition, a 
tilt of the incom plane wave provid a non-zero momentum 
along the NW axis, caus the bg scatter dip to split into 
two separ dip domin by a right- and left-propag bg 
state (supplementari fig. 4); however, we focu onli on normal 
incid illumin in thi study. 

the featur of the mie–bg coupl can be account for

where Am be the mie reson amplitude, γm and γg be radi 
decay rate for the mie reson and bgs, S+ be the incom 
wave, and km be the coupl coeffici to the incom wave. 
here, we have neglect absorpt contribut and neglect 
an off-diagon radi coupl term, γc. the outgo wave, 
s−, can be express a s−= s++ dmam, where dm be the 
coupl coeffici to the outgo wave. the coupl 
coeffici of the bg to the incom and outgo wave be 
set to zero under normal incid illumination, which assum 
that γg be small compar to γm. In a perfectli cylindr NW 
geometri (δ= 0), coupl between the mie reson and bg 
do not occur, and ωc and γg be both zero, leav both 
reson unaffect and the bg complet dark. however, in 
the case of a NW gsl, both paramet be non-zero, and 
scatter cross-sect calcul use eq. (1) be plot in 
fig. 1c a dot lines. analyt paramet be summar in 
supplementari tabl 1 and be determin by a fit to the 
numer simul consid energi conserv and time 
revers symmetry18, reproduc the spectral featur in the 
numer results. note that the scatter dip do not go to zero 
becaus of the introduct of loss in the guid mode (γg > 0; see 
supplementari fig. 5). the good agreement of numer and 
tcmt result valid the assign of the scatter dip a a 
scatter dark state result from coupl between a mie 
reson and bgs. similar calcul with differ geome- 
trical paramet (supplementari fig. 6) show that the effect be 
fulli tunabl from visibl through infrar wavelength by 
chang d and p with a fix δ. 

diagon of the energi matrix in eq. (1) yield 
eigenfrequencies, ω+ and ω−, and the eigenmodes, Α+ and α−. 
If the scatter dip appear at the center of the mie reson 
(ωm= ωg; red curv in fig. 1c), the eigenmod be A± = Am ± ag, 
where Am correspond to a dipolar mie reson uniformli 
distribut across the axial length of the nw, and Ag be the 
standing-wav mode profil of the bgs. the eigenmod Α+ and 
Α− thu repres interfer between the mie reson and 
bgs, in which the axial uniform amplitud of the mie 
reson overpow the oscil amplitud of the bg with 
a rel phase shift of π for the two eigenmodes. thi result 
correspond to the numer calcul mode profil in 
fig. 1d, e for the adjac peak on the blue (ω+) and red (ω−) 
side of the scatter dip. thi eigenmod analysi can also 
justifi the assign of the scatter dip a a fano reson 
aris from the interact between a sharp bg and a broad 
mie background resonance.

increas of the qualiti factor, extrapol to infin a δ

magnitud (supplementari tabl 2) becaus access to the bound 
state vanishes. In contrast, a δ increas in magnitude, the 
linewidth significantli broaden and eventu bifurc into 
two distinct peak that align with the posit of ω+ and ω−. 
thi transit occur becaus the mie reson and bg be no 
longer weakli coupled, and instead two qualit new mode 
aris that be more repres of scatter from Si NW 
segment of distinct diameters. 

To experiment verifi the predict optic properti of 
NW gsls, a process term engrav (encod nanowir

use to fabric Si NW gsl nanostructur from the bottom-up

dopant switch frequenc dure the growth, and d and e be 
determin by the size of Au catalyst and post-growth etch 
duration, respectively. optim growth condit without Au 
loss from the catalyst36 yield nw exceed 500 μm in length 
with no undesir diamet variat (supplementari fig. 8).

reson that shift to longer wavelength with increas

includ the focu laser beam (see methods) agre well with the 
experiment measurements, confirm the presenc of mie-bg 
coupl and a scatter dark state in these nanostructures. 
however, the simul also reveal sever differ between 
focu excit and the plane wave excit model in 
fig. 1. first, the simul predict a scatter dip with a 
substanti larg linewidth, which can be attribut to the 
local excit caus a broader distribut of fourier

predict an extinct peak within the dip, which can be attribut 
to mode distort caus by the finit number of gsl period 
excit by the focu beam. mode degrad in truncat 
array be a common phenomenon observ in planar metamater- 
ial due to loss of coherence37,38. In our case, the finit beam

caus incomplet format of the bg and an increas in

chang with diamet at differ rates, the pitch p requir to 
center the bg on the mie reson shift to larg valu a the 
diamet of the NW increas and the frequenc decreases. In 
fig. 3a, thi shift can be visual a the intersect of the solid 
line (bg dispers relation) with the magenta dash line (mie 
reson position), which repres the degener point 
where ωm= ωg and provid a guidelin for the geometr design 
of a gsl to enabl optim mie-bg coupl at a give free- 
space wavelength. magenta diamond and black circl repres 
data point where the mode be and be not degenerate, 
respectively, a determin from numer simul of NW 
gsl spectrum in fig. 1c and supplementari fig. 6. the good 
align of these data point with the dispers relat 
confirm the geometr relationship between d and p for mie-bg 
coupling. 

To take advantag of the WG characteristics, we design a 
gsl-wg nw, illustr in fig. 3b, compos of a truncat 
gsl adjac to a long, uniform cylindr segment that can act 
a a lossless wg. the geometr paramet of the gsl be 
design to support mie-bg coupl in the near-infrar 
spectral region to avoid absorpt loss in si. numer 
simul for a gsl (d= 330 nm; e= 310 nm; p= 900 nm) 
with 10 period of the pitch illumin by a focu laser beam 
(fig. 3c) yield an extinct spectrum (fig. 3d) with a broad mie 
reson center at ~1500 nm and an extinct dip center at 
~1504 nm. A mie-bg coupl excit occur at the dip, and 
the numer simul show energi propag into the 
guid mode of the WG segment adjac to the gsl, a show 
by the magnet field profil in fig. 3c and supplementari 
movi 2. integr of the energi flux in the WG portion of the 
NW yield the guid spectrum show in fig. 3e. As expected, the 
spectral region guid in the NW correspond to the spectral 
region of the dip in the extinct spectrum. the guid 
bandwidth of ~46 nm be in good agreement with the expect 
fourier-transform-limit bandwidth of 48 nm for a gaussian 
beam with a full-width at half maximum of 7 μm. moreover, 
we calcul a maximum guid effici (qguided) of 0.82 
for coupl into the WG base on the ratio of the power 
measur at the end of the WG to the power incid on 
the project area of the gsl. thus, the near-un qguid 

highlight the high effici with which the mie-bg coupl 
mechan can funnel the energi associ with the strong 
light-matt interact of the mie reson into the guid 
mode of a nw. 

To experiment valid the expect guid characterist 
of a gsl-wg nw, we synthes nw with a gsl adjac to a 
50 μm WG segment, a illustr in fig. 4a. geometr 
paramet of the NW be chosen to support lossless guid 
at frequenc below the bandgap of si. becaus of infrar free 
carrier absorpt loss in heavily-dop n-type Si nws39, we 
adopt the doping-invert engrav process29,36 in which n- 
type rather than intrins segment be etch (see methods), 
allow the WG segment to be compos of intrins si. To 
experiment measur guid in the gsl-wg structure, an 
excit beam be focu on the gsl segment, and optic 
imag be collect to observ ani light emiss from the end 
of the WG segment, where light be expect to scatter after 
travers the 50 μmwg. figur 4c–e display optic imag of a 
gsl-wg structur illumin at three excit wavelengths. 
As appar from these images, WG light emiss be observ 
from the end of the WG segment for an excit wavelength of 
1455 nm but be not observ at wavelength of 1400 and 1550 nm. 

extinct spectrum be collect from both gsl and WG 
segment of nw with three distinct geometr paramet 
(fig. 4i–n) design to tune the mie-bg coupl from ~1300 to 
~1500 nm. As expected, the uniform-diamet WG segment 
show one mie reson wherea the gsl segment show a 
scatter dark state within the mie resonance. WG emiss 
spectra, a show in fig. 4o–q, be also experiment 
measur by integr the signal from the end of the wg 
(e.g., from the region denot by a dash circl in fig. 4b). the 
WG emiss spectrum show that guid occur over a select 
wavelength rang that correspond to the spectral posit of the 
scatter dip in the extinct spectra. the WG spectrum in 
fig. 4o be collect from the same NW imag in fig. 4b, and 
the spectrum show maxim WG intens in the 1450–1500 nm 
range, in agreement with the imag in fig. 4c–e. simul of 
qext and qguid spectrum be show a solid black line in fig. 4i–q 
and agre well with experiment measurements, confirm the 
fourier-select guid characterist of the gsl-wg NW

sens and switch with a gsl-wg nw. the guid 
characterist of the gsl-wg system be sensit not onli to 
geometr paramet but also to the refract index, n, of the 
surround medium, a show schemat in fig. 5a. A 
chang in n from 1 to 1.5 in step of 0.1 refract index unit 
(rius) result in a shift of the maxim guid power by 142 nm, 

a show by the simul in fig. 5b, c. thi larg spectral shift 
correspond to a sensit of 270 nm riu−1, which be compar- 
abl to the sensit of planar dielectr metasurfac sensors37 

and suggest potenti applic of the gsl system in both 
sensing37 and optic switching40. figur 5d show the pro- 
gressiv chang in guid power a a function of n at three select 
wavelengths, exemplifi the sens and on/off switch 
characterist that can be achiev at each wavelength by rela- 
tive small chang in n. however, in comparison to typic 
microreson and planar metasurfaces, the finit length and 
nanoscal dimens of the NW gsl caus a rel low 
qualiti factor and wide bandwidth for the guid light. thi 
differ highlight an inher but common tradeoff in the 
design of optic compon in the nanoscal regime; never- 
theless, sever index-chang strategies, such a the electro- 
optic effect41,42 and photoisomerization43, offer suffici larg 
index modul to enabl switch in the NW gsl-wg 
system. 

We experiment demonstr reversible, passiv sensing, and 
optic switch by sequenti add up to 4 poly(methyl 
methacrylate) (pmma) layer over a NW gsl-wg on a sio2 
glass substrate. each success pmma layer increas the 
effect index of the environment. As show by the guid 
spectrum in fig. 5e, the pmma layer induc up to a 78 nm spectral 
shift of the maximum guid power, from 1286 to 1364 nm. thi 
shift correspond to a chang of the effect refract index (neff) 
of ~0.29 riu, from ~1.21 to ~1.50, which be approxim the 
expect chang consid the fix n of the substrate. 
moreover, the spectrum revert to it origin posit upon 
remov of all pmma layers, thu demonstr that the process 
be reversible. figur 5f show the rel guid power measur 
at wavelength of 1286 and 1364 nm a a function of neff. the 
data exemplifi the expect sens and optic switch 
behavior of the gsl-wg system, allow the guid of a 
specif wavelength to be modul and even turn on and off 
by the choic of neff. 

In conclusion, we have demonstr that period geometr 
perturb of a NW allow coupl of a mie reson and a 
bgs. the coupl creat a pronounc dip in scatter spectrum 
a predict by both numer finite-el model and 
analyt model use tcmt. the period gsl structur act 
a a fourier frequenc selector to determin the wavelength of the 
bg to be coupl with the mie resonance. the effect can be 
readili tune from visibl through near-infrar wavelength by 
control geometr parameters, a proven by experiment 
measur of extinct of individu gsl nws. We 
demonstr selective, fourier-transform-limit guid of light 
up to telecommun wavelength with near-un coupl 
efficiency, highlight the uniqu abil of the mie-bg 
coupl mechan to direct energi from the strong mie 
reson light-matt interact into a NW wg. We also 
demonstr a simpl optic switch that take advantag of the 
spectral sensit of the coupl wavelength to the surround 
medium. the mie-bg light coupl mechan thu offer a
