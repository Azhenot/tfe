In the digit age, data security, in all it facet from everi dayappl via profession environ to espionage, be ofutmost importance. although ultim secur will never be 
reached, a constant progress and improv of cryptographi 
and steganography, both evolv with the need and possibl 
of new technolog on the one hand and the steadi increas of 
the capabl of adversari on the other hand, be required. 
A core task of cryptographi be encryption, i.e., to convert 
messag into unintellig ciphertext that can onli be 
decrypt by a receiv who poss a dedic decrypt key. 
steganography, in contrast, hide the fact that a messag 
(encrypt or not) be be transmitted. for a high degre of 
security, decrypt key can be conceal by steganography, i.e., 
via chemicals1–3 

the idea to use chemic for secret commun date back 
to ancient time when secret ink be first applied4. today, more 
sophist method be discuss for data encryption, such a 
fluoresc materials5–11 or multi-analyt fluoresc molecular 
sensors1, 12–14. furthermore, dna be exploit for secur com- 
munication15–19. molecular logic gates20–25, molecular comput 
systems26–28, and system base on author password 
entries29–38 also contribut to thi field. other approach util 
nmr chemic shifts39, microorgan colonies40, antibodies41, 
3D photon crystals42, and molecular tag (equip with halogen 
substitut aromat sidechains) serv a barcod for the 
identif of chemic librari via ga chromatography43. 

consid cryptography, state-of-the-art symmetr encryp- 
tion schemes, like the advanc encrypt standard (aes, also 
know a rijndael)44, serpent, or blowfish can protect data 
reliably, but requir a secret key for their operation. thi secret 
key must be know by both the encryptor and the decryptor, and 
should be chosen uniformli at random. typically, secret key be 
short (e.g., 128 bits), but it be not a priori clear how encryptor and 
decryptor receiv common secret keys. popular method to dis- 
tribut secret key involv the use of asymmetr cryptographi 
(e.g., use the diffie-hellman key exchang scheme, or a key 
transport mechan base on an asymmetr encrypt 
scheme, such as, rsa). the disadvantag of use asymmetr 
cryptographi (besid be consider less effici than 
symmetr cryptography) be that state-of-the-art asymmetr 
encrypt scheme requir specif algebra structures, and thu 
may potenti be more prone to a structur cryptanalysis. 

however, hide of the secret key via steganographi (e.g., via 
chemicals) can introduc an addit level of security. even if 
the number of know chemic compound be tremend larg 
and steadili growing, their applic a molecular key be lim- 
ite consid certain requirements: first, a systemat synth- 
esi methodolog should be appli provid molecul with a 
high level of structur complexity. moreover, simple, robust, and 
reproduc procedur should be used. finally, the product 
should be thermal and chemic a inert a possibl and be 
design for simpl isolation, purification, and analysis. 

multicompon reaction (mcr) repres highli suitabl 
synthet tool to provid molecular keys, fulfil these criteria. 
In a mcr, three or more precursor compon be combin to 
one reaction product, contain moieti of all precursors45, 46. 
In the field of mcrs, the ugi reaction be appealing, becaus four 
compon be combin to a singl product in a straightfor- 
ward one-pot reaction47. In the ugi reaction (see fig. 1a and 
supplementari figur 1 for the reaction mechanism), an 
aldehyd (green) react with an amin (orange), a carboxyl acid 
(blue), and an isocyanid (red) to from a bis-amid ugi product 
display four individu defin sidechain (r1–4, introduc 
by the four start components). variat of the precursor 
compon creat molecular divers with minim synthet 
effort48–50. 

herein we report a mean to advanc chemic commun 
system (includ the inspir work of marguli et al.1), via a 
secret commun channel base on molecular keys, which 
can be easili hidden in variou media, transfer nondigitally1, 
isol via f-tag and unambigu read out via esi-ms/m 
(one of the most develop and sensit analyt techniques). 
In our system, the well-establish ae algorithm be combin 
with an effect hide and transport of the encrypt key. 
the latter consist of systemat select and tailor-mad 
molecul that can be transport in a conceal fashion via a 
non-digit channel. 

result 
design and synthesi of molecular keys. for explor the 
synthet potenti of the ugi reaction, an exemplari list of 
compon (see supplementari data 1), includ ten 
perfluorin carboxyl acids, 50 aldehydes, 50 amines, and 
20 isocyanides, be designed. the compon chosen for thi 
databas be commerci avail and select in order to 
select react to the desir ugi product (criteria list in the 
method section and illustr in supplementari figur 1). 
thi set of 130 compon can potenti be combin to 
10 × 50 × 50 × 20= 500,000 differ molecular keys. the number 
of compon be onli limit by the avail of compon 
suitabl for the ugi reaction and can be extend easili beyond 
thi set of commerci avail compounds. the main function 
of the list of compon be to assign chemic inform 
(i.e., react compon and side chain of the respect 
molecular keys) to alphanumer code (i.e., systemat 
combin of letters, numbers, and special characters). for thi 
purpose, a letter be give to a certain chemic function 
group, and the differ sidechain within the same categori of 
function group be count with arbitrari numbers, e.g., 
aldehyd → letter A, benzaldehyd →a(001), butyraldehyd →A 
(003), …; isocyanid → letter B, …). the list of compon be 
highli flexible, becaus the alphanumer assign can be 
exchang or adjust if necessary. 

As proof of principle, a sub-librari of differ molecular key 
be synthes by systemat variat of the differ react 
components, util the ugi reaction of perfluorin acids. 
consid molecular design, the molecular key be equip 
with a perfluorin side chain (also call f-tag), enabl a 
highli simplifi purif via fluorou solid phase extract 
(f-spe)51, 52. f-spe can retain fluorou molecul select and 
henc separ the molecular key from organ contamin 
and/or matrix materials. 

In fig. 1, the variat of compon be illustr in a 3D plot 
for one of the appli perfluorin acids. each point repres a 
herein synthesized, distinct molecule. the coordin be link 
to the compon use and thu the sidechain of the molecular 
key. two perform systemat compon variations, unambigu- 
ousli demonstr the synthesi possibl with differ 
components, be repres in the expans (fig. 1c, d). the 
molecular key be analyz via 1D and 2D nuclear magnet 
reson spectroscopi (nmr, see supplementari figur 2), high 
resolut mass spectrometri (hrms) and infrar spectroscopi 
to confirm their structur and thu to demonstr the viabil of 
the present librari design (synthet procedur and analysi can 
be found in the supplementari methods). 

our molecular key provid a robust steganograph channel that 
can be use to transport, i.e., cryptograph keys. the transmit 
key can hardli be recognized, becaus (i) an adversari do not 
know that a key be hidden in a molecule; (ii) onli the recipi 
know where the molecular key be located/stor (i.e., adsorb on 
paper, dissolv in perfume, etc., see below); (iii) inform on

with the develop of sequenc defin macromolecules53–55. 
the user can thu choos the appropri system for the requir 
application. importantly, the molecular key be design for 
simplifi purif util fluorou tags, a well a for 
straightforward character (tandem-ms), requir onli 
trace amount of the key at all stages. 

An exemplari way of key transmiss be present in fig. 2. 
the sender and recipi meet for the first time and exchang 
detail on how to secretli commun in the future. they need 
to agre on how the molecular key will be transfer (e.g., 
adsorb on paper, dissolv in a perfume, etc.), whether the 
decrypt key will be fragment onto sever molecular key 
(and if so how mani individu molecular key will be used) in 
order to increase/adjust the requir level of security. addition- 
ally, the list of components, should be exchang and the 
analyt method be preselected. these initi commun 
detail should remain secret, however, if an adversari reveal one 
or some of the discuss details, he be still not abl to decrypt the 
messag without know the other inform and most 
importantli the molecular keys. 

coding, transportation, and isol of molecular key. the 
encrypt of secret documents/fil (exampl includ in 

supplementari data 2) be perform by an independ state-of- 
the-art symmetr encrypt algorithm such a ae (herein a 
random 128-bit ae key). currently, people, organizations, 
military, and govern benefit from ae encrypt for 
protecting, e.g., classifi information, email communication, 
open virtual privat network (vpn) tunnel for secur 
internet connections, onlin banking, or secur file transfer pro- 
tocol such a hypertext transfer protocol secur (https). 
however, the molecular key strategi offer a univers stegano- 
graphic channel, and be not limit to ae applications, therefor 
open new perspect for everi symmetr encrypt 
scheme. the ciphertext be transfer convent in a digit 
channel (e.g., via email or even share publicly) or in a tradit 
letter. decrypt encrypt data without the correspond key 
be infeas with key of suffici entropy. the respect 
encrypt key be conceal in molecular key and transport 
non-digit via a steganograph chemic channel (fig. 2a) (see 
below for transfer examples). the cryptograph digit channel 
can, in principle, transmit data of ani size. the steganograph 
channel for the molecular key be small in term of data size and 
util for key distribut exclusively. If the herein present list 
of compon be access for the adversary, there be still 
500,000 possibl combin (~18 bits). for high level of 
security, the ae encrypt key can be fragment and 
transfer onto sever molecular keys, which be transfer 
independ (spatially- or time-displaced, e.g., the first 
molecular key be transfer underneath the stamp, the 
second one in the top left corner of the letter, and third one be 
includ in a perfume, etc.). thus, if six molecular key be 
utilized, the key size equal ~113 bit (100 bit be consid

suffici secur in cryptography). additionally, such a key 
fragment increas the steganograph secur level, sinc 
an adversari would have to intermit and decod each individu

As a first transport example, an envelop (repres 
for adsorpt onto paper, see fig. 3 and supplementari figur 3) 
be selected. A small quantiti (4 mg) of the molecular key be 
dissolv in a minim amount methanol and transfer onto 
the top right corner of the envelop with a pipet. after drying, the 
molecular key be adsorb onto the larg surfac of the cellulos 
fibers, not traceabl for the bare eye. for further protect and 
simpl recognit of the area cover with the molecular key, a 
stamp (prefer self-adhesive) be place abov the treat

after the letter reach it destination, the cover area be cut 
into piec and extract with methanol and dichloromethane. 
sinc the obtain materi might contain impur (which 
could interfer with late analysis), the molecular key be purifi

analysi (see method section). alternatively, the molecular key 
be conceal and transport in a commerci perfume, 
adsorb onto instant coffe powder, green tea, or on sugar

for pictures). To further demonstr the robust of our 
isol protocol, a molecular key be hidden in and reisol

thi alphanumer code be util to encrypt a messag or data. 
the recipi isol and analyz a molecular key via esi-m 
and determin a m/z of 595.1615 Da for [m+na]+. 
after enter thi mass into the analysi script (supplementari 
softwar 1), the most probabl molecul and their respect

alphanumer code can now be gener and util to decrypt 
the message/data (more exampl can be found in supplementari 
data 2). A detail procedur on how to read out the molecular 
key be provid in the method section. supplementari 
data 2 contain three exampl of encrypt messag and the 
tandem-m spectrum of the molecular key for decryption. upon 
identif of the promin fragment patterns, the four 
fragment display in fig. 5a be chosen for structur eluci-

mass within a ΔM threshold of 0.01 Da (which be well within 
the accuraci of modern high-resolut mass spectromet 
regard the investig molecular weights) be display in a 
distribut plot (more detail in supplementari figur 4). It can 
be conclud that preselect the monoisotop mass reduc the 
number of remain possibl molecul drastic (at least 
by three order of magnitude). with the fragment obtain 

via tandem-ms, the molecular structur be determin and 
transfer into alphanumer code via the list of components. 
the alphanumer code be enter into the molecular 
encrypt script (supplementari softwar 2) for decrypt of 
the sent message. As recommended, the final ae code can also 
be encod onto sever molecular keys, which be transfer 
independ (separ spatial or time-wise). In the case 
of these fragment keys, the individu alphanumer code of 
each molecular key be enter in the correspond sequenc into

In conclusion, the herein present molecular key strategi 
allow steganograph key distribut in combin with a 
flexibl and adapt data safeti protocol. molecular key with a 
data storag capac of ~18 bit be synthes in a one-pot 
reaction approach. the molecular structur be analyz by a 
combin of tandem-m fragment and comput assist 
readout (analysi script, supplementari softwar 1). the 
respect structur serv a decrypt key for ae encrypt 
messag or data file (supplementari softwar 2). In principle, 
the herein present key could also be use for other 
applications, e.g., a identif or anti counterfeit tags. In 
futur research, the investig of molecular key with even 
high data storag capac will be of great interest in order to 
overcom current limit of the system.

compon should not carri moieties, which be strongli redox sensible, photo- 
sensitive, or easili hydrolyz in the presenc of protic solvent like methanol or 
water. In thi context, we addit exclud tert-butyl ester from our databas 
becaus they be deprotect at low pH by trifluoracet acid. function groups, 
which be know to caus side reaction with ani other substanc involv in the 
ugi reaction, should also be avoided. In addition, phenol hydroxyl group on 
electron-poor aromat system (i.e., carri addit nitro substituents) should 
be avoid due to undesir side reaction (i.e., ugi-smil where the acid phenol 
act a acid component). sinc the molecular key be design for tandem mass 
spectrometr analysis, the dataset for one compon (same function group) 
should not contain isom (e.g., no aldehyd with the same molar mass). isotop 
label compon can be benefici for MS purposes, but be also exclud from 
our database. diastereomer mixtur of molecular key synthes from racem 
start compon can be treat and util similar to stereomer pure 
molecular key (a studi comment on the influenc of stereochemistri be 
includ in supplementari methods). 

gener synthet procedur 
gener procedur (gp1) for ugi reactions: larg scale, high efficiency. In a 25 mL 
round bottom flask the aldehyd (1.70 eq., typic 1 mmol) be dissolv in a 
minim amount of methanol, subsequ the amin (1.70 eq.) be add and the 
result mixtur be stir for 60 min over sodium sulfat for the imin for- 
mation (if both compon be liquid, no methanol be need unless the imin 
would precipitate). the perfluoro acid (1.00 eq.) be dissolv in a minim 
amount of methanol and add to the imin at room temperature. the result 
mixtur be stir for 2 min. subsequently, the isocyanid (1.70 eq.) be add to 

the stir mixture. the reaction be stir for 1–3 d at room temperature. If a 
precipit be form dure the reaction, addit methanol be added. If a 
long perfluorin chain be present, tetrahydrofuran be util in order to 
homogen the reaction mixture. the crude reaction mixtur be dri under 
reduc pressur and purifi via column chromatographi (see gener 
purif procedure: f-spe). typic yields: 20–85%. 

gener procedur (gp2) for ugi reactions: economic, small scale. In a 10 mL round 
bottom flask, the aldehyd (1.30 eq., typic 500 µmol) be dissolv in a minim 
amount of methanol. subsequently, the amin (1.30 eq.) be add and the 
result mixtur be stir for 60 min over sodium sulfate. the perfluoro acid 
(1.00 eq.) be dissolv in a minim amount of methanol and add to the imin 
at room temperature. the result mixtur be stir for 2 min. subsequently, 
the isocyanid (1.20 eq.) be add to the stir mixture. the reaction be stir 
for 3 d at room temperature. the crude reaction mixtur be dri under reduc 
pressur and purifi via column chromatographi (see gener purif 
procedure: f-spe section). typic yields: 2%–35%. the low yield compar 
to gp1 be most probabl due a larg excess of compon and high 
concentr favor product format for gp1. 

gener purif procedur for f-spe. for f-spe separation, we suggest to 
util 1 g of perfluorin silica gel per 50 mg of mixtur subject (5% by 
weight). however, in literatur high load of 5%–15% by weight be reported. 

step 1: flush the perfluorin silica gel with dimethylformamid (0.2 mL per g 
silica gel), gentli appli posit pressure.

step 2: precondit the column with methanol/wat (8:2) (3 mL per g silica 
gel). 

step 3: suspend the mixtur to be purifi in a minim amount of 
dimethylformamid and load onto the precondit column. 

step 4: elut the organ fraction with 2 mL methanol/wat (80:20) per g silica 
gel. We suggest fraction into tube of appropri size. 

step 5: elut with 4 mL methanol per g silica gel to collect the fluorou fraction. 
note: for long chain perfluorin compounds, addit elut with the same 
amount of tetrahydrofuran/aceton (1:1). again, fraction into tube be 
desirable. tlc of the fraction indic the complet elut of the desir 
compound. 

step 6: In order to recycl the f-spe silica gel, flush with aceton and 
tetrahydrofuran and air dry. We do not suggest reus the same silica gel more 
than three times. 

after separation, the fraction be test for puriti via tlc, combin and 
concentr under reduc pressure. If unreact perfluoro acid or residu 
dimethylformamid be present in the fluorou fraction, a short silica gel filter 
column, elut with c-hexane/ethyl acet (3:1) be perform to yield the 
desir perfluorin ugi product. 

note: for purifi the molecular key extract from the variou disguis 5 g 
of f-spe silica gel be utilized. 

hide and isol the molecular keys. the molecular key can be hidden in 
mani creativ ways. sinc the molecular key be flouro-tag compounds, they 
can easili be isol from variou type of surround media. the main 
requir to the surround environ or the matrix materi be the absenc 
of ani perfluorin alkyl chains. furthermore, the extract of the molecular key 
should be possibl with reason effort. 

the follow extract exampl be perform with the molecular key

with a heat gun. for further protect and disguising, the stamp be place just 
abov the cover area (see supplementari figur 3). for late extraction, the part 
of the paper dope with the molecular key (i.e., the area around the stamp) be cut 
into small piec and extract in an ultrason bath with 15 mL methanol for 15 
min three time and subsequ three time with 10 mL dichloromethane. 
the extract be combined, concentr under reduc pressure, and purifi via

(see supplementari figur 3). the result solut be more dilut than the initi 
perfume, but the dilut cannot be easili recogn by a chang of appear or 
smell. the molecular key prove too remain in solut for more than 14 days. It 
can be assumed, that the molecular key will not precipit or phase separ 
(becaus a dilut system be used). for the extract of the molecular key, the 
solut be evapor under reduc pressur and subject to f-spe. In thi 
protocol, 3.7 mg (93%) of the molecular key be recovered. 

adsorb onto instant coffe powder, tea, or sugar: 4.0 mg of the molecular key 
be dissolv in 0.5 mL dichloromethan and add dropwis onto 1 g of the 
substrat powder, each drop be place onto a differ spot and allow to 
evapor separately. for the extraction, the powder be ground with a mortar and 
stir three time in 5 mL dichloromethan for 3 min. the combin extract be 
and filter over celite® and wash with 10 mL water twice. the combin 
aqueou phase be reextract with 5 mL dichloromethan twice. the combin 
organ phase be wash with 5 mL brine once, dri over sodium sulfate, 
evapor under reduc pressure, and purifi via f-spe. extract yields: from 
instant coffe powder 3.4 mg (85%), from green tea 3.6 mg (90%), and from sugar 
3.4 mg (87%), of the molecular key be recovered. 

note: for the extract from sugar no further purif via f-spe be 
necessari (fulli water-solubl substrate). 

from blood: 5.0 mg of the molecular key be dissolv in 0.5 mL ethanol and 
concentr under reduc pressur until a transpar film of the molecular key 
with a minim amount of ethanol be obtained. 5 mL of pig blood be add 
into the vial and gentli stir for 5 min. the blood should be store and 
transport under cooling. for the extraction, the blood be dilut with 10 mL 
water and extract with 20 mL dichloromethan three time (after the second 
extract an emuls be formed, henc the second and third organ extract 
be combin and treat separately). the organ extract be wash 
separ with 10 mL water twice. the organ phase be dri over sodium 
sulfat (emuls broke upon drying), evapor under reduc pressure, and 
purifi via f-spe. In thi protocol, 4.5 mg (91%) of the molecular key be 
recovered. 

note: the extract from blood be intend to demonstr a challeng 
extract exampl for the herein present f-tag molecular key from complex 
biolog media. extract from biolog medium would be far more challeng 
for cryptograph key encod in dna or other biomolecules. the author also 
want to clearli state that it be uneth to transport molecular key in live 
organisms. 

for MS analysis, even small amount of substanc be requir so in principl 
a low concentr of the molecular key could be employed. however, the 
herein obtain mass of sever milligram be suffici to further conduct tlc, 
gc-m and nmr experi for puriti determination. gc-m evid a 
puriti of 99%, see supplementari figur 5, further indic success extract 
and purification. after the molecular key have be isol and purified, (tandem-) 
ms-spectra be obtain and henc the molecular key can be decrypted. 

gener extract procedure. If the molecular key be adsorb on a solid sup- 
port, we propos to extract with dichloromethan sever time (at least three) in 
order to fulli recov the molecular key. subsequently, the dichloromethan extract 
be wash with water and purifi via f-spe. If the molecular key be transport in 
solution, we propos concentration, and liquid/liquid extract with dichlor- 
omethan and water. the combin organ layer be dri prior to f-spe. 

analyz the molecular key via tandem-ms. first, the molecular key need to 
be located, isolated, and purified. subsequently, esi-m provid the monoisotop 
mass (full scan mode 200–2000 m/z), which be use in the comput assist 
readout (analysi script, supplementari softwar 1) to determin the most prob- 
abl structures. the predomin signal aris from the intact molecule+ sodium: 
[m+na]+ and two molecules+ sodium: [2 m+na]+ (see supplementari fig- 
ure 6). the sodium be introduc by util a dope solvent mixtur dure the 
esi sampl preparation. 

the next step toward the analysi of a molecular key be to isol the 
[m+na]+ m/z peak and further fragment the molecule. It prove to be most 
effici to start with mild condit (low fragment energy) and success 
move on to high fragment energi level (see supplementari figur 7). for 
the first evaluation, a spectrum with mani fragment peak occur in a wide 
rang of molar mass (high inform density) should be chosen and regard 
in detail (i.e., 30 eV in supplementari figur 7 provid a high inform density, 
sinc mani fragment can be observ and in addit the unfrag molecul 
at 595m/z be still present). however, the chosen energi should be a low a possibl 
in order to avoid the further fragment of fragments. furthermore, the 
observ of heavier/larg fragment speci be more like for low 
fragment energies. In supplementari figur 7 the respect spectrum at 
30 eV be displayed, the correspond fragment evalu can be found in the tabl 
below. As demonstr in the evaluation, it be possibl to observ numer 
fragment and henc the inform requir for structur elucid from one 
singl spectrum. 

however, in some cases, two tandem-m spectrum at differ fragment 
energi be necessari to observ enough relev fragments. In supplementari 
figur 8, two tandem-m spectrum of the same speci (731m/z) record at 35 eV 

(a) and at 50 eV (b) collis energi be displayed. the heavier fragment indic 
by the diamond cluster and asterisk can onli be observ in the 35 eV energi 
spectrum (a, expansion). the lighter fragment indic by the black circl and 
left-point triangl can sole be observ in the 50 eV spectrum (b). the 
correspond fragment assign be depict in the correspond tabl of 
supplementari figur 8. 

In addition, tandem-m fragment analysi can distinguish between isom 
(molecul with same mass but differ structures). In supplementari figur 9a, 
two isomer molecular key be displayed. these isom cannot be simpli 
distinguish by regard the molar mass of the intact molecul (right-point 
triangle) nor the isom fragments. In fact, it be necessari to evalu the lighter 
fragment (black circl and black square), which be unambigu different. the 
respect spectrum be display in supplementari figur 9b (isom 2) and c+ d 
(isom 1). the spectrum of the other isom 2 present in b show a differ 
and uniqu fragment pattern, and can therefor be distinguish from 1 (c+ 
d). the fragment analysi of both spectrum be present in the tabl of supplementari 
figur 9. In conclusion, isomer molecular key can be distinguish in a 
straightforward fashion, if the list of compon do not includ isom for the 
same compon (a state in the criteria for the compon database). 

comput assist readout for tandem-m spectra. the analysi of tandem-m 
spectrum at differ energi turn out to be time consuming. At thi point, a 
comput script (supplementari softwar 1) becom a veri use tool for pro- 
vide pre-calcul mass of the most probabl fragment after the input of the 
monoisotop mass of the respect molecular key. the mono isotop mass can be 
obtain from esi-m spectrum scan in a rang from 200 to 2000 m/z (see 
supplementari figur 6). the script oper a follows: the databas of compo- 
nent be the basi for the alphanumer cod (e.g., aldehyd → letter A; ben- 
zaldehyd →a(003), etc.), the chemic formula, the correspond exact mass 
and a smile code for visual the molecule, e.g., a(003) | benzaldehyde| 
c7h6o|106.04186|[h]c(c1= cc= cc=c1)=o. 

the script then search for all possibl permut of compon 
combin within the enter mass rang (reduct of possibl be illustr 
in supplementari figur 4). the mono isotop mass [m+na]+ be enter with 
four decimals, e.g., 567.5678 and an appropri ΔM threshold (for the herein 
present exampl δm= 0.02 Da be sufficient). the result possibl be 
list by the script and the mass of probabl fragment be directli displayed. 
after enter addit fragments, the result possibl be further refin 
until the structur be determined. the fragment mass be enter with two 
decim (e.g., 123.45). If accident a wrong number be entered, the redo 
command will return to the initi select of possibl after enter the 
[m+na]+ mass. after enter enough fragments, the select of possibl be 
reduc to one distinct molecule. with the alphanumer inform of the key 
[e.g., a(005)-b(002)-c(004)-d(007], the hidden messag can be decrypted. the 
script also offer the possibl to display more detail inform about the 
molecular key via the print command. after select the print command a 
smile code for the target molecul and all precursor compon (on basi of the 
list of components) be displayed. the siml code can be copied, e.g., to 
chemdraw® (insert with alt+ crtl+ P) for visual of the molecular key 
structur (also refer to supplementari methods). 

comput assist encrypt and decryption. To suppli a full toolchain, also a 
script be provid (supplementari softwar 2) that perform the actual encrypt 
of messag (and the revers process, the decrypt of ciphertexts). the script 
oper either in encryption, or in decrypt mode. In encrypt mode, the 
script take a input a plaintext (either a a file on disk, or enter on screen by the 
user), and a sequenc of molecular keys. the molecular key be then concaten 
and use to deriv an ae key for encryption, and the encrypt ciphertext be 
output either to a file, or onto the screen. In decrypt mode, a ciphertext and 
molecular key be entered, and the plaintext result from decrypt be output. 

internally, the script us the establish openssl tool to perform 
cryptograph oper (and in particular the key deriv and encryption/ 
decrypt operations). the main task of our script be henc to collect user input, 
and run the openssl tool with the appropri input and parameters. specifically, 
the script choos to encrypt/decrypt with the standard ae algorithm with 128-bit 
key (that be deriv use a standard cryptograph key deriv function from 
the molecular keys). 

for decrypt the encrypt messag includ a supplementari data 2, select 
decrypt mode, drag, and drop the respect file into the window an enter the 
correspond molecular key (obtain from the analysi script, supplementari 
softwar 1). pleas export the messag in the format < filenam > .txt (also refer to 
supplementari methods). for decrypt the encrypt file contain pleas export in 
the format < filenam > .zip. the solut can be found in supplementari note 1. 

puriti determination. the puriti of the isol molecular key [a(005)-b(002)-c 
(004)-d(007)] be further confirm by gc-m (supplementari figur 5). the 
intens signal at 11.5 min retent time correspond to the display molecular
