achin learn have be use to 

beat a human competitor in a game 

of Go (1), a game that have long be 

view a the most challeng of 

board game for artifici intelli- 

gence. research be now under way 

to investig whether machin learn can 

be use to solv long outstand problem 

in quantum science. On page 602 of thi 

issue, carleo and troyer (2) use machin 

learn on one of quantum science’ great- 

est challenges: the simul of quantum 

many-bodi systems. carleo and troyer use 

an artifici neural network to repres the 

wave function of a quantum many-bodi sys- 

tem and to make the neural network “learn” 

what the ground state (or dynamics) of the 

system is. their approach be found to per- 

form good than the current state-of-the-art 

numer simul methods. 

earli machine-learn demonstr 

be on specif pattern-recognit prob- 

lems. they have sinc show great capabil- 

iti in perform multifacet tasks, such 

a play video game (3) or board game 

(1). thi capac to take control of complex 

system and achiev difficult goals, in some 

case good than human competitors, have 

recent be use to tackl difficult prob- 

lem in quantum science. In experiment 

quantum science, machin learn have be 

use to design new experi (4), perform 

automat optim (5), and improv 

feedback control (6). all of these applic 

have solv problem that have onli recent 

face the field. 

due to vast number of complex number 

requir to save a complet wave function, 

the simul of many-bodi system have 

be an immens challeng in quantum sci- 

ence. for example, consid a many-bodi 

system compos of N qubits, the simplest 

quantum bodies. We must save a complex 

number for everi configur of thi sys- 

tem. each qubit can be in a state of 0 or 1, 

so that mean we need to save 2N complex 

numbers. even a small number of qubit 

requir an extrem amount of memory. for 

example, 26 qubit requir around a giga- 

byte, 46 qubit requir a petabyte, and 300 

qubit would requir more byte than the 

number of atom in the universe. richard 

feynman recogn thi problem, which lead 

to hi suggest that quantum comput 

may have an advantag over convent 

comput (7) [although we now know that 

the reason behind the quantum speedup be 

more nuanc (8)]. 

To circumv thi memori requir 

issue, a varieti of approxim techniqu 

have be develop to solv quantum many- 

bodi problems. these involv invent some 

compact approxim represent for the 

wave function. for example, matrix prod- 

uct state be the current state-of-the-art 

techniqu for find ground state of one- 

dimension many-bodi system (9). A set 

of matrix be use to save the approxim 

state-of-the-wav function; subset of these 

matrix can be multipli togeth to get 

the complex number correspond to a par- 

ticular system configuration. mani differ 

represent of the wave function exist, 

each have advantag in particular physi- 

cal settings. discov new represent 

for each physic problem have previous re- 

quir human ingenu and effort. 

carleo and troyer suggest use machin 

learn to automat discov a compact 

represent for the wave function appro- 

priat for each physic problem. the wave 

function can be thought of a a function that 

take a system configur and return a 

complex number. they assum that thi func- 

tion can be well approxim with a neural 

network, make of a set of weight and a singl 

layer of hidden bia (see the figure). given 

the hamiltonian for a particular physic sys- 

tem, they let the neural network learn a com- 

pact represent for the wave function of 

the system’ ground state (or dynamics). the 

learn algorithm they use be adapt from 

variat mont carlo and minim the 

so-cal local energi of the system. 

carleo and troyer found that the neural 

network be abl to discov ground state of 

quantum many-bodi system with a small 

memori footprint than those of compet 

techniques, such a matrix product states. 

furthermore, the accuraci of the neural net 

estim can be systemat improv by 

increas the number of hidden bia and 

weights. On the problem they tested, they 

found the machine-learn algorithm be 

abl to outperform all of the current state-of- 

the-art numer techniques. 

carleo and troyer have current test 

their approach on a few problem that have 

know solutions. We will not know for cer- 

tain that machin learn have solv the 

challeng of simul many-bodi quantum 

system until more physic system have 

be tested. nevertheless, there be great po- 

tential to expand on their work. carleo and 

troyer onli consid a single-lay neural 

net. deep neural nets, which have multipl 

layers, have be show to have the great 

capac for learn and express and be 

yet to be investigated. the work present a 

new pathway for physicist to benefit from 

the rapid develop in the machine- 

learn commun and will hope lead 

to new physic discoveries. j
