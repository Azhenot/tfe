how AI will impact the insur industri 

insur artifici intelligence: the journey toward effici and 
custom engag 

it’ hard not to use the languag of scienc fiction when talk about artifici 
intellig (ai). machin that can read information, act, learn, adapt and creat 
feel alien, far away from our experi today. 

but it be a fact that AI – of a kind – be alreadi in use in the insur industri today. 
As earli a 2015, tata consult servic put the averag invest in AI per 
insur that year at $124m1. 

what insur be invest in today be arguabl not AI but it foundations. “today, 
AI be in a develop stage. It be the veri practic use of technolog for the 
simplif and autom of processes, leverag some defin rule around 
the overal business,” explain georg hansen, claim actuary, gener insurance, 
zurich insurance. 

insur believ AI have the potenti to transform their busi model, deliv 
cost efficiencies, gener new product line and improv custom engage- 
ment. like ani sector-wid transformation, it be an iter process and one that 
see some player good abl to adapt than others. 

“there be some organ in insur that will be more readi for AI than 
other and it’ the one with the abil to har data and leverag skill 
engineers, programm and autom platforms” say imir arifi, imir arifi, senior 
director, busi solut consulting, health care servic corporation. 

In thi paper we look at the type of insur capabl AI be most like to influ- 
enc in the near futur and how insur can prepar for it today.

pattern recognit be and will continu to be one of the major benefit of ai. 
alreadi help in identifi fraud risks, it be go to prove increasingli valuabl in 
manag insur exposure. 

“we’r alreadi look at AI in some of our high sever books. We run those 
through the AI model to look at the note that be in there, look for combin 
and connect that the claim handler be put in, identifi high exposur 
and then put team leader on it to make sure they proactiv address those 
cases,” hansen reveals. “we identifi through the histori of a claim, start at fnol, 
flag anyth with potenti for busi interrupt and that kick off the 
forens account unit, who then work to quantifi and limit the exposure.” 

the abil to find the ‘unknown unknowns’ in the data allow insur to refin 
their offerings. it’ a win-win for insur and insured. the risk to the compani be 
reduc a more factor can be weight and the custom be give coverag that 
more accur reflect their need. 

AI and insur 2020: the rise of the machines? 

there be natur concern among both custom and the insur workforc that 
peopl will be replac wholesal by machines. not onli be thi unlik in the short 
term, but most execut believ thi will never be fulli realized. that’ not to say 
autom won’t reshap the employe landscape: 

“how far you can autom come down to where insur use human interven- 
tion to add value. but even then, the issu be to defin what it be to ‘add value’. that 
becom broader and broader a AI becom more sophisticated. In the foresee- 
abl futur we will have AI intervent in a lot of custom contact processes. you 
either won’t need a mani people, and peopl who be there will need to handl 
the more complex tasks,” explain hansen. 

“A signific amount of our busi process will be autom – with an abil 
to handl except where custom need to occur. but in general, mani of 
our process have the perfect infrastructur to move into AI – it’ all logic driven 
decis criterion on structur data sets,” explain matt marino, avp, oper 
effectiveness, unum. 

one such exampl would be in first notif of loss (fnol): “you want it a fast 
a possibl and get approv in for everyth that can be do automatically. 
that’ good for custom and good for the business. simplifi workstream and 
zero touch oper be the opportun in AI that come to mind,” marino adds. 

“simplifi process a much a possible,” hansen advises. “streamlin mundan

simpl claim and give the custom a cheque, that’ certainli a benefit in get 
them swiftli back to their pre-loss state. 

AI and insur 2020: intellig prospect 

AI be all about make intellig connect in data. while thi be alreadi under- 
way in certain part of underwrit and claim processing, it have see limit use 
in custom acquisition. that’ a big miss opportunity, accord to johnson: 

“the big deficit that’ not be address be good use AI and insurtech to make 
the connect between insurers’ exist book of busi and the next gener- 
ation. with advanc at the organis level, how do we use technolog to 
good ensur that the grandchild of our exist client becom our customers.” 

carrier focu a great deal on the recommend potenti of a posit claim 
experience, but fail to segment those word of mouth target by their relationship 
to the insured. AI give them visibl on that information. 

make connect be more than just find custom with closer tie to the 
carrier brand than the gener population. build relationship with customer’ 
famili member would be consid by mani to be a value-ad proposition: 

“thi be about take a leadership role in craft solut for custom that they 
don’t yet know they’r go to face. undiagnos dementia for example. how do 
we leverag technolog to help manag the claim experi when the child 
and grandchild may not know that their parent aren’t quit right? such 
solut be not just about risk mitig for the insurer, it’ about the right thing 
to do,” johnson says. 

johnson believ insur don’t look far enough into the futur to anticip attri- 
tion and that use AI to make those connect be the answer. “life insur be 
just a guilti of fail to forward plan. becaus there be no meaning relationship 
or connect between the generations, there be a vast amount of annuiti and 
life insur disburs that don’t make their way back to those insurers.” 

AI and insur 2020: limit 

there will be element of the insur landscap that will prove too involv even 
for AI to manage, hansen adds. “there be process outsid the insur world. 
litig mean it take time to settl complex claims. worker compens 
insur have to take into account subject assess includ thing such a 
maximum medic improvement. It isn’t around facts, it be up to individu to make 
the correct assessment. AI can help but it can’t take over.” 

the use of the word ‘involved’ be deliberate. It impli mani move parts, incom- 
patibl situat and data set but most importantly, it impli a constantli chang- 
ing landscap present new challenges. 

we’r delv into semant becaus often peopl refer to some situat a 
be too complex for AI to manage. AI be incred profici – it eat complex- 
iti for breakfast. however, arifi warns: “complex be not the challenge. the real

challeng and where you want to be care be repeatability. machin can zero in 
on complexity. We can build complex neural networks. but if the case occur rarely, 
if it’ someth that hasn’t be observed, AI isn’t possible. It can’t make one-off 
strateg decisions.” 

quit simply, if you don’t have the data to train the algorithm, you can’t use ai. 

these be just some area where AI be like to impact the insur sector in the 
near futur of 2020 and beyond. To capit on these advances, carrier need to 
start take action today, if they haven’t already. from legaci system to corpor 
culture, there be still mani challeng to address. 

prepar for AI – make the busi case 

one of the big challeng be take the first step. there be an understand 
that invest must be made: 

“in larg companies, the vast major of AI or machin learn project huge 
impact the bottom line and custom experience. certainly, the industri be begin- 
ning to understand that AI and advanc analyt will be part of the next indus- 
trial revolution,” arifi states, adding: “even if the use case be not a detail a we’d 
like them to be, that’ the way societi be going.” 

but understand intellectu that there will be some need to adapt to ai-bas 
process by 2020 and beyond be one thing, figur out how to make it a realiti 
in each organ be quit another. It be the difficulti in link a vagu sens of 
futur need with current insur pressur that be challeng execut who 
want to see AI in action today. 

“one of the big stumbl block have be defin what the object of AI 
are,” claim hansen. “you cannot build an AI model without defin the problem 
we be tri to solve.” 

for many, that start point for invest in AI have be it abil to creat cost 
efficiencies. insur execut be spend to save: “ironically, we start with 
look at how we minimis our IT invest in legaci systems, and we be start- 
ing with how we can appli robot to deliv good custom experi with less 
IT invest and time required. We have be look at the low expens option 
to replac old systems. there be signific opportun here,” marino explains. 

prepar for AI – develop the cultur 

the gener belief have be that insur leadership team understand and 
support the integr of ai. they also know that busi transform be neces- 
sary. however, johnson feel progress may not be a signific a we be lead to 
believe. It seem that buy-in may onli be skin deep: 

“there’ a lot of lip service. there be pocket of realli robust execut think 
around insurtech and AI but it’ also incred siloed. there also be a tremend 
level of protection in place.”

unum’ marino agrees: “A lot of the work AI and autom be suit for be preva- 
lent within insur companies. be abl to partner with the busi leader 
to demonstr how AI and autom help an organ be critical. it’ go 
to come down to get the busi to test and learn to discov that there be 
more scienc in that process than they would believe. If we lead these effort a IT 
driven project instead of build capabl with busi leader adopt will 
be slow significantly.” 

johnson explain that the person histori of senior insur execut may color 
their view: ““the gener of execut who popul senior leadership today tend 
to have risen through the ranks. they be adjust and underwrit who work 
their way up. thi will be in sharp contrast to the next gener of claim leader 
who will have background and expertis in big data, mathemat and technology.” 

He go on to add: “there’ also a disconnect between the evolut of insurtech 
and the board and govern community. their focu be on an alreadi crowd 
dashboard and they haven’t yet be baptis into thi brave new world. thi 
small but influenti group of stakehold be now be ask to fund technolog 
initi that will make stark chang to a legaci busi larg unchang 
for a century. the key to quicker adopt be ultim bring the govern 
commun up to speed.” 

“thi technolog be highli disrupt but the challeng around technolog have 
larg be resolved. If you have the drive and the budget you can do it. you 
need execut sponsorship to support engag becaus implement 
take time and resources. but you also need true believ at the grassroot level 
becaus they have to be will and abl to do the work. you can’t expect chang 
overnight.” arifi adds. 

chang may not be come overnight but it be imminent: “we be at a tip 
point where the pressur on profit from other part of the busi be 
compel compani one by one to look harder and more serious at make 
substant change. more carrier be be forced, rather than run willingly, 
into strateg AI invest becaus they’r experi other tremor on their 
balanc sheet,” johnson says. 

prepar for AI – hire and fire 

A signific worri for senior leadership be to find the skill employe that can 
deliv AI seamlessli into the organization. without knowledg of their own, they 
be look to expert to drive the function internally. the challeng is, that in thi 
brave new world, no-on realli know what today’ crack AI team look like: 

“we haven’t nail down how our team support these new capabl will be 
formed. As we look at build out new capabl we will evalu talent that be 
avail in the workforc a well a strateg partnerships.” marino explains. 

johnson refer to the notion that there might be a singl AI leader who can 
embodi all the compet with respect to technolog and science, strategi 
and financ and the custom experi etho a a ‘unicorn’. In other words, such 
a person doesn’t exist.

“you don’t tri to hire someon with all the skill set but you do make sure you 
bring those skill set to the table,” hansen elaborates. “data scientist have skill set 
use across a lot of differ industri that be transfer to AI in insurance.” 

“the real limit be the avail of talent,” arifi admits. “you need someon with at 
least three core competencies. someon who understand the data, understand 
the business, and understand cod but also understand the mathemat of 
what you’r tri to do. get that in a singl person be pretti rare.” 

It look a though ‘ai by committee’ be the way forward: “you need leadership 
to understand how integr AI have be success complet in anoth 
industri or organization. then you need to set up team and ingrain standard for 
the project they’r charg with. it’ unavoidable. the whole field be so new that 
everyon need some training. there be no turnkey solutions.” 

In zurich, hansen says, they have built a ‘team of all the talents’. “the data scientist 
be in hous and have a lot of experience; some have actuari experience, other 
come from an AI background. A lot of compani struggl to build that. talent be 
avail and it doesn’t have to come from the insur industry.” 

“but,” he adds, “you can’t just throw a problem at that team. you need to get the 
busi knowledge, have subject matter expert and senior manag all 
togeth identifi the problem that need to be solv and figur out how it 
fit into the busi flow.” 

prepar for AI – look for leader 

It would appear that the insur sector be on a relentless shift toward an 
ai-driven univers and the onli question be how far or fast they can go with the 
tool they alreadi have. 

there will be no ‘overnight sensation’ a organ build or buy in capability; 
advanc and enhanc part of their proposit until the data and strategi be in 
place that take the industri into a truli ‘intelligent’ future. 

insur be get more comfort with adopt innovation, but that’ not to 
say they be gener will to take the first step: 

“progress toward AI be go to be incremental. i’m hold out hope for a coupl 
of player to be bold and think about how they’r go to be leader in thi space,” 
marino suggests. 

what be clear be that AI will transform the sector over time and that insur must find 
way around the challeng they still face to remain relev to their customers: 

“we don’t have to look veri far to see what’ come in the way the big, establish 
player adapt. within the wealth manag space, at the dawn of the roboadvisor 
trend, the establish laugh at the concept. after all, who be go to trust 
their invest to an algorithm? fast forward 15 year and the big player have 
either develop proprietari model or acquir them outright. insur will go the 
same way across the full spectrum of technolog solutions,” johnson concludes.
