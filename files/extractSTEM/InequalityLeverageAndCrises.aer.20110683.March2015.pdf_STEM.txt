inequality, leverage, and crises† 

By michael kumhof, romain rancière, and pablo winant* 

the paper studi how high household leverag and crisi can 
be caus by chang in the incom distribution. empirically, the 
period 1920–1929 and 1983–2008 both exhibit a larg increas 
in the incom share of high-incom households, a larg increas 
in debt leverag of low- and middle-incom households, and an 
eventu financi and real crisis. the paper present a theoret 
model where high leverag and crisi be the endogen result 
of a grow incom share of high-incom households. the model 
match the profil of the incom distribution, the debt-to-incom 
ratio and crisi risk for the three decad preced the great 
recession. (jel d14, d31, d33, e32, e44, g01, n22) 

the unit state experienc two major econom crisi over the past century— 
the great depress start in 1929 and the great recess start in 2008. A 
strike and often overlook similar between these two crisi be that both be 
preceded, over a period of decades, by a sharp increas in incom inequality, and 
by a similarli sharp increas in debt-to-incom ratio among lower- and middle-in- 
come households. when debt level start to be perceiv a unsustainable, they 
contribut to trigger except deep financi and real crises. 

In thi paper, we first document these facts, both for the period prior to the great 
depress and the period prior to the great recession, and we then present a 
dynam stochast gener equilibrium model in which a crisi driven by great 
incom inequ aris endogenously. To our knowledge, our model be the first to 
provid an intern consist mechan link the empir observ rise in 
incom inequality, the increas in debt-to-incom ratios, and the risk of a financi

crisis. In do so it provid a use theoret framework, includ a new meth- 
odolog for it calibration, that can be use to investig the role of incom inequal- 
iti a an independ sourc of macroeconom fluctuations. 

the model be kept a simpl a possibl in order to allow for a clear understand- 
ing of the mechan at work. the crisi be the ultim result, after a period of 
decades, of perman shock to the incom share of two group of households: 
top earner who repres the top 5 percent of the incom distribution, and whose 
incom share increases; and bottom earner who repres the bottom 95 percent of 
the incom distribution.1 the key mechan be that top earners, rather than use 
all of their increas incom for high consumption, use a larg share of it to accu- 
mulat financi wealth in the form of loan to bottom earners.2 they do so because, 
follow carrol (2000) and others, financi wealth enter their util function 
directly, which impli a posit margin propens to save out of perman 
incom shocks. By accumul financi wealth, top earner allow bottom earner 
to limit the drop in their consumption, but the result larg increas of bottom 
earners’ debt-to-incom ratio gener financi fragil that eventu make a 
financi crisi much more likely. 

the crisi be the result of an endogen and ration default decis on the part 
of bottom earners, who trade off the benefit of relief from their grow debt load 
against output and util cost associ with default. lender fulli expect thi 
behavior and price loan accordingly. the crisi be character by partial house- 
hold debt default and an abrupt output contraction, a mechan that be consist 
with the result of philippon and midrigan (2011) and gärtner (2013) for the great 
recess and the great depression, respectively. when a ration default occurs, it 
do provid relief to bottom earners. but becaus it be accompani by a collaps in 
real activ that hit bottom earner especi hard, and becaus of high post-cri- 
si interest rates, the effect on their debt-to-incom ratio be small, and debt quickli 
start to increas again if incom inequ remain unchanged. 

when the shock to incom inequ be permanent, consist with the time 
seri properti of US top 5 percent incom shares, the prefer for wealth of 
top earner (and thu their posit margin propens to save follow a perma- 
nent incom shock) be key to our result on debt growth. We show in a baselin 
simul that, when prefer for wealth of top earner be calibr to match 
a margin propens to save of around 0.4, an empir estim that be base 
on independ microeconom data, a seri of perman neg shock to the 
incom share of bottom earners, of exactli the magnitud observ in the data, 
gener an increas in the debt-to-incom ratio of bottom earner veri close to the 
magnitud observ in the 1983–2007 data. becaus the evolut of the debt-to- 
incom ratio of bottom earner be not a target of our calibration, thi constitut an 
empir success of our model. furthermore, the increas in debt lead to a signifi- 
cant increas in crisi risk, of approxim the magnitud found in the recent work 
of schularick and taylor (2012). In section IF we discu other explan for the 
1983–2007 increas in debt level and crisi risk that focu on domest and global 

1 note that our paper focu onli on the macroeconom implic of increas incom inequality, rather 
than take a stand on the fundament reason for chang in the incom distribution.

asset market imbal in the decad prior to the great depression. We also show, 
in an altern simulation, that when the shock to incom inequ be model a 
transitory, the same model parameter without prefer for wealth among top 
earner can gener an increas in debt and crisi risk pure base on a consump- 
tion smooth motive. 

the central argument of the paper link two strand of the literature3 that have 
larg be evolv separately: the literatur on incom and wealth distribution,4 
and the literatur on financi fragil and financi crises.5 In addition, our mod- 
ele approach take element from the literatur on prefer for wealth,6 to 
explain the rise of household debt leverag when the increas in incom inequ 
be permanent, and from the literatur on ration default, to endogen financi 
crises.7 

rajan (2010) and reich (2010) share with thi paper an emphasi on incom 
inequ a a long-run determin of leverag and financi fragility. In contrast 
to these authors, we studi thi issu in the context of a gener equilibrium model. 
thi permit a quantif of the import of thi channel, and an identif 
of the respect role of credit demand and credit suppli in the rise of household 
leverag and crisi risk.8 anoth literatur have relat increas in incom inequal- 
iti to increas in household debt (krueger and perri 2006, iacoviello 2008). In 
these authors’ approach, an increas in the varianc of idiosyncrat incom shock 
across all household gener a high demand for insur through credit mar- 
kets, therebi increas household debt. thi approach emphas an increas in 
incom inequ experienc within household group with similar characteris- 
tics, while our paper focu on the empir well-docu rise in incom 
inequ between two specif household groups, the top 5 percent and the bottom 
95 percent of the incom distribution. 

In theory, if increas incom inequ be accompani by an increas in 
intragener incom mobility, the dispers in lifetim earn might be 
much small than the dispers in annual earnings, a agent move up and down 
the incom ladder throughout their lives. however, a recent studi by kopczuk, saez, 
and song (2010) show that short-term and long-term incom mobil in the unit 
state have be either stabl or slightli fall sinc the 1950s. these author also 
find that virtual all of the increas in the varianc of earn over recent decad 
have be due to an increas in the varianc of perman earn rather than of 
transitori earnings.9 these result provid support for one of our simplifi mod- 
ele choices, the assumpt of two incom group with fix memberships. they 
also provid addit support for our calibration, wherebi shock to the incom 
distribut be permanent.

there be littl guidanc from the literatur on how to calibr the prefer 
for wealth specification. but there be a small literatur on the margin propens 
to save (mps) of differ incom groups. the key paper be dynan, skinner, and 
zeld (2004), who find that mp be steepli increas in the level of perman 
income, and reach valu of 0.5 or even high for the high incom groups. We 
show that these result can be map directli into a calibr of the prefer 
for wealth parameters. thi calibr methodolog be anoth contribut of our 
paper. 

the rest of the paper be organ a followed. section I discu key styl- 
ize fact for the great depress and the great recession. section II present 
the model. section iii discu model calibr and the comput solut 
method. section IV show model simul that studi the effect of increas 
incom inequ on debt level and crises. section V concludes. 

I. styliz fact 

thi section document five key styliz fact that characterize, for the US 
economy, the period prior to the great recess and, where available, the great 
depression. these fact be relev to the nexu between inequality, leverage, and 
crises. some will inform the specif and calibr of our model, and other 
will be use to evalu the empir support for the model. We conclud thi sec- 
tion with a discuss of the empir evid associ with the two main alter- 
nativ explan for high and grow household debt that have be advanc 
in the literature. 

A. incom inequ and aggreg household debt 

In the period prior to both major crises, rapidli grow incom inequ be 
accompani by a sharp increas in aggreg household debt. 

pre-great-recession.—panel A of figur 1 plot the evolut of US incom 
inequ and household debt-to-gdp ratio between 1983 and 2008. incom 
inequ experienc a sharp increase, a the share of total incom command by 
the top 5 percent of the incom distribut increas from 21.8 percent in 1983 to 
33.8 percent in 2007. dure the same period the ratio of household debt to gross 
domest product (gdp) doubled, from 49.1 percent to 98.0 percent. 

pre-great-depression.—panel B of figur 1 plot the evolut of US incom 
inequ and household debt-to-gdp ratio between 1920 and 1929. between 
1920 and 1928, the top 5 percent incom share increas from 27.5 percent to 34.8 
percent. dure the same period, the ratio of household debt to gdp more than dou- 
bled, from 16.9 percent to 37.1 percent. 

B. debt by incom group 

the period prior to both major crisi be character by increas heteroge- 
neiti in debt-to-incom ratio between high-incom household and all remain

households. for the period prior to the great depress data avail be veri 
limited, but some evid exists, and be consist with the period prior to the great 
recession. 

pre-great-recession.—panel A of figur 2 plot the evolut of debt-to-incom 
ratio for the top 5 percent and bottom 95 percent of households, rank by income, 
between 1983 and 2007.10 In 1983, the top incom group be more indebt than 
the bottom incom group, with a gap of around 20 percentag points. In 2007, the 
situat be reversed. the debt-to-incom ratio of the bottom group, at 147.3 per- 
cent compar to an initi valu of 62.3 percent, be now more than twice a high 
a that of the top group, which remain fluctuat around 60 percent. As a con- 
sequenc almost all of the increas in the aggreg debt-to-incom ratio show 
in figur 1 be due to the bottom group of the incom distribution. A similar pat- 
tern to the debt-to-incom ratio in figur 2 be also observ in debt-to-net-worth 
ratio (panel A of figur 3), and in unsecur debt-to-incom ratio (panel B of 
figur 3).11 

pre-great-depression.—accord to olney (1991) and olney (1999), the ratio 
of non-mortgag consum debt to incom increas from 4.6 percent in 1919 to 
9.3 percent in 1929. around two-third of thi be instal debt, especi for 

10 debt-to-incom ratio be construct use data from the survey of consum financ (scf), which start 
in 1983, and becom triennial start in 1989, make 2007 the last pre-crisi observation. 

11 It be sometim argu that the more recent increas in household debt (2000–2007), which consist to a 
larg extent of mortgag loans, repres borrow against hous whose fundament valu have risen. howev 
sever recent empir paper (mian and sufi 2009; favara and imb 2010; adelino, schoar, and severino 2012) 
show that causat ran from credit to hous prices, specif that credit suppli shock caus hous price to 
increas abov fundament values.

1223 kumhof et al.: inequality, leverage, and crisesvol. 105 no. 3 

informative, for two reasons. first, the top 5 percent incom share in 1936 be still 
high (32.5 percent), impli that incom inequ have onli veri partial be 
revers sinc 1929. and second, by 1936 the number of new car sell and the per- 
centag of household buy car on installment, after have collaps between 
1929 and 1934, have recov to reach veri compar level to 1927 (olney 1991). 

We use the incom threshold provid by piketti and saez (2003) to classifi 
the respond of both survey into either the top 5 percent or the bottom 95 per- 
cent of the incom distribution. To make the result of the two survey comparable, 
we confin the analysi to instal credit. the survey do not report stock of 
debt but rather flow of new debt associ with instal purchas in the last 
12 months. panel B of figur 2 present the results. In the 1917/1918 survey, the 
new instal debt to incom ratio be both low and similar for both groups, at 
3.0 percent and 3.8 percent for the top and bottom incom groups. In the 1935/1936 
survey, the ratio be much high and, more importantly, much more dissimilar 
across incom groups, at 6.8 percent and 10.9 percent for the top and bottom incom 
groups. In 1935/1936, the ratio of averag incom between borrow in the top 
and bottom group be 3.25, while the ratio of averag amount borrow be onli 
1.6. To the extent that these data be repres of other year dure thi period, 
it indic a significantli high growth in debt-to-incom ratio among the bottom 
incom group.12 

C. wealth by incom group 

In the period prior to both major crises, the rise in incom inequ be asso- 
ciat not onli with diverg debt level across incom groups, but also with diver- 
gent share of overal wealth. 

pre-great-recession.—panel A of figur 4, which be base on scf data, plot 
the share of wealth held by the top 5 percent of the incom distribut between 
1983 and 2007. except for a brief period between 1989 and 1992, thi wealth share 
increas continuously, from 42.6 percent in 1983 to 48.6 percent in 2007. 

pre-great-depression.—panel B of figur 4, which be base on the dataset of 
saez and zucman (2014), plot the share of wealth held by the top 1 percent of 
the wealth distribut between 1920 and 1928. except for 1923, thi wealth share 
increas continuously, from 34.9 percent in 1920 to 47.5 percent in 1928. 

D. leverag and crisi probabl 

To quantifi the link between household leverag and crisi probabilities, we use 
the dataset of schularick and taylor (2012), which contain inform on aggre- 
gate credit and crisi for 14 countri between 1870 and 2008. We follow these 
authors’ methodolog by running, on the full dataset, a logit specif in which 

12 altern sourc for the period immedi prior to 1929 exist and be broadli consist with the 
1935/1936 survey, but they be much more limit in qualiti or scope. see plummer (1927) and bureau of labor 
statist (1929). 



1224 the american econom review march 2015 

the binari variabl be a crisi dummy, and the latent explanatori variabl includ 
five lag of the aggreg loans-to-gdp ratio. the estim logit model be use 
to predict crisi probabl over the full cross section and time seri sample. 
figur 5 report the estim probabl for the unit states. We observ that, 
in the period prior to both major crises, there be a sizabl increas in crisi prob- 
abilities, even though a crisi remain a low probabl event. 

pre-great-recession.—panel A of figur 5 show that the estim crisi prob- 
abil start at 2.0 percent in 1983 and increas to 5.2 percent by 2008. between 
2001 and 2008, the crisi probabl increas by two percentag points. 

pre-great-depression.—panel B of figur 5 show that the estim crisi prob- 
abil almost doubl between 1925 and 1928, from 1.6 percent to 3.0 percent, 
befor reach 4.0 percent in the year of the crisis. 

E. household default dure crise 

both major crisi be character by high rate of default on household loans. 
their magnitud matter becaus the share of loan default on in a crisi be an 
import paramet of our model. 

great recession.—w comput delinqu rate a ratio of the balanc of 
delinqu loan (defin a be past due by 90 day or more) to the total loan 
balance.13 between 2006 and 2010, mortgag delinqu rate increas dramat- 
ically, from 0.9 percent to 8.9 percent, and so do unsecur consum loan delin- 
quenci rates, from 8.8 percent to 13.7 percent for credit card loans, from 2.3 percent 
to 5.3 percent for auto loans, and from 6.4 percent to 9.1 percent for student loan 
(the delinqu rate for student loan reach 11.7 percent in 2013). the figur

mobil instal debt contract (olney 1999). the percentag of car repossess 
increas from 4.1 percent in 1928 to 10.4 percent in 1932. furthermore, reposses- 
sion rate be significantli high for use car than for new car (13.2 percent ver- 
su 5.7 percent in 1932). combin with the fact that wealthi household be much 
more like to buy new car than middle- and lower-class household (calder 1999), 
thi suggest that default rate on instal debt be high among the bottom 
incom group. mortgag default rate be also high dure the great depression. 
accord to a studi of 22 citi by the depart of commerce, by januari 1934, 
43.8 percent of home with a first mortgag be in default (wheelock 2008). 

F. altern explan for the increas in household debt 

the literatur have advanc a number of altern explan for the rapid 
increas in household debt prior to the great recession. In thi subsect we briefli 
look at the empir evid for the two most import altern explanations, 
financi innov and the global save glut. 

financi sector growth and financi innovation.—th styliz fact pertain- 
ing to the evolut of the US financi industri over the last 125 year have recent 
be document by philippon (2013). for the purpos of our paper, the key fact 
are: (i) the financ industry’ share of gdp increas by roughli 50 percent in the 
two period of interest, from 2.8 percent to 4.6 percent between 1920 and 1928, and 
from 5.5 percent to 7.9 percent between 1983 and 2007. (ii) most of these variat 
can be explain by correspond chang in the quantiti of intermedi assets. 
(iii) intermedi be produc under constant return to scale with an annual aver- 
age cost of around 2 percent of outstand assets. (iv) the unit cost of interme- 
diation have not decreas over the past 30 years. thi impli that the substanti 
increas in the gdp share of the financi sector can be explain by the simpl

growth of balanc sheets, without a necessari role for financi innovation.14 In our 
model, that growth of balanc sheet be due to an increas in household credit to bot- 
tom earners, follow an increas suppli of save by top earner after they expe- 
rienc a perman increas in income. accord to philippon (2013), household 
credit repres onli around one-quart of the stock of outstand intermedi- 
ate asset between 1983 and 2007. financi activ that relat to non-household 
credit remain outsid our model. nevertheless, the rough doubl of household 
credit over the 1983–2007 period contribut substanti to the overal increas in 
the gdp share of the financi sector. 

the fact state abov do not howev rule out that financi innov could have 
be an addit sourc of financi fragility. accord to levitin and wachter 
(2012), sever financi product innov that spread dure the last phase of the 
mortgag credit boom (2004–2007) lead to signific underpric of credit risk due 
to the complex and opac of these products.15 interestingly, the seemingli safe 
senior tranch of these secur attract mani foreign investors, contribut to 
the global save glut to which we turn next. 

global save glut.—th global save glut, which link the larg current 
account surplu of asian countri and the larg current account deficit of the 
unit states, emerg in 1998, in the aftermath of the asian crisis. An empir 
challeng be that we cannot directly, from the data, measur the contribut of for- 
eign inflow to the build-up of household credit. We can howev approxim thi 
contribution, by consid the broad categori of privat credit market instrument 
in the US flow of funds, and by draw on the model-bas estim result of 
justiniano, primiceri, and tambalotti (2014). 

In flow of fund data, the ratio of privat domest credit to gdp increas 
from 130.4 percent to 292.3 percent between 1983 and 2007. meanwhil the ratio 
of foreign privat credit asset to gdp increas from 2.8 percent to 34 percent. 
the contribut of foreign asset accumul to privat domest debt accumula- 
tion differ wide between the pre-sav glut period (1983–1998) and the save 
glut period (1998–2007). In the earli period, privat credit grow by 71 percentag 
points, with foreign asset accumul onli account for around 5 percent of 
this. In the late period, privat credit grow by 90.6 percentag points, with for- 
eign asset accumul account for around 25 percent. justiniano, primiceri, 
and tambalotti (2014) perform a quantit model-bas exercis that ass the 
role of foreign capit flow in explain the accumul of US household credit 
over the period 1998–2006. they find that between one-quart and one-third of the 
increas in US household debt can be explain by the dynam of capit flows. 
In section ivd we will show that these find be consist with the empir 
perform of our model over the period 1998–2007. 

14 As state by philippon (2013, p. 7): “sinc the unit cost appear to be roughli constant, the question becomes: 
how do we explain the larg histor variat in the ratio of intermedi asset over gdp?” 

15 thi aspect cannot be captur in our model, in which investor correctli price default risk.

when top earner lend to bottom earners, they offer p t unit of consumpt

tion of loan default on in a crisis. bottom earner default onli rarely, becaus

V t N = V ( s ̂ t , δ t = 0) . bottom earner default when V t D − V t N be high than an i.i.d. 
addit util cost of default ξ t , a in pouzo and presno (2012). We can therefor 
write the decis to default as: 

(11) δ t = arg max 
δ t ∈{0, 1} 



{ V t D − ξ t , V t N } , 

where V t D = V ( b t−1 (1 − h) , y t , z t , ρ u u t−1 + γ u ) and V t N = V ( b t−1 , y t , z t , ρ u u t−1 ) . 
the distribut of δ t depend upon the distribut of ξ t . We have the simpl formula 

(12) prob ( δ t = 1| s ̂ t ) = Ξ ( V t D − V t N ) , 

where Ξ be the cumul distribut function of ξ t . We assum that Ξ take the 
modifi logist form 

(13) Ξ ( x ) =

where ψ < 1 . thi impli that, over the econom relev range, default 
occur with posit probabl but never with certainty.17 the paramet ψ , θ , γ u , 
and ρ u be calibr to match the empir evid for the probabl of crises, 
but with γ u and ρ u in addit constrain by the need to at least approxim 
match the evid on the depth and durat of such crises. the paramet ψ help 
to determin the mean level of crisi probabl over the sample, while θ determin 
the curvatur of crisi probabl with respect to the differ V t D − V t N . 

17 the cost take an infinit valu with probabl 1 − ψ , and finit valu distribut accord to the c.d.f.

D. equilibrium 

In equilibrium, top earner and bottom earner maxim their respect lifetim 
utilities, the market for borrow and lend clears, and the market clear con- 
dition for good holds: 

(14) y t (1 − (1 − z t ) u t ) = χ c t τ + (1 − χ) c t b . 

E. analyt result 

A small number of key paramet of our model affect the speed at which bottom 
earners’ debt accumul follow a drop in their incom share. befor discuss 
the calibration, it be therefor use to analyt deriv some relationship that 
clarifi the role of these parameters. 

debt suppli and debt demand.—on implic of prefer for wealth be 
that a unique, stabl determinist steadi state for financi wealth b t exists. In thi 
steadi state, the euler equat (6) and (10) can be interpret a the hypothet 
price at which top earner and bottom earner would be will to buy and sell 
debt while keep their consumpt constant. these equat therefor repres 
steady-st suppli and demand function for debt. bottom earners’ demand price 
a a function of debt, p(b) , be flat at18 

(15) p(b) = β b , 

while top earners’ suppli price a a function of debt be implicitli give by

the numer on the right-hand side, which equal ( c ̅ τ ) 1/σ , be alway posit 
becaus consumpt util satisfi the inada conditions. equat (17) therefor 
show that for ani model with prefer for wealth ( φ > 0 ), a steadi state with 

18 the simplif of abstract from default, for the purpos of thi exercise, be justifi by the fact that 
default have a neglig effect on the euler equat in the neighborhood of the origin steadi state.

posit debt of bottom earner ( b ̅ > 0 ) requir the condit β b > β τ , which be 
therefor alway satisfi in our calibration. however, thi do not mean that top 
earner be more impati than bottom earners. the reason be that their effect 
impati be give by p(b) rather than simpli by β τ . effect impati be there- 
fore endogen to the level of debt, and the effect steadi state impati of top 
earner be equal to the impati of bottom earners. 

chang in steady-st incom and prefer for wealth.—differenti

which can be show to be posit for ani plausibl calibration, impli that an 
increas in incom inequ rais the steady-st equilibrium level of debt. 

the left and middl subplot of figur 6 show initi credit demand (15) a the 
horizont dash-dot line at a price of debt of approxim 0.96. initi credit 
suppli (16) be show a thick lines, and increas credit suppli after a 10 percent- 
age point increas in the top 5 percent incom share a thin lines. the solid line 
repres the baseline, and the dash and dot line show the effect of varying, 
rel to the baseline, the paramet φ or η , while adjust β τ to remain consis- 
tent with an unchang initi level of steady-st debt. the left subplot show 
that, while the size of the increas in steady-st debt follow the increas in 
credit suppli be independ of φ , a high φ increas the slope of the credit sup- 
pli schedule. therefore, with debt start out at it initi low-debt steadi state, 
a high φ impli that top earner be will to more aggress low interest 
rate on debt (rais the price of debt) to move toward the new high-debt steadi state 
at a high speed. the middl subplot show that a high η , mean a low cur- 
vatur of the util function with respect to wealth, lead to more financi wealth 
accumulation. the reason be that a high η reduc the rate at which margin util 
fall in respons to increas in wealth, so that top earner limit the increas in their 
consumpt more strongli in order to accumul more wealth. 

the margin propens to save.—at shorter horizon of 20–40 years, 
the effect of high φ and high η be hard to distinguish, becaus both tend 
to increas the rate at which debt increas follow a perman increas 
in incom inequality. the margin propens to save (mps) of top earn- 
er follow a perman incom shock be a function of both φ and η . 
the model-bas formula for the mp be deriv in the onlin appendix of thi 
paper. the right subplot of figur 6 show how differ combin of φ and η 
translat into differ mp in that formula.

iii. calibr and solut method 

A. calibr 

We calibr the model at the annual frequency. top earner and bottom earner 
correspond to the top 5 percent and the bottom 95 percent of the incom distribution, 
respectively, χ = 0.05 . the model combin two key mechanisms, the accumula- 
tion of debt by bottom earner follow a perman increas in incom inequality, 
and a ration default decision, with default probabl increas in the level of 
debt. An increas in the default probabl interact with the speed of debt accu- 
mulat through an increas in default risk premia. however, default be partial, 
and default probabl be low, rang from 2.2 percent in 1983 to 5.1 percent 
in 2008, when calibr base on the empir evid of schularick and taylor 
(2012). thi impli that the effect of default risk on debt accumul be veri 
limit dure the 1983–2008 period. the calibr exercis be therefor make 
more transpar by separ paramet relat to debt accumul and to the 
default mechanism.

debt accumulation.— 
preferences: follow mani paper in the busi cycl literature, the curva- 

ture of the util function with respect to consumpt be fix at σ = 0.5 for both 
top and bottom earners. the detail calibr procedur for the prefer for 
wealth paramet φ and η be describ in the onlin appendix. We first use our 
theoret model to deriv an approxim formula for top earners’ mp out of per- 
manent incom shocks. We then use the empir methodolog of dynan, skinner, 
and zeld (2004) to estim the empir counterpart of thi formula, use scf 
and psid data. finally, the model’ prefer for wealth paramet φ and η be 
calibr by equat the model-bas mp to the data-bas mps. We find that 
save rate be a steepli increas function of income, and obtain a baselin mp 
of top earner of 0.397, with a low bound of 0.248 and an upper bound of 0.505.19 
the result baselin paramet valu be φ = 0.05 and η = 1.09 .20 becaus 
we be match one mp use two parameters, these valu be not unique, but a 
show in section ivd, chang the combin of φ and η at a give mp have a 
veri small effect on our results. 

initi steadi state: steady-st output be normal to 1, y ̅ = 1 . the steady- 
state net real interest rate be fix at 4 percent per annum, similar to valu typic 
use in the real busi cycl literature, by fix bottom earners’ discount factor 
at β b = 1. 04 −1 . We calibr the initi steadi state of the debt-to-incom ratio λ t 
and of the top 5 percent incom share τ t to be equal to their 1983 counterparts. In 
the model, λ t be give by21 

(19) λ t = 
(1 − χ) l t __________________ 

y t−1 (1 − z t−1 ) (1 − u t−1 ) 
. 

We choos β τ to replic λ ̅ in 1983, which equal 62.3 percent. To calibr the 
1983 valu of τ t we use the data comput by piketti and saez (2003, updated), 
which includ interest incom but exclud interest payment in the comput of 
annual gross incomes. the model counterpart be give by 

(20) τ t = 
y t z t + (1 − χ) l t (1 / p t−1 − 1) _______________________________ 

y t (1 − u t (1 − z t ) ) + (1 − χ) l t (1 / p t−1 − 1) 
. 

We choos z ̅ to replic τ ̅ in 1983, which equal 21.8 percent. 

exogen shock processes: We estim the exogen stochast process for 
output y t use the detrend seri of US real gdp from 1983 to 2010 obtain from 

19 By consid a wide rang of differ mp estimates, we have take into account the inevit uncer- 
tainti associ with altern method of estim thi magnitude. 

20 We note that the relationship η > σ be consist with the prefer for wealth specif of carrol 
(2000). 

21 thi ratio be defin to be consist with scf data, where debt liabil be measur dure the first 
semest of the survey—at the time of the interview—whil incom refer to incom in the year prior to the survey. 



1234 the american econom review march 2015 

the bea. our estim be ρ y = 0.669 and σ y = 0.012 . for the year 1983–2008 
of the baselin simul we calibr the shock ϵ y, t to exactli match the detrend 
data, while all subsequ shock be set to zero. 

the exogen stochast process for the top 5 percent output share z t be param- 
eter by specifi ρ z and σ z such that the behavior of τ t match that of the 
updat piketti and saez (2003) data seri from 1983 to 2010. use standard 
tests, the hypothesi that thi data seri have a unit root cannot be rejected. In the 
baselin model, we therefor calibr ρ z = 1 , and then estim σ z = 0.008 from 
the data. for the year 1983–2008 of the baselin simul we calibr the shock 
ϵ z, t such that τ t exactli match the data, with all subsequ shock set to zero. 

target and non-target facts: tabl 1 summar the calibr of the 
model, with the except of the default parameters. thi part of the model have ten 
exactli identifi paramet and two (φ and η) that be match use empir 
estim of the mp of top earners. importantly, the use of empir estim to 
independ calibr the prefer for wealth paramet of top earner impli 
that match the post-1983 evolut of the debt-to-incom ratio of bottom earner 
be not a target of the calibration. A comparison of it simul evolut with the 
data will therefor serv to evalu the empir success of our model.22 

default mechanism.—th haircut, or percentag of loan default upon dure

B. solut method 

our model have two featur that advis against the applic of convent 
perturb methods. the first be the presenc of default, which impli larg 
discret jump in state variables. the second be the fact that the stochast process 
for incom share z t be random walk, which in our simul impli that bottom 
earners’ debt-to-incom ratio perman drift far away from it origin steadi 
state. We therefor use a global solut techniqu that adapt the time-it pol- 
ici function algorithm describ by coleman (1991). the comput procedur 
be detail in the onlin appendix.25

A. default region 

In our model, due to random util costs, the state space be divid into region 
with a continuum of probabl of default. figur 7 contain a visual represen- 
tation that divid the state space into region whose boundari repres default 
probabl that increas in equal increment of two percentag points. each sub- 
plot show the debt-to-incom ratio26 on the horizont axi and output on the ver- 
tical axis. the effect of variat in the third state variable, the top output share, be 
illustr by show two separ subplots, correspond to the 1983 and 2008 
top output shares. 

We observ that high debt level impli a high crisi probability, by increas- 
ing the benefit of default without affect the costs. over the histor 
observ rang of debt levels, the impli crisi probabl rang from 2.2 percent 
to 5.1 percent. As be standard in thi class of models, default be more like to occur 
when output be low, becaus at such time the insur benefit of default be high 
while the output cost of default be low. small drop in incom start to have a sig- 
nificantli larg effect on default probabl a we move from region of low debt 
to region of veri high debt. for the same reason a for low output, high top 
output share also lead to high crisi probabilities. but their direct effect, beyond 
the effect that oper through high debt accumulation, be veri modest. 

B. impuls respons

26 We show the debt-to-incom ratio rather than the state variabl debt becaus the former be a key variabl in 
our model. it unit be therefor more intuit and easi to interpret.

that the equilibrium loan interest rate drop by around 85 basi point on impact, with 
a subsequ increas back to it long-run valu that mirror the gradual decreas 
in output. the drop in the interest rate repres an addit incom gain for bot- 
tom earner rel to top earners, so that the top 5 percent incom share fall by 
around 0.35 percentag points. bottom earner smooth their incom gain over time 
by decreas their debt-to-incom ratio by around 0.8 percentag point on impact, 
while still increas their consumpt by more than twice a much a top earners. 

figur 9 show a one standard deviat perman shock to the output share z t . 
the top 5 percent incom share τ t immedi increas by 0.8 percentag points, 
accompani by a downward jump of 0.5 percent in bottom earners’ consump- 
tion and an upward jump of 1.9 percent in top earners’ consumption. the long- 
run increas in top earners’ consumpt be even larger, becaus they initi limit 
their addit consumpt in order to accumul addit financi wealth. 
the process of debt accumul take sever decades, with bottom earners’ 
debt-to-incom ratio increas by around 7 percentag point in the veri long run, 
accompani by an increas in crisi probabl of 0.13 percentag points. the real 
interest rate fall on impact by 9 basi points, due to the increas in credit suppli 
from top earner that initi limit the drop in consumpt of bottom earners. the 
top 5 percent incom share τ t , becaus it includ not onli the output share z t but 
also the interest earn on increas financi wealth, increas in the long run 
by approxim anoth 0.1 percentag points, and top (bottom) earners’ long-run 
increas (decrease) in consumpt be correspondingli larger. We note that the one 
standard deviat incom distribut shock in figur 9 be small compar to what 
occur over the period 1983–2008. 

figur 10 show the impuls respons for a crisi shock. bottom earner default 
on 10 percent of their loans, but they also experi a 4 percent loss in incom due 
to the output cost of default, which be suffer exclus by thi group of agents. 
As a result their debt-to-incom ratio onli drop by around 3.9 percentag points.

C. baselin scenario 

figur 11 show the central simul of the paper. the variabl show be the 
same, and be show in the same units, a in the impuls respons in figur 8–10. 
the horizont axi repres time, with the simul start in 1983 and end 
in 2030. the circular marker repres US data, while the line repres model 
simulations. the data for gdp and for the top 5 percent incom share be use a 
forc process that pin down the realiz of the shock ϵ y, t and ϵ z, t between 
1983 and 2008. post-2008 data for gdp and the top 5 percent incom share be 
show but be not use a forc processes. becaus thi be an endow econ- 
omy, interest rate fluctuat mirror output fluctuations. We assum that a crisi 
shock hit in 2009. the crisi event in 2009 is, a discuss above, character by 
output loss that be somewhat low than observ dure the great recession. 
start in 2009, the model be simul assum a random sequenc of util 
cost shocks, but no further nonzero realiz of output or output share shocks. 
becaus the preced shock impli further increas in debt after 2009, thi 

27 A model with borrow constraint would limit reborrowing. however, data from the crisi period show that, 
while the crisi stop mortgag debt from increas further, unsecur debt kept increasing.

mean that futur endogen crisi remain a possibility, and in fact becom increas- 
ingli likely. 

the key forc variabl be the increas in the top 5 percent incom share from 
21.8 percent in 1983 to 33.8 percent in 2008. In the baselin calibration, the mar- 
ginal propens to save of top earner be equal to 0.397. therefore, top earner save 
a sizabl share of their addit incom in order to acquir addit financi 
wealth, in other word to lend to bottom earners. bottom earners’ debt-to-incom 
ratio therefor increas from 62.3 percent in 1983 to 131.9 percent in 2007 and 
138.8 percent in 2008, accompani by an increas in crisi probabl from 
2.2 percent in 1983 to 5.1 percent in 2008. In the data, the debt-to-incom ratio 
increas from 62.3 percent in 1983 to 147.3 percent in 2007. potenti explan 
for the 15.4 percentag point 2007 differ between model and data be discuss 
in section ivd. 

while the initi debt-to-incom ratio in the model and in the data be match 
through the calibr of the initi steadi state, it post-1983 evolut be not 
target in our calibration. the fact that we nevertheless close match it, after cal- 
ibrat the prefer for wealth specif on the basi of independ micro- 
econom evidence, be therefor a measur of the empir success for our model. 
By match the increas in debt we also match the increas in crisi probability, 
but thi be not an addit independ success of the model, sinc the default 
mechan be calibr so a to replic the empir link between leverag and 
crisi probabilities. 

In the baselin scenario, top earner increas their consumpt by a cumula- 
tive 50 percent until just prior to the great recession, while bottom earner reduc 
their consumpt by 10 percent. the simul top 5 percent consumpt share, 
which be show in the same subplot a the top 5 percent incom share, also increas 
between 1983 and 2008, but by less than the incom share. thi be a necessari 
consequ of the fact that top earner be lending, and be therefor maintain 
low consumpt level than what their incom alon would permit. there be an 
ongo debat in the empir literatur about the rel evolut of consump- 
tion inequ and incom inequality.28 the result of thi literatur be howev not 
directli compar to our results, becaus it have so far not produc an empir 
estim of the top 5 percent consumpt share that would correspond to our model 
simulations. 

for the future, the model predict a further increas of the incom share of top 
earners, not becaus of further increas in their output share z t but rather becaus of 
further increas in debt and associ interest charges. bottom earners’ simul 
debt-to-incom ratio increas from around 140 percent to around 180 percent over 
the post-crisi decade, accompani by an increas in crisi probabl from around 
5 percent to around 8 percent. under the random sequenc of util cost shock 
use in our simulation, the model gener one subsequ crisi in 2028. 

28 krueger and perri (2006) argu that consumpt inequ increas by much less than incom inequ 
between 1983 and 2003. these result have recent be challeng by aguiar and bil (2011), who estim that 
the increas in consumpt and incom inequ mirror each other much more closely. attanasio, hurst, and 
pistaferri (2012) confirm the result of aguiar and bil (2011). By contrast, meyer and sullivan (2013) find that the 
rise in incom inequ have be more pronounc than the rise in consumpt inequality.

the effect of the crisi on bottom earners’ debt-to-incom ratio in the model be 
modest, it drop by around four percentag point on impact but then immedi 
resum it upward trajectory. the reason be the continu upward trend in top 
earners’ financi wealth accumulation, a a result of previou favor shock to 
their incom share. 

D. empir perform of the model 

the crucial implic of the mps-base calibr be that the 1983–2007 evo- 
lution of the debt-to-incom ratio of bottom earner can be use to evalu the 
quantit perform of the model.29 the left subplot of figur 12 illustr 
that thi perform depend on the calibr valu of the mps. for thi figure, 
we calibr the model base on the baselin mp of 0.397, the upper bound mp 
of 0.505, and the low bound mp of 0.248. our baselin simul be reproduc 
a the solid line, the data a circular markers, and low and upper bound mp a 
dash-dot and dot lines. differ in mp be calibr by hold φ at it 
baselin valu of 0.05 and vari η , with a high η (higher mps) impli that top 
earner alloc a larg share of their addit incom to financi wealth accumu- 
lation. the interest rate adjust to ensur that thi high credit suppli be take up by 
bottom earners, who end up with a high debt-to-incom ratio. 

the baselin model track the overal trend in the data well. By 2007, the model 
predict a debt-to-incom ratio of 131.9 percent, versu 147.1 percent in the data. the 
upper-bound model slightli over-predict over the period 1992–1998 but be closer 
to the data toward the end of the period. the lower-bound model under-predict 
throughout. however, even thi calibr predict a 1983–2007 increas in bottom 
earners’ debt-to-incom ratio of around 47 percentag points, which equal well over 
one-half of the increas observ in the data. overall, the baselin model explain 
close to 100 percent of the increas in the debt-to-incom ratio of bottom earner over 
the first 15 year of the period of interest (1983–1998), and approxim 70 percent 
over the last 9 year (1998–2007). thi suggest a possibl role for complementari 
explan over the latter period. As discuss in section if, the global save glut 

29 We focu on thi period becaus the model be simul over 1983–2008 for a seri of inequ and output 
shock that exactli reproduc the data. 2007 be the last pre-crisi data point in scf.

1242 the american econom review march 2015 

can explain around one-quart of the increas in US household debt over thi period. 
thi be roughli the share of household debt that be left unexplain by our model. 

the right subplot of figur 12 show that, onc a mp have be chosen (in thi 
case the baselin mp of 0.397), differ in the combin of φ and η that 
give rise to that mp have onli a veri small effect on the model’ predictions. We 
note that the combin of φ and η show in figur 12 differ by a veri substan- 
tial margin, with the upper bound φ 60 percent larg than the baselin (0.08), and 
the low bound φ 60 percent small than the baselin (0.031). yet the impli 
differ in the behavior of the debt-to-incom ratio be veri small. what matter

evid in the onlin appendix. 

E. pure consumpt smooth and shock persist 

In our baselin scenario, the increas in bottom earners’ debt be due to increas 
credit suppli from top earners. the reason be that shock to the incom distribut 
be permanent, so that neither bottom earner nor top earner have an incent to 
smooth consumption, while top earner have a strong incent to accumul wealth. 

the perman of shock to the incom distribut be consist with the evolu- 
tion of incom inequ between 1983 and 2008, and with the evid of kopczuk, 
saez, and song (2010) and deback et al. (2013). It be nevertheless interest to 
ask what quantit role pure consumpt smoothing, in the complet absenc of 
a wealth accumul motive, could play if shock to the incom distribut be 
perceiv to be more temporary. In that case top earner would have no motiv to 
accumul wealth for it own sake, while both bottom and top earner would have a 
strong incent to borrow and lend to smooth consumption. In other words, in such 
a world there would be an increas role for credit demand rel to credit supply. 

for thi exercis we perform anoth variat of our baselin simul in 
which wealth do not enter the util function of top earner ( φ = 0 ), both 
incom group have the same discount factor ( β b = β τ = 1. 04 −1 ), and shock to 
the inequ process be highli persist but not permanent. the initi valu of 
all endogen variabl be ident to the baselin case. the result be show in 
figur 13, under the assumpt ρ z = 0.98 . 

We observ that for thi particular persist paramet the effect of consump- 
tion smooth be similar to those of prefer for wealth in the baseline, with 
both debt and crisi probabl increas by similar magnitud prior to the crisis. 
but thi would chang dramat for a less persist z t . In that case the consump- 
tion smooth motiv would becom veri much stronger, becaus it would impli 
that bottom earner continu expect their incom to revert to a much high level 
over a fairli short period. the cumul effect of thi perception, which would 
repres larg and one-sid forecast error over the 1983–2008 period, would be 
a much larg build-up of debt. 

V. conclus 

thi paper have present styliz facts, a theoret framework, and an empiri- 
cal methodolog for calibr it, that explor the nexu between increas in the 



1243 kumhof et al.: inequality, leverage, and crisesvol. 105 no. 3 

incom share of high-incom households, high debt leverag among poor and 
middle-incom households, and vulner to financi crises. We provid evid 
which suggest that thi nexu be promin prior to both the great depress 
and the great recession. In our baseline, theoret model high debt leverag 
aris a a result of perman posit shock to the incom share of high-incom 
household who, due to prefer for wealth, lend part of their addit incom 
back to poor and middle-incom households. thi increas in credit suppli allow 
poor and middle-incom household to sustain high consumpt levels. but the 
result be that loan keep growing, and therefor so do the probabl of a crisi 
that, when it happens, be accompani by a contract in the real economy. thi 
contraction, togeth with a desir of high-incom household to accumul further 
wealth while their incom share remain high, impli that the effect of a crisi on 
debt leverag and therefor on the probabl of further crisi be quit limited. 

It be possibl to use our framework to simul altern scenario for the futur 
of the US economy. one alternative, studi in kumhof, rancière, and winant 
(2013), look at the consequ of a revers of the post-1983 increas in incom 
inequ over a period of ten years. We find that thi would lead to a sustain 
reduct in leverag that would significantli reduc the probabl of further crises.
