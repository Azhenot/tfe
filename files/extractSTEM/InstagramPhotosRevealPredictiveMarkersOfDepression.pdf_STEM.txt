abstract 
use instagram data from 166 individuals, we appli machin learn tool to 
success identifi marker of depression. statist featur be comput 
extract from 43,950 particip instagram photos, use color analysis, metadata 
components, and algorithm face detection. result model outperform 
gener practitioners’ averag unassist diagnost success rate for depression. 
these result held even when the analysi be restrict to post make befor 
depress individu be first diagnosed. human rate of photo attribut (happy, 
sad, etc.) be weaker predictor of depression, and be uncorrel with 
computationally-gener features. these result suggest new avenu for earli

1 introduct 
the advent of social medium present a promis new opportun for earli detect and 
intervent in psychiatr disorders. predict screen method have success an- 
alyz onlin medium to detect a number of harm health condit [–]. all of these 
studi reli on text analysis, however, and none have yet har the wealth of psycho- 
logic data encod in visual social media, such a photograph post to instagram. In 
thi report, we introduc a methodolog for analyz photograph data from instagram 
to predict screen for depression. 

there be good reason to priorit research into instagram analysi for health screening. 
instagram member current contribut almost  million new post per day [], and 
instagram’ rate of new user join have recent outpac twitter, youtube, linkedin, 
and even facebook []. A nascent literatur on depress and instagram use have so far 
either yield result that be too gener or too labor-intens to be of practic signifi- 
canc for predict analyt [, ]. In particular, lup et al. [] onli attempt to cor- 
relat instagram usership with depress symptoms, and andalibi et al. [] employ a 
time-consum qualit cod method which the author acknowledg make it ‘im- 
possibl to qualit analyze’ instagram data at scale (p.). In our research, we incorpo- 
rat an ensembl of comput method from machin learning, imag processing,

and other data-scientif disciplin to extract use psycholog indic from pho- 
tograph data. our goal be to success identifi and predict marker of depress in 
instagram users’ post photographs. 

hypothesi  instagram post make by individu diagnos with depress can be re- 
liabli distinguish from post make by healthi controls, use onli measur extract 
comput from post photo and associ metadata. 

1.1 photograph marker of depress 
photograph post to instagram offer a vast array of featur that might be analyz 
for psycholog insight. the content of photograph can be cod for ani number of 
characteristics: are there peopl present? Is the set in natur or indoors? Is it night or 
day? imag statist properti can also be evalu at a per-pixel level, includ valu 
for averag color and brightness. instagram metadata offer addit information: did 
the photo receiv ani comments? how mani ‘likes’ do it get? finally, platform activ 
measures, such a usag and post frequency, may also yield clue a to an instagram 
user’ mental state. We incorpor onli a narrow subset of possibl featur into our 
predict models, motiv in part by prior research into the relationship between mood 
and visual preferences. 

In studi associ mood, color, and mental health, healthi individu identifi 
darker, grayer color with neg mood, and gener prefer brighter, more vivid 
color [–]. By contrast, depress individu be found to prefer darker, grayer col- 
or []. In addition, barrick, taylor, & correa [] found a posit correl between 
self-identif with depress and a tendenc to perceiv one’ surround a gray 
or lack in color. these find motiv u to includ measur of hue, saturation, 
and bright in our analysis. We also track the use of instagram filters, which allow 
user to modifi the color and tint of a photograph. 

depress be strongli associ with reduc social activ [, ]. As instagram 
be use to share person experiences, it be reason to infer that post photo with 
peopl in them may captur aspect of a user’ social life. On thi premise, we use a face 
detect algorithm to analyz instagram post for the presenc and number of human 
face in each photograph. We also count the number of comment and like each post 
receiv a measur of commun engagement, and use post frequenc a a metric 
for user engagement. 

1.2 earli screen applic 
hypothesi  be a necessari first step, a it address an unansw basic question: Is de- 
pression detect in instagram posts? On find support for hypothesi , a natur 
question arises: Is depress detect in instagram posts, befor the date of first diag- 
nosis? after receiv a depress diagnosis, individu may come to identifi with their 
diagnosi [, ]. individuals’ self-portray on social medium may then be influenc by 
thi identification. It be possibl that a success predict model, train on the entireti 
of depress instagram users’ post histories, might not actual detect depress sig- 
nals, per se, but rather purpos content choic intend to convey a depress condi- 
tion. train a model use onli post make by depress particip prior to the date 
of first diagnosi address thi potenti confound factor. 



reec and danforth epj data scienc (2017) 6:15 page 3 of 12 

hypothesi  instagram post make by depress individu prior to the date of first 
clinic diagnosi can be reliabl distinguish from post make by healthi controls. 

If support be found for hypothesi , thi would not onli demonstr a methodolog 
advanc for researchers, but also serv a a proof-of-concept for futur healthcar appli- 
cations. As such, we benchmark the accuraci of our model against the abil of gener 
practition to correctli diagnos depress a show in a meta-analysi by mitchell, 
vaze, and rao []. the author analyz  studi that evalu gener practitioners’ 
abil to correctli diagnos depress in their patients, without assist from scales, 
questionnaires, or other measur instruments. out of , patient outcom in- 
clude across the pool studies, .% be actual depressed, a evalu separ 
by psychiatrist or valid interview-bas measur conduct by researchers. gener 
practition be abl to correctli rule out depress in non-depress patient % of 
the time, but onli diagnos depress patient correctli % of the time. We refer to 
these meta-analysi find [] a a comparison point to evalu the use of our 
models. 

A major strength of our propos model be that their featur be gener use en- 
tire comput mean - pixel analysis, face detection, and metadata pars - which 
can be do at scale, without addit human input. It seem natur to wonder whether 
these machine-extract featur pick up on similar signal that human might use to iden- 
tifi mood and psycholog condition, or whether they attend to wholli differ infor- 
mation. A comput may be abl to analyz the averag satur valu of a million pixels, 
but can it pick out a happi selfi from a sad one? understand whether machin learn 
and human opinion be sensit to the same indic of depress may be valuabl in- 
format for futur research and applications. furthermore, insight into these issu may 
help to frame our result in the larg discuss around human versu machin learning, 
which occupi a central role in the contemporari academ landscape. 

To address these questions, we solicit human assess of the instagram pho- 
tograph we collected. We ask new particip to evalu photo on four simpl met- 
rics: happiness, sadness, interestingness, and likability. these rate categori be in- 
tend to captur human impress that be both intuit and quantifiable, and which 
have some relationship to establish depress indicators. dsm-iv [] criterion for ma- 
jor depress disord includ feel sad a a primari criterion, so sad (and it 
anti-correlate, happiness) seem obviou candid a rate categories. epstein et al. 
[] found depress individu ‘had difficulti reconcil a self-imag a an ‘outgo 
likeabl person’’, which prompt likabl a an inform metric. We hypothes 
that human rater should find photograph post by depress individu to be sadder, 
less happy, and less likable, on average. finally, we consid interesting a a novel 
factor, without a clear direct hypothesis. 

hypothesi a human rate of instagram post on common semant categori can 
distinguish between post make by depress and healthi individuals. 

hypothesi b human rate be posit correl with computationally-extract 
features.

If human and machinea predictor show posit correlation, we can infer that each set of 
featur track similar signal of depression. In thi case, the strength of the human model 
simpli suggest whether it be good or bad than the machin model. On the other hand, 
if machin and human featur show littl or no correlation, then regardless of human 
model performance, we would know that the machin featur be capabl of screen 
for depression, but use differ inform signal than what be captur by the affect 
rate categories. 

2 method 
2.1 data collect 
data collect be crowdsourc use amazon’ mechan turk (mturk) crowdwork 
platform. separ survey be creat for depress and healthi individuals. In the de- 
press survey, particip be invit to complet a survey that involv pass a 
seri of inclus criteria, respond to a standard clinic depress survey, an- 
swere question relat to demograph and histori of depression, and share social 
medium history. We use the ces-d (center for epidemiolog studi depress scale) 
questionnair to screen particip depress level []. ces-d assess qualiti have 
be demonstr a on-par with other depress inventories, includ the beck de- 
pression inventori and the kellner symptom questionnair [, ]. healthi particip 
be screen to ensur no histori of depress and activ instagram use. see addit 
file  for actual survey text. 

qualifi particip be ask to share their instagram usernam and history. An 
app emb in the survey allow particip to secur log into their instagram ac- 
count and agre to share their data.b upon secur consent, we make a one-tim col- 
lection of participants’ entir instagram post history. In total we collect , pho- 
tograph from  instagram users,  of whom have a histori of depression. 

We ask a differ set of mturk crowdwork to rate the instagram photograph col- 
lected. thi new task ask particip to rate a random select of  photo from the 
data we collected. rater be ask to judg how interesting, likable, happy, and sad each 
photo seemed, on a continu - scale. each photo be rat by at least three differ- 
ent raters, and rate be averag across raters. rater be not inform that photo 
be from instagram, nor be they give ani inform about the studi particip 
who provid the photos, includ mental health status. each rate categori show 
good inter-rat agreement. 

onli a subset of particip instagram photo be rat (N = ,). We limit rat- 
ing data to a subset becaus thi task be time-consum for crowdworkers, and so 
prove a costli form of data collection. for the depress sample, rate be onli make 
for photo post within a year in either direct of the date of first depress diagnosis. 
within thi subset, for each user the near  post prior to the diagnosi date be 
rated. for the control population, the most recent  photo from each user’ date of 
particip in thi studi be rated. 

2.2 particip safeti and privaci 
data privaci be a concern for thi study. strict anonym be nearli imposs to guar- 
ante to participants, give that usernam and person photograph post to instagram 
often contain identifi features. We make sure particip be inform of the risk

individuals. 

of be person identified, and assur them that no data with person identifiers, 
includ usernames, would be make public or publish in ani format. 

2.3 improv data qualiti 
We employ sever qualiti assur measur in our data collect process to reduc 
noisi and unreli data. our survey be onli visibl to mturk crowdwork who have 
complet at least  previou task with a minimum % approv rating; mturk work- 
er with thi level of experi and approv rate have be found to provid reliable, 
valid survey respons []. We also restrict access to onli american IP addresses, a 
mturk data collect from outsid the unit state be gener of poorer qualiti []. 
all particip be onli permit to take the survey once. 

We exclud particip who have success complet our survey, but who have a 
lifetim total of few than five instagram posts. We also exclud particip with ces- 
D score of  or higher. studi have indic that a ces-d score of  repres an 
optim cutoff for identifi clinic relev depress across a rang of age group 
and circumst [, ]. 

2.4 featur extract 
sever differ type of inform be extract from the collect instagram data. 
We use total post per user, per day, a a measur of user activity. We gaug commu- 
niti reaction by count the number of comment and ‘likes’ each post photograph 
received. face detect softwar be use to determin whether or not a photograph 
contain a human face, a well a count the total number of face in each photo, a a 
proxi measur for participants’ social activ levels. pixel-level averag be comput 
for hue, saturation, and valu (hsv), three color properti commonli use in imag 
analysis. hue describ an image’ color on the light spectrum (rang from red to 
blue/purple). lower hue valu indic more red, and high hue valu indic more 
blue. satur refer to the vivid of an image. low satur make an imag ap- 
pear grey and faded. valu refer to imag brightness. lower bright score indic a 
darker image. see figur  for a comparison of high and low hsv values. We also check 
metadata to ass whether an instagram-provid filter be appli to alter the appear- 
anc of a photograph. collectively, these measur serv a the featur set in our primari 



reec and danforth epj data scienc (2017) 6:15 page 6 of 12 

model. for the separ model fit on rate data, we use onli the four rate categori 
(happy, sad, likable, interesting) a predictors. 

2.5 unit of observ 
In determin the best time span for thi analysis, we encount a difficult question: 
when and for how long do depress occur? A diagnosi of depress do not indi- 
cate the persist of a depress state for everi moment of everi day, and to conduct 
analysi use an individual’ entir post histori a a singl unit of observ be there- 
fore rather specious. At the other extreme, to take each individu photograph a unit of 
observ run the risk of be too granular. De choudhuri et al. [] look at all of a 
give user’ post in a singl day, and aggreg those data into per-person, per-day unit 
of observation. We adopt thi preced of ‘user-days’ a a unit of analysis.c 

2.6 statist framework 
We use bayesian logist regress with uninform prior to determin the strength 
of individu predictors. two separ model be trained. the all-data model use all 
collect data to address hypothesi . the pre-diagnosi model use all data collect 
from healthi participants, but onli pre-diagnosi data from depress participants, to 
address hypothesi . We also fit an ‘intercept-only’ model, in which all predictor be 
zero-weight to simul a model under a null hypothesis. bay factor be use to 
ass model fit. detail on bayesian estimation, model optim and selection, and 
diagnost check be avail in addit file . 

We also employ a suit of supervis machin learn algorithm to estim the pre- 
dictiv capac of our models. We report predict result onli from the best-perform 
algorithm, a -tree random forest classifier. As an inform benchmark for com- 
parison, we present gener practitioners’ unassist diagnost accuraci a report in 
mitchell, vaze, and rao [].d 

In evalu binari classif accuracy, a simpl proport of correct classif 
be often inappropriate. In case where data exhibit a class imbalance, i.e. more healthi 
than depress observ (or vice-versa), report naiv accuraci can be misleading. 
(A classif accuraci of % seem excel until it be reveal that % of the data 
model belong to a singl class.) additionally, naiv accuraci score be opaqu to the 
specif strength and weak of a binari classifier. instead, we report precision, recall, 
specificity, neg predict value, and F score for fuller context. definit for these 
term be a follows: 

precis tp/(tp + fp) 
recal tp/(tp + fn) 
specif tn/(tn + fp) 
neg predict valu tn/(tn + fn) 
F  ∗ (precis ∗ recall)/(precis + recall) 
TP = true posit FP = fals posit TN = true neg FN = fals neg 

3 result 
both all-data and pre-diagnosi model be decis superior to a null model (kall = 
.; kpre = .), see page  of the addit file  for a descript of K. all-data pre- 
dictor be signific with % probability. pre-diagnosi and all-data confid lev- 
el be larg identical, with two exceptions: pre-diagnosi bright decreas to %

a null predict valu in the latter case. 

increas hue, along with decreas bright and saturation, predict target class 
observations. thi mean that photo post by depress individu tend to be bluer, 
darker, and grayer (see figur ). the more comment instagram post received, the more 
like they be post by depress participants, but the opposit be true for like re- 
ceived. In the all-data model, high post frequenc be also associ with depres- 
sion. depress particip be more like to post photo with faces, but have a low 
averag face count per photograph than healthi participants. finally, depress partici- 
pant be less like to appli instagram filter to their post photos. figur  show the 
magnitud and direct of regress coeffici for both models.

definit of accuraci metrics. 

A closer look at filter usag in depress versu healthi particip provid addit 
texture. instagram filter be use differ by target and control group (χall = ., 
p = . × –; χpre = ., p = . × –). In particular, depress particip 
be less like than healthi control to use ani filter at all. when depress particip 
do employ filters, they most disproportion favor the ‘inkwell’ filter, which convert 
color photograph to black-and-whit imag (see figur ). conversely, healthi partici- 
pant most disproportion favor the valencia filter, which lighten the tint of photos. 
exampl of filter photograph be provid in addit file . 

our best all-data machin learn classifier, averag over five random iterations, 
improv over mitchel et al. [] gener practition accuraci on most metric (see ta- 
ble ). compar with mitchel et al. [] results, the all-data model be less conserv 
(lower specificity) but good abl to posit identifi target class observ (higher re- 
call). given  observations, our model correctli identifi % of all target class case 
(n = ), with a rel low number of fals alarm (n = ) and miss (n = ). 

pre-diagnosi predict show improv over the mitchel et al. [] benchmark 
on precis and specificity. the pre-diagnosi model found onli about a third of actual 
target class observations, but it be correct most of the time when it do predict a target 
class label. By comparison, although mitchel et al. [] gener practition discov 
more true case of depression, they be more like than not to misdiagnos healthi sub- 
ject a depressed. 

out of the four predictor use in the human rate model (happiness, sadness, likabil- 
ity, interestingness), onli the sad and happi rate be signific predictor of 
depression. depress participants’ photo be more like to be sadder and less happi 
than those of healthi participants. rate assess gener show strong pattern 
of correl with one another, but exhibit extrem low correl with computa- 
tional features. the modest posit correl of human-r happi with the pres- 
enc and number of face in a photograph be the onli except to thi trend. correl 
matrix for all model be avail in addit file . 

4 discuss 
the present studi employ comput machin learn techniqu to screen for 
depress use photograph post to instagram. our result support hypothesi , 
that marker of depress be observ in instagram user behavior, and hypothesi , 
that these depress signal be detect in post make even befor the date of first 
diagnosis. human rate prove capabl of distinguish between instagram post make 
by depress and healthi individu (hypothesi a), but show littl or no correl 
with most comput featur (hypothesi b). our find establish that visual social

medium data be amen to analysi of affect use scalable, comput methods. one 
avenu for futur research might integr textual analysi of instagram posts’ comments, 
captions, and tags. consid the earli success of textual analysi in detect variou 
health and psycholog signal on social medium [, , ], the model of textual and 
visual featur togeth could well prove superior to either medium on it own. 

our model show consider improv over the abil of unassist gener 
practition to correctli diagnos depression. On average, more than half of gener prac- 
titioners’ depress diagnosi be fals posit []. By comparison, the major of 
both all-data and pre-diagnosi depress classif be correct. As fals diagnosi 
be costli for both healthcar program and individuals, thi improv be noteworthy. 
health care provid may be abl to improv qualiti of care and good identifi individ- 
ual in need of treatment base on the simple, low-cost method outlin in thi report. 
given that mental health servic be unavail or underfund in mani countri [], 
thi comput approach, requir onli patients’ digit consent to share their social 
medium histories, may open avenu to care which be current difficult or imposs to 
provide. 

On the other hand, our pre-diagnosi predict engin be rather conservative, and 
tend to classifi most observ a healthy. there be good reason to believe, however, 
that the pre-diagnosi predict accuraci observ repres a low bound on perfor- 
mance. ideally, we would have use the all-data classifi to evalu the pre-diagnosi 
data, a that model be train on a much larg dataset. the fact that the pre-diagnosi 
data be a subset of the full dataset meant that appli the all-data model to pre- 
diagnosi observ would have artifici inflat accuracy, due to inform leak- 
age between train and test data. instead, we train a new classifi for pre-diagnosis, 
use train and test partit contain within the pre-diagnosi data, which left the 
pre-diagnosi model with consider few data point to train on. As a result, it be like 
that pre-diagnosi accuraci score underst the technique’ true capacity. 

regard the strength of specif predict features, some result match common per- 
ception regard the effect of depress on behavior. photo post to instagram by 
depress individu be more like to be bluer, grayer, and darker, and receiv few 
likes. depress instagram user in our sampl have an outsiz prefer for filter 
out all color from post photos, and show an avers to artifici lighten pho- 
tos, compar to non-depress controls. these result match well with the literatur 
link depress and a prefer for darker, bluer, and monochromat color [–]. 
depress user be more like to post photo with faces, but they tend to post few 
face per photo. thi find may be an obliqu indic that depress user interact in 
small social settings, or at least choos onli to share experi of thi sort on social 
media. thi would be in accord with previou find that reduc social interactiv- 
iti be an indic of depress [, , ]. 

other, seemingli obvious, relationship fail to emerge. for example, when peopl 
rat a photograph a sad, that impress be unrel to how blue, dark, or gray that 
photo was. both ‘sad’ and ‘blue, dark, and gray’ be strong predictor of depression, how- 
ever, and semant these descript seem like they should match well with one an- 
other, a well a link to depression. these diverg may serv a the basi for a number 
of futur research inquiri into the relationship between depress behavior and com- 
mon percept of depression.

A gener limit to these find concern the non-specif use of the term ‘depres- 
sion’ in the data collect process. We acknowledg that depress describ a gener 
clinic status, and be frequent comorbid with other conditions. It be possibl that a spe- 
cific diagnost class be respons for drive the observ results, and futur research 
should fine-tun questionnair to acquir specif diagnost information. additionally, 
it be possibl that our result be in some way specif to individu who receiv clin- 
ical diagnoses. current perspect on depress treatment indic that peopl who 
be ‘well-inform and psycholog minded, experi typic symptom of depres- 
sion and littl stigma, and have confid in the effect of treatment, few concern 
about side effects, adequ social support, and high self-efficacy’ seek out mental health 
servic []. the intersect of these qualiti with typic instagram user demograph 
suggest caution in make broad inferences, base on our findings. 

As these method provid a tool for infer person inform about individuals, 
two point of caution should be considered. first, data privaci and ethic research prac- 
tice be of particular concern, give recent admiss that individuals’ social medium data 
be experiment manipul or expos without permiss [, ]. It be perhap 
reflect of a current gener skeptic toward social medium research that, of the  
individu who begin our survey,  (%) refus to share their instagram data, even

endnot 
a the term ‘machine’ (e.g. ‘machin predictors’, ‘machin model’) be use a shorthand for the comput featur 

extract process we employed. signific human bia inform thi process, however, a the initi select of 
featur for extract involv entir human decision-making. 

b data collect sourc code be avail on github, see addit file 1. 
c occasionally, when report result we refer to ‘observations’ a ‘participants’, e.g. ‘depress particip receiv 

few likes’. It would be more correct to use the phrase ‘photograph data aggreg by participant-user-days’ 
instead of ‘participants’. We chose to sacrific a degre of technic correct for the sake of clarity. 

d compar point estim of accuraci metric be not a statist robust mean of model comparison. however, 
we felt it be more meaning to frame our find in a realist context, rather than to benchmark against a naiv 
statist model that simpli predict the major class for all observations.
