superconduct in metal nanowir be strongli influenc by fluctuat of the superconduct order parameter1. thermal activ phase slip (taps) be dominant2 near 
the superconduct transit temperature, tc. well below Tc the 
phase of a homogen superconduct wire can slip by 2π due 
to quantum tunnelling, a process analog to cooper-pair tun- 
nell in josephson junctions3. the notion of coher phase slip 
in nanowir propos by mooij and nazarov4 be support by 
experi by astafiev et al.5 with wire make of nomin homo- 
geneou superconduct material. such cqps, carri by tun- 
nell of magnet fluxon across a superconduct wire, enabl 
devic base on quantum interfer effects, open a rout 
toward a wide rang of quantum devic dual to those that can be 
implement with josephson junctions4,6,7. 

quantum interfer of cooper pair in flux-bas supercon- 
duct quantum interfer devic (squids) be demonstr 
soon after the discoveri of the josephson effect8 and have sinc 
becom a cornerston of superconduct electronics. anoth cor- 
nerston be the lock of the phase across the josephson junction 
to an extern microwav field, result in shapiro step at quan- 
tize voltages9. thi effect be use in high-frequ amplifi and 
detectors, and a the basi for the quantum voltag standard, which 
today underpin the electron industry10. the main motiv 
for studi cqp and dual superconduct devic have so far 
be the promis of a robust quantum current standard base on 
so-cal dual shapiro steps4,11–13, complementari to the josephson 
voltag standard. although thi particular goal have not yet be 
achieved, the experiment observ of cqp in superconduct- 
ing nanowires5 have advanc the understand of one-dimension 
superconduct and coher in disord superconductors14,15 
to the level where dual superconduct electron have now becom 
a possibility. 

convent d.c. squid can be view a a specif imple- 
mentat of the aharonov–bohm (ab) effect16, where interfer 
of the wavefunct of a move charg particl occur when it 
encircl a flux (fig. 1a). In contrast, the aharonov–cash (ac) 
effect, where the interfer of fluxon trajectori occur around a 
static charge17, be dual to the AB effect. the AC effect have previous 

be observ in a varieti of particl and solid-st systems18–21 
and in josephson junction arrays22–26. here we demonstr the 
AC effect in a nomin continu superconductor. our devic 
compris two seri cqp junction in which we achiev charge- 
control interfer of fluxon tunnel in a devic exactli dual 
to the squid. We call thi devic the charg quantum interfer 
devic (cquid). thi coher charge-sensit interferomet 
demonstr the potenti of cqp devic previous explor 
onli through the approximate4 self-dual of josephson junction 
circuits12,22,27–31. such array of josephson junction have be show 
to be a challeng complementari rout toward a quantum cur- 
rent standard base on quantum phase slips32. 

In the cquid, schemat show in fig. 1b, flux coher 
tunnel across two narrow constrict in a superconduct 
wire that we conclud be continu in the superconduct order 
paramet (see evid in supplementari information). the two 
constrictions, of size ~30nm × 50 nm, be connect in seri and 
make out of a continu ~3.3-nm-thick nbn film. these con- 
striction provid well-defin point with an increas phase slip 
amplitude15. the wider, ~100 nm, region (‘island’) between the con- 
striction be coupl through the capacit Cg to a gate electrode. 
the island be make larg enough to prohibit phase slips, but small 
enough to minim it self-capacit shunt the cquid. such 
a shunt capacit would reduc the imped and renorm 
the phase-slip amplitud of the device. 

the charg induc by the gate potenti Vg control the interfer- 
enc of the phase-slip amplitudes, with a period of 2e, in much the 
same way a the effect josephson energi in the squid be tune 
by an extern magnet flux, with a period of φ0, the flux quantum. 
each interferomet becom indistinguish from it dual coun- 
terpart by the dual single-particl exchang (cooper pair or fluxon) 
with the follow addit substitutions: current (cooper-pair 
flow) ↔ voltag (flux flow), charg ↔ magnet flux, josephson 
energi ↔ phase-slip energi and insul ↔ superconductor4. thi 
also impli that the lack of flux quantiz in the squid trans- 
late to the absenc of charg quantiz in the dual device, and 
the induc charg on the island (normal to 2e) precis fol- 
low q = cgvg/2e.

the demonstr of coher quantum phase slip (cqps) in disord superconductor have open up a new rout toward 
explor the fundament charge–phas dualiti in superconductors, with the promis of devic with new function and 
a robust quantum current standard base on cqps. here we demonstr a devic that integr sever cqp junctions: the 
charg quantum interfer device. the charg quantum interfer devic becom the dual of the well-known supercon- 
duct quantum interfer device, and be a manifest of the aharonov–cash effect in a continu superconduct 
system devoid of dielectr barriers.

In much the same way a the insul in a superconductor– 
insulator–superconductor (sis) junction provid a tunnel barrier 
for cooper pair (but not to fluxons), a continu superconduc- 
tor provid a tunnel barrier for fluxon (but not for cooper pairs). 
observ of cqp requir a low barrier for flux tunnel 
across the superconductor, realiz by a high kinet inductance. 
thi be achiev in highli disord superconduct film close 
to the superconductor–insul transit (sit)14,15. the same 
magnitud of the phase-slip amplitud can be realiz in a wider 
constrict for superconductor close to the sit, eas fabric 
requir and increas reproduc due to the exponen- 
tial depend of phase-slip amplitud on constrict width14. 
By use atom layer deposit (ald)-grown nbn films33–35, we 
can now control make high-qual film that be veri close to 
the sit, enabl fabric of multipl veri similar cqp con- 
striction in the same devic use convent nanofabr 
techniques. We have verifi the continu of the superconduct- 
ing order paramet in our film in independ measur 
on microbridges. for the cquid devic present here we also 
confirm that the phase-slip energi in the cquid persist up to 
magnet field much larg than would be possibl for a small- 
area josephson junction, confirm that our cqp junction be 
inde constrict in a continu film. We refer the reader to the 
supplementari inform for further details. 

direct current (d.c.) transport measur be essenti for the 
realiz of a current standard base on cqps4,13,31,36–38; however, 
these be often complic by incoher effect such a coulomb 
blockad and dissipation. To demonstr cqp interfer in the 
cquid we instead follow the methodolog of previou studies5,14,15 
and use microwav spectroscopy, which provid a tool for mea- 
sure the tunnel energi in quantum systems. In particular, the 
cooper pair box connect to a reservoir via a squid allow one to 
control and measur the cooper-pair tunnel energi (josephson 
energy) of the squid39. We develop an exact dual measur 
circuit: the cquid be implement in a loop with a high but finit 
inductance. the result flux state provid a degre of freedom 
orthogon to the energi spectrum of the cquid and the fluxon 
flow due to cqps. the circuit allow u to directli measur the 

tunnel energi of the cquid (tunnel energi of fluxons); see 
supplementari inform for details. In addition, a high-imped- 
anc environ for flux tunnel be achiev by emb the 
loop in a λ/2 superconduct resonator, make from the same nbn 
film. the reson allow for direct readout of the energi spectrum 
of the devic by dispers microwav spectroscopy5,14,15. 

the reduc hamiltonian describ our devic in the flux basi 
be H = − elσz/2 − esσx/2 (ref 6,40), where σi be the pauli matrices, 

ν= ∣ ∣E h tot be the coupl energi due to the phase-slip ampli- 
tude νtot and EL = 2ipδφ be the induct energi due to the persis- 
tent current Ip = φ0/2lk in the loop with kinet induct Lk and 
δΦ = φext − (N + 1/2)φ0. N be the number of magnet flux quantum Φ0 
in the loop subject to a magnet flux φext tune by an extern sole- 
noid. the energi differ between the ground and the first excit 
state of the diagon hamiltonian be δφδ = + ∕E I e((2 ) )p

where we use νtot = ν1 + ν2ei2πq (ref 22,30,41). ν1 and ν2 be the bare phase- 
slip amplitud for the two junctions, respectively. importantly, the 
phase-slip rate depend onli on the gate-induc charge. thi be a 
direct result of the non-quant charge, and cooper pair be not 
local on the island. the expect 2e-period oscil due 
to the induc charg on the island be a result of the phase-slip 
amplitud interfer across the two junctions. We note that equa- 
tion (1) appli to both cqp and josephson junction chains, and 
a distinct of the underli physic could not be base sole on 
equat (1). We refer the reader to our supplementari inform 
for a thorough discuss on the natur and homogen of our 
cqp junctions.

energi to be suppress to zero. for larg dissimilar phase-slip 
amplitud (ν ν≫1 2), or in the presenc of non-trivi flux bia 
δΦ ≠ nφ0 (where n be an integ number), the variat in Δ E due 
to the induc charg instead resembl a sinusoid dependence, 
a sketch in fig. 1c. We now proceed to the measur of our 
device, which be in veri good agreement with these expectations. 

figur 2a,b show the measur energi level spectroscopi data 
a a function of magnet flux for two differ appli gate voltages. 
from the asymptot linear depend of the energi level tran- 
sition on magnet flux, we extract Ip = 30 nA and Lk = 33 nh, corre- 
spond to the induct per squar of the nbn film L◻ = 1.35 nh. 
bardeen–cooper–schrieff (bcs) theori underestim Lk near 
the sit42. from the normal state per squar resist R◻ = 2.3 kΩ 
measur abov tc, we get L◻ = ħr◻/(π Δ bcs) = 0.67 nH for Tc = 4.7 K, 
differ by a factor of two. figur 2c show the full respons of 
the energi level due to the induc charg on the island at δΦ = 0. 
notably, for each gate voltag we find two spectroscop line that 
deviat in phase from each other in gate voltage. these line be 
shift in charg by exactli half-a-period, which be explain by 
charg interfer (ac effect) and the presenc of non-equilibrium 
quasiparticles. A chang in the number of non-equilibrium quasi- 
particl (nqp) present on the island will chan ge the overal island 
charg by 1e and the AC phase by π . depend on the charg num- 
ber pariti of the island43,44, we observ two differ pariti band 
accord to ν ν ν= + − π( 1) eN i qtot 1 2 

2qp . thi be similar to what have be 
observ in charg qubits45. In the complex-amplitud representa- 
tion of the phase-slip amplitud of equat (1) show in fig. 2e, 
such pariti shift result in two phase-slip amplitud rotat by 
exactli π . the two band be maxim separ at an induc 
island charg of precis q = ne, where n be an integer. 

the oscil provid compel evid for flux interfer- 
ence, the fundament mechan on which the cquid be based, 
and be a demonstr of the AC effect in a solid-st system 

without insul tunnel barriers18,22. thi be further show by 
fig. 2d, show the fit of the data in fig. 2c to equat (1). We 
extract the two phase-slip amplitud ν1 = 9.2 ghz and ν2 = 3.3 ghz. 
thi strong similar in phase-slip amplitud allow u to accu- 
rate compar the cquid oper with theoret predictions. 

We may express the phase-slip energi of a singl constrict 
in term of the dimensionless conduct gξ = rq/rξ of a wire seg- 
ment of length ξ, where Rq = h/4e2 be the superconduct resist 
quantum1: Es = (Δ gξ) exp(− agξ). here the dimensionless parameter6,46 
a ≈ 0.3 be onli weakli depend on the environ of the phase- 
slip junction. for the measur phase-slip amplitud of 3.3 ghz and 
9.2 ghz and for junction dimens of 46 nm × 30 nm and 
39 nm × 30 nm, respectively, we obtain a ≈ 0.29, in excel agree- 
ment with the observ dimens and the expect valu for a. 

As we move the flux bia away from the degeneraci point we 
expect that the variat in transit energi with induc charg 
on the island be suppressed. In fig. 3a we show the differ in tran- 
sition energi at the maximum and minimum of equat (1) with 
respect to the gate-induc charg q a a function of flux detun 
δφ0, and in fig. 3b we show the measur and expect deviat 
of equat (1) from a pure sinusoid depend of Δ E on q. both 
data set be in except good agreement with equat (1). the 
transit linewidth be δe/h = 200 mhz in the weak-driv limit for 
both the even and odd pariti modes, and their occup probabil- 
iti be the same (fig. 3c). thi linewidth be similar to that obtain 
in previou experi where cqp have be studied5,14,15. 

the origin of the pariti fluctuat can be understood by con- 
sider the natur of the junction in the device. We may intro- 
duce an arbitrari number of quasiparticl on the cquid island 
without incur ani addit electrostat energy. instead, the 
normal-st resist determin the time that a non-equilibrium 
quasiparticl spend on the island (in the absenc of recombina- 
tion, which be parity-conserving). We may estim the shortest

quasiparticl resid time on the island a τqp ≈ e2r◻vρ ≈ 2 ns, 
where ρ = 3.8 × 1047 j−1 m−3 (ref. 47) be the densiti of state in nbn 
at the fermi energi and V ≈ 10−22 m3 be the volum of the island. 
thus, in the presenc of non-equilibrium quasiparticl in the 
leads, we expect to have a rapidli fluctuat number of quasipar- 
ticl nqp on the cquid island, lead to the observ behaviour 
of equal probabl for the two pariti over the much longer 
measur timescale. 

the quasiparticl dwell time be compar to the coher time 
τ ≃ 5 n we observ in our time-averag measurements, extract 
from the transit linewidth. 

In addit to pariti fluctuations, we observ larg fraction 
charg jump on a timescal of ~1 hour due to charg fluctuat 
in the surround dielectrics, a clear indic that offset charg 
fluctuat in long wire will affect the coher and phase-slip 
amplitudes, analog to what have be found for josephson junc- 
tion chains32,48. 

We have demonstr control of the interfer of coher 
quantum phase-slip amplitud in a charg quantum interfer 
devic compris of two cqp junctions. the excel agreement 
with theori and larg respons due to the induc island charg 
be compel evid for the AC effect in a continu highli 
disord superconduct system. thi demonstr of dual- 
iti and the cquid be an import step toward a futur quantum 
current standard base on cqps; however, the observ strong 
quasiparticl poison may provid an addit obstacl toward 
it realization. quasiparticl poison may lead to a spuriou qua- 
siparticl current and perturb to the phase lock of bloch 
oscillations48. quasiparticl poison be thu an engin chal- 
leng that need to be address use quasiparticl trap and 
elimin techniques. By place the coher cquid in a high- 

imped environ for d.c. measur it could be use a a 
rout toward a cqps-base current standard.

thin-film technology. the nbn thin film be deposit on undop si(100) 
by plasma-enhanc atom layer deposit (peald). An opal ald system 
from oxford instrument plasma technolog upgrad with a remot plasma 
sourc (icp) and a nitrogen glove box be used. the metal–organ compound 
(tertbutylimido)-tri (diethylamino)-niobium (tbtden) and an hydrogen plasma 
be appli a precursors. the nbn ald process be base on a self-limit 
surfac reaction principl with a well-control layer growth of 0.46 Å per cycle. 
thus, for the cquid experiments, superconduct nbn layer of onli 3.3 nm 
thick be prepar within an ald process of 72 cycles. the prepar 
layer have a granular film structure. more detail be give in ref 33,35 and the 
supplementari material. the precis adjust of chemic composition, crystal 
structur and film thick allow product of nbn layer with the above- 
report high valu of tc, R◻ and l◻, which be essenti for realiz the cquid. 

devic fabrication. To pattern the cquid devic we use electron beam (e-beam) 
lithography. A 50 nm layer of the neg e-beam resist hydrogen silsesquioxan 
(hsq) be expos to a 50 kev beam in a jeol jbx-5500zd e-beam lithographi 
system. the resonator, the loop and the islands, a well a the gate electrodes, 
be expos to a dose of 900 μ C cm−2 while the constrict be defin by do 
between 8.6 mC cm−2 and 31.5 mC cm−2. thi give constrict width in the 
rang 50–70 nm. after the hsq develop (microchem AZ 726 mif), 
the coplanar ground-plan and the microwav and bia gate pad be defin by 
optic lithographi use a standard lift-off technique. the ground plane and 
contact pad be make by thermal evapor of a 5 nm titanium (ti) adhes 
layer and an 80 nm gold (au) layer in a plassi meb 550 S evaporator. dure thi 
step, the reson and the loop with constrict be protect by the optic 
resist. after lift-off, the reson and the loop with constrictions, island and 
gate be defin in the nbn film by reactiv ion etch (rie) use an oxford 

instrument plasmalab 80 plus. the hsq act a a hard mask against the reactant 
fluorin (cf4:ar, 10:1) in the rie process, which etch the nbn much faster than 
the hsq. all au-cov area be protect sinc Au be inert against fluorin rie. 
test structur for d.c. measur be co-fabr on the same films, from 
which we extract valu for Tc and R◻ measur just abov tc. 

measurements. sampl be mount in a dilut refriger with a base 
temperatur of 20 mk, essenti for maxim the coher of the devic and 
minim the effect of thermal activ phase slips. sampl be shield 
by both superconduct and cryoperm shield to minim nois in the flux 
thread the loops. heavili attenu coaxial line be use for microwav 
excit and the transmit signal be pass through two cryogen isol 
befor be amplifi by a cryogen high-electron-mobl transistor amplifi 
at 4 K. the gate voltag be appli through low-pass filter thermocoax 
lines, with addit low-pass filter at the mix chamber stage. the 
measur gate period (2e) at the sampl be 60.1 mv, give an effect 
gate capacit of 5 af, in good agreement with finite-el electrostat 
calcul of the total capacit a see by the island of 20 af, which also 
includ the contribut from the gate capacitance. the dispers readout of 
the reson be perform by appli a weak probe tone at the fundament 
reson frequenc of 3.74 ghz that monitor the phase shift of the reson 
(use a vector network analyser) in respons to a strong tone that induc 
transit in the loop’ energi spectrum. the particular loop present in thi 
manuscript be identifi by it flux periodicity, match to the design loop 
area. thi particular sampl have six loop with work constrictions, allow 
for easi identification.
