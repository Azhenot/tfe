As the record single-junct e�cienc of perovskit solar cell now rival those of copper indium gallium selenide, 
cadmium tellurid and multicrystallin silicon, they be becom increasingli attract for use in tandem solar cell due 
to their wide, tunabl bandgap and solut processability. previously, perovskite/silicon tandem be limit by signific 
parasit absorpt and poor environment stability. here, we improv the e�cienc of monolithic, two-terminal, 1-cm2 
perovskite/silicon tandem to 23.6% by combin an infrared-tun silicon heterojunct bottom cell with the recent 
develop caesium formamidinium lead halid perovskite. thi more-st perovskit toler deposit of a tin oxid 
bu�er layer via atom layer deposit that prevent shunts, have neglig parasit absorption, and allow for the sputter 
deposit of a transpar top electrode. furthermore, the window layer doubl a a di�us barrier, increas the thermal 
and environment stabil to enabl perovskit devic that withstand a 1,000-hour damp heat test at 85 ◦C and 85% 
rel humidity. 

the rapid rise of perovskit solar cell with record single-junct effici of over 22% (ref. 1) be the result of auniqu combin of properties, includ strong optic 
absorption2, long diffus lengths3, and solut process 
enabl by the rel benign natur of intrins defects4. 
additionally, their wide, tunabl bandgap5 make perovskit highli 
attract for use in multijunct solar cell on top of narrower- 
bandgap absorbers, such a silicon, copper indium gallium selenid 
and sn-contain perovskites6–18. thi present a pathway to 
achiev industri goal of improv effici to over 30% 
(ref. 19) while maintain low modul cost20. 

the first monolith perovskite/silicon tandem be make with 
a diffus silicon p–n junction, a tunnel junction make of n+ 
hydrogen amorph silicon, a titania electron transport layer, 
a methylammonium lead iodid absorber, and a spiro-ometad 
hole transport layer8. the power convers effici (pce) 
be onli 13.7% due to excess parasit absorpt of light in 
the hole transport layer, limit the match current densiti to 
11.5ma cm−2. switch to a silicon heterojunct bottom cell and 
care tune layer thick to reduc optic loss increas 
the current densiti to 15.9ma cm−2 and rais the pce to a record 
21.2% (ref. 15). It be clear from these report that minim 
parasit absorpt in the window layer be crucial to achiev 
high current densiti and effici in monolith tandems. 
To thi end, the window layer through which light first pass 
befor enter the perovskit and silicon absorb materi must 
be highli transparent. the front electrodemust also be conduct to 
carri current later across the top of the device. indium tin oxid 
(ito) be wide util a a transpar electrod in optoelectron 

devic such a flat-panel displays, smart windows, organ light- 
emit diodes, and solar cell due to it high conduct and 
broadband transparency21. ito be typic deposit through 
magnetron sputtering; however, the high kinet energi of sputter 
particl can damag underli layers22. In perovskit solar cells, a 
sputter buffer layer be requir to protect the perovskit and organ 
carrier-extract layer from damag dure sputter deposition. 
the ideal buffer layer should also be energet well align so 
a to act a a carrier-select contact, have a wide bandgap to 
enabl high optic transmission, and have no reaction with the 
halid in the perovskite. additionally, thi buffer layer should act 
a a diffus barrier layer to prevent both organ cation evolut 
and moistur penetr to overcom the often-report thermal 
and environment instabl ofmet halid perovskites23. previou 
perovskite-contain tandem utilizedmolybdenumoxid (moox) 
a a sputter buffer layer9,11,12, but thi have rais concern over long- 
term stability, a the iodid in the perovskit can chemic react 
with moox (ref. 24). 

mixed-c perovskit solar cell have consist outper- 
form their single-c counterparts. the first perovskit 
devic to exceed 20% pce be fabric with a mixtur of 
methylammonium and formamidinium (fa)25. recent report have 
show promis result with the introduct of caesiummixtures, 
enabl high effici with improv photo-, moistur and

temperatur or water a a counter reagent. both titanium dioxid 
(tio2) and tin oxid (sno2) have consist prove to be effect 
electron-select contact for perovskit solar cell and both can be 
deposit via ald at temperatur below 150 ◦C (ref 33–35). 

here, we introduc a bilay of sno2 and zinc tin oxid (zto) 
that can be deposit by either low-temperatur ald or pulsed- 
cvd a a window layer with minim parasit absorption, effici 
electron extraction, and suffici buffer properti to prevent the 
organ and perovskit layer from damag dure the subsequ 
sputter deposit of a transpar ito electrode. these layers, 
when use in an excel mixed-c perovskit solar cell atop 
a silicon heterojunct solar cell tune to the infrar spectrum, 
enabl highli effici perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell with 
enhanc thermal and environment stability. 

single-junct perovskit solar cell 
We first fabric single-junct perovskit solar cell on 
ito-co glass to develop a transfer architectur for 
monolith tandem solar cell on silicon. We fabric the 
cs0.17fa0.83pb(br0.17i0.83)3 (csfa) perovskit top cell, with a bandgap 
of 1.63 eV (supplementari fig. 1), in the p–i–n architecture, in 
which the electron-select contact be deposit on top of the 
perovskit absorb layer and act a a window layer. suitabl 
contact for thi geometri includ low work-funct metal oxid 
such a zinc oxid (zno), tio2 and sno2. figur 1a display a 
schemat of the devic structure. the perovskit be deposit on 
top of nickel oxid (niox)—a hole-select contact—to achiev 
high voltag and stabil than with the tradit poly(3,4- 
ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyren sulfon (pedot:pss) 
contact36,37. the csfa perovskit be deposit from a stoichio- 
metric solut contain csi, formamidinium iodide, pbi2, and 
pbbr2 in a mixtur of dimethylformamid and dimethyl sulfoxide. 
thi deposit method be modifi from the literature27 and the 
full detail of devic fabric be provid in the methods. 

To deposit an electron-select contact, we attempt to use 
phenyl-c61-butyr acid methyl ester (pcbm) and aluminium- 
dope zinc oxid nanoparticles, which be previous use suc- 
cess in a methylammonium lead iodid (mapbi3) perovskit 
solar cell38; however, the devic be larg shunt due to the high 
surfac rough of the csfa perovskit (supplementari fig. 2). 
spin coat on rough surfac requir thick, planar layer 
to be appli to prevent shunt pathways, lead to low optic 
transmiss (supplementari fig. 2). evaporation, ald and cvd 
enabl the fabric of uniform, conformal, thin film with high 
optic transmission, regardless of surfac texture. sno2 can be dep- 
osit by ald use tetrakis(dimethylamino)tin(iv) (tdmasn) 
and water at temperatur a low a 30 ◦C (ref. 39), although deposi- 
tion temperatur be know to affect the stoichiometri and electron 
properti of metal oxid films40. We use thi ald chemistri at 
100 ◦C to deposit sno2. other have show that a thin layer of 
pcbm between sno2 and the perovskit increas efficiency29. We 
thermal evapor 1 nm of lif and 10 nm of pcbm to leverag 
their good electron extract properti (supplementari fig. 3), 
while still achiev high optic transmission. We find that lif act 
a a shunt-block layer similar to how thin, insulating, silicon 
oxid layer have be employ previous in thin-film silicon solar 
cell to block shunt pathway and increas fill factor (ff)41. We 
believ that lif help enabl 1-cm2-aperture-area tandem without 
a loss in FF and a larg spread in effici (see supplementari 
fig. 9). additionally, we note that pcbm thermal decompos 
dure evapor to a more thermal stabl isom with veri 
similar electron properties42. 

On top of the pcbm layer, we deposit 4 nm of sno2 by 
ald at 100 ◦c, follow by 2 nm of zto. the x-ray photoelectron 
spectroscopi sputter depth profil of the 4 nm sno2/2 nm zto 
stack in supplementari fig. 4 show onli partial diffus of zinc 

into the sno2 film, indic that 4 nm of sno2 be suffici 
to prevent detect concentr of zinc from reach the 
perovskite. zto be deposit by combin sno2 and zno ald 
process in a repeat supercycl consist of three cycl of sno2 
follow by three cycl of zno (ref 43,44). the paramet for 
the individu sno2 and zno process use in the zto supercycl 
be describ in supplementari tabl 1–4. thi process result 
in an effect growth rate of 5.8 Å per supercycle, or 0.1 nmmin−1. 
We investig faster process method of our window layer by 
reduc the purg time from 30 s to 5 s between pulses. In do 
so, the process approach the pulsed-cvd growth regime, further 
increas the deposit rate to 0.5 nmmin−1, result in a total 
window layer deposit time of approxim 15min. current– 
voltag (j–v ) and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopi data in 
supplementari figur 5 and 6 illustr the ident perform 
and stoichiometri of sno2 and zto layer deposit via ald 
and pulsed-cvd. pulsed-cvd be use in the fabric of our 
champion devices, which be noteworthi a cvd have the potenti to 
reduc process time compar with ald andminim thermal- 
induc degrad dure processing. 

A 150-nm-thick ito electrod with a sheet resist of 30 
per squar be sputter on top of the cell, a in our previou 
work38. optic model of the devic stack indic that thicker 
ito layer introduc signific current loss through parasit 
absorpt (supplementari fig. 7) while thinner layer reduc FF 
due to high seri resistance. the 2 nm of zto be necessari to 
achiev low contact resist with ito and reach a high ff, a 
show in supplementari fig. 3. finally, we finish the devic stack 
with an evapor silver metal electrod around the perimet of 
the 1-cm2 devic area to minim seri resist and a 150-nm- 
thick, thermal evapor lif anti-reflect coating. 

supplementari fig. 3 display the j–v curv of a semi- 
transpar devic on glass compar with a refer opaqu 
device, in which an aluminium electrod be evapor onto the 
sno2/zto bilay instead of sputter an ito electrode. the 
equival effici of the semi-transpar and opaqu devic 
speak to the efficaci of the sno2/zto bilay and sputter ito 
layer a an electron-select contact. additionally, the high FF of 
78.8% and lack of an extract barrier, demonstr by the j–v 
curv in fig. 1b, indic that the bilay be a success sputter 
buffer layer. figur 1c show the extern quantum effici (eqe), 
transmitt and 1−reflect measur from the sno2/zto 
bilay (front) side. the high eqe, with an integr current 
densiti of 18.7ma cm−2, and low parasit loss between 400 and 
750 nm, showcas the optic properti of the bilay and sputter 
ito. the am1.5g-weight averag transmitt of thi devic 
between the perovskit bandgap at 765 nm and the silicon bandgap 
at 1,200 nm be 74%. figur 1b indic that there be still room for 
open-circuit voltag (voc) improvement, a the bandgap-voltag 
offset be over 0.65v. We believ that the origin of the voltag loss be 
primarili due to the difficultli in crystal thecsfaperovskit in 
the invert architectur on a planar surface. supplementari fig. 2 
reveal consider surfac roughness, which may caus void in 
the lif and pcbm layer dure the evaporation. 

two-termin tandem solar cell 
To form two-termin perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells, 
perovskit cell be fabric directli on top of complet silicon 
bottom cells, a show in fig. 2a. the perovskit top cells, one 
of which be show in cross-sect in fig. 2c, be ident to 
their single-junct predecessors, except the niox layer be 
anneal at 190 ◦C for 10 h instead of 300 ◦C for 1 h to prevent 
appreci deterior of the surfac passiv layer in the 
underli silicon cell (supplementari fig. 10). We chose an 
amorph silicon/crystallin silicon heterojunct solar cell 
design for the bottom cell becaus of it high voc, which result

the silicon cell fabric process be adjust to tune the 
silicon cell to the infrar spectrum that they receiv in the tandem, 
a well a for compat with the spin-coat perovskit top 
cells. In particular, the a-si:h layer on both side be slightli 
thicken to enhanc passiv and carrier collection45. A wafer 
with a chemical–mechanical-polish front surfac be use to 
allow for top-cel spin-coating, but the rear of the wafer be 
textur to form random pyramids. the pyramid scatter weakli 
absorb near-bandgap light, elong it path length through 
the wafer and enhanc the cell’ infrar eqe. An excel rear 
reflector compris a silicon nanoparticl (sinp)/silv stack be 
also implemented. the sinp layer, which be atyp in silicon 
heterojunct solar cells, be use becaus of it low refract 
index—with a poros of approxim 60%, it refract index be 
1.4—and high transpar at wavelength longer than 1,000 nm. 
more detail on the use and fabric of the rear reflector 
compris a sinp/silv stack will be present in a subsequ 
publication. insert a thick, low-refractive-index layer between 
the wafer and metal reflector increas the rear intern reflect 
by reduc the fraction of light that reach the lossi metal layer46, 
and a sinp/silv reflector have a rear intern reflect of over 
99% (ref. 47). finally, the front ito layer be thin to reduc 
infrar parasit absorpt sinc it do not need to play the role of 
anti-reflect coat in tandem and because, unlik in a single- 
junction silicon cell, the later conduct of the front electrod 
need not be high. 

In more detail, follow the fabric sequence, an n-type, 
280-µm-thick, double-sid polished, float-zon silicon wafer be 
textur onli on it rear side in an alkalin solution, result in the 
format of random pyramids. intrins and p-type a-si:h film 
(7 and 15 nm thick, respectively) be first deposit by plasma- 
enhanc chemic vapour deposit on the textur (rear) side of 
the wafer, and intrins and n-type a-si:h film (7 and 8 nm thick, 
respectively) be then deposit on the polish (front) side. A 
20-nm-thick, highli transpar ito layer be next sputter on 
the front side through a shadow mask, defin 11mm × 11mm 
squar cells, to act a a recombin junction between the silicon 
and perovskit cells. A 20-nm-thick, highli transpar ito layer 
be also deposit over the rear side through the same shadow 
mask, follow by a 300-nm-thick sinp layer spray coat through 

a stainless-steel mesh to defin local openings48, and finally, a 
200-nm-thick silver layer. figur 2b show a plan-view microscop 
imag of the pattern sinp layer befor silver sputtering; the 5% 
uncoat area allow the silver to make direct electr contact 
to the underli ito layer (fig. 2d), wherea the sinp in the

On it own, the silicon bottom cell have an effici well below 
10% becaus of low FF caus by the high sheet resist of the 
thin front ito layer and lack of metal fingers, and becaus of low 
short-circuit current densiti (jsc) caus by the high reflect 
of the planar front surfac and lack of appropri anti-reflect 
coating. the best 4-cm2 silicon heterojunct solar cell fabric

becaus of a 10mv voc loss from increas edg recombination, 
and a compar cell with a planar front surfac (a in the tandem) 
be expect to reach onli 19–20%.

the tandem be held at it maximum power point for over 
half an hour, under constant illumination, and maintain 23.6%

4.2ma cm−2. (a parasit absorpt still exists, not all transmit 
photon would be convert into electron–hol pairs.) the short- 
wavelength parasit absorpt loss associ with the first pa 
through the layer at the front of the solar cell be 1.2ma cm−2 
(0.7ma cm−2 from the ito and 0.5ma cm−2 from the pcbm and 
sno2/zto bilayer, accord to our optic simulations) would be 
gain a current in the top cell if the parasit absorpt be 
eliminated. the infrar parasit absorption, which may occur in 
ani layer in the tandem, appear to be larg at 3.3ma cm−2, but thi 
‘loss’ be mislead becaus not all of thi current be avail to be 
gained. elimin infrar parasit absorpt will result in a jsc 
gain (in the bottom cell) of less than half that valu because—even 

assum lambertian light trapping—much of the light will escap 
out the front of the cell and contribut to the measur reflectance. 

improv stabil of perovskit solar cell 
In addit to act a a highli transpar and conduct 
electrode, ito—bi virtu of it behaviour a a diffus barrier— 
can significantli increas the thermal and environment stabil 
of a perovskit solar cell by trap the volatil methylammonium 
cation38,49. the increas thermal stabil of the thermodynam 
favourable27 mix csfa perovskit compar with the pure 
methylammonium perovskite26, along with the dense, pinhole-fre 
ald sno2/zto bilayer, should result in perovskit solar cell 
with even great stabil than previous reported. We test 
the stabil of single-junct csfa mix perovskit solar cell 
by oper 0.48-cm2-aperture-area devic at the maximum 
power point without addit encapsul under continuous, 
one-sun-equivalent, visibl illumin with a sulfur plasma lamp. 
the test be perform in ambient condit with an averag room 
humid of around 40% and the lamp heat the sampl to 35 ◦c. 
remarkably, the devic oper with minim degrad in 
perform for over 1,000 h of testing, a show in fig. 3a. In our 
previou study, small dust particl in the perovskit result in pin- 
hole in the ito encapsulation, creat a pathway for methylam- 
monium evolut and caus eventu effici degradation38.

figur 3 | stabil of perovskit top cell. a, e�cienc (black), jmpp (red), and vmpp (blue) of a single-junct perovskit devic with no addit 
encapsul dure 1,000 h of continu maximum-power-point tracking. b, e�cienc (black), jmpp (red), and vmpp (blue) of a single-junct 
perovskit devic packag with eva, glass, and a butyl rubber edg seal dure damp heat testing. 

In the present csfa devices, however, no such pinhole-bas 
degrad be appar after 1,000 h of operation, speak to the 
efficaci of the conform ald process to prevent pinhol format 
and to the overal increas stabil of the csfa perovskite. 

although the cell in fig. 3a have the same effici after 
1,000 h a at the start of the test, thi effici be not constant 
over the test period. As can be see in fig. 3a, the rise in 
effici dure the first 400 h correspond to an increas in 
voltag (vmpp), suggest an improv of the nio/perovskit 
interfac or increas perovskit crystallinity. vmpp start at onli 
a modest valu but the lack of vmpp decay dure the test be 
noteworthy. fall current densiti (jmpp) be the culprit for the 
decreas in effici over the last 600 h of the test. the exact 
caus of thi decreas in jmpp be current be studied, but 
potenti caus be the lack of an edg seal or pinhol in the 
ito layer caus by dust particles; either case would lead to 
evolut of the organ cation. however, both of these potenti 
issu can be solv through proper devic encapsulation. the 
vast major of commerci silicon solar modul be encapsul 
with the elastomer polym ethylene-vinyl acet (eva) and a 
glass cover sheet to prevent oxid and moistur ingress, and 
thu to enable>25-year lifetimes. lamin of eva be typic 
perform at 110–150 ◦C for 30min under mild vacuum. the 
increas thermal stability38 of our perovskit devic with the 
sputter ito electrod enabl u to compar the stabil of our 
devic directli with convent silicon modul by packag 
our devic use thi industry-standard encapsul process. We 
lamin single-junct perovskit devic between two sheet of 
glass with eva at a cure temperatur of 140 ◦C for 20min. A butyl 
rubber edg seal be use to prevent moistur ingress. 

To test the efficaci of thi packaging, we perform the 
damp heat test describ in the intern electrotechn 
commiss (iec) design qualif test protocol 61215 for 
‘crystallin silicon terrestri photovolta (pv) modules’. these 
be acceler lifetim test with the goal of rigor test 
modul for the same failur mechan observ in the field in 
a much shorter time. the damp heat test requir that the modul 
withstand 85 ◦C and 85% rel humid for 1,000 h with nomor 
than 10% degrad in performance. We perform thi damp 
heat test on two packag perovskit devic over the cours of 
6 week (1,008 h). the devic be take out of the dark damp 
heat chamber onc a week and measur with a maximum-power- 
track program until the effici stabilized. figur 3b show 
the voltage, current and effici at maximum power each week. 
not onli do the devic pa the damp heat test, they improv over 
the cours of the test. while the effici of the devic be initi 

limit by poor ff, vmpp increas throughout the test, similar to 
under continu illumin (fig. 3a). however, unlik in the 
continuous-illumin study, jmpp remain constant throughout 
the cours of the damp heat test, indic that the packag 
success address potenti problem such a pinhol in the 
ito and an improp edg seal. 

conclus 
An ald- or pulsed-cvd-process sno2/zto window layer have 
enabl the success fabric of perovskit solar cell with high 
effici and improv stability. these vapour process produc 
a compact, conformal, uniform and highli transpar sno2/zto 
bilay with effici hole-block abil and sputter buffer layer 
properties, allow for 1-cm2 devic with no pinholes. these 
devic have the thermal and ambient stabil to be further seal 
with industry-standard encapsul such a eva and glass. In 
addit to be make a single-junct devic on glass, the 
same devic be fabric on silicon solar cell with planar 
front surfac to form two-termin tandems. when the perovskit 
cell be coupl with silicon heterojunct bottom cell with 
an excel rear reflector and a-si:h and ito layer adjust for 
the exclus infrar spectrum, the result tandem reach 
an effici of 23.6% with no hysteresi and stabl maximum 
power over more than 30min under illumination. thi effici 
be well beyond that of both sub-cells, beyond that of the record 
single-junct perovskit cell, and approach that of the record 
single-junct silicon cell. performance-loss simul suggest 
that the effici can be increas further by widen the 
bandgap of the perovskit and reduc front-surfac reflection, 
which will enabl both high match current densiti and high 
voltage. perovskite/silicon tandemswith anald sno2/zto-bilay 
layer present a promis method to achiev industry-standard 
oper lifetim with pathway to rais effici over 
30% (ref. 19).

(sigma-aldrich). the solut be deposit through a 0.2 µm ptfe filter and 
spun at 1,000 r.p.m. for 11 s, follow by 6,000 r.p.m. for 30 s. dure 
spin-coating, chlorobenzen be quickli dispens 5 s prior to the end of the spin 
process a an antisolv to assist perovskit crystallization. the film be 
anneal on a hot plate at 50 ◦C for 1min and then anneal at 100 ◦C for 
30min. thi deposit method be adapt from the literature27. next, we 
thermal evapor 1 nm of lif and a thin 10 nm layer of pcbm. then, we 
deposit 4 nm of stoichiometr sno2 with pulsed-cvd at 100 ◦C on top of the 
pcbm, follow by 2 nm of zinc tin oxide. tin oxid and zinc oxid pulsed-cvd 
process be develop on an arradi gemstar-6 ald system at 100 ◦c. 
the sno2 pulsed-cvd cycl consist of the process sequence: 5 s purg 
(30 sccm n2), 1.5 s tdmasn puls (30 sccm n2), 5 s purg (90 sccm n2), 1 s 
deioniz water puls (90 sccm n2) and 5 s of purg (90 sccm n2) 
(5 s/1.5 s/5 s/1 s/5 s). the door and bodi temperatur be maintain at 100 ◦C 
for the hot-wal reactor while the manifold temperatur be 115 ◦C with a 
precursor temperatur of 60 ◦c. pulsed-cvd of zinc oxid be grown at 100 ◦C 
use diethyl zinc and water with the process sequence: 100ms/5 s/1 s/5 s with 
a constant 90 sccm N2 flow. the reactor temperatur be the same a the tin 
oxid process, but the diethyl zinc precursor be unheated. note that ald can be 
perform instead of pulsed-cvd above. see supplementari tabl 1–4 for 
detail of the ald and pulsed-cvd process parameters. for the semi-transpar 
and monolith tandem devices, 150 nm of ito be deposit through d.c. 
sputtering. the sputter deposit of ito film in the work be perform a 
previous described38. An ito wit sampl on glass have a mobil of 
43 cm2 v−1 s−1 and a carrier concentr of 3.5 × 1020 cm−3. We finish the 
devic stack with an evapor or sputter silver metal electrod around the 
perimet of the 1 cm2 devic area to minim seri resist and subsequ 
evapor 150 nm of lif a a second anti-reflect coating. for the damp heat 
stabil testing, the single-junct solar cell be packag between top and 
bottom eva encapsul and two sheet of 3-mm-thick glass. the butyl rubber 
edg seal be place a a frame on the outer edg of the glass dure assembly. 
the packag get press with 1,000mbar pressur at 140 ◦C for 20min for the 
edg seal to soften and the encapsul to cure. 

silicon devic fabrication. An n-type, 280-µm-thick, double-sid polished, 
float-zon wafer be use a the start substrate. A 250-nm-thick silicon 
nitrid layer be deposit by plasma-enhanc cvd in an amat p5000 tool on 
one side of the wafer a a protect coating, and the wafer be then textur on 
the uncoat side in potassium hydroxid to reveal random pyramids. after 
remov the nitrid coat in dilut hydrofluor acid, the wafer be clean 
in piranha and rca-b solutions, and the oxid be remov in buffer oxid 
etchant prior to deposit of amorph silicon (a-si:h) layers. intrins and 
p-type a-si:h film (7 and 15 nm thick, respectively) be first deposit by 
plasma-enhanc cvd on the textur (rear) side of the wafer, and intrins and 
n-type a-si:h film (7 and 8 nm thick, respectively) be then deposit on the 
polish (front) side. A 20-nm-thick indium tin oxid (ito) layer be sputter 
from a 90/10 in2o3/sno2 in an mrc 944 tool on the polish side of the wafer 
through a shadow mask to defin squar cell 11mm on a side. A 20-nm-thick 
ito layer be also sputter over the textur surfac through the same shadow 
mask. the front ito layer be deposit use a 2.3:100 oxygen/argon mixture, 
which result in film with electron densiti and mobil of approxim 
5 × 1020 cm−3 and 25 cm2 v−1 s−1, respect after anneal at 200 ◦c; in 
contrast, the rear ito layer be deposit use a 4.1:100 oxygen/argon mixture, 
which result in film with electron densiti and mobil of approxim 
2 × 1020 cm−3 and 25 cm2 v−1 s−1, respectively, after anneal at 200 ◦c. the 
textur surfac be subsequ coat with a 300-nm-thick silicon 
nanoparticl layer that be spray-coat through a stainless-steel mesh (in 
contact with the wafer) to defin local open occupi approxim 5% of 
the total area. the nanoparticl be synthes and deposit in a custom tool 
that us a flow-through plasma process to nucleat nanoparticl from silan ga 
and deposit them via acceler through a nozzl toward a substrate. the wafer 
be next anneal at 200 ◦C for 20min to partial oxid the nanoparticles, and 
a 200-nm-thick silver layer be sputter through the shadow mask to cover the 
textur surface, finish the cell. 

devic characterization. current–voltag measur be perform use a 
keithley model 2400 digit sourc meter. A 300w xenon lamp (oriel) solar 
simul be use to irradi semi-transpar devic from the bottom glass 
side. To irradi tandem and semi-transpar devic from the top, an oriel 
sol3a solar simul be used. To negat spectral mismatch between our 
refer kg5 diod and the respons of the perovskit and silicon solar cells, the 
lamp be calibr to match the integr photocurr calcul by eqe. for 
the semi-transpar devices, the j–v curv be measur from forward to 
revers bia with a 0.1v s−1 scan rate. the semi-transpar devic be initi 
test use a maximum-power-track program that be a perturb-and-measur 
program with voltag step of 5mv. onc the devic effici have stabil for 
at least 10min, a j–v scan be taken. for the monolith tandem devices, both 

forward-to-revers and reverse-to-forward scan be measur at a rate of 
0.12v s−1. report valu for effici be all evalu on the basi of steadi 
maximum-power-point oper for a minimum of a minute. the opaqu cell 
and semi-transpar cell be illumin through 0.12 and 0.39 cm2 apertur 
areas, respectively. the perovskite/silicon tandem all have an apertur area of 
1 cm2. the eqe be record a a function of the wavelength use a keithley 
model 236. A 100w tungsten lamp (newport) be use a the excit sourc 
and focu through a princeton instrument spectrapro 150 monochromator. 
the monochromat light be chop at around 73hz and stanford research 
system sr830 model lock-in be use to monitor the perovskit signal at the 
chop frequency. data be averag for 5 s at each wavelength. each 
individu sub-cel in the tandem must be electr isol to obtain an eqe 
spectrum. We light-bias the silicon sub-cel with a 980 nm laser diod from 
thorlab and the perovskit sub-cel with a white-light led array to measur the 
eqe of the perovskit and silicon sub-cells, respectively. No white-light bia be 
use dure the eqe measur of the single-junct perovskit devices. To 
measur the unpackag stabil under continu illumination, devic be
