We show how a quantum comput can be employ to elucid reaction mechan in com- 
plex chemic systems, use the open problem of biolog nitrogen fixat in nitrogenas a 
an example. We discu how quantum comput can augment classical-comput simul for 
such problems, to significantli increas their accuraci and enabl hitherto intract simulations. 
detail resourc estim show that, even when take into account the substanti overhead of 
quantum error correction, and the need to compil into discret gate sets, the necessari computa- 
tion can be perform in reason time on small quantum computers. thi demonstr that 
quantum comput will realist be abl to tackl import problem in chemistri that be 
both scientif and econom significant. 

chemic reaction mechan be network of molecu- 
lar structur repres short- or long-liv intermedi- 
ate connect by transit structures. At it core, thi 
surfac be determin by the nuclear coordin depen- 
dent electron energy, i.e., by the born–oppenheim 
surface, which can be supplement by nuclear-mot 
corrections. the rel energi of all stabl structur 
on thi surfac determin the rel thermodynam 
stability. differ of the energi of these local minimum 
to those of the connect transit strucur determin 
the rate of interconversion, i.e., the chemic kinet of 
the process. reaction rate depend on rate constant that 
be evalu from these latter energi differ enter- 
ing the argument of exponenti functions. hence, veri 
accur energi be requir for the reliabl evalu 
of the rate constants. 

the detail understand and predict of complex 
reaction mechan such a transition-met catalyz 
chemic transform therefor requir highli accu- 
rate electron structur methods. however, the electron 
correl problem remains, despit decad of progress 
[1], one of the most vex problem in quantum chem- 
istry. while approxim approaches, such a densiti 
function theori [2], be veri popular and have success- 
fulli be appli to all kind of correl electron 
structures, their accuraci be too low for truli reliabl 
quantit predict (see, e.g., refs. [3, 4]). On clas- 
sical computers, molecul with much less than a hundr 
strongli correl electron be alreadi out of reach for 
systemat improv ab initio method that could 
achiev the requir accuracy. 

the appar intract of accur simul for 
such quantum system lead richard feynmann to propos 
quantum comput (see appendix A for a brief review 
of quantum computing). the promis of exponenti 
speedup for quantum simul on quantum comput 
be first investig by lloyd [5] and zalka [6] and be 
directli appli to quantum chemistri by lidar, aspuru– 
guzik and other [7–11]. quantum chemistri simul 
have remain an activ area within quantum algorithm 

development, with ever more sophist method be- 
ing employ to reduc the cost of quantum chemistri 
simul [12–20]. 

the promis of exponenti speedup for the electron 
structur problem have lead mani to suspect that quan- 
tum comput will one day revolution chemistri and 
materi science. however, a number of import ques- 
tion remain. not the least of these be the question of how 
exactli to use a quantum comput to solv an import 
problem in chemistry. the inabl to point to a clear 
use case complet with resourc and cost estim be a 
major drawback; after all, even an exponenti speedup 
may not lead to a use algorithm if a typical, practic 
applic requir an amount of time and memori so 
larg that it would still be beyond the reach of even a 
quantum computer. 

here, we demonstr for an import prototyp 
chemic system how a quantum comput would be use 
in practic to address an open problem and to estim 
how larg and how fast a quantum comput would have 
to be to perform such calcul within a reason 
amount of time. thi set a target for the type and size of 
quantum devic that we would like to emerg from exist- 
ing research and further give confid that quantum 
simul will be abl to provid answer to problem 
that be both scientif and econom impactful. 

the chemic process that we consid in thi work be 
that of biolog nitrogen fixat by the enzym nitro- 
genas [22]. thi enzym accomplish the remark 
transform of turn a dinitrogen molecul into two 
ammonia molecul (and one dihydrogen molecule) un- 
der ambient conditions. wherea the industri haber- 
bosch catalyst requir high temperatur and pressur 
and be therefor energi intensive, the activ site of mo- 
depend nitrogenase, the iron molybdenum cofactor 
(femoco) [23, 24], can split the dinitrogen tripl bond at 
room temperatur and standard pressure. mo-depend 
nitrogenas consist of two subunits, the Fe protein, a ho- 
modimer, and the mofe protein, an α2β2 tetramer. fig-

tail on the chemic mechan and theoret attempt 
be hamper by intrins methodolog limit of 
tradit quantum chemic methods. nitrogen fixa- 
tion also turn out to be a true challeng for synthet 
approach and onli three homogen catalyst work- 
ing under ambient condit have be discov so far 
[25–27]. all of them decompos under reaction condit 
a highlight by an embarassingli low turnov number 
of less than a dozen. 

I. quantum chemic method for 
mechanist studi 

standard concept 

At the heart of ani chemic process be it mecha- 
nism, the elucid of which requir the identif 
of all relev stabl intermedi and transit state 
and the calcul of their properties. the latter allow 
for experiment verification, wherea energi associ 
with these structur provid access to thermodynam 
stabil and kinet accessibility. In general, a multitud 
of charg and spin state need to be explicitli calcul 
in search for the relev one that make the whole chem- 
ical process viable. thi can lead to thousand of elemen- 
tari reaction step [28] whose reaction energi must be 
reliabl calculated. 

In the case of nitrogenase, numer proton in- 
termedi of dinitrogen-coordin femoco and sub- 
sequent reduc intermedi in differ charg and 
spin state be feasibl and must be assess with re- 
spect to their rel energy. especi kinet mod- 

ell pose tight limit on the accuraci of activ 
energi enter the argument of exponenti in rate 
expressions. 

although most chemic process be local and there- 
fore involv onli a rather small number of atom (usu- 
alli one or two bond be broken or form at a time), 
they can be modul by environment effect (e.g., 
a protein matrix or a solvent). for the consider 
of such environ effects, mani differ emb 
method [29–33] be available. they incorpor envi- 
ronment terms, rang from classic electrostat to 
full quantum descriptions, into the hamiltonian to be 
diagonalized. 

for nitrogenase, an electrostat quantum- 
mechanical/molecular-mechan (qm/mm) model 
that captur the emb of femoco into the protein 
pocket of nitrogenas can properli account for the 
energi modul of the chemic transform step 
at femoco. accordingly, we consid a structur 
model for the activ site of nitrogenas (fig. 1 left) 
carri onli model of the anchor group of the 
protein, which repres a suitabl QM part in such 
calculations. To studi thi bare model be no limit a 
it do not at all affect our feasibl analysi (becaus 
electrostat qm/mm emb do not affect the 
number of orbit consid for the wave function 
construction). We carri out (full) molecular structur 
optim with densiti function theori (dft) 
method of thi femoco model in differ charg and 
spin state in order to not base our analysi on a singl 
electron structure. while our femoco model describ 
the rest state, bind of a small molecul such 
a dinitrogen, dihydrogen, diazene, or ammonia will 
not decis increas or reduc the complex of it 
electron structure. see appendix H for more details.

a suitabl chosen fock operator. A four-index transform from the atom orbit to the molecular basi produc all 
integr requir for the second-quant hamiltonian. onc the quantum comput produc the (ground-state) energi of 
thi hamiltonian, it can be supplement by correct that consid nuclear motion effect to yield enthalp and entrop 
quantiti at a give temperatur accord to standard protocol (e.g., from dft calculations). the temperature-correct 
energi differ between stabl intermedi and transit structur then enter rate express for kinet modeling. for 
complex chemic mechanisms, thi model might point to the explor of addit structures. 

elucid reaction mechan 

understand a complex chemic mechan re- 
quir the explor of a potenti energi landscap 
that result from the born–oppenheim approximation. 
thi approxim assign an electron energi to everi 
molecular structure. the accur calcul of thi en- 
ergi be the pivot challenge, here consid by quantum 
computing. characterist molecular structur be op- 
timiz to provid local minimum structur indic 
stabl intermedi and first-ord saddl point rep- 
resent transit structures. the electron energi 
differ for elementari step that connect two min- 
ima through a transit structur enter express for 
rate constant by virtu of eyring’ absolut rate the- 
ori (art) which be a detail quantum- and statistical- 
mechan interpret of the phenomenolog rate 
express by arrhenius. although more inform on 
the potenti energi surfac a well a dynam and quan- 
tum effect may be take into account, art be accur 
even for larg molecular system such a enzym [34, 35]. 
these rate constant then enter a kinet descript of 
all elementari step that ultim provid a complet 
pictur of the chemic mechan under consideration. 

exact diagon method in chemistri 

If the frontier orbit region around the fermi level of 
a give molecular structur be dense, a be the case in 
π-conjug molecul and open-shel transit metal 
complexes, then so-cal strong static electron cor- 

relat play a decis role alreadi in the ground 
state. thi be even more pronounc for electroni- 
calli excit state relev in photophys and pho- 
tochem process such a light harvest for clean 
energi applications. such situat requir multi- 
configur method of which the complete-active- 
space self-consistent-field (casscf) approach have be 
establish a a well-defin model that also serf a the 
basi for more advanc approach [36]. 

cas-typ approach requir the select of orbit 
for the cas, usual from those around the fermi en- 
ergy. thi ca select be an art that, however, may 
be automat [37, 38]. while cas-typ method well 
account for static electron correlation, the remain 
dynam correl be decis for quantit results. 
A remain major drawback of exact-diagon 
scheme therefor be to includ the contribut of all 
neglect virtual orbitals. 

casscf be tradit implement a an exact di- 
agon method, which limit it applic to 18 
electron in 18 (spatial) orbit becaus of the steep scal- 
ing of many-electron basi state with the number of elec- 
tron and orbit [39]. the polynomi scale densiti 
matrix renorm group (dmrg) algorithm [40] 
can push thi limit to about 100 spatial orbitals. this, 
however, also come at the cost of an iter procedur 
whose converg for strongli correl molecul is, 
due to the matrix product state represent of the 
electron wave function, neither easi to achiev nor be it 
guaranteed. the groundstat energi output by quan- 
tum comput simul be not affect by these is- 
sues, but present other accuraci consider that we 
quantifi below.

way quantum comput will help solv these 
problem 

As long a molecular structur optim cannot be 
effici implement on a quantum computer, thi task 
can be accomplish with standard dft approaches. 
dft optim molecular structur be in gener re- 
liable, even if the correspond energi be affect 
by larg uncontrol errors. the latter problem can 
then be solv by a quantum comput that implement 
a multi-configur (cas-ci) wave function model 
to access truli larg activ orbit spaces. the or- 
bital for thi model do not necessarili need to be op- 
timiz a natur orbit can be take from an unre- 
strict hartree-fock [41] or small-ca casscf calcu- 
lation. clearly, the miss dynam correl need 
to be implemented. thi can be do in a ’perturb- 
then-digonalize’ fashion befor the quantum computa- 
tion start or in a ’diagonalize-then-perturb’ fashion, 
where the quantum comput be use to produc the 
higher-ord reduc densiti matrix required. the for- 
mer approach, i.e., built-in dynam electron correlation, 
be consider more advantag a no wave-function- 
deriv quantiti need to be calculated. one option for 
thi approach is, for example, to consid dynam cor- 
relat through dft that avoid ani doubl count 
effect by virtu of rang separ a have alreadi be 
success studi for casscf and dmrg [42, 43]. 
fig. 2 present a flowchart that describ the step of a 
quantum-comput assist chemic mechan explo- 
ration. moreover, the quantum comput result can be 
use for the valid and improv of parametr 
approach such a dft in order to improv on the latter 
for the massiv pre-screen of structur and energies. 

ii. quantum simul OF quantum 
chemic system 

from among a number of differ approach to de- 
termin energi of ground state on a quantum com- 
puter [13, 44], we focu on quantum phase estim 
(qpe). If we take the time evolut of an eigenst to 
be e−iht|n〉 = e−ient|n〉 then the task of qpe be to learn 
the phase φ = ent in a manner analog to a mach– 
zehnder interferometer. If qpe be appli to a trial state 
that be a superposit of eigenvectors, it collaps the 
state to one of the eigenst and will collaps it to the 
ground state with high probabl if the trial state have a 
larg overlap with the ground state. see appendix F for 
a discuss of state prepar approach in quantum 
simulation. 

In practice, e−iht must be decompos in qpe 
into elementari operations. there be sever meth- 
od know for achiev thi [45–47]; here we fo- 
cu on the trotter–suzuki (ts) decomposit and 
specif the second-ord TS formula, which for the 
second-quant coulomb hamiltonian take the form 

e−iht = 
(∏m 

j=1 e 
−ihjt/2r 

∏1 
j=m e 

−ihjt/2r 
)r 

+ o(t3/r2). 

In the limit r → ∞ thi approxim becom ex- 
act. well-known method exist for implement each 
e−ihjt/2r aris in a second-quant formul us- 
ing a sequenc of elementari gate and single-qubit ro- 
tation [11]. these rotat domin the cost of the 
quantum simulation. 

circuit synthesi and quantum error correct 

while exist estim of the cost of quantum sim- 
ulat have take these rotat to be intrins quan- 
tum operations, do so beli the cost of perform 
the comput fault tolerantly. To achiev reliabl re- 
sults, fault toler implement of the algorithm be 
crucial. fault toler be achiev by encod a sin- 
gle logic qubit in a number of physic qubit with a 
quantum error-correct code, such a the surfac code 
[48]. thi redund protect the logic qubit against 
decoher and other experiment imperfections. 

quantum error correct cannot directli protect ani 
arbitrari quantum operation, such a arbitrari rotations. 
fortunately, however, it can protect a discret set of 
gates, from which ani continu quantum oper can 
be approxim to within arbitrarili small error [49]. 

approxim take two steps. first the exponen- 
tial in the trotter formula be decompos into single- 
qubit rotat and so-cal clifford gates. In the sur- 
face code, which we consid here, clifford gate can be 
implement fault tolerantly. the single-qubit rotations, 
however, requir approxim by a discret set of gate 
consist of clifford oper and at least one non- 
clifford operation, usual take to be the T gate, a ro- 
tation by π/8 about the z-axis. each T gate requir a 
procedur call magic state distillation, which consum 
a host of noisi quantum state to output a singl accu- 
rate magic state. the magic state be then use to tele- 
port a T gate into the comput [50]. the space and 
time overhead of state distil render it by far the 
most costli aspect of quantum error correction, lead 
to a larg multipl overhead for each single-qubit 
rotation. the number of T gate therefor typic dom- 
inat the cost when implement a fault toler algo- 
rithm. 

iii. resourc estim 

We now show that the resourc requir to elucid 
reaction mechan on quantum comput not onli 
scale polynomially, but also that the calcul be fea- 
sibl on a rel small quantum comput in reason- 
abl time. these resourc estim be base on extrap- 
olat from the cost found from simul of small 
molecul (for loos upper bound see appendix C) and 
focu on two protoyp structur of femoco that be

and the number of logic qubit need for the simul

structur 2 be for spin state S = 1/2 and charg 0 with 65 
electron in 57 spatial orbit (see support materi for 
further details). these runtim and gate count be like to 
exceed the actual requirements. 

typic of the complex of those that natur would 
aris when probe the potenti energi landscap of the 
complex to find the reaction rates. our work differ from 
previou studi in that we not onli look at an import 
target for simul but we also examin it within a ba- 
si set that be reason match for the target accuraci 
requir (see appendix j). 

We first estim the runtim of the comput as- 
sum a quantum comput can perform a logic T gate 
everi 10 ns, clifford circuit requir neglig time and 
that a good trial state for the ground state be available. 
We then determin the cost of perform thi simula- 
tion fault tolerantli use the surfac code, such that 
each physic gate take 10 ns. 

for chemic significance, we aim to comput the en- 
ergi with a total error of at most 0.1 mhartree, add 
up all sourc of systemat and statist error (see ap- 
pendix e). these error includ the error in phase esti- 
mation, the error in the trotter–suzuki deocomposit 
and error from decompos the trotter–suzuki approx- 
imat into H and T gates. We then optim over these 
three cost to find the most effici way to divid the 
error budget up over these three sources. We also con- 
sider a larg error of 1 mhartre that would still put 

our approach into the accuraci rang of standard state- 
of-the-art quantum chemic method for simpl (mono- 
nuclear) transit metal complexes. 

three concret implement of the quantum algo- 
rithm be consid here. In the first approach, call 
serial, the single-qubit rotat be constrain to occur 
serially. In a second approach, call nesting, hamilto- 
nian term that affect disjoint set of spin orbit be exe- 
cut in parallel, which substanti reduc the runtim 
of the calculations. In the third approach, programm 
ancilla rotat (par), rotat be cach in qubits, 
which be then teleport into the circuit a need [12]. 
for each approach, the overal cost be found by decom- 
pose the rotat into clifford and T gate use [51] 
for the serial case and [52] in the other two cases. 

the cost at a logic level, show in tabl I for sim- 
ulat of two differ structur of femoco in differ 
charg and spin state (see appendix J for details) be 
within reach of a small scale quantum computer. If all 
gate be execut in seri then we estim that the 
simul will complet in under a year and use a small 
number of logic qubits. par can reduc the time re- 
quir to sever day at the price of requir nearli 
20 time a mani logic qubits. nest give a reason- 
abl tradeoff between the two and may be the prefer 
approach. finally, if we focu on learn qualit 
accur reaction rate then the cost drop by roughli a 
factor of 10 in all examples. further detail can be found 
in the appendix. 

resourc requir with quantum error 
correct 

We next add the overhead requir to perform the 
simul fault tolerantli and summar the cost in- 
cur by perform the simul of structur 1 use 
the surfac code in tabl vi. the underli resourc 
calcul follow [48]. these cost natur depend on 
the physic error rate assum in the hardware, and we 
consid three case that correspond to (a) a near-term 
error rate of 10−3, (b) an error rate of 10−6 that might 
one day be feasibl in superconduct qubits, but be ex- 
pect earli on for topolog quantum bit [53] and (c) 
an error rate of 10−9 that may be achiev for topolog- 
ical quantum computers. 

rather than focu sole on the number of physic 
qubit we consid a fine-grain modular architectur 
for a quantum computer, sketch in fig. 3, consist 
of a classic supercomput interfac with a quantum 
comput that consist of a main quantum processor and 
dedic separ T factori and rotat factori to 
produc T gate and to synthes rotations, respectively. 
onli the main quantum processor be a gener purpos 
device, while the other factori be special purpos hard- 
ware that be expect to be easi to construct. 

We first observ in tabl VI that the number of logic 
qubit in the main quantum processor be onli of the order

fig. 3. We show the architectur of a hybrid classi- 
cal/quantum comput for quantum chemistri type calcula- 
tions. the quantum comput act a an acceler to the

of a hundred, which translat into ten of thousand 

to million of physic qubit – which be challeng but 
not out of reach for earli devices. most of the qubit 
be use in the T factories, which each need even few 
physic qubit than the main quantum processor. even 
the number of T factori need to perform the serial 
calcul be reasonable, with onli 202 such factori 
requir in thi case for an error rate of 10−3, and few 
for good qubits. after factor in the number of qubit 
need per T factory, we arriv at the conclus that onli 
105 to 106 physic qubit be need for the 10−6 and 
10−9 error rates. 

If we consid the parallel with the par approach 
then these cost becom much more daunting. the num- 
ber of T factori requir increas by a factor of roughli 
1000 although the number of qubit requir in each 
factori remain comparable. thi explos be due to 
the fact that par perform about one thousand time a 
mani rotat a the serial code. the cost requir by 
the nest approach, on the other hand, be much more 
modest and lead to onli an order of magnitud increas 
in the number of qubit with a compar reduct in 
runtimes. 

At low error rates, the total number of qubit requir 
in both the serial and nest case be of the order of a 
million, which could even be envis a a singl quan- 
tum processor. the case of 10−3 error or the par ap- 
proach requir hundr of million to nearli a trillion 
physic qubits, which seem more daunting. however, 
consid a modular design where each factori requir 
about one million physic qubit thi be nevertheless cer-

iv. discuss 

while at present a quantit understand of chem- 
ical process involv complex open-shel speci such 
a femoco in biolog nitrogen fixat remain beyond 
the capabl of classical-comput simulations, our work 
show that quantum comput use a acceler to 
classic comput could be use to elucid thi mech- 
anism use a manag amount of memori and time. 
In thi context a quantum comput would be use to 
obtain, validate, or correct the energi of intermedi 
and transit state and thu give accur activ 
energi for variou transitions. 

We note that the requir quantum comput re- 
sourc be compar to that need for shor’ fac- 
tore algorithm for interest 4096 bit numbers; both 
in term of number of gate and also physic qubit [48]. 
the complex of these simul be thu typic of 
that requir for other target for quantum computing. 

We also observ that the resourc requir depend 

sensit on gate error rates. therefor robust qubits, 
such a topolog protect qubit [53], may be in- 
valuabl for use a quantum comput to elucid re- 
action mechan for import chemic process such 
a the mode of action of nitrogenase. 

chemic reaction that involv strongli correl 
speci that be hard to describ by tradit multi- 
configur approach be not just limit to nitro- 
gen fixation: they be ubiquitous. they rang from 
small molecul activ catalyst for c-h bond break- 
ing, to those for hydrogen and oxygen production, carbon 
dioxid fixat and transform to industri use 
compounds, and to photochem processes. given the 
econom and societ impact of chemic process rang- 
ing from fertil product to polymer catalysi 
and clean energi processes, the import of a versatile, 
reliable, and fast quantum chemic approach power by 
quantum comput can hardli be overemphasized. par- 
allelis the quantum comput of the energi land- 
scape will be crucial to provid answer within a time-

appendix A: introduct to quantum comput 

here we provid a brief review of quantum comput 
for those that be not expert in quantum computing. 
the aim of thi review be to introduc the basic con- 
cept and notat that be use in quantum comput 
a well a introduc quantum algorithm for simul 
chemistri and also quantum error correction. for a more 
detail exposit see [49]. these concept will be use 
in section B 1 where we discu quantum process such 
a phase estimation. 

1. qubit and quantum gate 

In quantum computation, quantum inform be 
store in a quantum bit, or qubit. wherea a classic 
bit have a state valu s ∈ {0, 1}, a qubit state |ψ〉 be a 
linear superposit of states: 

|ψ〉 = α|0〉+ β|1〉 = [ αβ ] , (a1) 

where the {0, 1} basi state vector be repres in 

dirac notat (call ket vectors) a |0〉 = 
[ 
1 0 

]T 
, and 

|1〉 = 
[ 
0 1 

]T 
, respectively. the amplitud α and β be 

complex number that satisfi the normal condi- 
tion: |α|2 + |β|2 = 1. upon measur of the quantum 
state |ψ〉, either state |0〉 or |1〉 be observ with proba- 
biliti |α|2 or |β|2, respectively. 

dirac notat be use larg becaus it contain an 
implicit tensor product structur that make express 
qubit state much easier. for example, that the four- 
qubit state |0000〉 be equival to write the tensor 
product of the four states: |0〉 ⊗ |0〉 ⊗ |0〉 ⊗ |0〉 = |0〉⊗4 = 
[ 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ]

. 

A gener n-qubit quantum state life in a 2n- 
dimension hilbert space and be repres by a 2n×1- 
dimension state vector whose entri repres the am- 
plitud of the basi states. A superposit over 2n 

state be give by: 

|ψ〉 = 
2n−1∑ 
i=0 

αi|i〉, such that 
∑ 
i 

|αi|2 = 1, (a2)

where αi be complex amplitud and i be the binari rep- 
resent of integ i. the abil to repres a su- 
perposit over exponenti mani state with onli a 
linear number of qubit be one of the essenti ingredi 
of a quantum algorithm — an innat massiv parallelism. 

In a quantum computation, unitari transform 
be use to transform quantum state into other quan- 
tum states. In particular, the quantum state |ψ1〉 of the 
system at time t1 be relat to the quantum state |ψ2〉 at 
time t2 by a unitari |ψ2〉 = U |ψ1〉. 

In gener we cannot expect that a quantum comput 
can implement everi unitari transform on n qubit 
exactli becaus there be an infinit number of such 
transformations. instead, gate model quantum comput- 
er use a discret set of quantum gate (which can be 
repres a 2n × 2n unitari matrices) to approxim 
these continu transformations. ani such set of gate 
be know a univers if ani unitari transform can 
be expressed, within arbitrarili small error, a a sequenc 
of such gates. 

the gate set that we consid in thi work includ the 
follow gates: 

• the X gate which be the classic not gate that 
map |0〉 → |1〉 and |1〉 → |0〉. 

• the hadamard gate H map |0〉 → 1√ 
2 

(|0〉+ |1〉) and 
|1〉 → 1√ 

2 
(|0〉 − |1〉). 

• the Z gate map |1〉 → −|1〉 and T be the fourth– 
root of Z, and can be use interconvert Z and X 
gate via hzh = X. 

• the Y gate map |1〉 → −i|0〉 and |0〉 → i|1〉. 

• the ident gate be repres by 11. 

• the two-qubit controlled-not gate, cnot, map 
|x, y〉 → |x, x⊕ y〉. the correspond unitari ma- 
trice are: 

H = [ 1 11 -1 ] , X = [ 
0 1 
1 0 ] , Y = 

[ 
0 i 
−i 0 

] 
, Z = [ 1 00 -1 ] , 

T = 
[ 

1 0 
0 eiπ/4 

] 
, 11 = [ 1 00 1 ] , cnot = 

[ 
1 0 0 0 
0 1 0 0 
0 0 0 1 
0 0 1 0 

] 
. 

measur be an except to thi rule; it collaps 
the quantum state to the observ value, therebi eras- 
ing ani inform about the amplitud α and β. thi 
mean that extract inform from a quantum sys- 
tem irrevers damag a state. consequently, although 
the exponenti parallel that quantum comput nat- 
ural poss be mitig by the fact that most quantum 
comput will have to be repeat mani time to ex- 
tract the necessari inform about the output of the 
quantum algorithm. 

2. quantum circuit synthesi 

In order to understand how the cost estim of our 
algorithm be found it be import to understand how 
arbitrari unitari can be convert into discret gate 
sequences. for our purposes, we consid the clifford + 
T gate librari discuss above, but compil into other 
gate set be also possibl [54, 55]. the simplest case to 
consid be that of singl qubit unitari synthesi where 
U ∈ c2×2. In such cases, an euler angl decomposit 
exist such that, up to an irrelev overal phase, 

U = eiαzheiβzheiγz . (a3) 

thu the problem of implement a singl qubit trans- 
format reduc to the problem of perform the ro- 
tation eiθz = cos(θ)11 + i sin(θ)z. the gener case of 
U ∈ c2n×2n similarli reduc to instanc of singl qubit 
synthesi interspers with entangl gate such a cnot. 
thu implement singl qubit rotat can be see a 
an atom oper on which compil process for U 
be based. 

there be a host of method know for decompos 
rotat into clifford and T gates. perhap the earli- 
est such algorithm be the solovay–kitaev algorithm [56], 
which provid an effici method for perform thi 
decomposit base on lie–algebra techniques. In re- 
cent years, much more effici method for decomposi- 
tion have be discov that be base on number the- 
ory. these method requir near–quart few opera- 
tion than the solovay–kitaev algorithm would need [56] 
and be useful, if not necessary, for reduc the gate 
count of the simul algorithm to a palat level. 

In the absenc of ancillae, the cost requir to approx- 
imat an axial rotat within error � for the bad pos- 
sibl input angle, c(�), be know to lie within the inter- 
val [52] 

4 log2(1/�)− 9 ≤ c(�) ≤ 4 log2(1/�) + 11. (a4) 

subsequ work [57] have provid a method that have an 
averag case complex roughli 3/4 of thi bad case 
bound and also have make the compil process effi- 
cient [58]. 

more recent method have introduc the use of ancil- 
lae to reduc the cost of synthesi [51]. these method 
can substanti reduc the number of T gate requir 
to perform the synthesis. thi approach can reduc the 
scale of the averag number of T gate need to im- 
plement an axial rotat 

c(�) ≈ 1.15 log2(1/�) + 9.2. (a5) 

thi approach requir one addit ancilla qubit. 
asymptot good method exist, such a repeat- 

until-success (rus) synthesi with fallback [51], but these 
method do not outperform thi method give the rang 
of � that we requir for the simul to reach chemic 
accuracy. further method such a par rotat [12] or 



9 

gearbox circuit [59] can be use to substanti reduc 
the t–depth of the simul circuit at the price of re- 
quir great parallel width. while we do not consid 
the impact of gearbox synthesi here, we will examin the 
cost and benefit of par rotations. 

An import issu aris when use such method for 
parallel execution. If sever rotat be implement 
simultan on differ qubit and ru synthesi be 
use then the domin contribut to the cost be give 
by the long sequenc of gate use in each block of 
parallel rotations. In particular, while ru synthe- 
si reduc the expect valu by a factor of roughli 
4 from the bad case bounds, it be clear that when per- 
form mani of them in parallel it be veri like that 
at least one of them will satur the bound. for thi 
reason we use upper bound on determinist synthesi 
give by (a4), which have a good bad case scaling. 

3. simul quantum chemistri 

our approach to quantum chemistri simul 
close follow the strategi propos in ref. [9]. We be- 
gin by repres the quantum chemistri hamiltonian 
in a second quantiz form, keep track of the locat 
of the electron by use the occup of a discret ba- 
si of spin-orbitals. sinc a spin orbit can onli contain 
one electron, such state be veri natur to express in a 
quantum computer. each spin orbit be assign a qubit 
where the state |1〉 correspond to an occupi orbit 
and |0〉 an unoccupi orbital. 

these state be often describ use creation and an- 
nihil oper which obey a†|0〉 = |1〉, a†|1〉 = 0, 
a|1〉 = |0〉 and a|0〉 = 0. sinc these oper correspond 
to creat electrons, they must respect the symmetri 
appropri for fermions. the most import prop- 

erti be the anti–commut properti {a†i , aj} = δi,j . 
thi mean that while it may be tempt to identifi 
a† = (X − iy)/2, such a represent do not satisfi 
the anti–commut relat for fermion operators. 
instead, these creation and annihil oper can be 
convert into pauli oper use the jordan–wign 
or bravyi–kitaev [60] transformations. 

In order to simul the dynam of the system we 
need to emul the unitari dynam that the system 
undergo use a sequenc of gate operations. thi dy- 
namic be of the form e−iht where 

H = 
∑ 
pq 

hpqa 
† 
paq + 

1 

2 

∑ 
pqr 

hpqrsa 
† 
pa 
† 
qaras, (a6) 

onc these fermion creation and annihil oper 
be translat into pauli oper using, for example, 
the jordan–wign transform then the hamiltonian 
can be translat into a sequenc of oper that in- 
dividu could be perform on a quantum computer. 
well know circuit exist for perform the exponenti 
yield by the trotter–suzuki formula [11, 14, 49]. 

the most direct method for estim the ground- 
state energi be phase estim (see section B 1 for more 
detail). phase estim us quantum interfer be- 
tween control execut of 11, e−iht1 , e−iht2 , . . ., to 
infer the eigenvalu of e−iht. If t be small than π/‖h‖ 
thi also directli yield the eigenvalu of H. apart from 
the abil to directli sampl from the eigenvalues, a fur- 
ther advantag to phase estim be that it requir 
o(1/�) applic of e−ihdt to learn it eigenphas 
within error � with high probability. thi be quadrati- 
calli good than bound on the varianc that would be 
see from optim classic sampl method use an 
unbias estimator. 

It be necessari to appli phase estim on an ini- 
tial state that have larg overlap with the ground state 
in order to find the ground-stat energi with high prob- 
ability,. specifically, if appli to an initi state |ψ〉 = 
ag|eg〉+ 

√ 
1− |ag|2 

∣∣e⊥g〉 then PE return an estim of 
ground-stat energi EG with probabl |ag|2. the sim- 
plest state to use be the hartree–fock state, which onli 
requir appli a sequenc of not gate to the state 
|0〉n, howev configur interact with suffici 
high excit may be requir to achiev high overlap 
for system that have strong correl in their ground 
states. We do not consid the cost of prepar such a 
state here, sinc such a cost of prepar a suffici 
accur approxim to the ground state of femoco 
be difficult to determin in absentia of larg scale quan- 
tum computers. We discu thi issu in more detail in 
section F. 

4. quantum error correct 

quantum hardwar be far less robust to error a clas- 
sical hardware. quantum error correct provid a way 
to reduc the error in the devic without sacrific the 
quantum natur of the system. quantum error correct 
code requir that the physic error rates, say of qubits, 
quantum gates, and measurements, be less than a give 
threshold value. thi threshold valu depend on the er- 
ror correct code be use and the type of nois of 
the system. If error rate be below the threshold, then 
error in the computation, refer to a the logic gate 
and logic qubits, can be make arbitrarili small at onli 
a polylogarithm overhead. 

the surfac code be current the most popular code 
due in part to it rel high threshold of 1% [61]. 
much of thi enthusiasm have arisen becaus of evid 
that exist superconduct quantum comput may 
alreadi have error rate near thi threshold [62]. thi 
rais the hope that a fault-tolerant, scalabl quantum 
comput may be just over the horizon. 

while quantum error correct promis the abil 
to perform arbitrarili long quantum comput on a 
noisi device, the resourc requir to execut such a 
fault-toler comput can be larg if the system op- 
erat close to the threshold. the major of the cost 



10 

of quantum error correct aris from the need to per- 
form a univers set of quantum gates. while protect 
so-cal clifford gate requir veri littl overhead in 
the surfac code, in comparison protect a non-clifford 
gate, such a a T or toffoli gate, requir substanti 
resources. while sever techniqu for produc fault- 
toler non-clifford gate exist [63–66], here we focu on 
the use of magic state distil in conjunct with the 
surfac code [61]. magic state distil [50] take a in- 
put a set of noisi resourc state and output a cleaner 
resourc state. for the surfac code, we must distll the 
T state a it cannot be implement directli in the code. 
here we consid the 15− 1 distil scheme of bravyi 
and kitaev [50], where 15 noisi input state with error 
rate p produc a singl magic resourc state with error 
rate roughli 35p3. 

magic state distil consist onli of clifford opera- 
tions, which can be implement easili within the surfac 
code. 

appendix B: implement phase estim 

In thi section, we discu how to implement the phase 
estim protocol in quantum computers. thi be im- 
portant to our subsequ estim of the complex 
of simul nitrogenase’ femoco becaus phase esti- 
mation constitut the outer most loop of the quantum 
simul and henc be a major driver of the cost of the 
simulation. 

1. phase estim 

phase estim be one of the most critic compon 
of the quantum simul algorithm. without phase es- 
timation, the amount of simul time need to esti- 
mate the ground-stat energi would grow quadrat 
a �−2 with the precis � required. sinc � be on the 
order of 0.1mhartree, the phase must be estim for 
one time step of the evolut oper within an error 
0.1/r mhartre where r be the number of trotter step 
required. If statist sampling, rather than phase es- 
timation, be use to estim the phase then on the 
order of 1012 experi would be need to make the 
varianc in the estim suffici small. thi would be 
impract and so phase estim be crucial for most 
larg scale applic in quantum chemistry. 

the standard quantum phase estim algorithm [49] 
allow eigenvalu to be learn within error � with prob- 
abil at least 1/2 us a number of applic of the 
unitari circuit, m(�), that be bound abov by 

m(�) ≤ 16π 
� 
. (b1) 

thi valu be far from optim time scale of π/�, but 
have the advantag of requir neither measur of 
the quantum system nor a classic comput to infer the 

|0〉 H rz(mθ) H 

|ψ〉 UM 

fig. 4. thi circuit be use in iter phase estim al- 
gorithm wherein the eigenvalu be infer from measure- 
ment statistics. 

most like eigenvalue. We will also use thi result below 
becaus it provid an upper bound on the cost of the 
optim phase estim algorithm. 

An altern approach be to use iter phase es- 
timation. iter phase estim forgo store the 
phase in a quantum regist and instead us a classic 
infer algorithm to learn the eigenphas from mea- 
surement of an auxillari probe qubit that be iter 
measur and re-entangl with the system. kitaev pro- 
pose the first variant of iter phase estimation. the 
circuit use in thi process be give in fig 4. 

the ultim limit that can be achieved, in term of 
the number of time the unitari be appli a a function 
of desir error tolerance, be give by [67–69] 

m(�) ≈ π 
� 
. (b2) 

furthermore, gaussian strategi such a rfpe [70] 
yield bayesian cramer–rao bound that come close to 
satur this: 3.3/�. As these bound be often satu- 
rat for likelihood function of thi form [71] and be- 
caus the gaussian assumpt caus the user to throw 
away substanti inform from high moment in the 
posterior distribution, we expect that (b2) repres the 
ultim limit for phase estim and that base on 
previou studi the use of optim polici [72–74] will 
enabl perform that come close to satur thi 
limit. As a result we use m(�) ≈ π/(2�) a a surrog for 
the expect perform of these optim approaches, 
where the factor of 2 differ follow from an import 
optim that hold for the case of quantum simula- 
tion algorithm that we discu in detail in the follow 
section. 

2. control rotat 

while the previou discuss onli show how to per- 
form a z–rotation, we need to perform control Z– 
rotat to perform the phase estim algorithm. 
fortunately, there be well know method that can be 
use to perform such control rotat use a pair of 
rotat and two cnot gates. A good approach, pre- 
viousli show in unpublish work by tsuyoshi ito in 
2012, be give in figur 5 and the valid of the circuit 
be proven in the follow lemma.

fig. 5. low depth circuit for control z–rotat where 
the θ gate repres eiθz . 

lemma 1. the circuit of fig. 5 implement the con- 
troll oper λ(rz(2θ)) where the top most qubit be 
the control. 

proof. assum that |c〉 = |0〉 or |1〉 then the cnot gate 
perform 

|c〉|ψ〉 7→ (xc ⊗ 11)(a|00〉+ b|11〉). (b3) 

the rotat gate then prepar the state 

(aei(1−(−1) 
c)θ/2|c〉|0〉+ be−i(1−(−1) 

c)θ/2|c⊕ 1〉|1〉). (b4) 

final the cnot gate yield the state 

|c〉(aei(1−(−1) 
c)θ/2|0〉+ be−i(1−(−1) 

c)θ/2|1〉) 
= (λ(rz(2θ))|c〉|ψ〉) . (b5) 

therefor the circuit function properli for either |c〉 = 
|0〉 or |c〉 = |1〉. By linear it be also valid for ani 
input. 

thi form of a control rotat be well suit for 
mani quantum simul applic becaus it allow 
the control evolut to be replac with evolut 
that control onli on the singl qubit rotat in the cir- 
cuit for implement the individu term in the hamil- 
tonian. however, it be not optim here becaus we can 
implement a variant of a control rotat gate to in 
effect doubl the impact that the eigenphas have on the 
measur probabilities.

rotat and sampl from a bernoulli distribut such 
that the probabl of the protocol output 0 be 

P (0|φ; θ,m) = 1 + cos(2m [φ+ θ]) 
2 

. 

proof. our proof be construct and follow directli from 
the argument present inform in [75]. the idea 
behind the protocol be to replac everi control ro- 
tation use in the circuit in fig. 4 with the circuit in 
fig. 6. formal we denot thi by replac the con- 
troll oper λ(um ) with WM , which be defin such 
that W |0〉|ψ〉 = |0〉u |ψ〉 and W |1〉|ψ〉 = |1〉u†|ψ〉. sinc

a 

W =

where the controlled–not oper λ(x) us the control 
qubit a it control and the qubit that Rz act on a it 
target. thi circuit be show in fig. 6.

(b7) 
up to a global phase. the probabl of measur the 
ancilla qubit to be zero be (1 + cos(2m(φ − θ)))/2 a 
claimed. 

lemma 2 show that the number of rotat need 
to perform phase estim be 1/4 the valu that would 
be expect if circuit such a that of fig. 5 be use 
(or 1/2 the cost in parallel settings). As an example, for 
the case of rfpe numer experi show that we 
can learn the eigenphas within error � with probabl 
1/2 use 

m(�) ≈ 2.3

. (b8) 

In comparison, the ultim low limit give by previou 
studi becom π/(2�) and the bayesian cramer–rao 
bound give a low limit of approxim 1.6/� under 
the assumpt of gaussian prior make in rfpe [70]. 
similarli the upper bound on the cost of tradit 
qpe in [49] becom 8π/� rather than 16π/� if these cir- 
cuit be used. 

while the assumpt that the underli trotter– 
suzuki formula can be invert by simpli invert the 
sign of the evolut time. specifically, thi assumpt 
appli for the (2k + 1)th order trotter-suzuki formula 
for all k ≥ 1 but it do not appli to the second order 
formula unless further assumpt be made. We can 
see thi from the fact that N∏

If we assum that we be interest onli in the ground- 
state energi and the hamiltonian be real valu (like in 
the quantum chemistri applic that we consider) 
then the error in assum that U† can be form by 
simpli flip the sign be o(t3) [16], which be by no 
mean fatal but it could potenti contribut to the er- 
ror in trotter–suzuki decompositions. wherea if the 
third (or higher) order trotter–suzuki formula be use 
then no such danger exists. this, along with the supe- 
rior bound proven for the error in the third order for- 
mula, provid the justif for use thi formula in 
prefer to the asymptot equival second–ord 
formula.

appendix C: trotter error 

here we discu the issu of how error from the use 
trotter suzuki formula lead to systemat error in the 
ground-stat energi estim output by phase estima- 
tion. We further discu the methodolog that we use 
to upper bound these error and also give empir esti- 
mate of the scale of such errors. 

1. rigor bound 

A major sourc of error in most quantum simul 
algorithm aris from the use of trotter formula expan- 
sions. such error can be make arbitrarili small but the 
need to make such error small then chemic accuraci 
mean that the cost of do so can substanti impact 
the time requir to perform the simulation. In thi ap- 
pendix we will provid a detail discuss about how 
to bound the error in low–ord trotter formulas. 

trotter error aris from the fact that the term in 
the hamiltonian use in the expans do not commute. 
In principle, the zassenhau formula provid everyth 
that be need in order to understand the scale of these 
errors: 

e(a+b)t = eatebt 
1 
2 [a,b]t 

2 

+o(t3), (c1) 

and thu 

‖e(a+b)t − eatebt‖ ∈ o(‖[a,b]‖t2). (c2) 

although thi express be use in estim the 
scale of simul errors, the question that we’r in- 
terest in be somewhat orthogon to this. instead, we 
be interest in the error in estim eigenvalues. the 
baker–campbell–hausdorff formula, which be the dual to 
the zassenhau formula, can be use to estim these 

errors. If H = 
∑L 
α=1hα where the Hα correspond to 

term in (a6) then the second order trotter–suzuki for- 
mula (also know a the straang splitting) give

(c4) 
thi show that, to lead order, the error in the strang 
split can be estim by the ground–stat expecta- 
tion valu of a doubl commut sum. furthermore, 
sinc L ∈ o(n4) it be clear from thi form that the error 
in the trotter formula must scale at most a o(n10t2). 
It be not o(n12t2) becaus the commut structur re- 
strict two of the orbit Hα and Hβ act on. although 
thi estim can be comput in polynomi time, there 
be too mani term for thi to be reliabl estim for 
molecul on the scale of nitrogenas even use mont 
carlo method [19]. 

An upper bound on the asymptot scale can be triv- 
ialli found by appli the triangl inequ to (c4). 
thi approach be not appropri for our purpos be- 
caus we do not know apriori how larg t must be for the 
lead order term to be dominant. As a result, we use 
the follow result, which be provabl an upper bound 
on the error in the energi of the evolution: 

∆ets/t

∑ 
α,β,α′ 

‖hα‖‖hβ‖‖hα′‖ 

× (δα>βδα′>β + δβ>αδα′,α)w (α, β, α′), 
(c5) 

where W (α, β, α′) be an indic function that take the 
valu 1 if and onli if the correspond doubl commu- 
tator be non–zero. note that thi be slightli tighter than 
the bound use in (16) of [17]. 

there be sever criterion that we know a priori lead to 
a doubl commut vanishing: 

1. hα′ and Hβ act on disjoint set of qubits. 

2. Hα act on a disjoint set of qubit from the set of 
qubit that hα′ and Hβ act on. 

3. hα′ and Hβ correspond to PP or pqqp terms. 

4. hα′ and Hβ correspond to PR and pqqr term 
with the same P and R. 

5. onli one of [hα, [hβ , hα′ ]], [hβ , [hα′ , hα]] and 
[hα′ , [hα, Hβ ]] be non–zero accord to the prior 
rule (jacobi identity). 

there be other symmetri to the term that can be 
use to argu that even more term be necessarili zero. 
sinc we do not consid these properties, we overcount 
the contribut of ani such term and so our estim 
remain an upper bound. 

thi bound be much more comput than the origin 
expression, but be comput challeng to com- 
pute exactli owe to the o(n10) term in the doubl 
commut sum. the cauchy–schwarz inequ can 
be use to convert thi express into one that can be 



13 

comput in o(n4) operations, but do so can over- 
repres the influenc of larg term in the hamilto- 
nian [17]. 

2. empir estim of trotter error 

given that comput of the matrix element of the 
error oper in (c4) be comput challenging, 
we reli on mont carlo sampl to estim the up- 
per bound in (c5). mont carlo sampl be much more 
effect here becaus the use of the triangl inequal- 
iti remov the altern sign that we see when sum- 
ming the origin series. We achiev thi by draw M 
sampl uniformli at random for {αj : j = 1 . . .m}, 
{βj : j = 1 . . .m} and {βj : j = 1 . . .m}. We then reject 
the sampl if (δα>βδα′>β + δβ>αδα′,α)w (α, β, α 

′) = 0, 
and otherwis comput the product of the product of 
the norm of the three correspond hamiltonian terms. 
If there be L term in the hamiltonian and defin 

γ(α, β, α′) :=4‖hα‖‖hβ‖‖hα′‖ 
× (δα>βδα′>β + δβ>αδα′,α)w (α, β, α′)

. 

(c10) 
In practice, uniform sampl be not necessarili the 

best option becaus the import of the differ term 
can vari wildli within a class. for example, the one-bodi 
term tend to be much larg than the two-bodi term 
but the two-bodi term be far more numerous. thi 
mean that uniform sampl can underestim the con- 
tribut of such term becaus of their rel scarciti 
in the sampl space. 

We combat thi by sampl from each type of dou- 
ble commutator. In particular, we sampl over a class 

of doubl commut such a [pq, [pp,pq]] and uni- 
formli draw pq, PP and PQ term to estim those 
term contribut to the overal error. the total error be 
then the sum of the estim over all such classes. We 
use a minimum of 108 sampl per class, which render 
the sampl standard deviat in our estim of the 
error less than 1%. 

the result bound can be see in fig. 7 wherein we 
examin the predict trotter number and the empiri- 
calli observ trotter number for small molecules. the 
rough scale of the upper bound on the trotter number 
that we see correspond to n2.5 which be note in previ- 
ou numer studi [17], but owe to the scatter of the 
data due to the wide vari chemic properti of the 
molecules, thi scale should not be see a definitive. 
We observ that the upper bound seem to be roughli 
a factor of 10 000 time too loos for small molecules. 
for thi reason we plot three reason extrapol 
of the scale base on the numer result for small 
molecules. the most pessimist bound rescal the scal- 
ing extract from the upper bound such that all the data 
remain beneath the curve. the middl one rescal the 
upper bound data by the averag discrep between 
the upper bound and the numer comput exam- 
ples. the most optimist curv be simpli a polynomi 
fit to the numer data that ignor the upper bound. 
We expect the middl curv to be the most realist es- 
timates, but provid resourc estim for these three 
case below a well a result that follow from use the 
upper bound. 

appendix D: error propag 

here we provid proof of some basic result that we 
will use to propag these error through the quantum 
simulation. these result be crucial for the cost esti- 
mate in the subsequ section becaus they show how 
larg the bad case error can be in the eigenvalu es- 
timat give error of these magnitudes. It be worth 
note that we expect these result to yield substanti 
overestim of the error becaus they do not consid 
the natur cancel that be like to occur in prac- 
tical eigenvalu estim problems. 

lemma 3. let A and B be hermitian oper act 
on finit dimension hilbert space such that ‖a−b‖2 ≤ 
� and a|ψa〉 = ea|ψa〉 and b|ψb〉 = EB |ψb〉 where EA 
and EB be the small eigenvalu of either oper 
then |ea − EB | ≤ �. 

proof. becaus A and B be hermitian they satisfi the 
variat properti mean that 

EB ≤ 〈ψa|b|ψa〉. (d1) 

sinc ‖A − b‖2 ≤ � it follow that there exist C such 
that ‖c‖2 ≤ 1 and A = B + �c. thi impli that 

EB ≤ 〈ψa|a+ �c|ψa〉 = EA + �〈ψa|c|ψa〉. (d2)

thu 

EB − EA ≤ �〈ψa|c|ψa〉. (d3) 

If EA ≤ EB then we have from the definit of ‖ · ‖2 
that 

|eb − ea| ≤ �|〈ψa|c|ψa〉| ≤ �. (d4) 

now assum that EB > ea. We then have 

EA ≤ 〈ψb |a|ψb〉. (d5) 

then by repeat the same argument we conclud that 
|eb − ea| ≤ � regardless of the sign of EA − EB . 

now we will go beyond thi bound to show that the 
error scale in the eigenvalu of the unitari evolut 
gener by two similar hamiltonian be no more patho- 
logic than the scale of error in the ground-stat en- 
ergies. 

lemma 4. assum that for hermitian bound opera- 
tor A and B act on a finit dimension hilbert space 
‖e−iat − e−ibt‖2 ≤ tγ(t) for γ(t) a non–decreas con- 
tinuou function of t on [0,∞) then ‖a−b‖2 ≤ γ(t). 

proof. use standard bound [49], we have that ‖e−iat− 
e−ibt‖2 ≤ ‖a−b‖2t and furthermor from taylor’ the- 
orem ‖e−iat − e−ibt‖2 = ‖a− b‖2t + o([‖a− b‖2t]2). 

therefor the former upper bound be tight in the limit 
a t → 0. By assumpt ‖e−iat − e−ibt‖2 ≤ tγ(t) for 
all t in a compact subinterv contain 0. assum that 
limt→0 γ(t)/‖a − b‖2 < 1. thi impli that there ex- 
ist a compact interv contain 0 such that for all t in 
thi interv ‖e−iat − e−ibt‖2 > ‖a− b‖2t, which lead 
to a contradict becaus we have alreadi demonstr 
that ‖a−b‖2t be a tight bound on the error in thi limit. 
therefor γ(t) ≥ limt→0 γ(t) ≥ ‖A − b‖2 under the as- 
sumption of the lemma.

then use our assumpt and standard inequ for 
the error in unitari oper [49] thi error be at most 

[∆ets(t) + (2m − 1)δ]t. (d7) 

then appli lemma 4 we have that ‖H − h̃(t)‖2 ≤ 
∆ets(t) + (2m − 1)δ. the result then follow from ap- 
pli lemma 3. 

these error bound appli for gener quantum simu- 
lation base on the second order trotter formula (also 

know a the strang splitting), howev they appli in 
particular to the case of simul quantum chemistry. 
We have alreadi discuss the trotter–suzuki error for 
quantum chemistri in (c5). even in the absenc of de- 
coherence, a sourc of error inevit come into our 
analysi from approxim the singl qubit rotations. 
now we need to show a result that bound the impact of 
such eigenvalu estimation. 

lemma 5. for hermitian H and t ≥ 0 let u(t) be a 
famili of unitari oper such that ‖e−iht−u(t)‖2 ≤ 
�t for all t ≥ 0, then for everi t there exist a hermitian 
oper h̃(t) such that U = e−ih̃t and ‖h−h̃(t)‖2 ≤ �. 

proof. By take the princip matrix logarithm of u(t) 

it be clear that there exist h̃(t) such that U = e−ih̃(t)t. 
furthermore, use standard inequ it be easi to see 

that ‖e−iht − e−ih̃(t)t‖2 ≤ ‖H − h̃(t)‖2t. becaus thi 
bound be tight in the limit a t → 0, if � < ‖H − h̃(t)‖2 
then a contradict be reach for t suffici small. 
therefor sinc we requir that the inequ hold for 
all t ≥ 0, ‖H − h̃(t)‖2 ≤ �. 

It be easi to see from the fact that there be a one to one 
map between the hamiltonian term and the rota- 
tion perform in the circuit. thu if the error in each 
such rotat be δt then the error in each term of the 
effect hamiltonian be at most δ. thi mean that the 
total shift in energi from circuit synthesi be at most mδ.

such that ‖uj(t) − e−ihjt/2‖2 ≤ ∆synth for all t. the 
error in the ground-stat energi that result from such a 
simul be at most ∆et + (2m − 1)∆synth/t. 

proof. the result then follow directli from theorem 1 
and lemma 5. 

thi show that it suffic to choos synthesi error 
that shrink linearli with the timestep use in the trot- 
ter decomposition. sinc the cost of circuit synthesi of 
rotat in the the clifford + T gate librari scale log- 
arithm with ∆synth/t [52]. 

appendix E: cost estim for nitrogenas 

fundamentally, two factor contribut to the cost of 
the quantum simul (assum that the user can pre- 
pare an exact copi of the ground state at neglig cost). 
the first be the cost of implement the trotter decom- 
posit of the hamiltonian and the second be the number 
of time that the trotter circuit must be repeat in the 
phase estim algorithm. 

one might object that the number of time step re- 
quir in the trotter–suzuki decomposit also be a driv- 
ing factor in the cost. Of cours the trotter decomposi- 
tion be a major driver of the cost, but it come in onli in- 
directli through the cost of phase estimation. thi be be- 
cause, in principle, the phase estim algorithm learn 
the eigenphas of a singl trotter step. the trotter er- 
ror can be make arbitrarili small by choos shorter 
evolut times, but thi in turn requir the phase es- 
timat algorithm to take more steps. As the cost of 
phase estim scale invers with the desir uncer- 
tainty, thi caus the cost to scale invers with the time 
step use in the trotter–suzuki decomposition. thu the 
cost of the simul can be thought of a aris from 
onli two sources, the cost of each depend on the error 
toler allow for all three contribut to the error. 

If we then defin �1 to be the error in phase estimation, 
�2 := ∆et to be the error in the trotter–suzuki expan- 
sion and �3 := (2m−1)∆synth/t to be the error in circuit 
synthesi then it follow from the triangl inequ and 
corollari 1 that the error in the ground-stat energi be 
at most 0.1 mhartre if 

�1 + �2 + �3 ≤ � := 10−4ha. (e1) 

In thi section we will focu on the target of 0.1 mha 
level of accuracy, which be appropri for quantit 
calcul of the reaction rates. 

We estim the cost of the circuit use the number 
of T gate requir in the algorithm, which be a function 

of the form

(e2) 
and then optim over �1, �2 and �3 to minim C sub- 
ject to the constraint in (e1). here α be the scale con- 
stant for the phase estim algorithm used, β be the 
trotter number (or multipl factor by which t be 
decreas from 1 ha−1) need to achiev an error of 
0.1 mhartre in the ground-stat energi estim and γ 
and δ be the constant use in the quantum circuit syn- 
thesi algorithm. here M = 6.1× 106 for nitrogenas in 
the 54 orbit basi and M = 8.2× 106 for nitrogenas in 
the 57 orbit basi use the circuit of [9]. 

the true optimum of (e2) be difficult to find becaus 

of the factor of 
√

plifi our optim we instead choos �1, �2 and �3 to

subject to the same constraint. the global optimum 
of (e3) can be found directli from calculus, which al- 
low near optim paramet for (e2) to be found easily. 
the valu of (e2) at these paramet be then an upper 
bound on the minimum of (e2) and so the estim pro- 
vide remain upper bound (modulo assumpt about 
the trotter error). 

the “worst” case assumpt in tabl IV correspond 
to onli use rigor proven upper bound on the cost. 
these lead to estim that be clearli extrem pes- 
simistic. even give our optimist assumpt about 
the target computer, the bad case bound suggest be- 
tween million and ten of thousand of year depend 
on whether parallel be used. 

the “pessimistic” assumpt use empir scale 
for circuit synthesi and phase estim and use the 
bad scale support from our bound on the trotter 
error, but rescal by the ratio observ between the ac- 
tual trotter number requir and the theoret pre- 
dict ones. 

the “rescaled” case take the rigor upper bound 
for nitrogenas and divid it by the averag ratio ob- 
serv between the exact trotter number and their up- 
per bound for the tractabl molecul molecules. rescal- 
ing the upper bound by a constant and appli least 
squar fit to find the most consist constant yield 
similar results. We suspect these rescal estim may 
provid the most realist estim of the trotter number 
requir to simul nitrogenase. 

the “optimistic” assumpt again use the same em- 
piric scale for PE and synthesis, but instead extrap- 
olat the averag scale observ for the ensembl of 
molecul whose trotter number we can comput and 
scale up the result so that all of the data lie beneath

1. variance-bas estim 

such error aris from three sources: the systemat 
error in the TS decomposit �ts, the statist er- 
ror toler for phase estim �qpe, and the sta- 
tistic error in synthes rotat from clifford and 
T gate �rot. We then requir the total error to be

the previou analysi for the estim in the error 
can be use within thi express for the error under 
the assumpt that the error in qpe and synthesi 
be not adversarial. thi approach be take with the

to minim the cost give in (e2), howev a differ 
constraint link the three error be used. thi lead to 
modest reduct in the cost rel to the bad case 
bounds, which we provid in tabl IV and V. 

2. par circuit 

there be sever approach that can be take to par- 
allel rotations. the first, often coin nesting, be dis- 
cuss in [16, 76]. It involv take term that commut 
with each other in the hamiltonian and group them 
togeth so that they can be execut simultaneously. In 
principle, thi can lead to substanti reduct in the 
depth but in practic it be difficult to ass the perfor- 
manc of these scheme here becaus of the size of the 
molecul and the fact that we have chosen to restrict our- 
self to lexicograph ordering. thi mean that if we 
be to estim the impact that parallel can bring 
to these calcul we need to introduc a method that 
can reduc the t–depth without chang the order 
of term in the trotter–suzuki decomposition. 

the par method give a way to achiev thi goal [12]. 
It work by teleport a rotat into a state with prob- 
abil 1/2 use onli clifford oper and a pre– 



18 

rotat ancilla. In the event that thi method fail then 
instead of perform rz(θ) it perform rz(−θ). thi 
can be correct by teleport a rotat rz(2θ) into 
the qubit in question. should thi fail (and it will half the 
time) the rotat can be correct by teleport a rota- 
tion of rz(4θ) and so on. thi creat a geometr distri- 
bution of the number of pre–cach qubit need to per- 
form a give rotation. these rotat angl be know 
befor hand and so can be prepar offlin in parallel. 
henc a logarithm multipl overhead in space be 
need to guarante that enough ancilla qubit be pre- 
par to perform the rotat with such high probabl 
that it be unlik that the cach of ancilla will ever be 
depleted. 

In order to bound the number of ancilla need in 
order to parallel a factor of M rotat with high 
probabl consid the follow protocol. 

• divid the term in the trotter expans of the 
hamiltonian into block consist of M sequenti 
terms. 

• for each rotat angl θj in a give bloeck 
and each j = 0, . . . , n − 1, prepar the state 
rz(2 

jθj)|+〉 in parallel for a predetermin valu 
of n. 

• implement each of the M (possibl sequenti oper- 
ations) use programm ancilla rotat use 
at most n attempts, if the par circuit fail in each 
attempt then a failur be say to have occurred. 

• If a failur occur then implement the correct rota- 
tion and proceed to the next precach rotation. 

thi protocol can be use to perform the desir rotat 
and it perform be summar below. 

theorem 2. there exist a protocol for implement- 
ing par rotat that cach M rotat of the form 
rz(θj), rz(2θj), . . . , rz(2 

n−1θj) for j = 1, . . . ,M such 
that the expect number of rotat perform befor a 
failur occur be 

2n(1− (1− 2−n)m ). 

proof. the proof be constructive. To see thi consid the 
protocol discuss above. such a protocol fail when all n 
par circuit fail for ani of the M rotat cached, and 
a failur occur when all n attempt at the rotat that 
have be precomput be expended. the probabl 
of such a failur be clearli 2−n becaus the par circuit’ 
success probabl be independ and each attempt 
have success probabl 1/2 [12]. 

from the geometr distribution, the probabl that 
no failur occur in M trial be then simpli (1− 2−n)m . 
similarly, the probabl that a failur occur after pre- 
cise k attempt be 2−n(1−2−n)k−1. sinc there be onli 
M rotat in the cach ani branch that have more than 

M success can onli yield M rotations. thi impli 
that the mean be 

M∑ 
k=1 

k2−n(1−2−n)k+m(1−2−n)m = 2n(1−(1−2−n)m ). 

(e4) 

A consequ of theorem 2 be that a par cach of M 
rotat that further cach the correct oper for 
n failur can reduc the t–depth by a factor of 2n(1 − 
(1 − 2−n)m ). We can therefor adjust these paramet 
to substanti reduc the t–depth without add a 
prohibit number of rotations. 

note that a n→∞ (e4) approach M a expected. 
thi suggest that take larg n allow the par rota- 
tion to be paralel more efficiently, but thi come at 
the price of requir more T gate and henc increas 
the overhead of quantum error correction. 

a. factori approach 

A major challeng with par face cost it in a fault 
toler set be that all the non–clifford oper 
can be prepar simultan and offline. thi mean 
that if we take the cost model where onli T gate be 
consid then we come to the absurd conclus that 
the cost of all quantum simul algorithm can be 
reduc to that of synthes a singl rotation. In order 
to prevent such absurd tradeoff we assum here that a 
delay of time equal to 1 T gate be includ to model the 
measur and feed-forward step that be need for the 
programm ancilla rotation. thi fix cost mean 
that even if all of the t–gate be precach befor hand 
then the time requir for the remaind of the simul 
will never be zero. 

the abov assumpt lead to an altern approach 
to implement par rotations, which we follow in the 
par cost in the follow a well a the main body. 
rather than construct a larg cach of rotat of- 
fline, it make sens to produc the rotat just in time. 
specif if the cost of synthes a rotat be C T 
gate then it make sens to have nC factori constantli 
produc rotat state of the form rz(2 

jθj)|+〉 for 
j = 1, . . . , n. each of these nC factori be stagger 
such that one set of factori finish with their n state 
at least 1 cycl befor the next rotat be needed. As 
soon a a set of factori finish it then proce on to 
the next set of rotat need (exclud those that be 
current be generated). If a failur occurs, then the 
factori approach halt just like the tradit approach 
and wait for a rotat to be synthes that appli 
the correct rotat online. 

imagin for the moment that the par circuit succeed 
in C consecut attempts. sinc each attempt requir 
time equival to a singl invoc of a T gate and the 
cost of synthesi be C T gates, the first set of factori 



19 

will have finish produc their state befor the last 
set appli theirs. thi mean that with C such factori 
rotat state can be continu gener even in the 
“worst case scenario” where each par circuit succeed on 
the first attempt. thi be whi in thi set it do not 
make sens to use more than nC rotat factori give 
the assumpt that the cost of each par attempt be 1 T 
gate and that the rotat for at most n failur be to 
be pre-cached. 

theorem 3. the averag time requir per rotat 
to appli the factory–bas par strategy, assum each 
par applic requir time at most equal to 1 T gate 
and all remain clifford oper be free is( 

2− n+ 2 
2n 

) 
+ 
C + n 

2n 
. 

proof. the probabl of success in ani par attempt be 
1/2 therefor the expect number of T gate that need 
to be appli befor a solut be found be 

n∑ 
j=1 

j 

2n 
+ 
C + n 

2n 
. (e5) 

the latter term give the expect impact of a failure, 
which occur with probabl 1/2n, make n par at- 
tempt and incur a cost of C T gate in appli the 
fallback rotation. the result then follow from sum 
the geometr series. 

We use the abov theorem to comput the expect 
time requir by par under our assumpt of the cost 
of feed forwarding. If such cost be neglect then the 
onlin cost of perform a par rotat be simpli c/2n 

T gates. 

b. nest estim 

finally, we would like to reiter that in both the se- 
rial and par cases, the cost be found by build the 
circuit correspond to the TS formula and count the 
gate that compos it. the estim for nest give 
in the main bodi be upper bound base on empir 
estim of the number of term that can be simultane- 
ousli executed. We estim thi by take femoco and 
greedili group term that act on distinct set of spin 
orbitals. We specif find that there exist a group 
that can simultan execut 26.43 term simultane- 
ousli for strucur 1 and 27.83 for structur 2. these 
valu roughli correspond to the optim scale of n/4 
that can be achiev through thi nest strategy. We 
then assum the quantum comput can simultan 
execut each of these commut group and find the cor- 
respond time by divid the T count by these factors. 

rather than execut the group in liqui|〉 we use 
a simpl upper bound on the number of clifford gate 
that could aris from the grouping. We do thi becaus 

the group strategi break the lexicograph order 
that lead to dramat cancel of the cnot string 
that aris from the jordan–wign decomposition. 

for the nest data, the number of timestep need 
be assum to be the same a for the other cases, which be 
reason give that oper order tend to not have 
a dramat impact on the error. subsequ work will 
investig the precis interplay that oper order 
have in nesting. 

appendix F: state prepar 

We discu in thi section the issu of state prepara- 
tion, which be a major unansw question that impact 
the cost of quantum simulations. while we do not dis- 
cuss these cost in detail in the rest of the paper, we 
discu below the issu that aris when use elemen- 
tari state prepar method base on coupl cluster, 
configur interact or hartree–fock state a well 
a adiabat state preparation. We also provid numer- 
ical result show that the ground state overlap with 
hartree–fock state scale for small molecul and dis- 
cuss the cost involv in adiabat state preparation. 

1. elementari state prepar method 

although we cannot rigor prove that elementari 
state prepar method such a hartree–fock states, 
unitari coupl cluster or truncat configur inter- 
action state (such a cisd or differ dedic CI 
(ddci) [77] states) will suffic for prepar a state with 
larg overlap with the ground state, it be still import 
to ask how good simpl ansatz perform for numer 
tractabl cases. We provid some numer evid for 
small molecul show that the overlap of the true 
ground state with the hartree–fock ground state be not 
necessarili small. We leav similar studi of the overlap 
for unitari coupl cluster and truncat configur 
interact ansatz for subsequ work. 

We see in figur 8 that there be substanti overlap be- 
tween the hartree–fock state and the true ground state 
of the molecul calcul use liqui|〉 . In particu- 
lar, the small overlap that we see be 89%. other stud- 
y that have look at chain of hydrogen atom that 
be near disassoci show veri small overlap with the 
hartree–fock states. thu there be small molecul that 
can be construct that be not well describ by such 
ansatzes. 

We find weak evid for a downward trend in the 
overlap with the hartree–fock state a the size of the sys- 
tem grows. specifically, we see that roughli 50% of the 
data point be well approxim by 107.75%×e−0.0076n 
where n be the number of spin orbitals. thi scale would 
suggest that the overlap with the hartree–fock state for 
a molecul typic of thi ensembl of the scale of femoco 
may be roughli 43%, we cannot say whether nitrogenas

pect strong correl to be present for molecul that 
contain atom with d–electron than those examin in 
figur 8. such molecul be frequent outsid of our 
abil to simul classic so find an appropri 
ensembl of molecul to use for such benchmark re- 
main an open research problem; however, the success of 
method such a CI dynam extend activ space 
(ci-deas) [78, 79] in dmrg suggest that elementari 
truncat configur interact state may also suf- 
fice for quantum simul [80]. 

We further see no compel evid for scale with 
the maximum nuclear charg of the constitu atom 
for the molecul in thi set. thi can clearli be see 
from beh2 which have substanti good fidel with 
the ground state than Be does. similarly, HF and hcl 
have nearli ident overlap despit the fact that Cl 
have nearli twice the nuclear charg of F. more studi 
be need in order to understand how these overlap 
scale for larg molecules, howev it be strongli suspect 
that multi–refer state will be requir to accur 
model highli correl ground states. 

2. adiabat state prepar 

adiabat state prepar [81] provid an alterna- 
tive approach state prepar wherein the hamiltonian 
to be simul be replac with a time–depend hamil- 
tonian whose final ground state coincid with the target 
ground state and whose initi ground state be an easili 

prepar state. An exampl of such a hamiltonian be 

h(s) =

, 

(f1) 

where s ∈ [0, 1] be a dimensionless time that be 0 at the be- 
gin of the evolut and 1 at the end. It be then easi 
to see that the ground state of h(0) be the hartree–fock 
state and the ground state of h(1) be the full configura- 
tion interact (fci) ground state. 

for such hamiltonian (or more gener for those 
that be differenti at least three time and whose re- 
sult deriv be o(1) [82]) a suffici slow evolu- 
tion under the hamiltonian will caus the hartree–fock 
state to be transform into the fci ground state of H. 
In other word if T be the time–ord oper which 
be defin such that 

∂st (e−i 
∫ s 
0 
h(s′)ds′t ) := −ih(s)t (e−i 

∫ s 
0 
h(s′)ds′t ) (f2) 

and if we defin P to be a projector onto the fci ground 
state and ∆(s) to be the small eigenvalu gap between 
the ground state and the rest of the spectrum of h(s) 
then 

|(11− p)t (e−i 
∫ 1 
0 
h(s′)ds′t )|ψhf〉| ∈ O 

( 
max ‖ḣ(s)‖ 
min ∆2(s)t 

) 
. 

(f3) 
here we take T � 1 and treat the other paramet 
to bound abov by a constant in thi asymptot ex- 
pansion. for such hamiltonian the triangl inequ 
clearli show that ‖ḣ(s)‖ ∈ o(n4) (although on phys- 
ical ground we expect ‖ ˙h(s)‖ to be in o(η2) ∈ o(n2) 
becaus the potenti energi scale quadrat with 
the number of constitu particles). thu if we want to 
have o(1) probabl of prepar the fci ground state 
it suffic to simul the time–depend hamiltonian 
h(s) for time 

T ∈ O 
( 

N4 

min ∆2(s) 

) 
. (f4) 

prima facie, the best know bound on the cost of 
trotter–suzuki base simul give the circuit size for 
such a simul to be [83, 84] 

noper ∈ 

( 
N4 
[ 

hn8 

min ∆2(s) 

]1+o(1)) 
, (f5) 

where h ≥ max{|hpq|, |hpqrs|}. If we take h ∈ o(1), thi 
rigor bound suggest that the cost of adiabat state 
prepar may be prohibit expens even if the 
eigenvalu gap be constant, it be import to note that 
thi upper bound on the norm of the deriv of H be 



21 

expect to be extrem loos and the scale of the 
error in the trotter–suzuki formula be expect to be 
much good than the scale quot above. 

If we take the depth of second-ord trotter–suzuki 
formula simul of real molecul to scale a o(n5.5), 
a observ in previou studi [17], and take the norm of 
the hamiltonian to scale a o(n2) a anticip asymp- 
totic for a local basi [85] then the scale that aris 
from use the second–ord trotter formula for time– 
depend hamiltonian [83] would be 

O 

( 
h3/2n8.5 

min ∆3(s) 

) 
. (f6) 

If h ∈ o(n−2) then thi scale reduc to 
n5.5/min ∆ 

3(s), which be expect if the two bodi 
term domin the cost of the trotter–suzuki decom- 
position. thi mean that even after make empir 
assumptions, highli gap adiabat path be like to 
be necessari for adiabat state prepar to be useful. 

It be worth mention that adiabat state prepar 
have be investig for other system and in these set- 
ting it have be found to be a highli practic method of 
state prepar [20, 75]. although it should be note 
that the path use from the initi hamiltonian to the 
final hamiltonian be often non-trivial. these observa- 
tion suggest that the abov complex analysi may be 
quit loose. further work be need to good estim the 
cost of adiabat state prepar for realist molecul 
and also the cost of learn optim adiabat path from 
easili prepar hamiltonian to the fci hamiltonian. 

appendix G: cost estim for topolog qubit 

In thi section we will examin the impact topolog- 
ical quantum comput may have on these numbers. 
thi be import becaus the fault toler overhead 
quot in the main bodi depend sensit on the error 
rate. topolog quantum comput promis to pro- 
vide physic error rate that be order of magnitud be- 
yond what be achiev in altern platforms; howev 
there be a catch. much of the current research underway 
focu on topolog quantum comput use ise 
anyons, which provid topolog protect for clifford 
oper but do not provid protect for T gates. thi 
mean that even if we achiev veri low error rate use 
thi technolog then the cost of magic state distil 
may not be reduc dramat despit the qualiti of 
the clifford gate that topolog quantum comput 
affords. We examin thi by model the error in gen- 
erat the T state to be 10−4 and then consid the 
cost of use the surfac code to distil the necessari 
gates. We provid the data for thi scenario in tabl vi. 

the data in tabl VI show that even in thi set 
assum low qualiti magic state do not remov the 
benefit of topolog protect for the clifford opera- 
tions. In particular, if we look at the save in physic 
qubit that occur from go from error rate 10−6 to 10−9 

we see in the data in the main bodi that roughli an or- 
der of magnitud separ the two number of physic 
qubits. In contrast, if we assum the low qualiti magic 
state give abov then the reduct be more modest: 
they be roughli a factor of 5. thi show that while 
have high fidel magic state be ideal, even if such 
state be low qualiti then a topolog quantum com- 
puter with protect clifford oper can nonetheless 
see advantag from have topolog protect gate 
at the level of accuraci requir to simul nitrogenase. 

appendix H: femoco — the activ site of 
nitrogenas 

In thi section we provid more background on the im- 
portanc of biolog dinitrogen fixat and on the ac- 
tive site model of nitrogenas prepar in differ charg 
and spin state appli in the feasibl analysi of thi 
work. 

for decades, a holi grail in chemistri have be 
the catalyt fixat of molecular nitrogen under am- 
bient conditions. less than half a dozen synthet cata- 
lyst have be develop for thi purpos [25–27] (after 
decad of fruitless efforts). all of them suffer from low 
turnov number and the synthet dinitrogen-fix 
problem under ambient condit can thu be consid 
larg unsolved. the process be of tremend impor- 
tanc for societi a fertil be produc from ammo- 
nia, the final product of dinitrogen fixation. industrially, 

ammonia be produc in the veri effici haber–bosch 
process, which, however, requir high temperatur and 
pressur (and consum up to 2% of the annual energi 
production) [86]. 

while it current appear unrealist that thi sim- 
ple heterogen process will be replac by a sophisti- 
cat synthet homogen catalyst, which be like to 
be less stabl and expens to produce, a mono- or poly- 
nuclear iron-bas catalyst work under ambient condi- 
tion and feed on an easili access sourc for ’hydro- 
gen’ (and dinitrogen from air) could becom import 
for local small-scal fertilizer-product concepts. 

In ani case, nitrogen fixat repres a tremend 
chemic challeng to activ and break the strong tripl 
bond in dinitrogen at room temperatur and pressure. 
natur found an effici way to achiev thi goal. It 
be accomplish by the enzym nitrogenas whose activ 
site, the iron–molybdenum cofactor femoco, consist of

seven iron atom and one molybdenum atom, which be 
clamp togeth by bridg sulfur atom [87]. the 
complet structur of the femoco be solv onli veri 
recent when a central main-group atom be discov- 
ere [88] that, surprisingly, turn out to be a carbon 
atom [23, 24, 89]. the complex electron structur of 
thi cluster of open-shel iron atoms, the possibl charge, 
spin, and proton state a well a the differ lig- 
and bind site to be consid make thi activ site 
a nightmar for electron structur calculations, which 
be the basi of all theoret approach toward the elu- 
cidat of the mode of action of metalloenzym such a 
nitrogenase. 

It be thu no surpris that the specif mechan of 
dinitrogen reduct at thi activ site have be elusive, 
especi give the fact that the mechan of nitro- 
genas be difficult to studi experimentally. computa- 
tional approach suffer from the static electron corre- 
lation problem. for two ammonia molecul to be pro- 
duced, the transfer of six proton and six electron be re- 
quir per dinitrogen molecul (in fact, eight proton and 
eight electron be need a one dihydrogen molecul 
be produc stoichiometrically). the transfer of these 
highli reactiv agent lead to mani stabl intermedi 
and side product (see, for example, the analog dis- 
cussion of these step in ref. [28] for the first synthet 
dinitrogen-fix complex by yandulov and schrock). 
To elucid the mechan of nitrogenase, which be im- 
portant for a good understand of the activ of 
inert bond by synthet catalysts, therefor requir the 
consider of a veri larg number of molecular struc- 

tures. 
while molecular structur of stabl intermedi and 

transit state may be optim within unrestrict 
kohn–sham dft, the calcul of their energi de- 
mand an accur wave-function-bas approach. We 
therefor optim molecular structur of a femoco 
model in the rest structur (fig. 1 (right) in the 
main article) for vari charg and spin state in or- 
der to creat differ electron situat that challeng 
the feasibl analysi present in thi work. for these 
structures, integr in a molecular orbit basi have 
be obtain that parametr the electron structur 
of the cluster in the second-quant quantum-chem 
hamiltonian of eq. (a6). 

appendix I: exact diagon techniqu in 
chemistri 

the electron structur of a molecular structur de- 
termin it reactivity. predict chemic reaction re- 
quir the solut of the electron schröding equa- 
tion to obtain the electron energi and wave function. 
wherea the expans of the many-electron wave func- 
tion into a (quasi-) complet many-electron basi will 
produc the exact solution, call full configur inter- 
action in chemistri or exact diagon in physics, 
thi approach be unfeas for molecul of more than a 
few atoms. As all standard quantum-chem solut 
approach construct many-electron basi function from 
orbitals, the number of the former be determin by the 



23 

number of the latter. exact diagon be therefor 
limit to about 18 electron distribut among 18 spa- 
tial orbit due to the exponenti scale of the many- 
electron basi state with the number of orbit [39]. 
unfortunately, the size of an orbit basi be alreadi veri 
larg for moder size molecules. As a consequence, 
a restrict orbit space must be chosen. 

Of all approxim develop in quantum chem- 
istri to overcom thi problem [36] the complete-active- 
space self-consistent-field (casscf) approach (and re- 
late models) util exact diagonalization, but, becaus 
of the exponenti scaling, in a reduc orbit space, the 
so-cal cas, that select orbit around the fermi en- 
ergy. To compens for thi approximation, the orbit 
be relax self consistently, henc the name. still, the 
ca be limit by the 18-orbit wall and by the neglect 
of most of the (virtual) orbit for the construct of 
the wave function. consid the fact that molecul of 
a hundr atom or more quickli requir much more than 
a thousand one-electron basi function for an accur 
descript of their electron structure, most of the or- 
bital construct from these basi function be omit 
in the construct of a casscf wave function. even 
iter techniqu such a the densiti matrix renormal- 
izat group (dmrg), which can be understood a a 
polynomi scale casscf approach, can push thi 
wall onli to about a hundr spatial orbitals. 

As a result, a casscf-typ wave function solv onli 
the so-cal static electron correl problem. It be 
therefor particularli well suit for molecular structur 
with near-degener orbitals. the result electron 
structur be onli qualit well described. however, 
thi featur be maintain throughout a reaction coordi- 
nate, which make a casscf-typ approach an appeal- 
ing univers approach. for a quantit description, 

the mani virtual orbit not consid for the ca 
make a nonneglig contribut to electronic-energi 
differences. To account for thi so-cal dynam cor- 
relat be mandatori and typic achiev by a sub- 
sequent multi-refer perturb theori calculation. 
such perturb theori to second order requir el- 
ement of the three- and four-electron reduc densiti 
matrices, which be difficult to calcul and to store. 

instead of thi ’diagonalize, then perturb’ approach, 
also ’perturb, then diagonalize’ idea have be studi 
in chemistry. these latter approach produc a ’dressed’ 
many-electron hamiltonian which be then good condi- 
tion for a casscf-typ approach. A new develop- 
ment in thi area be the combin of densiti function 
theori (dft), know to describ dynam electron cor- 
relat well with a casscf-typ approach by spatial 
rang separ introduc by savin (see refs. [42, 43] 
and refer cite therein). rang separ be ac- 
complish for the electron–electron interact matrix 
element and allow one to appli dft at short range, 
wherea at long rang the full flexibl of a casscf- 
type wave function can be exploited. thi approach be 
veri effici and do not compromis the effici of 
a casscf-typ approach (bi contrast to perturb 
theory). In combin with the polynomi scale 
dmrg, thi approach have deliv veri promis re- 
sult [43] for benchmark reaction involv transit 
metal [4]. 

As a consequence, a chemic sensibl exact diag- 
onal techniqu be a casscf-typ approach that 
captur dynam correl effect in the one-electron 
states. such an approach could be directli implement 
on a quantum comput with the specif exact diagonal- 
izat technolog develop for such a machine. 

what chemic problem will benefit from such an im- 
plementation? clearly, these will be problem that be 
domin by strong static electron correl (rather 
than by weak dispers interact origin from dy- 
namic electron correlation). the electron schröding 
equat assign an energi to a give molecular struc- 
ture in the born–oppenheim approximation, and thi 
electron energi (evalu at zero kelvin without vi- 
brational, temperature, and entropi corrections) should 
domin the energi chang of a chemic process. 
transition-met catalysi be a field that present such 
situations. 

mani import chemic transform be medi- 
ate by complic electron structur featur by 
transition-met complexes. especi late 3d transit 
metal be of thi kind, most importantli iron, which be 
cheap and ubiquitous, often yield nontox compounds, 
and therefor repres an ideal catalyt center. more- 
over, stabl intermedi and, in particular, transit 

state of a reaction mechan often repres typic 
static electron correl problem a bond be form 
and broken on the way to stabl products. To reliabl 
predict a chemic transform of thi kind usual 
requir to studi mani more than one elementari reac- 
tion step — especi when reactiv intermedi be 
involved. the number of stabl intermedi also in- 
creas due to unwant side reaction that need to be in- 
spected. therefore, the total number of molecular struc- 
ture whose electron energi be requir for an under- 
stand of a reaction mechan is, in general, veri 
large. 

clearly, all these structur must be optim with 
an effici quantum chemic method. while the ac- 
curaci of electron energi obtain with present-day 
dft approach be often not satisfactori for predict 
purpos (see, e.g., refs. [4, 90]), molecular structur 
can be reproduc with remark accuraci (obviously, 
a geometri gradient would replac dft structures, too).

hence, casscf-typ method will mostli be requir 
for the valid of electron energi of dft-optim 
molecular structures, which be the essenti piec of infor- 
mation for establish a reaction mechanism. 

appendix J: comput methodolog 

We optim the structur of a femoco resting-st 
model that take those residu of the protein backbon 
into account which anchor the metal cluster in the en- 
zyme (see fig. 1 (right) in the main article). note that 
differ spin and charg state be consid for the 
structur optim in order to obtain a varieti of elec- 
tronic structur for the assess of a solut algo- 
rithm on a quantum computer. these spin and charg 
state do not necessarili match the one of the rest 
state of nitrogenase. 

structur 1 for three posit excess charg and an 
equal number of α- and β-spins, and structur 2 for an 
uncharg femoco model with one unpair α-spin. 

the cartesian coordin of these structur be col- 
lect in tabl viii and ix. In these unrestrict dft 
calculations, the spin symmetri be broken [91] and onli 
Sz remain a a good quantum number. for these struc- 
ture optim we chose the turbomol program 
packag (v6.4) [92] and employ the b3lyp densiti 

function [93–96] with the def2-tzvp ahlrich triple- 
zeta basi set plu polar function on all atom 
[97]. An effect core potenti be chosen onli for 
the molybdenum atom [98], which also take care of all 
scalar-relativist effect on thi heavi atom. 

then, integr in the molecular orbit (mo) basi 
be produc MO integr for structur 1 be gen- 
erat for a ca of 54 electron in 54 spatial casscf 
orbit (108 spin orbitals), which be obtain from a 
singlet casscf calcul with 24 electron in 16 or- 
bitals. accordingly, for structur 2 we gener MO 
integr for a ca of 65 electron in 57 spatial casscf 
orbit (114 spin orbitals) from a quartet casscf cal- 
culat with 21 electron in 12 orbitals. 

the choic of the larg activ space be base on 
pulay’ uno-ca criterion [37, 99], in which the oc- 
cupat number of the natur orbit serf a a 
select criterion. however, rather than unrestrict 
hartree–fock natur orbitals, we select those small- 
ca casscf natur orbit in the occup inter- 
val [1.98,0.02] and [1.99,0.01], respectively. the molec- 
ular orbit integr for the second-quant electron 
hamiltonian in these small-ca orbit base be cal- 
culat with the molca program [39].
