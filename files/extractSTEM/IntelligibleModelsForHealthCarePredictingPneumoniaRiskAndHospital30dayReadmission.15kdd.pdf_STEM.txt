abstract 
In machin learn often a tradeoff must be make between 
accuraci and intelligibility. more accur model such a 
boost trees, random forests, and neural net usual be 
not intelligible, but more intellig model such a logist 
regression, naive-bayes, and singl decis tree often have 
significantli bad accuracy. thi tradeoff sometim limit 
the accuraci of model that can be appli in mission-crit 
applic such a healthcar where be abl to under- 
stand, validate, edit, and trust a learn model be important. 
We present two case studi where high-perform gener- 
aliz addit model with pairwis interact (ga2ms) 
be appli to real healthcar problem yield intellig 
model with state-of-the-art accuracy. In the pneumonia 
risk predict case study, the intellig model uncov 
surpris pattern in the data that previous have pre- 
vent complex learn model from be field in thi 
domain, but becaus it be intellig and modular allow 
these pattern to be recogn and removed. In the 30- 
day hospit readmiss case study, we show that the same 
method scale to larg dataset contain hundr of thou- 
sand of patient and thousand of attribut while remain- 
ing intellig and provid accuraci compar to the 
best (unintelligible) machin learn methods.

the applic of machin learn to import problem in 
healthcar such a predict pneumonia risk. In the study, 
the goal be to predict the probabl of death (pod) for 
patient with pneumonia so that high-risk patient could be 
admit to the hospit while low-risk patient be treat 
a outpatients. In the studi [3, 2], the most accur mod- 
el that could be train be multitask neural nets.1 On 
one dataset the neural net outperform tradit meth- 
od such a logist regress by wide margin (the neural 
net have auc=0.86 compar to 0.77 for logist regression), 
and on the other dataset use in thi paper outperform 
logist regress by about 0.02 (see tabl 2). although 
the neural net be the most accur models, after care 
consider they be consid too riski for use on real 
patient and logist resgress be use instead. why? 

one of the method be evalu be rule-bas learn- 
ing [1]. although model base on rule be not a accur 
a the neural net models, they be intelligible, i.e., inter- 
pretabl by humans. On one of the pneumonia datasets, 
the rule-bas system learn the rule “hasasthama(x) ⇒ 
lowerrisk(x)”, i.e., that patient with pneumonia who have 
a histori of asthma have low risk of die from pneumo- 
nia than the gener population. needless to say, thi rule 
be counterintuitive. but it reflect a true pattern in the 
train data: patient with a histori of asthma who pre- 
sent with pneumonia usual be admit not onli to 
the hospit but directli to the icu (intens care unit). 
the good news be that the aggress care receiv by asth- 
matic pneumonia patient be so effect that it lower 
their risk of die from pneumonia compar to the gener 
population. the bad news be that becaus the prognosi for 
these patient be good than average, model train on the 
data incorrectli learn that asthma lower risk, when in fact 
asthmat have much high risk (if not hospitalized). 

one of the goal of the studi be to perform a clinic trial 
to determin if machin learn could be use to predict 
risk prior to hospit so that a more inform decis 
about hospit could to be made. the ultim goal 
be to reduc healthcar cost by reduc hospit admis- 
sions, while maintain (or even improving) outcom by 
more accur identifi patient that need hospitaliza- 
tion. As the most accur models, neural net be a strong 
candid for clinic trial. deploy neural net model that 
could not be understood, however, be deem too riski — 

1svm and boost tree be not in common use yet, and 
random forest have not yet be invented.

if the rule-bas system have learn that asthma lower risk, 
certainli the neural net have learn it, too. the rule-bas 
system be intellig and modular, make it easi to recog- 
nize and remov danger rule like the asthma rule. while 
there be method for repair the neural net so they do 
not incorrectli predict that asthmat be at low risk and 
thu less like to need hospitalization, e.g., re-train without 
asthmat in the population, remov the asthma feature, 
modifi the target for asthmat to “1” in the data to re- 
flect the care they receiv (unfortun confound care 
with death), the decis be make to not use the neural net 
not becaus the asthma problem could not be solved, but be- 
caus the lack of intellig make it difficult to know what 
other problem might also need fixing. becaus the neural 
net be more accur than the rules, it be possibl that 
the neural net have learn other pattern that could put 
some kind of patient at risk if use in a clinic trial. for 
example, perhap pregnant woman with pneumonia also re- 
ceiv aggress treatment that lower their risk compar 
to the gener population. the neural net might learn that 
pregnanc lower risk, and thu recommend not admit 
pregnant women, thu put them at increas risk. In an 
effort to “do no harm”, the decis be make to go forward 
onli with model that be intellig such a logist regres- 
sion, even if they have low auc than other unintellig 
models. the logist regress model also learn that hav- 
ing asthma lower risk, but thi could easili be correct 
by chang the weight on the asthma featur from neg 
to posit (or to zero). 

jump two decad forward to the present, we now 
have a number of new learn method that be veri ac- 
curate, but unfortun also rel unintellig such 
a boost trees, random forests, bag trees, kernelized- 
svms, neural nets, deep neural nets, and ensembl of these 
methods. appli ani of these method to mission-crit 
problem such a healthcar remain problematic, in part 
becaus usual it be not ethic to modifi (or randomize) 
the care deliv to patient to collect data set that will 
not suffer from the kind of bia describ above. learn 
must be do with the data that be available, not the data 
one would want. but it be critic that model train on 
real-world data be valid prior to use l some patient 
be put at risk, which make use the most accur learn 
method challenging. 

In thi paper we describ the applic of a learn 
method base on high-perform gener addit mod- 
el [5, 6] to the pneumonia problem describ above, and to 
a modern, much larg problem predict 30-day hospit 
readmission. On both of these problem our ga2m model 
yield state-of-the-art accuraci while remain intelligible, 
modular, and editable. We believ thi class of model repre- 
sent a signific step forward in train model with high 
accuraci that be also intelligible. the main contribut of 
thi paper be that it: show that ga2m yield competit 
accuraci on real problems; demonstr that the learn 
model be intelligible; demonstr that the predict 
make by the model for individu case (patients) also be 
intelligible, and demonstr how, becaus the model be 
modular, they can be edit by experts. 

the remaind of the paper be organ a follows. sec- 
tion 2 provid a brief introduct to gam and ga2m. 
section 3 and 4 present our case studi of train intelli- 
gibl ga2m model on the pneumonia and the 30-day read- 

mission data, respectively. section 5 discu a wide rang 
of issu that aris when learn with intellig model 
and our gener lesson for the research community. 

2. intellig model 
let D = {(xi, yi)}n1 denot a train dataset of size N , 

where xi = (xi1, ..., xip) be a featur vector with p featur 
and yi be the target (response). We use xj to denot the jth 
variabl in the featur space. 

gener addit model (gams) be the gold stan- 
dard for intellig when low-dimension term be con- 
sider [4, 5, 6]. standard gam have the form 

g(e[y]) = β0 + 
∑ 

fj(xj), (1) 

where g be the link function and for each term fj , e[fj ] = 0. 
gener linear model (glms), such a logist regres- 
sion, be a special form of gam where each fj be restrict 
to be linear. sinc the contribut of a singl featur to the 
final predict can be easili understood by examin fj , 
such model be consid intelligible. 

To improv accuracy, pairwis interact can be add 
to standard gams, lead to a model call ga2m [6]: 

g(e[y]) = β0 + 
∑ 
j 

fj(xj) + 
∑ 
i6=j 

fij(xi, xj). (2) 

note that pairwis interact be intellig becaus they 
can be visual a a heat map. ga2m build the best 
gam first and then detect and rank all possibl pair of 
interact in the residuals. the top k pair be then in- 
clude in the model (k be determin by cross-validation). 

there be variou method to train gam and ga2ms. 
each compon can be repres use splines, lead to 
an optim problem which balanc the smooth of 
spline and empir error [7]. other represent includ 
regress tree on a singl or a pair of features. empir 
studi show gradient boost with bag of shallow re- 
gression tree yield a compon veri good accuraci [5]. 
interest reader be refer to [5, 6] for details.2 

3. case study: pneumonia risk 
In thi case studi we use one of the pneumonia dataset 

discuss earli in the motiv [3]. thi dataset have 
14,199 pneumonia patients. To facilit comparison with 
prior work, we use the same train and test set fold from the 
earli study: the train set contain 9847 patient and the 
test set have 4352 patient (a 70:30 train:test split). there 
be 46 featur describ each patient. these rang from 
histori featur such a age and gender, to simpl measure- 
ment take at a routin physic such a heart rate, blood 
pressure, and respir rate, to lab test such a white 
blood cell count (wbc) and blood urea nitrogen (bun), 
to featur read from a chest x-ray such a lung collaps or 
pleural effusion. see tabl 1 for a complet list. 

As discuss earlier, the goal be to predict probabl of 
death (pod) so that patient at high risk can be admit- 
ted to the hospital, while patient at low risk be treat a 
outpatients.3 10.86% of the patient in the dataset (1542 pa- 
tients) die from pneumonia. the gam/ga2m model be 
2code be avail at https://github.com/yinlou/mltk. 
3hospit be danger places, particularli for patient 
with impair immun systems. treat low-risk patient 
a outpati not onli save money, but be actual safer.

train on thi data use 100 round of bagging. bag be 
do to reduc overfitting, and to provid pseudo-confid 
interv for the graph in the intellig model. 

the auc area for differ model train on thi data be 
show in tabl 2. On thi dataset logist regress achiev 
auc = 0.843, random forest achiev 0.846, logitboost 
0.849, gam 0.854, and ga2m be best with auc = 0.857.4 

the differ in auc between the method be not huge (less 
than 0.02), but it be reassur to see the gam/ga2m meth- 
od achiev the best accuraci on thi problem. the im- 
portant question be if the gam/ga2m model be abl to 
achiev thi accuraci while remain intelligible? 

figur 1 show 28 of the 56 term in the ga2m model 
for pneumonia. unfortunately, the compact represent 
necessari for the paper reduc intelligibility. for small 
model like thi with few than 100 term we would pre- 
fer to present all terms, possibl sort by their import 
to the model. In the actual deployment, for each term we 
would also show a histogram of data densiti for differ 
valu of the feature, descript statist about the fea- 
ture, sever differ measur of term import in the 
model, and link to onlin resourc that provid informa- 
tion about the term, e.g., link to a hospit database, or 
wikipedia or webmd page that describ features, how they 
be measured, what the normal rang are, and what abnor- 
mal valu indicate. becaus of space limit we have 
suppress all of thi auxiliari inform (includ some 
axi labels!) and just present shape plot for some of the 
more interest terms. present the term in multicol- 
umn format without the auxiliari inform further hin- 
der intellig — the model be more readabl when 

4the ga2m model us 10 of the 46∗45/2 = 1035 possibl 
pairwis interact term (k chosen by cross-validation).

tabl 2: auc for differ learn method on the

present in sort order a a scrollabl list of graph plu 
auxiliari information. 

the 1st term in the model be for age. age (in years) on the 
x-axi rang from 18-106 year old (the pneumonia dataset 
contain onli adults). the vertic axi be the risk score 
predict by the model for patient a a function of age. the 
risk score for thi term vari from -0.25 for patient with age 
less than 50, to a high of about 0.35 for patient age 85 and 
above. the green errorbar be pseudo-errorbar of the risk 
score predict for each age: each errorbar be ±1 standard 
deviat of the variat in the risk score measur by 100 
round of bagging. We use ±1 standard deviat instead 
of the standard error of the mean becaus it be well know 
that bag underestim the varianc of predict from 
complex models. We believ it be safer to be conserv 
than to present unrealist narrow confid intervals. 
(see the top of figur 3(a) for an enlarg version of thi 
graph, and the discuss in section 5.5 for more detail 
analysi of the age feature.) 

the 2nd term in the model, asthma, be the one that caus 
troubl in the cehc studi in the mid-90’ and prevent 
clinic trial with the veri accur neural net model. the 
ga2m model have found the same pattern discov back 
then: that have asthma lower the risk of die from pneu- 
monia. As with the logist regress and rule-bas mod- 
el train then, but unlik with the neural net models, thi 
term be easi to recogn and fix in the ga2m model. We 
can “repair” the model by elimin thi term (effect 
set the weight on thi graph to zero), or by use hu- 
man expertis to redraw the graph so that the risk score 
for asthma=1 be positive, not negative. becaus asthma be 
boolean, it be not necessari to use a graph, and we could 
present a weight and offset (riskscor = w*hasasthma + 
b) instead. We prefer to use graph for boolean term like 
asthma for three reasons: 1) it be necessari to show graph 
for featur with multipl or continu valu such a age 
a well a for interact between features, and it be awk- 
ward for the user to jump from term present a graph to 
term present a equations; 2) we find graph provid an 
intuit display of risk where up impli high risk, down 
impli low risk, and the magnitud of the chang in risk be 
captur by the distanc moved; and 3) some user be not 
a comfort with number a they be with graphs, and 
it be import that the model be intellig to real users, 
whatev their background. 

the 3rd term in the model be bun (blood urea nitro- 
gen) level. most patient have bun=0 because, a in mani 
medic datasets, if the variabl be not measur or assum 
normal it be cod a 0. the model say risk be reduc 
for patient where bun be not measured, suggest that 
thi test typic be not order for patient who appear 
to be healthy. bun level below 30 appear to be low risk,

healthi bun be 10-20, and that elev level abov 30 may 
indic kidney damage, congest heart failure, or bleed 
in the gastrintestin tract. 

the cancer term in the model be clear: have cancer sig- 
nificantli increas the risk of die from pneumonia, prob- 
abli becaus it explain whi the patient have pneumonia (ei- 
ther from lung cancer, from immuno suppress drug use 
to treat cancer, or from hospit associ with can- 
cer) and/or becaus it explain the stage of cancer (termin 
stage of cancer frequent lead to fail health and be 
bed-ridden, both of which can lead to pneumonia). 

the next term in the model, chronic lung disease, and the 
histori of chest pain term that occur later, be interest 
becaus the model suggest that chronic lung diseas and a 
histori of chest pain both decreas pod. We suspect that 
thi may be a similar problem a asthma: patient with 
lung diseas and chest pain may receiv care earlier, and 
may receiv more aggress care. If further investig 
suggest thi to be the case, both term would be remov 
from the model, or edited, similar to the asthma term. 

the # of diseas (# of comorbid conditions) be a gener 
measur of illness. the graph suggest that have no dis- 
ea other than pneumonia lower risk, that risk increas 
slowli a the number of comorbid condit increas from 
1-3, then be flat or decreas until it rise dramat abov 
6, but the errorbar be larg enough to be consist with 
risk be somewhat flat for 3-8 comorbidities. 

heart rate be an unusu look graph. 91% patient 
have rate=0, indic it be not measur or assum 
normal. risk be high for veri low heart rate (10-30), and 
for veri high rate (125-200), but the model do not ap- 
pear to discrimin between patient with heart rate 40- 
120. On further inspection, there be no patient with heart 
rate record between 40-120! appar all patient in 
thi rang be consid “normal” and cod a 0. (nor- 
mal heart rate in adult be about 60-100, 40-60 for athletes, 
and somewhat high than 100 for patient with “white 
coat” syndrome). the unusu shape of the graph for heart 
rate have lead u to discov a surpris aspect of the data, 
though it be not clear what risk we would want to model to 
predict for rate between 40-120 where there be no data? 

the respir rate term be veri clear: rate=0 (missing) 
or 20-28 be low risk, and risk rise rapidli a breath rate 
climb from 28-60. normal respir rate for adult be 
16-20. In the bodi temperatur term, temp from 36◦c- 
40◦c be low risk (normal be 37◦c), risk be somewhat elev 
at low bodi temp (32◦c-36◦c), and greatli elev for 
temp abov 40.5◦c (fever thi high often be a sign of seriou 
infection). have a fever abov 41.5◦c increas the risk 
score by a full point or more.5 diastol blood pressur also 
can dramat increas risk: low diastol in the rang 20- 
50 (normal be 60-80) increas risk a much a a full point. % 
band be also a strong term (band in a blood test be a sign 
of bacteri infection—bacteri pneumonia be more deadli 
than viral pneumonia): band abov 40% indic elev 
risk, with band abov 80% indic veri elev risk. 

befor leav pneumonia, let u examin one of the inter- 
action terms. In the age vs. cancer term, we see that risk be 
high for the young patient (probabl cancer acquir 

5an increas in risk of 1 point more than doubl the odd 
of dying. see section 5.1. 

in childhood but not cure when the patient reach age 18), 
and declin for patient who acquir cancer late in life, but 
for patient without cancer risk rise a expect with age. 
thi be a classic interact effect that like result from the 
differ between childhood and adult cancers. 

space prevent u from discuss each term individually, 
or from discuss term in great detail. see section 5.5 for a 
deeper dive on the age term. To summar thi section, the 
ga2m model discov the same asthma pattern that cre- 
ate problem in the cehc study, provid a simpl mech- 
anism to correct thi problem, and uncov other similar 
problem (chronic lung diseas and histori of chest pain) 
that be not recogn in the cehc studi but which war- 
rant further investig and probabl repair. As hoped, 
the ga2m model be accurate, intelligible, and repairable. 

4. case study: 30-day readmiss 
In thi section we appli ga2m to a modern and much 

larg dataset for 30-day hospit readmission. the data 
come from a collabor with a larg hospital. there 
be 195,901 patient in the train set (2011-2012), 100,823 
patient in the test set (2013), and 3,956 featur for each 
patient. featur includ lab test results, summari of doc- 
tor notes, and detail of previou hospitalizations. In thi 
problem, the goal be to predict which patient be like to 
be readmit to the hospit within 30 day after be re- 
leas from the hospital. all patient in thi dataset have 
alreadi be hospit at least once, and the goal be to 
predict if they will need to return to the hospit unusu 
quickli (within 30 days). hospit with abnorm high 
30-day readmiss rate be penal financi becaus 
a high rate suggest the hospit do not provid adequ 
care on the earli admission, or may have releas the pa- 
tient prematurely, or do not provid adequ instruct 
to the patient when they be released, or do not perform 
adequ follow-up after release. In the data 8.91% of pa- 
tient be readmit within 30 days. for thi problem we 
use 10 iter of bagging. train the 10 model take 
2-3 day on a small cluster of 10 gener purpos computers. 
tabl 2 show the auc for differ model on thi data. 

In section 3 we examin the ga2m model for the pneu- 
monia problem. unfortunately, the readmiss dataset con- 
tain almost 100 time a mani features. instead of tri 
to examin the full model, we instead examin the predic- 
tion make by the model for three patients. two of these 
patient have veri high predict probabl of readmiss 
(p=0.9326 and p=0.9264), and one of the patient have a typ- 
ical readmiss probabl (p=0.0873). thi allow u to 
demonstr that the model be intellig not onli take 
a a whole, but that the predict ga2m model make for 
individu patient also be intelligible. 

In figur 2, each of the three column be a patient, and 
each row be a term in the model. term be sort for each 
patient (in each column) by the risk they contribut to that 
patient for 30-day readmission. space limit u to show 
the top 6 term for each patient that contribut most to 
risk. patient #1 have a veri high probabl of readmiss 
within 30 days: p=0.9326. the four term that contribut 
most to their high probabl of readmiss are: their total 
number of visit to the hospit be 40, they have be an in- 
patient in the hospit 19 time in the last 12 months, they 
have be in the hospit 10 time in the last 6 months, and 
4 time in the last 3 months. thi be not unusual: the most

1726 



predict term in the 30-day readmiss model measur 
the number of visit patient have make in the last 12 month, 
6 months, and 3 month to the er, a an outpatient, and a 
an inpatient. As we see with thi patient, a larg number of 
recent inpati visit (admissions) be associ with a high 
probabl of readmission.6 the next two term suggest 
whi patient #1 may have be in the hospit often: thi 
patient have receiv larg do of amoxicillin (an antibiot 
use to treat infect like strep and pneumonia) and ver- 
apamil (a treatment for hypertens and angina), i.e., they 
have an ongo infect that may not be respond to 
antibiotics, and also probabl have heart disease. the main 
reason thi patient be predict to be like to return be be- 
caus they have be in the hospit often in the last year, 
but the first few term in the model also give u a hint of 
the medic condit that put them at elev risk. 

the term that be most import for patient #2 (also 
high risk: p=0.9364) be differ from the term that be 
import for patient #1. the most import 6 term 
be prepar that the patient receiv dure their last 
visit: prednison be a corticosteroid use a an imummo- 
suppressant, etoposid in an anticanc drug, mesna be a 
cancer chemotherapi drug, doxorubicin be a treatment for 
blood and skin cancers, dexamethoson be anoth immuno- 
suppress steroid, and ondansetron be a drug use to treat 
nausea from chemotherapy. patient #2 have receiv do 
of each of these prepar that suggest cancer may not be 
respond well to treatment and that they be receiv ag- 
gressiv chemotherapy. the contribut to risk from these 
6 term alon be great than +1.5, i.e., these 6 term alon 
tripl the odd of their be readmit within 30-days. 

patient #3 have moder risk: p=0.0873 (baselin rate 
be 8.91%). thi 6 term that increas thi patient’ read- 
mission risk the most are: 1) the patient have endrometri 
carcinoma (a cancer common in post-menopaus woman 
that often can be treat effect by hysterectomi with- 
out radiation- or chemo-therapy); 2) a benign abdomin 
tumor (malign adenomat neplasm =3); 3) a relax 
typic prescrib to calm patient or reduc spasms; 4) a 
fairli typic (i.e. low risk) hematocrit test result; 5) a pre- 
cancer non-invas lesion in the breast; and 6) a small 
number of outpati visit suggest they have be re- 
ceiv treatment a an outpati without need to be 
hospit (the inpati and ER risk factor for thi pa- 
tient be all low). patient #3 be a typic patient a far a 30- 
day readmiss be considered. they be post-menopausal, 
have cancer that respond well to treatment if caught early, 
the treatment themselv be rel low-risk, and they 
have not need unusu medic or to be hospit 
often in the last year. 

the patient abov provid a small glimps of what the 
ga2m model learn from a 200,000 patient train set with 
4,000 features: we have onli be abl to examin three 
patients, and have onli look at the top 6 term for each 
of these patients. To a medic expert, the sort term 

6A larg number of visit to the ER also be associ with 
increas chanc of readmission, but outpati visit be 
more interesting: a small number of recent outpati visit 
increas risk of readmission, but a veri larg number of 
outpati visit (100-200 in the last year) indic low 
risk of readmiss becaus the patient be receiv primari 
care a an outpatient—mani of these patient be dialysi 
patient who visit the hospit 1-2 time per week.

for each patient present a comprehens pictur of the risk 
factor that contribut to the probabl of readmiss pre- 
dict for a patient. the model be not causal — it do not 
say that becaus the patient have X, they receiv treatment 
A, B, and C, and we can see from the amount of A, B, and 
C they receiv that they be not respond well. instead, 
it learn that high do of A, B, and C be associ with 
high risk or readmission, and it be up to the human expert 
to infer the underli causal reason for the featur valu 
and the risk they predict. nevertheless, compar to an un- 
intellig model such a an ensembl of 1000 boost tree 
or a complex neural net, the model be fairli transparent, and 
the predict it make can be fulli “understood”, both at 
the per-pati level, and at the macro-model level. 

5. discuss 

5.1 how To interpret risk score 
each term in the intellig model return a risk score 

(log odds) that be add to the patient’ aggreg predict 
risk. term with risk score abov zero increas risk; term 
with score below zero decreas risk. the term risk score 
be add to a baselin risk, and the sum convert to a 
probability. both penumonia and 30-day readmiss have 
baselin rate near 0.1, which correspond to totalriskscor 
= -2.197. So patient with aggreg risk score abov -2.2 
have high than averag risk, and patient with total risk 
score below -2.2 have low than averag risk scores. A pa- 
tient with totalriskscor = 0 (includ the baselin offset) 
have quit high risk: p = 1/(1+exp(−1∗totalrisksccore) = 
1/(1 + exp(0)) = 0.5. tabl 3 show a sampl of total risk 
score and the correspond probabilities. 

5.2 modular 
In the intellig model discuss in thi paper, the av- 

erag risk score for each graph (i.e., each term: each featur 
or pair of features) averag across the train set be set 
to zero by subtract the mean score. A singl bia term 
be then add to the model so that the averag predict 
probabl across all patient equal the observ baselin 
rate. thi be do to make model identifi and modular. 
becaus of thi property, each graph can be remov from 
the model (zero out) without introduc bia to the pre- 
dictions. If all term be remov from the model, the onli 
remain term would be the bia term, and the probabl 
predict for all patient would be the observ baselin rate 
in the train set. ad term (graphs) to the model in- 
creas the model’ discrimin without alter the 
prior. thi be import becaus it increas modular and 
make it easi to interpret the contribut of each term: 

1727 



neg score decreas risk, and posit score increas 
risk compar to the baselin risk. 

5.3 sort term by import 
If a model contain a modest number of term (e.g., less 

than 50), it be best to show term in the model to expert 
in the order they be most familiar with. becaus expert 
be often use to see featur in logic groupings, inter- 
pretat be aid by preserv these group when the 
model be presented. however, when the number of term 
grow large, it becom infeas for expert to examin all 
term carefully. term import often follow a power-law 
distribution, with a few term be veri important, a mod- 
est number of term be somewhat important, and mani 
term be of littl importance. when thi be the case, in- 
tellig can be improv by sort term by a measur 
of import such a the drop in auc when the term be 
removed, or the skill of the term measur in isolation, or 
the maximum contribut (posit or negative) that the 
term can make for ani patient. No one measur be correct 
or best, and we find that a sort that reflect a combin 
of these metric seem to work well. 

It be much easi to sort term by import when make 
predict for a singl patient: becaus each term yield a 
singl risk score for each patient at the point where that 
patient’ featur valu lie on the term graph, it be possibl to 
sort term by how much they increas or decreas risk for the 
patient. thi provid a well-defin order of the term 
for a patient from term that increas risk most to term that 
decreas risk most. often thi order quickli identifi 
the key patient characterist that best explain the model’ 
prediction, and which help expert quickli understand the 
patient’ condition. thi be the method we use to describ 
the predict make by the 30-day readmiss model — 
although that model contain more than 4000 terms, the 
number of term that be relev for each patient are, in 
practice, often quit small (e.g., less than 100). 

5.4 featur shape vs. expert discret 
signific effort be make in the cehc pneumonia studi 

to train accur model with logist regress and other 
method that could not handl continu attributes. med- 
ical expert care discret each continu attribut 
into clinic meaning rang use to defin boolean vari- 
ables. for example, the interv for age be 18-39, 40-54, 
55-63, 64-68, 69-72, 73-75, 76-79, 80-83, 84-88, and 89+. We 
use these expert-defin interv for the logist regress 
model report in tabl 2. We also train a ga2m model 
with these discret features, and observ a drop in auc 
of about 0.01 on the test set compar to the ga2m train 
with the continu features, suggest that the ga2m model 
gain some of it accuraci by shape continu featur 
more accur than expert discretization. 

5.5 deep dive: risk a a function of age 
In thi section we drill down on how the featur “age” 

be shape by the pneumonia and 30-day readmiss mod- 
els. age be present in both data set and measur in years. 
but the relev of age to the two predict task be veri 
different. In pneumonia, age be a critic factor that can ex- 
plain whi a patient have acquir pneumonia, and what the

however, age be just one of thousand of factor that affect 
a patient’ health and cours of illness. moreover, becaus 
the predict task be hospit readmission, not probabl 
of death, age repres a weaker, more gener characteriza- 
tion of patient health and their likeli to need addit 
hospit within 30 days. If the patient be elderly, but 
just have a success hip replac or kidney stone re- 
moved, they be not like to need to return to the hospit 
within 30 day for thi condition. similarly, an elderli pa- 
tient who be admit to the hospit becaus of pneumo- 
nia, but who be now be releas becaus they respond 
to treatment, be unlik to need further care for pneumonia 
within 30 day if they take proper medications. all-caus 
readmiss be veri differ from probabl of death for a 
specif condit such a pneumonia. 

figur 3(a) show the risk profil for age in the pneumo- 
nia model, and the distribut of age in the pneumonia 
data. the major of pneumonia patient be age 60-90. 
qualitatively, the risk of die from pneumonia be low and 
constant from age 18-50, rise slowli from age 50-66, then 
rise quickli from age 66-90, and then level off at veri high 
risk abov age 90. the low-risk region to the left of age 50 be 
remark flat, suggest that the underli tree rare 
if ever found it use to split thi region into subregions. 
note that the risk score for thi region be -0.27, suggest 
that be young significantli reduc the risk of die from 
pneumonia. but risk slowli increas a age increas abov 
50, though the contribut to risk do not becom posit 
until about 70 years. beyond 70 year old, the contribut 
to risk rise rapidli from 0.0 at 70 to +0.20 at age 82 and 
+0.35 at age 86. accord to the model, the increas in 
risk of go from 70 to 86 be larg than the decreas be risk 
of go from 70 down to 50 or less. 

beyond the risk vs. age profil describ above, there be 
intrigu detail in the graph. 1) there be a small jump 
in risk at age 67, and again at age 86. the error bar be 
reason tight around age 65-70, suggest that the jump 
in risk at 67 may be real. one possibl explan for thi 
be that in a dataset from the 90’s, mani patient would have 
retir at around age 65, and that thi may yield differ- 
enc in activ levels, health insurance, and willing to 
get access healthcar earli enough to improv outcom — 
pneumonia respond well to treatment with antibiotics, but 
can be life threaten if not treated. the 2nd jump in risk 
around age 86 be harder to explain. It may be that practi- 
tioners, either conscious or subconsciously, treat patient 

old than 85 differently, and that thi ultim increas 
their pod. Or the jump at 86 may be an artifact of the 
model — the error bar at age 86 and abov be larger. one 
approach to investig thi issu further would be to train 
on anoth sampl sampl of data (or on differ subsam- 
ples) to see if the rise at age 86 persists.8 2) there be an 
appar drop in risk abov age 100. We suspect that thi 
drop probabl be not real and may be due to mild overfit- 
ting — there be veri few patient age 95 and older, and the 
error bar from age 90 to 106 be larg and consist with 
risk be constant in thi region.9 3) surprisingly, there be 
no evid that risk, although veri high, increas abov 
age 85. either medic treatment be equal effect for 
patient old than 85, or other medic condit be more 
like to be respons for death at thi age than pneumo- 
nia, or risk do increas abov 85 and the model have fail 
to learn it. 

figur 3(b) show the age term and densiti for 30-day 
readmission. one of the key differ between the pneu- 
monia and 30-day readmiss dataset be that pneumonia 
dataset contain onli adult patient age 18 and older, but 
the readmiss dataset contain patient of all age, includ- 
ing newborn infants. the import of age to 30-day read- 
mission be veri different. age have littl effect on readmiss 
between age 2 and 50, risk slowli increas from age 50 to 80, 
and then increas a littl more abov age 80. the larg 
increas in score be +0.03 at age 90 and above. there be 
mani reason whi age be less import for readmiss than 
for pneumonia: most patient independ of age would not 
be releas if the hospit thought they be like to need 
to be readmit in less than a month, in thi dataset there 
be thousand of other more specif variabl that can bet- 
ter explain varianc in the risk of readmiss (the model 
be more ill specific) than age, and some patient who 
be veri elderli will die at home (either unexpectedli or by 
choice) and thu will not be readmitted. 

8it be onli becaus the model be so intellig that we be 
abl to recogn and question such fine detail in the risk vs. 
age profile. We assum that similar jump in predict risk 
occur in other accur model such a boost tree a well, 
but becaus those model be less intellig the jump be 
not recogn or investigated. 
9or it might be due to success agers, a rare but geneti- 
calli identifi class of peopl with trait that good en- 
abl them to surviv into old age

An interest featur of the model for 30-day readmis- 
sion be highlight in figur 3(c) where the x axi have be 
expand to show age 0-2. In thi dataset newborn infant 
be born into the hospital, and thu will be treat a read- 
mit if they need to be hospit within 30 day after 
go home. In part becaus newborn would not be re- 
leas if they be at risk, the risk score for newborn age 
0-2 month be -0.04—thi be a larg neg risk score than 
the increas in risk for elderli patients. thi suggest that 
most newborn tend to be healthi when they be releas 
from the hospit and be less like to need to be readmit 
within 30 days. but thi reduct in risk from be new- 
born diminish after 2-3 months, and the model suggest 
that infant age 3-15 month have slightli high posit 
risk of be readmit to the hospital. thu infant age 3- 
15 month have high risk of readmiss than infant that 
be young or older, and it be not until age 45 that the risk 
of readmiss rise to thi level again. 

5.6 shape with spline 
gener addit model be often fit with spline [7]. 

spline allow gam to be train with care control over 
regular and provid more principl error bars. un- 
fortunately, the spline method tend to over regularize, yield 
less accuraci than ga2m models, and yield risk profil that 
sometim miss detail discov by ga2m models. figur 4 
show three term from a spline gam model train on the 
pneumonia data. the 1st term be age, the 2nd be ph, and the 
3rd be temperature. although the spline captur the basic 
trend (e.g., risk increas with age, pH risk be least around 
7.6, and fever risk rise abov 40◦c), the spline miss detail 
learn by ga2m. for example, the ga2m model for age 
be much more nuanced, and the spline model may not prop- 
erli model temperatur in the normal rang 36◦c-38◦c. the 
spline gam model have accuraci closer to logist regress 
than ga2m, so the extra detail learn by ga2m increas 
accuraci and probabl reflect genuin structure. 

5.7 correl doe not impli causat 
becaus the model in thi paper be intelligible, it be 

tempt to interpret them causally. although the model 
accur explain the predict they make, they be still 
base on correlation. If featur be add to or subtract 
and the model retrained, the graph for some term that have 
remain in the model would chang becaus of correl 
with the featur add or subtracted. although detail of 
some of the shape plot be suggest (e.g., do pneumonia 
risk truli jump a age increas abov 65, and again abov 
85?), it be not (yet) clear if some detail like thi be due to a) 
overfitting; b) correl with other variables; c) interact 
with other variables; d) correl or interact with un- 
measur variables; or e) due to true underli phenomenon 
such a retir and chang in insur provider. 

perhap the strong statement we can make right now be 
that the model be intellig enough to provid a window 
into the data and predict problem that be miss with 
mani other learn methods, and that thi window allow 
question to be rais that will requir investig and 
further data analysi to answer. In futur version of these 
model we hope to autom some of these analysi so that 
it be clearer what featur in the intellig model be “real” 
or due to random factor such a overfit and spuriou 

correlation. ad causal analysi to the model would be 
tremend useful, but is, of course, difficult. 

6. conclus 
We present two case studi on real medic data where 

ga2m achiev state-of-the-art accuraci while remain in- 
telligible. On the pneumonia case studi the ga2m model 
learn pattern that previous prevent complex machin 
learn model from be deployed, but becaus ga2m be 
intellig and modular it be possibl to edit the model to re- 
duce deploy risk. On the larger, more complex 30-day 
hospit readmiss task the ga2m model achiev excel- 
lent accuraci while yield a manageable, surprisingli intel- 
ligibl model despit incorpor over 4000 terms. use 
thi problem we demonstr how ga2m can be use to 
explain the predict the model make for individu pa- 
tient in a concis way that place focu on the most impor- 
tant/relev term for each patient. We believ ga2m rep- 
resent a signific step forward in the tradeoff between 
model accuraci and intellig that should make it easi 
to deploy high-accuraci learn model in applic such 
a healthcar where model verif and debugg be 
a import a accuracy.
