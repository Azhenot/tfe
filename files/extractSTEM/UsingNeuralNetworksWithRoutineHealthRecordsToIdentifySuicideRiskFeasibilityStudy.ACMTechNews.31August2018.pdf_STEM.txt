abstract 

background: each year, approxim 800,000 peopl die by suicid worldwide, account for 1–2 in everi 100 deaths. It 
be alway a tragic event with a huge impact on family, friends, the commun and health professionals. unfortunately, suicid 
prevent and the develop of risk assess tool have be hinder by the complex of the underli mechan 
and the dynam natur of a person’ motiv and intent. mani of those who die by suicid have contact with health servic 
in the preced year but identifi those most at risk remain a challenge. 
objective: To explor the feasibl of use artifici neural network with routin collect electron health record to 
support the identif of those at high risk of suicid when in contact with health services. 
methods: use the secur anonymis inform linkag databank uk, we extract the data of those who die by suicid 
between 2001 and 2015 and pair controls. look at primari (gener practice) and secondari (hospit admissions) electron 
health records, we built a binari featur vector cod the presenc of risk factor at differ time prior to death. risk factor 
included: gener practic contact and hospit admission; diagnosi of mental health issues; injuri and poisoning; substanc 
misuse; maltreatment; sleep disorders; and the prescript of opiat and psychotropics. basic artifici neural network be 
train to differenti between the suicid case and pair controls. We interpret the output score a the estim suicid 
risk. system perform be assess with 10x10-fold repeat cross-validation, and it behavior be studi by repres 
the distribut of estim risk across the case and controls, and the distribut of factor across estim risks. 
results: We extract a total of 2604 suicid case and 20 pair control per case. our best system attain a mean error rate 
of 26.78% (sd 1.46; 64.57% of sensit and 81.86% of specificity). while the distribut of control be concentr around 
estim risk < 0.5, case be almost uniformli distribut between 0 and 1. prescript of psychotropics, depress and 
anxiety, and self-harm increas the estim risk by ~0.4. At least 95% of those present these factor be identifi a 
suicid cases. 
conclusions: despit the simplic of the implement system, the propos methodolog obtain an accuraci like other 
publish method base on special questionnair gener data. most of the error come from the heterogen of pattern 
show by suicid cases, some of which be ident to those of the pair controls. prescript of psychotropics, depress

introduct 

background 
the world health organ recogn suicid a a public 
health priority. the world health organ member state 
be commit to work toward the global reduct of 
suicid rate worldwid by 10% by 2020 [1]. In wale alone, 
approxim 300 peopl die each year by suicide, account 
for about 1% of all deaths, and three time the rate of fatal 
follow traffic accid [2]. the suicid rate have bare alter 
over the last decade, and ani chang that have occur have 
gener be an increas [3]. each death by suicid in the UK 
be estim to cost more than £1,370,000 (direct and indirect 
costs) [4]. consid these observations, adopt a public 
health approach to suicid prevent “ha to be a nation 
priority” [5]. 

unfortunately, the predict of suicid risk have proven to be a 
challeng problem for epidemiolog studi and how they 
appli to health care practice. the pathway to suicid be 
mediat by highli complex processes, integr mani 
interdepend risk factor variabl [6-9]. thi creat 
difficulti around the posit identif of the rel 
small number of individu who will take their own life from 
the much larg group of peopl in whom some or all the variou 
risk factor have be identified. assess of immedi 
suicid risk requir a clinic evaluation. however, the major 
of those who take their own life present to health servic other 
than mental health specialist in their final year. the 
identif of those at risk—so appropri question can be 
ask in relat to suicidality—would support ongo suicid 
prevent effort across a rang of health services. 

short-term suicid risk predict (ie, days, weeks, or months) 
be particularli use for target interventions; but less be know 
about the process underli short-term suicid than 
longer-term present [10]. distal, or identifi long-term 
risk factors, have complex effect on short-term risk and 
therefor separate, specif research be needed. 

At the same time, we have databank curat a wealth of 
electron health record (ehrs), and administr inform 
which, when linked, could provid a repres pictur of 
the biological, societ and health statu of an individu at ani 
point in time. use of thi data at scale be expect to make a 
pivot contribut to the studi of mani diseas [11], 
especi those with complex longitudin histori like suicide. 
however, the sheer volum of data and the complex of the 
suicid factors-risk model have proven to be a challeng for 
tradit epidemiolog and statist model methods. 
As a result, exist screen tool be reportedli ineffici 
[12]. thus, advanc artifici intellig (ai) techniqu be 

current good posit to tackl the combin challeng 
of big data and suicid risk prediction. 

prior work 
although the applic of AI techniqu in differ area of 
medicin be extens [13,14], the difficulti of process 
routin collect ehr and big data in gener have be 
report elsewher [15-18]. these includ the volume, 
complexity, heterogen and chang natur of medic data 
a well a it poor mathemat characterization; the import 
of physician’ interpretations; and the legal, ethic and social 
implications. It be onli recent that we have have the resourc 
to record, maintain and analyz routin collect ehr with 
million of records. 

In the last decade, the use of machin learn (a branch of ai) 
to analyz ehr have grown dramatically, spur in part by 
advanc in artifici neural network (anns) and deep learn 
[19]. miotto and colleagu [20] creat a deep ann that 
receiv hospit diagnosi code and creat a “patient 
representation” vector of 500 features. thi vector be fed to 
a random forest to predict 78 differ diseases, includ mental 
disord such a schizophrenia. thi model gener an 
accuraci of more than 90% for (more than) 76,000 patients, but 
suicid risk be not part of the study. 

indeed, the applic of AI in psychiatri be a field that have 
receiv rel littl attent but have great potenti for 
innov [11]. some propos found in the literatur be 
optim of the deliveri of momentari cognitive-behavior 
intervent [21], earli identif of post-traumat stress 
disord [22], and analysi of social-network inform for 
mental health research [23]. AI studi specif focu on 
suicid risk estim be more recent and scarce. 

passo and colleagu [24] administ questionnair to 144 
particip with major depress disord or bipolar disord 
to extract risk-factor information. suicid be estim 
base on a previou histori of suicid attempts. thi data be 
then fed into variou machin learn algorithm with the aim 
of identifi those at high risk of attempt suicide. A best 
perform of 72% accuraci be obtain with a relev 
vector machine. 

kessler and colleagu [25] use a popul cohort of 
non-deploy US regular armi soldier who have a diagnos 
mental disord and at least one outpati visit. their cohort 
includ 147 death through suicide. between 10 and 14 factor 
be extract after outpati visit follow by suicid (cases) 
and visit not follow by suicid (controls) and use to build 
a logist regress with elast net regular to predict 
suicid in the five week after these visits. their system 
obtain a sensit of 48% and a specif of 84% when

predict suicidality. the author conclud that their system 
“outperform mental health profession to a larg margin.” 

goal of thi studi 
We aim to explor the use of ann with routin collect 
ehr to estim suicid risk within the gener population. 
thi approach build on passo et al and kessler et al research, 
take it a step further by reli on routin collect ehr 
across health set rather than mental health questionnaires. 
hence, our system would not depend on inform that be 
collect onli in specif circumst (eg, outpati visit 
or hospit admissions), and could therefor be use to screen 
the entir popul without increas the workload of health 
care practitioners. 

our system aim to improv not onli the qualiti of suicid risk 
assessment, but also it coverage. thi be a crucial factor when 
consid that onli 35% of those who die in wale by suicid 
between 2010 and 2015, be admit to hospit in the year 
prior to death, and around 40% have an emerg depart 
admission. furthermore, of those who die in wale by suicid 
between 2001 and 2015, 65% do not have a mental health 
record in the year prior to death; and 40% never had. however, 
approxim 83% of these suicid case have at least one 
contact with their gener practition (gp) dure that period. 
therefore, our system seek to util these contact to ass 
suicid risk and increas popul coverage. 

additionally, our system have the potenti to perform risk 
assess continu over time and in the background (ie, 
without human intervention) across healthcar settings. rather 
than use thi a an assess of immedi “at risk” or “not 
at risk,” it will be use to flag patients, even those attend for 
reason other than mental health, so that appropri question 
can be asked. the UK nation institut for health and care 
excel recommend that risk assess tool and scale 
should not be use to predict futur suicid or repetit of 
self-harm [26]. thi be becaus of the dynam natur of suicid 
risk. An individu assess a “not at risk” on one occas 
could subsequ becom “at risk,” but profession may not 
be a respons to these chang becaus of label effects. 
the propos system aim to flag at risk individu upon ani 
contact with health servic so that relev question be ask 
and appropri addressed. 

the goal of thi studi be to test the feasibl of thi concept, 
valid the methodolog from function (performance) 
and medic (valid of factors-risk model) point of view. 
use an oversimplifi system (shallow ann), conserv 
result regard model complex and perform be 
ensured. We combin data from primari and secondari care, 
use repeat cross-valid dure evaluation, and explor 
the distribut of factor across differ level of estim 
suicid risk to describ the system’ behavior. 

In the remaind of thi article, we describ the data sourc 
used, how we defin our cohort of suicid case and controls, 
and the risk factor use dure experimentation. A brief 
introduct to ann be provided, follow by a detail 
descript of the model evalu here. We detail the analysi 
that be run to ass raw perform and the result 

factors-risk model. follow the present of the results, 
we discu their interpret a well a the potenti of the 
propos model, how it compar with the current state of the 
art approaches, it limit and implic for practice, and 
conclusions. 

method 

materi 

data sourc 
data avail within the secur anonym inform 
linkag (sail) databank [27] be used. the hiru inform 
govern review panel (igrp) grant ethic approval. 
igrp be an independ bodi consist of a rang of 
government, regulatori and profession agencies, that overse 
studi approv in line with permiss alreadi grant to the 
analysi of data in the sail databank [28,29]. the current 
research take place under the sid-cymru project [30] (approv 
number 0204). 

for thi study, we link and analyz the nation statist 
annual district death extract (adde), the welsh 
demograph servic (wds), the welsh primari care GP 
dataset (wgp), the patient episod databas for wale (pedw) 
and the emerg depart data set (edds). while all 
dataset be use to defin the studi case-control cohort, onli 
wds, wgp and pedw be use to build the featur vector 
for experimentation. 

data avail vari across individu and databases. while 
add and pedw dataset have a nationwid coverage, wpg 
contain data from 348 out of 474 (73%) GP practic in wales. 
thi variat be reduc by restrict appli dure the 
cohort definit (see below). At the same time, while the wgp 
and pedw dataset be avail over the full studi period 
(2001 to 2015), add be onli avail from 2009. however, 
add data be use onli to determin a key date befor death, 
not to train or test the ann system, and therefor we do not 
expect thi have significantli bia our results. 

cohort definit 
We extract our cohort from sid-cymru, a popul base 
electron case-control studi on complet suicid in wale 
between 2001 and 2015 defin within sail [30]. 
approxim 32,000 death of welsh resid be regist 
each year, of which approxim 350 be suicid or event 
of undetermin intent. It be convent research practic to 
includ the latter in the definit of suicid [31]. 

the case-control studi cohort be built accord to the 
follow steps: 

1. We identifi those that die through suicid at age 10 or 
old between 2001 and 2015. death of undetermin 
intent in those under 10 year of age may be relat to abus 
or neglect and thu be excluded. 

2. We follow individuals’ health histori retrospect 
from death date to identifi the full calendar of health 
servic contact lead up to death (cld). thi could 
includ multipl entri within the wgp, pedw and edd

databas (eg, attend at A and E, admiss to hospital, 
transfer to anoth hospital, and final GP letter receiv 
from hospit notifi of deaths). A maximum cld 
durat of one month be consid to avoid includ 
unrel hospit stays. the cld be subsequ 
remov from the analysi to avoid use inform 
directli link with the death of cases. 

3. onli those resid in wale at the time of their death, with 
GP data avail for at least 80% of the five year prior to 
cld be includ in the study. thi ensur that similar 
data coverag be avail for all case and controls. the 
valu of five year be chosen to balanc between the length 
of health histori and number of case retained. 

4. for each case, 20 control be randomli selected, without 
replac and exclud cases, after match by gender 
and week of birth (±1 year). dure control selection, those 
with a similar period of welsh resid and GP data 
coverag be priorit to ensur similar coverag quality. 
although thi number be unnecessarili larg for tradit 
pair case-control studies, the propos methodolog 
benefit from increas data avail dure training. 

A total of 2604 suicid case be identified—2012 (77.3%) 
of which be males, and 58,080 controls. these have a perfect 
(deterministic) or veri high (probabilistic) linkag score 
(between 0.95 and 1) within sail. 

featur vector 
onli data from wds, wgp and pedw be use dure 
experimentation. not all event record in wgp and pedw 
repres face-to-fac contact with the patient, and a singl event 
may have multipl associ entri (eg, multipl diagnoses). 

each entri be categor in wgp and pedw into type of 
health event: depress and anxiety; other common mental 
disorders; other mental health; non-intent injuri and 
poisoning; self-harm; alcohol misuse; drug misuse; possibl 
maltreatment; physic sleep disorders; non-phys sleep 
disorders; and “others.” We also identifi the prescript of 
opiat and psychotrop from wgp (pedw have no 
prescript information) and record whether there be ani 
entri record in wgp or pedw (repres a hospit 
admission). thi make a total of 15 factor (11 diagnoses, two 
prescriptions, wgp entri and hospit admissions). 

the abov categori be defin in term of readcod for 
wgp and icd10 for pedw with the help of expert clinician 
and base on previou public when avail (depress 
and anxieti [32], other common mental disord [33], 
non-intent and intent (self-harm) injuri and poison 
[34,35], alcohol misus [36], drug misus [36,37], possibl 
maltreat [38] and psychotrop [39]). full code definit 
can be see in tabl A1 and a2, multimedia appendix 1. 

We identifi the presenc of the abov 15 health event dure 
four non-overlap time-frames: 

• 1m: between cld and 1 month befor cld [cld – 1 
month, cld]. 

• 6m: between 1 and 6 month befor cld [cld – 6 months, 
cld – 1 month). 

• 1y: between 6 and 12 month befor cld [cld – 1 year, 
cld – 6 months). 

• 5y: between 1 and 5 year befor cld [cld – 5 years, 
cld – 1 year). 

the final featur vector also includ age at cld and sex, 
result in a length of 62: 1 float age + 1 binari sex + 15 binari 
health event * 4 time-frames. thi featur vector do not 
includ data directli relat to the cld. interact between 
these factor be automat take into account by the ann. 

system design 

artifici neural network 
artifici neural network (anns) be biolog inspir 
comput system capabl of learn task through exampl 
and experience, without the need of explicit program of 
task-specif rule or ani a priori knowledg of the solut 
[40]. 

ann be typic compos of an input layer, one or more 
hidden layer and an output layer (figur 1). each unit (artifici 
neuron) in the input or output layer correspond to one 
dimens of the input or output vector respectively, with each 
dimens correspond to one input or output variable. the 
complex of the input-output model be govern by the 
activ function of neurons, the number of hidden layers, the 
number of neuron in each layer and the connect between 
neuron and layers. 

the term “black-box” be sometim use to describ anns. 
thi have contribut to the widespread misconcept of ann 
not be transparent, which in turn have gain them a bad 
reput in field such a medicine, where understand how 
and whi decis be take be important. however, “black-box” 
allud to the fact that the input-output model gener by the 
network be too complex to be express by a set of simpl rule 
that be syntact meaningful. such a model can nevertheless 
be express a a mathemat equation. for example, a simpl 
ann compos of no hidden layer and a singl output neuron 
with a logist activ function be equival to the logist 
regress model; 

y = S( b + ∑ ∀ iw ji x i) 

where xi be each of the input neuron (ie, variables), wji be the 
weight from the i-th input to the j-th neuron, b be a bia term, 
s(∙) be the sigmoid function and y be the output neuron (ie, result). 
typically, the input-output equat quickli grow in 
complexity, and therefor we opt not to repres it.

figur 1. structur of an artifici neural network with 1 input layer (red), 2 hidden layer (green) and one output layer (blue) all fulli connected. 

evalu architectur 
A simpl ann be implement with seven differ 
configurations: no hidden layer (nn0), one hidden layer of size 
10, 50 or 100 (nn10, nn50, nn100) and two hidden layer with 
size 10, 50 or 100 (nn10-10, nn50-50, nn100-100). all layer 
be fulli connect (ie, each neuron in layer i be connect 
to all neuron of the previou layer i-1). the input layer be 
compos of the featur vector describ abov (ie, 62 neurons). 
hidden layers, when present, have a tanh activ function. 
the output layer have a singl neuron with a sigmoid activ 
function, return the score r of a sampl belong to a 
(suicide) case (r=1) or a control (r=0). A decis threshold of 
0.5 be used, ie, sampl with r>0.5 be classifi a case 
while sampl with r ≤0.5 be classifi a controls. We 
interpret thi score r a the estim risk of suicide, 
differenti between veri low risk (vlr; r ≤0.17), low risk 
(lr; 0.17<r ≤0.33), moderate-low risk (mlr; 0.33<r ≤0.5), 
moderate-high risk (mhr; 0.5<r ≤0.67), high risk (hr; 0.67<r 
≤0.83) and veri high risk (vhr; r>0.83). 

the mean squar error be adjust to account for data 
imbal (20 control per case) so that the result cost of 
both class (case and control) be equal to 1. the final cost 
includ l2 weight regular with scale 0.01. 

all ann be train with the gradient descent algorithm and 
exponenti learn rate decay start at 1. train be 
perform sequenti with three differ batch sizes: 25, 100 
and all case and their respect control (ie, total batch size 
525, 2100 and full). the learn rate be reset with everi 
chang in batch size. train within each batch size continu 
until a maximum number of epoch be reached, the chang of 
cost function evalu on the valid set be low than a 

threshold or the chang be in the neg direct (ie, not 
improving). 

use the oversimplifi system (ie, small number of featur 
and shallow anns) describ above, we favor obtain 
conserv result in term of model complex and 
performance, which we hope would counteract some of the 
limit of the studi (describ below). In addition, in a 
practic applic the cost of misidentifi suicid case 
and control will probabl not be the same. whether the system 
should be tune to have a high sensit at the cost of low 
specif or vice versa depend on mani factor and be beyond 
the scope of thi study. for simplicity, we equal thi cost 
to be the same for case and controls. hence, account for the 
unbalanc 1:20 distribut of case and controls, the cost of 
misclassifi a case be 1, while the cost of misclassifi a 
control be 1/20. all experi and ann be design 
and execut use tensorflow in python. 

statist analysi 

system perform 
We follow a 10x10-fold cross-valid approach to evalu 
the perform of the anns. On each iteration, one-fold be 
use for testing, one for valid (use to inform the earli 
stop train algorithm) and eight for training. case be 
randomli distribut across folds, follow by their respect 
control so that case-control pair be alway maintain 
dure partit (thi partit rule be also appli dure 
batch partit in training). 

On each iteration, a well a measur the classif error 
obtain with the threshold result from training, the threshold 
be vari to comput the receiv oper characterist

compar perform between system use a correct

for 10x10-fold, and P valu be further adjust (Q values) 
for multipl test use the fals discoveri rate benjamini 
and hochberg method [43]. 

finally, we repeat the abov analysi shuffl the label of 
each samples, ie, we randomli assign the label “case” to one 
of the 20 pair control of a case and rebrand the origin 
case a “control,” thi aim at evalu whether our initi 
result be due to real relationship between label and data, 
rather than to random idiosyncrat pattern in the data. 

system behavior 
In addit to measur system performance, we attempt to 
ass the factors-risk model obtain by the best perform 
ann. due to the dimension of the featur vector (ie, 
number of input factors) and the freedom of the ann to build 
complex model with numer non-linear interactions, get 
the full represent of the factors-risk model be not practical. 
however, the follow result give u insight into how larg 
a role each factor play in the comput of the risk score: 

• the histogram of the number of case and control across 
estim risk scores. thi will provid inform 
addit to the perform measur about the 
classif capabl for case and controls. 

• the histogram of the estim risk differ when turn 
specif factor “on” and “off’” across the whole dataset. 
thi will show an estim role of each individu factor 
in the comput of the risk score, and how it vari due 
to interact with other factors. 

• the distribut of each factor (ie, individu present 
a factor) across estim risk scores. thi will work in 
conjunct with the previou point to draw an estim of 
the role of each individu factor. 

• the incid of each factor within estim risk scores. 
thi will allow u to compar incid across risk level 
for case and controls. 

result of thi analysi refer to the factor-risk model built by 
our ann and do not necessarili agre with the real factor-risk 
model. our confid of how similar these two be depend 
on the size and qualiti of the test data and on the perform 
of our system. thi be true for ani AI application, but it be 
especi import in medic applic such a the one 
propos here. 

result 

system perform 
the error rate of the describ ann decreas slightli from 
28.9% to 26.8% when increas the number of hidden layer 
from 0 to 2 (tabl 1). overall, nn0 perform bad than the 
rest. the perform differ between network with 1 and 
2 hidden layers, although small, be statist signific (q< 
0.05) (tabl A3 of multimedia appendix 1). 

figur 2 show the roc curv of the best perform network 
for each number of hidden layer (ie, nn0, nn50 and nn10-10). 
roc curv of nn10, nn50 and nn100 be virtual identical, 
a be curv of nn10-10, nn50-50 and nn100-100. In the fals 
posit rate (fpr=1-specificity) rang between 0 and 15%, nn50 
and nn10-10 perform good than nn0. past thi point, the roc 
curv get closer togeth and for fpr>30% they becom virtual 
identical. despit the similar between roc of nn50 and 
nn10-10, the differ in auc between them be statist 
signific (q< 0.05) (tabl A4 of multimedia appendix 1). In 
gener terms, nn10-10 and nn50 can obtain good sensit 
for more restrict specif valu than nn0 but perform 
similarli well for high specificity. 

crucially, result after shuffl the label be characterist 
of a random process (ie, 50% error rate and 0.5 auc). 

system behavior 
the distribut of case and control across estim risk 
score reflect the result of tabl 1 (figur 3). control be 
mostli concentr on score below 0.5 (hence, high 
specificity). case on the other hand be almost uniformli 
distribut (hence, low sensitivity). overall, few individu 
receiv an estim risk score ≤0.2. 

prescript of psychotropics, depress and anxiety, and 
self-harm seem to have the strong effect on the estim 
risk, increas r by ~0.4 when chang from “off’” to “on” 
across all time-fram (figur 4). most of the risk increas from 
prescript of psychotrop and depress and anxieti come 
on the first six month befor cld (∆r≈ 0.3), while self-harm 
have a more linear effect across time-frames. the distribut of 
∆r for prescript of psychotrop be the most concentr 
around the peak. these three factor be follow in strength 
by hospit admiss and alcohol misuse, with ∆r≈ 0.25. wgp 
entries, on the other hand, reduc the estim risk by around 
0.2. 

most sampl be assign a risk below the 0.5 threshold, with 
onli 70 individu result in a a veri low risk r≤0.17 (tabl 
2). In contrast, a mani a 1366 individu obtain a veri 
high estim risk (r>0.83). age and gender distribut be 
virtual ident across risk levels, except for the veri low 
risk rang (r ≤0.17) which be mainli compos of woman 
(tabl 2). 

look at how factor (individu with factor “on”) be 
distribut across risk score (figur 5, and tabl A5 to A8 
of multimedia appendix 1), in the month befor cld, 97% of 
those with a prescript of psychotropics, 96% of those with 
depress and anxieti and 95% of those with self-harm be 
classifi a be at risk of suicid (r>0.5) (figur 5). more 
than 78% of those present with one of these factor or drug 
or alcohol misus across most of the consid time-fram 
(i.e. 1m, 6m, 1Y and 5y) be classifi a at risk. moreover, 
more than half of the individu with record self-harm in the 
five year befor cld, or depress and anxieti or alcohol or 
drug misus in the month befor cld, receiv a veri high 
estim suicid risk score (r>0.83).

discuss 

princip result 
the present oversimplifi system success differenti 
between 2604 suicid case and 52,080 match control in 
73.22% of test instanc dure 10x10-fold cross-validation. 
It achiev thi use onli routin collect ehr from GP 
and hospit admiss in the five year befor the case’ cld. 

the reduct in error rate a the number of hidden layer 
increas be repres of the complex of the underli 
suicid factors-risk model. In our case, result bare chang 
when the number of neuron in the hidden layer increased. In 

fact, perform differ between network with the same 
number of layer come from a good tune of the output score 
result in an oper point closer to the optim (ie, equal 
error rate). overall, we expect the advantag of have more 
layer and neuron to becom obviou when more factor be 
fed into the model. 

the dispar that be observ between sensit and 
specif and on the score distribut between case and 
control highlight the variat in the level of difficulti 
experienc when analyz both groups. control seem to 
follow more uniform pattern and be therefor easi to identify, 
henc the high specif and the cluster of control below 
a 0.5 score. On the other hand, pattern of the case be more 
heterogeneous, with some have featur vector ident to 
controls, which explain the low sensit and the almost 
uniform distribut of case across risk scores. 

the present behavior evalu do not unequivoc 
explain the factor-risk model built by the network. however, 
they do provid a gener idea of what be drive the output 
score upwards. the input factor prescript of psychotropics, 
depress and anxiety, and self-harm, and, to a low degree, 
drug and alcohol misuse, be strongli link with increas 
estim risk scores. thi be in keep with previou literatur

[6-8] and provid evid for proof of concept and the 
feasibl of identifi high risk individu use ann and 
routin collect ehrs. similarly, gender and age be not 
relat with risk estimation, also in line with find of 
short-term risk studi [10]. 

On the other hand, some risk factor identifi in the literatur 
do not exhibit the same behavior in our results. physic sleep 
disord seem to decreas rather than increas the estim 
risk. due to the rel low incid of thi factor in our 
data, it effect may be attenu by and highli depend on 
more activ factors. thi would also explain the dispers of 
it effect on the estim risk score (figur 4). furthermore, 
possibl maltreat also seem to reduc the estim risk. 
however, after a closer look, it effect seem to chang sign a 
the maltreat get further away from the cld, with possibl 
maltreat in the 5Y time-fram increas the estim 
risk. thi may be relat to long last effect of maltreat 
and with help and support receiv in the first year after the 
maltreatment. 

due to the non-perfect specif and rel low sensit 
obtained, result from the behavior analysi should not be 
directli extrapol to the real-world factor-risk model. have 
say that, the remark agreement between our model and the 
exist literatur work a an indic of the feasibl of 
our proposal. additionally, we expect to substanti improv 
perform with a more complex system design, which will 
in turn increas our confid in the valid of the obtain 
factors-risk model. 

potenti of the propos 
perfect estim of suicid risk use ehr will never be 
possible, mainli becaus some individu take their own life 
without ever seek help or without present to health care 
servic with sign of be at risk. In addition, of those that 
seek help or present with evidence, sign may be miss or 
inaccur or insuffici recorded. other may simpli 
present insuffici evid to distinguish them from control 
(ie, have a pattern ident to controls). 

accord to our data, around 90% of those that die through 
suicid in wale have one or more contact with health servic 
in the year prior to their cld, and approxim 30% of them 
have a contact relat to their mental health. therefore, the 
propos methodolog still have a good scope for application. 

comparison with prior work 
To our knowledge, passos’ [24] and kessler’ [25] be the onli 
two public to date with propos compar to ours. 
they report 72% and 66% of accuraci respectively, compar 
to 73% obtain by our best system. however, these result 
cannot be directli compar due to differ in the applic 
setting, data use and the evalu process. firstly, they 
appli and test their system in a hospit set with onli 
mental health patients. secondly, their system use small 
dataset and data extract from questionnair or outpati 
visit with a specialist. here we use diagnosi in primari and 
secondari care which be less specific, and primari care record 
have littl indic of severity. 

interestingly, while kessler’ method also suffer from low 
sensitivity, passos’ system obtain compar sensit and 
specificity. thi may be due to the latter use data from the 
questionnair structur clinic interview for dsm-iv axis-i 
disorders, which record highli specif diagnoses. In addition, 
passos’ system aim at differenti previou suicid 
attempt from non-attempters, rather than identifi futur 
risk. 

limit 
the result present here be limit by the purpos 
oversimplifi system design use both in term of the number 
of factor consid (onli 15 over four time-frames) and the 
design of the ann (a maximum of two hidden layers). still, 
our system improv chanc identif by almost 50%. As 
we move from feasibl to pilot studi and increas the 
complex of the system we expect to increas perform 
substantially. 

the problem of suicid risk estim suffer not onli from a 
highli complex factors-risk model, but also from a lack of a 
quantit measur of the real risk of suicid which be onli 
know with certainti within a short time span befor a record 
attempt. At ani other time-point, we do not know the real risk 
for ani individual. someon at risk may refrain from ever 
attempt suicide, wherea anoth person may becom at risk 
and attempt suicid within a veri short period. thi will have 
implic for a more practic evalu (compar to the 
feasibl analysi present here), a we will need to find way 
to ass perform fairli without know the real risk 
ourselves. 

without properli label data, we need to reli on clinician to 
ass the factors-risk model construct by the algorithm. In 
our case, most of the individu with a self-harm event be 
classifi a case or a be at risk (ie, r>0.5). some of them 
belong to the control group, and we consid these a error 
in our evaluation. however, should all these instanc be 
consid errors? the answer to thi question be not trivial, and 
have technical, clinic and ethic implic that we need to 
explor in more depth. 

implic for practic 
our propos will be most practic in set where 
profession do not have specialist mental health train but 
be in contact with individu at risk of suicide. nurses, 
emerg depart staff, ambul services, polic and 
prison worker would be among the one benefit the most 
from the tool propos here. these profession face both the 
challeng of see larg number of peopl where it be difficult 
to discern those at risk, and of assess the suicid of 
individu often without have receiv suffici train 
and under staff shortag [44,45]. As a result, it can be a 
challeng to identifi individu for appropri assess and 
care [46]. have an advanc assess tool with complex 
factors-risk model that produc good estim would be 
invalu in these cases.

conclus 
prescript of psychotropics, depress and anxiety, and 
self-harm be strongli link with high estim risk scores, 
follow by hospit admiss and long-term drug and alcohol 
misus which be in keep with the current literature. other 
risk factor such a sleep disord and maltreat have more 
complex effects. 

the system present here be an oversimplifi one, use a 
short featur vector and shallow ann to ass the practic 
of use ehr in thi way. As a feasibl study, we be more 
interest in (a) confirm the exist of discrimin 
information, and (b) valid the propos methodology, than 
obtain high accuraci rates. nevertheless, our system obtain 
an accuraci like other publish method base on special 
questionnair data. 

prescript of psychotropics, depress and anxiety, and 
self-harm be strongli link with high estim risk scores, 
follow by hospit admiss and long-term drug and alcohol 
misuse. age and gender have no effect on risk. interestingly, 
possibl maltreat have the opposit effect in the short and 
long terms, decreas risk when recent and increas it when 
more than a year befor cld. 

the promis perform obtain with a basic ann, and 
the fact that the result factors-risk model be in line for the 
most part with the literature, support the hypothesi of the 
possibl of build a tool capabl of estim suicid risk 
in the gener popul use onli routin collect ehrs. 
We be a long way from employ such method in clinic 
practice, but thi be a first step to har the potenti of 
routin collect electron health record to support clinic 
practic in real time.
