incom inequ and it effect on polit inequ 

februari 19th, 2015 by kara in case studi 

the third in spi’ seri on inequ 

by: remi smith 

polit race be expensive. candid be press by consult 
and campaign manag to rais exorbit amount of money to creat 
lit piec and other advertis that may sway potenti voters. 
recently, the advent of superpac allow larg donor to circumv 
campaign contributions. 

though limit in direct contribut to a campaign (so call hard 
money), ani individu can donat unlimit sum to a superpac or soft 
money. the latter be use for issu advocaci or support of a candidate. 
superpac be controversi becaus they allow a few wealthi citizen to 
domin polit outcom by fill a candidate’ superpac with 
larg amount of money. some argu superpac be a major caus of 
inequ in america’ polit system. A small percentag of 
american control vast sum of fund and they now have a 
disproportion degre of polit influence. Is thi polit 
inequ permiss and do it pose a threat to the polit 
system? 

the import of opportun 

polit inequ is, in mani ways, akin to econom inequality. 
both appear to be grow problem in the US and their solut requir 
some level of equal opportunity. inequ of outcom be justifi and 
even benefici to ani system a it incentiv hard work and reward 
individu base on merit. inequ of opportunity, in contrast, be 
not onli unjust but also perilous. 

opportun be arguabl a right. everyon deserv a chanc to succeed and none should be deni opportunity. poll 
suggest a major of american support the idea of equal of 
opportunity. the concept of equal of opportun be may be appli to 
polit inequality. 

virtu of equal of polit opportun 

democraci reli on and be defin by equal polit opportunity. It 
be a basic principl of democraci that citizen who meet rudimentari 
requir (like age and nation birth) be abl to run for elect 
office. thi impli a fundament equal in democracy: the equal 
of opportun to declar candidaci for an elect position. 

when all member of societi can run for office, it increas 
represent from all segment of society, from farmer to industri 
worker to financiers. A commun leader from a minor group will not 
be bar from candidaci for, say, not own properti or for belong 
to a certain racial group. thi notion run be true 
from municip level to the feder level. peopl have a say 
in govern through the elect of those who best serv the 
their interests. 

abil to run for offic 

prior to the progress era, the u.s. have a system that restrict 
candidaci for polit office. the u.s. senate, instead of be 
elect by the people, compris of individu select by state 
senates. america’ founder intend such a system becaus they want 
to restrict the power of the peopl (jefferson and other fear the 
tyranni of the masses), but it result in a congression bodi that do 
not serv the will of citizen and thu face no account to 
the people. 

not everyon have an equal chanc to becom senator. In thi earli 
america, be born to a poor famili who do not own land, or to an 
ethnic minor meant the individu would not have the connect or 
power to be elect by a state senate. It be a select few who be 
wealthi enough to attend high school or colleg and could becom 
involv in matter of state that be most like to be elected. that 
system close off equal opportunity. 

import of the vote 

the most common mean by which inequ of polit opportun 
occur be through voter suppress or limit the electorate. vote 
be inher equalizing. A citizen have one vote to cast for the 
candid she believ will best repres and good her interest. one 
person, one vote – complet equal. when thi principl be corrupt 
voic be silenc and polit inequ results. 

return to the early-american example, it be obviou how the voic 
of certain group be stifled: there be signific impedi 
voting. prevent certain segment of societi from vote larg 
prevent the interest of the poor and the work class from be 
pursu in government. thi neglect contribut to mani american 
work in dire conditions. few elect offici found it in their 
self-interest to go against busi and properti owner i.e., voters, 
in favor of polici that favor american without signific 
polit heft. It take a populist movement and dedic reform to 
chang american polit to favor, or at least be recept to labor. 
voter suppress be clearli a forc that drive inequality. 

virtu of polit inequ 

polit inequ be not necessarili detrimental. On the contrary, 
some element of polit inequ be necessari for a 
well-structur and incentiv polit system. much like econom 
outcomes, inequ in result be justifiable. those who activ engag 
in the polit system and seek to shape polit outcom right 
have a louder voic in politics. 

there be mani way to be polit engag and do so be 
necessari to be heard: “equal consider of the prefer and need 
of all citizen be foster by equal polit activ among citizens” 
(sidney verba). 
To influenc policymakers, voter can, for instance, work on campaigns, 
contact congress members, particip in protests, and vote. 

studi find that policymak be overwhelmingli respons 
to the whim and want of the high incom earners. naturally, mani 
peopl be offend by thi reality. Is it realli an equal democraci 
when the will of the major be disregarded? yet, democraci reflect 
those who engag in the democrat process. polit inequality, if a 
result of unequ engagement, be benefici to the system and offer 
justifi reason for the more influenti will of the affluent. 

engag 

politicians, while sway by money, also be respons to those who 
seek to influenc polit outcomes. A recent studi do by page, bartel and seawright find that 
the view of american politician be increasingli reflect of those 
of the affluent. thi be partli becaus of substanti campaign 
donations, but it be also due to the polit engag of wealthi 
voters. politician respond to those who be engaged. 

In 1990, nearli 50% of the top quintil incom earner contact a 
congress member versu 25% of the poor. the studi by bartel et 
al find that 47% of the wealthi make “at least one contact with a 
congression office”, 40% contact their own senator, 37% their own 
hous member, and “about one quarter contact a repres or 
senat from anoth district or state”. the wealthi be not afraid to 
take to the street either. protests, “which demand littl in the way of 
skill or money and which be often thought of a ‘the weapon of the 
weak’” (schlozman et al), 
be also domin by the wealthy. the 1990 survey find more than 
twice a mani of those from the top incom quintil than the bottom 
quintil engag in protests. while work on campaigns, contact 
polit officials, and protest do not necessarili influenc polici 
outcomes, they be an opportun to aid the campaign of sympathet 
politician and to make one’ voic heard. 

the import of the vote, part 2 

perhap the easi and most effect way to exert polit opinion 
be to vote. voting, the basic tenet of a democracy, hold elect 
offici account to the public. but for many, the right to vote be 
wasted. the two graph below depict an alarm trend in american 
politics: the discrep of voter registr and turnout between the 
affluent and the poor. 











source: voteview.com 



the first graph demonstr the low voter registr of those in 
the low incom quintile. for the major of the year cover by 
the survey, voter registr be below 50% for the low quintil and 
it rise in the first obama campaign to get out the minor vote. 
As incom increases, so do the percentag of those who regist 
to vote. the second graph be for the 2008 elect and show 
the increas in actual vote a incom rises. for famili earn less 
than $50,000, which be about the median famili incom in 2008, onli 
between 50 and 75% vote – worri especi consid thi be a 
presidenti elect and the obama campaign’ focu on bring 
minor voter to the polls. Of note: 99% of the wealthi american 
(the test group have a median wealth of $7.5 million) survey by page, 
bartels, and seawright vote in the 2008 election. 

whi do larg number of low- and medium-incom voting-ag citizen 
neglect to vote? one explan be lack of time. low-incom american 
often find themselv work multipl job to make end meet and 
therefor may not have time to make it to the polls. An easi solut to 
thi would be to make elect day a nation holiday so no voter have 
to compromis work in order to vote. anoth theori be that low- and 
medium-incom voter find polit outcomes, both in elect and 
policy, so skew to the will of the affluent they do not find it 
worthwhil to vote. thi of cours creat a perpetu cycl wherebi 
outcom will be even more depend upon the desir of the wealthi and 
other voter will be even more disincentiv to vote. A new trend 
emerg in conserv state be also damag voter turnout. voter ID 
law and the limit of absente vote in some state neg 
impact turnout for poor and minor voters. often see a racial 
motivated, thi move be thought to be design to keep the republican 
parti in power in state legislatur becaus the new requir make 
it more difficult for some segment of the popul to vote. 

influenc of the polit activ 

It be no wonder wealthi american have a strong say in polici outcom 
– they vote presumably, for candid who best repres their 
interests. benjamin page and martin gilens, in a new studi call “test theori of american politics: elites, interest groups, and averag citizens”, 
find that “it make veri littl differ [in policy] what the gener 
public thinks.” such result be caus by inequ in polit 
activity. In thi way, the potenti for unequ outcom incentiv 
polit engag and, at the least, awar in order to assur 
respons governance. 

the role of money 

one of the most divis issu in campaign financ and in the theori 
of equal of polit opportun be the role of money. oppon of 
hard, soft, and shadow money contend the abil to contribut 
unlimit sum have a corrupt effect on politicians. propon of 
unlimit financi contribut argu polit fund be a provis 
of the freedom of speech: a person make a polit statement when 
donat money to a campaign or to an organ support a certain 
candidate. 

whatev the case, unlimit campaign contributions, in the form of 
hard, soft, or shadow money, creat inequ of polit opportunity. 
those who be well posit in the econom hierarchi immedi 
have a resourc advantag versu those who be poorli placed. 

three categori of polit activ 

We can divid polit activ into three categories: 

(1) vote 

(2) polit engag 

(3) monetari donat 

categori (1) and (2) be necessarili equal in that everyon have one 
vote and everyon have the abil to volunt in a campaign. money, 
however, be a not an equalizer. assum unlimit contributions, there 
be no initi equality. take thi example: there be two vote 
citizens, rob and joe, both of whom vote in everi elect and volunt 
on the campaign of their favorit candid (who happen to be 
competing). rob have an incom of $200,000 a year with a larg save 
account and be will to donat a substanti portion of thi year’ 
incom to candid R. joe, on the other hand, onli make $30,000 a year 
and need to save all that he can in order to put hi son through 
colleg and thu cannot contribut a much a he would like. that be not 
equal of opportunity. rob’ opportun be 6 time that of joe’ 
becaus of hi incom and, take account joe’ need to save, rob’ 
opportun be even higher. even if each person be limit to 
contribut 15% of total income, rob’ opportun to sway polit 
outcom be much high than joe’s. the problem with campaign 
contribut be a person’ financi success determin hi abil to 
alter polit outcomes. 

willing and abil 

with monetari contributions, there be two variabl affect 
equality: willing and abil to donate. categori (1) and (2) be 
limit to the sole variabl of willingness. In contrast, not everyon 
have the equal abil to donate. unlimit campaign contribut 
prohibit true equal of opportunity. there be some who argu 
polit engag be also subject to the variabl of abil – in 
thi case, the abil to alloc time to polit engagement. thi 
argument have merits. after all, retire and the affluent can afford to 
spend more time volunt on campaigns. however, with the advent of 
the internet and social media, it be a quick and easi process to be 
polit engaged. volunt can be do remot in the form of 
phone bank which can be do remot at ani reason time. with 
candid and office-hold websites, it be rel easi and take 
minut to write a messag to a politician. the same appli for 
facebook and twitter. status or tweet explain one’ support of a 
candid be simpl and easi way to voic support. these technolog 
advanc have help in reduc the use of time for polit 
engagement. 

campaign contribut 

To assur true equal in the abil to donate, contribut must 
be limit to a level equal to the low amount voter be will to 
give, a number that almost certainli will be $0. elimin campaign 
contribut restrict freedom of speech, necessarili limit one’ 
abil to impact polit outcomes. It seem equal of opportun 
and justifi unequ outcom cannot be attain at the same time. 

perfect equal be perhap unattainable, but we cannot ceas tri 
to creat equal in the polit system. A contribut limit should 
be enact and soft and shadow money ban a they creat overwhelm 
inequ of opportunity. the new limit may be base on ani number of 
factors. one possibl mean by which the limit be determin be to use 
the averag of the median contribut across a varieti of contests. 
anoth way be to survey a consortium of voter who reflect the 
demograph of activ voter and use the median of their willing to 
donat a the contribut limit. some public money should also be make 
avail to all candid and parti that achiev a certain 
threshold in the previou election. 

there be mani benefit to impos a limit on campaign contribut 
besid equal of opportunity. one other benefit be a polit 
candid will tend to court more voters. limit campaign 
contribut have a populist effect. 

equal of polit opportun be a basic tenet of democracy. It 
allow for all citizen to have equal potenti to sway polit 
outcom though the actual effect on polit outcom will vari base 
on polit activity. the introduct of money into the polit 
system open the possibl of destroy the equal of polit 
opportunity. A limit in polit contribut can actual have a 
populist effect becaus politician need to reach and appeal to more 
peopl in order to rais necessari funds. 

however, fail to ban soft and shadow money and establish more 
stringent regul on hard money can have a veri neg effect on 
the polit system. the continu of superpac and the infiltr 
of money into america’ democraci have advers effects. An 
extrapol of benjamin page’ studi point to the u.s. slowli 
evolv into an oligarchy. the continu of increas money into 
the polit system lead to barrier to entri in polit activity, 
either through dollar need to have a voic heard or through the 
elect of offici act in accord to the will of the wealthy. these 
elect offici may enact legisl that further obstruct 
polit engagement. thi facet of polit be evid in some state 
where barrier to vote alreadi have be erected. the effect of not 
limit money in polit could be dire.
