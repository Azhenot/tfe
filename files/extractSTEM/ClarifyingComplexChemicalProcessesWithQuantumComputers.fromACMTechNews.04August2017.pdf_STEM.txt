scienc and the IT industri have high hope for quantum computing, 
but descript of possibl applic tend to be vague. 
research at eth zurich have now come up with a concret 
exampl that demonstr what quantum comput will actual be 
abl to achiev in the future.

futur quantum comput will be abl to calcul the reaction mechan of the en- 

zyme nitrogenase. the imag show the activ centr of the enzym and a mathemati- 

cal formula that be central for the calculation. (visualisations: eth zurich)

specialist expect noth less than a technolog revolut from 
quantum computers, which they hope will soon allow them to solv 
problem that be current too complex for classic supercomputers. 
commonli discuss area of applic includ data encrypt and 
decryption, a well a special problem in the field of physics, quantum 
chemistri and materi research. 

but when it come to concret question that onli quantum comput can 
answer, expert have remain rel vague. research from eth 
zurich and microsoft research be now present a specif applic 
for the first time in the scientif journal pnas: evalu a complex 
chemic reaction. base on thi example, the scientist show that 
quantum comput can inde deliv scientif relev results. 

A team of research lead by eth professor marku reiher and matthia 
troyer use simul to demonstr how a complex chemic reaction 
could be calcul with the help of a quantum computer. To accomplish 
this, the quantum comput must be of a “moder size”, say matthia 
troyer, who be professor for comput physic at eth zurich and 
current work for microsoft. the mechan of thi reaction would be 
nearli imposs to ass with a classic supercomput alon – 
especi if the result be to be suffici precise. 

one of the most complex enzym 
the research chose a particularli complex biochem reaction a the 
exampl for their study: thank to a special enzym know a a 
nitrogenase, certain microorgan be abl to split atmospher nitrogen 
molecul in order to creat chemic compound with singl nitrogen 
atoms. It be still unknown how exactli the nitrogenas reaction works. “thi 
be one of the great unsolv mysteri in chemistry,” say marku 
reiher, professor for theoret chemistri at eth zurich. 

comput that be avail today be abl to calcul the behaviour of 
simpl molecul quit precisely. however, thi be nearli imposs for the 
nitrogenas enzym and it activ centre, which be simpli too complex, 
explain reiher. 

In thi context, complex be a reflect of how mani electron interact

with each other within the molecul over rel long distances. the 
more electron a research need to take into account, the more 
sophist the computations. “exist method and classic 
supercomput can be use to ass molecul with about 50 strongli 
interact electron at most,” say reiher. however, there be a significantli 
great number of such electron at the activ centr of a nitrogenas 
enzyme. becaus with classic comput the effort requir to evalu a 
molecul doubl with each addit electron, an unrealist amount of 
comput power be needed. 

anoth comput architectur 
As demonstr by the eth researchers, hypothet quantum 
comput with just 100 to 200 quantum bit (qubits) will potenti be abl 
to comput complex subproblem within a few days. the result of these 
comput could then be use to determin the reaction mechan of 
nitrogenas step by step. 

that quantum comput be capabl of solv such challeng task at 
all be partial the result of the fact that they be structur differ to 
classic computers. rather than requir twice a mani bit to ass 
each addit electron, quantum comput simpli need one more qubit. 

however, it remain to be see when such “moder large” quantum 
comput will be available. the current exist experiment quantum 
comput use on the order of 20 rudimentari qubit respectively. It will 
take at least anoth five years, or more like ten, befor we have 
quantum comput with processor of more than 100 high qualiti qubits, 
estim reiher. 

mass product and network 
research emphasis the fact that quantum comput cannot handl 
all tasks, so they will serv a a supplement to classic computers, rather 
than replac them. “the futur will be shape by the interplay between 
classic comput and quantum computers,” say troyer. 

with regard to the nitrogenas reaction, quantum comput will be abl to

comment 

calcul how the electron be distribut within a specif molecular 
structure. however, classic comput will still need to tell quantum 
comput which structur be of particular interest and should therefor 
be calculated. “quantum comput need to be thought of more like a co- 
processor capabl of take over particular task from classic computers, 
thu allow them to becom more efficient,” say reiher. 

explain the mechan of the nitrogenas reaction will also requir 
more than just inform about the electron distribut in a singl 
molecular structure; indeed, thi distribut need to be determin in 
thousand of structures. each comput take sever days. “in order 
for quantum comput to be of use in solv these kind of problems, 
they will first need to be mass produced, therebi allow comput to 
take place on multipl comput at the same time,” say troyer.
