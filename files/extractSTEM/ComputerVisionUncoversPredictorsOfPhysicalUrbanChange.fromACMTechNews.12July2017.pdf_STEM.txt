which neighborhood experi physic improvements? In thi 
paper, we introduc a comput vision method to measur chang 
in the physic appear of neighborhood from time-seri 
street-level imagery. We connect chang in the physic appear- 
anc of five US citi with econom and demograph data and 
find three factor that predict neighborhood improvement. first, 
neighborhood that be dens popul by college-educ 
adult be more like to experi physic improvements—an 
observ that be compat with the econom literatur link- 
ing human capit and local success. second, neighborhood with 
good initi appear experience, on average, larg posit 
improvements—an observ that be consist with “tipping” 
theori of urban change. third, neighborhood improv corre- 
late posit with physic proxim to the central busi dis- 
trict and to other physic attract neighborhoods—an obser- 
vation that be consist with the “invasion” theori of urban 
sociology. together, our result provid support for three classic 
theori of urban chang and illustr the valu of use comput 
vision method and street-level imageri to understand the physic 
dynam of cities.

neighborhood effect 

for more than a century, urban planners, economists, sociol-ogists, and architect have advanc theori connect the 
dynam of a neighborhood’ physic appear to it loca- 
tion, demographics, and built infrastructure. 

the tip theori of schell (1) and grodzin (2) suggest 
that neighborhood in bad physic condit will get progres- 
sive worse, wherea nicer area will get better. econom theo- 
rie of urban chang at the citi level often emphas popul 
densiti and educ (3–6), and it be natur to hypothes that 
agglomer of human capit will predict neighborhood-level 
improv a well. theori from urban sociology, such a 
the invas theori of burgess (7), however, emphas locat 
and social networks, predict that improv in a city’ 
appear should be spatial clustered, and that improv 
should occur both near the central busi district (cbds) and 
near other physic attract neighborhoods. 

To test theori of physic neighborhood change, we need 
to quantifi neighborhood appear at differ point in 
time. historically, however, method to quantifi neighborhood 
appear have not be scalable. the empir literatur on 
urban appearance, which be pioneer by urban planner such 
a lynch (8), rapoport (9), and nasar (10), a well a by psy- 
chologist such a milgram (11), have reli on interviews, low- 
throughput visual percept surveys, and manual evalu of 
images. those methods, however, can onli be use to collect data 
on a few neighborhood and have limit spatial resolution. In 
the past decade, new data on urban appear have emerg 
in the form of “street view” imageri (12). As of 2016, googl 
street view have photograph more than 3,000 citi from 106 

countri at the street level. recent approach to quantifi urban 
appearance, such a those of rundl et al. (13), hwang and 
sampson (14), and saless et al. (15), leverag thi larg onlin 
corpu of street-level imageri but still reli on manual data cura- 
tion, limit throughput. 

the appear of street-level imageri sourc have be par- 
allel by signific advanc in the field of comput vision. 
task such a automat classifi and label imag be 
now much easier, thank in part to the avail of more com- 
prehens train dataset and new machin learn algo- 
rithm (16). these advanc have lead to an emerg literatur at 
the intersect between comput vision, urban planning, urban 
sociology, and urban economics. 

In 2011, the massachusett institut of technolog (mit) 
place puls project (15) begin collect a massiv crowd- 
sourc dataset on urban appear by ask peopl to select 
imag from pair in respons to evalu question (such a 
“which place look safer?”). naik et al. (17) use the place puls 
data to train a comput vision algorithm call streetscor that 
accur predict human-deriv rate for the percept of a 
streetscape’ safeti (also see refs. 18 and 19). use streetscore,

We develop a comput vision method to measur chang 
in the physic appear of neighborhood from street- 
level imagery. We correl the measur chang with 
neighborhood characterist to determin which character- 
istic predict neighborhood improvement. We find that both 
educ and popul densiti predict improv in 
neighborhood infrastructure, in support of theori of human 
capit agglomeration. neighborhood with good initi 
appear experi more substanti upgrading, a pre- 
dict by the tip theori of urban change. finally, we 
observ more improv in neighborhood closer to both 
citi center and other physic attract neighborhoods, in 
agreement with the invas theori of urban sociology. our 
result show how comput vision techniques, in combin 
with tradit methods, can be use to explor the dynam 
of urban change.

determin of physic improv in neighborhoods. We 
use our data to test three theori of urban change. We find that, 
in agreement with econom theori of human capit agglomer- 
ation, neighborhood that be dens popul by highli edu- 
cat individu be more like to experi posit urban 
change. also, in agreement with the invas theori (7) of urban 
sociology, we find that neighborhood be more like to improv 
in physic appear when they be proxim to a cbd and/or 
other neighborhood perceiv a safe. finally, we find evid 
for a weak version of the neighborhood tip theori (1, 2), a 
the neighborhood that have the best appear at the begin- 
ning experienc the larg improv (however, we do not 
find that neighborhood with initi low score deteriorated— 
they just improv less). our find illustr how comput 
vision methods, togeth with demograph and econom data, 
can be use to studi physic urban change. 

data and method 
We obtain 360◦ panorama imag of streetscap from five 
US citi use the googl street view applic program 
interface. each panorama be associ with a uniqu identifi 
(“panoid”), latitude, longitude, and time stamp (which specifi 
the month and year of imag capture). We extract an imag 
cutout from each panorama by specifi the head and pitch 
of the camera rel to the street view vehicle. We obtain 
a total of 1,645,760 imag cutout for street block in balti- 
more, boston, detroit, new york, and washington, dc, cap- 
ture in 2007 (the “2007 panel”) and 2014 (the “2014 panel”).∗ 

We match imag cutout from the 2007 and 2014 panel by 
use their geograph locat (i.e., latitud and longitude) 
and by choos the same head and pitch. thi process give 
u imag that show the same place, from the same point of view, 
but in differ year (fig. 1 b–d).† 

We calcul the percept of safety—cal “streetscore”— 
for each imag use a variant of the naik et al. algorithm (17) 
train on a crowdsourc studi of people’ percept of safeti 
(15) base on 2,920 imag from boston and new york and 

∗for the street block that lack imag for either 2007 or 2014 we complet the 2007 
and 2014 panel use imag from the closest year for which data be available. As 
a result, 5% of the imag in the 2007 panel be from either 2008 or 2009. similarly, 
12% of the imag in the 2014 panel be from 2013. 
†we reduc our data to elimin pair contain over-exposed, blurred, or occlud 

imag (for details, see SI appendix). 

186,188 pairwis comparisons. the streetscor comput pro- 
ce includ three step (fig. 1a). first, we segment imag 
into four “geometric” classes: ground (which contain streets, 
sidewalks, and landscaping), buildings, trees, and sky (27). next, 
we creat featur vector character each geometr class 
use two imag features: gist (28) and texton map (29). 
roughli speaking, these featur encod the shape and tex- 
ture present in an image. finally, we use the featur of street 
and build to predict the streetscor of an imag use sup- 
port vector regress (30). We ignor the featur of tree 
and sky to minim season effect (weather, time of day, and 
time of year). the predict streetscor of a street view imag 
rang from 0 to 25, with 0 be the most unsafe-look street 
scene in the sampl and 25 the most safe-look scene. next, we 
comput chang in streetscor between imag in the 2007 
and 2014 panels, to obtain streetchang (fig. 1 b–d). A posi- 
tive valu of streetchang be indic of upgrad in physic 
appearance, wherea a neg valu of streetchang be indica- 
tive of decline. (for detail on the methods, see SI appendix.) 

We valid streetchang use three sources: a survey con- 
duct on amazon mechan turk (amt), a survey of grad- 
uat student in mit’ school of architectur and planning, 
and data from boston’ plan and develop author 
(bpda). 

particip give inform consent for all human subject stud- 
ies. experi be approv by the massachusett institut 
of technology’ committe on the use of human a exper- 
iment subject (mit couhes). the amt studi be con- 
duct in accord with the requir of mit couhes. 

We found strong agreement between streetchang and both 
(i) human assess and (ii) new urban development. In 
the amt validation, worker be present two imag pairs, 
drawn from a pool of 1,565, and ask to select the one 
show more physic change. the bin rank score pro- 
vide by the amt worker have a strong correl with abso- 
lute streetchang (spearman correl = 72%, P -value< 1 × 
10−5). In the school of architectur and plan student val- 
idat we present student with 150 imag pair and ask 
them to classifi imag into posit and neg physic chang 
(N =3). the student agre with streetchang in 74% of cases. 
finally, we collect build project data from bpda and corre- 
late streetchang with total new squar footag built per squar 
mile (at census-tract level) dure the sampl period (2012–

statistics, see tabl 1. 

result 
We begin by present the cross-sect demograph and 
econom correl of cities’ physic appear and chang 
in appearance, a estim by 2007 streetscor and streetchang 
between 2007 and 2014 (tabl 2). all regress includ citi 
fix effect and hold up in multivari specifications. addi- 
tionally, in all regress we have correct for spatial corre- 
lation in standard error follow conley (32) use stata 
routin develop by hsiang (33). for each censu tract we con- 
sider popul density, level of educ (share of colleg edu- 
cat adults), median income, hous price, rental costs, hous- 
ing vacancy, race, and poverty. from all of these variabl the two 
strong correl of percept of safeti be popul densiti 
and education, so we present a tabl (tabl 2) summar the 
coeffici of these two variables. (for a tabl with all control 
see SI appendix, tabl s4.) 

column 2 of tabl 2 show that streetscor improv by 0.74 
with the log of popul density. thi repres about one- 
quarter of an SD of streetscor (2.6). becaus streetscor be 

fig. 2. evid of neighborhood tipping: We test the tip model of 
neighborhood change. We group the data into 16 bin base on the initi 
valu of streetscor and plot the averag streetchang in each bin against 
the averag initi streetscore. 

roughli linear in log density, the overal relationship be concave, 
mean that perceiv safeti rise with densiti but the effect 
level off. thi fact lend some support to the idea that perceiv 
safeti increas with “ey on the street” (34). however, our find- 
ing do not impli that dens urban space be see a safer than 
low-dens suburban or rural areas, becaus we do not have such 
low-dens space in our sample. our result suggest onli that in 
five (gener dense) eastern US cities, space with high popula- 
tion densiti be perceiv a be safer than urban space with 
low popul densities. 

the second robust correl of perceiv safeti be educ 
(tabl 2, column 1). As the share of the popul with a col- 
lege degre increas by 20% (one sd), perceiv safeti rise by 
0.51, or one-sixth of an SD in streetscore. We suspect that the 
relationship reflect the tendenc of educ peopl to be will- 
ing to pay for neighborhood that appear safer, rather than the 
abil of educ resid to make a neighborhood feel safe. 

We now move to chang in physic appearance—th primari 
contribut of thi paper. column 4, 5, and 6 of tabl 2 show 
the correl between initi social characteristics, a mea- 
sure in the 2000 US census, and neighborhood streetchang 
a measur between 2007 and 2014. 

column 4 of tabl 2 examin education, again control 
for initi streetscore. the observ impact of educ on 
streetchang seem to be large. A one-sd increas in share with 
colleg degre in 2000 (20%) be associ with an increas in 
streetchang of 0.13, or about one-sixth of an sd. just a skill 
citi have do particularli well over the last 50 y, skill neigh- 
borhood seem to have experienc more physic improvement.

streetscore—a the log of densiti increas by 1 the growth in

fig. 3. the correl of physic upgrad in neighborhoods: posit urban chang occur in geograph and physic attract area with dense, 
highli educ populations, a illustr here for brooklyn, new york. 

densiti on the streetchang over a 7-i period be about 1/12 of the 
impact of log densiti on the level of streetscor in 2007. den- 
siti do seem to predict growth in streetscor over the sam- 
ple period, but the relationship be far weaker than the connec- 
tion between densiti and the level of streetscor in 2007. We 
do not find ani robust relationship between streetchang and 
median income, hous price, or rental costs; thi suggest that 
the educ effect be more like to reflect skill than incom 
(si appendix, tabl s4). 

the find that variabl that predict the level of streetscor 
in 2007 also predict the chang in streetscor between 2007 and 
2014 seem to support a posit feedback loop—th essenc of 
tip model (1, 2). tip be also suggest by the posit 
correl between 2007 streetscor and streetchange.‡ how- 
ever, we find a linear relationship, rather than the nonlinear rela- 
tionship suggest by the origin tip theori (2). moreover, 
tip model suggest that initi unattract neighborhood 
get bad over time—and that be not found in our data. the mean 
streetchang by decil of 2007 streetscor be posit even for 
the area with the low score (fig. 2). It be not clear whether 
thi repres tip or a pattern in which visual safer area 
be be upgrad first and faster. We suspect that the lack 
of downward movement may be particular to the time period 
under consideration. despit the great recession, 2007–2014 
be a rel good time period for mani of america’ eastern 
cities, and thi may explain whi we do not see declin even for 
less-attract neighborhoods. still, the data do show the overal 
pattern predict by tip models, in which upward growth be 
faster in initi good areas. 

next, we test for invas (7) by regress chang in 
streetscor on characterist of border neighborhood and 
proxim to the cbd, after control for the predictor identi- 
fie in tabl 2 (2007 streetscore, log of density, and education).§ 

the invas hypothesi be just one of the reason whi area may 
improv more when they have attract neighbors—perhap the 
most natur explan be just that area that be bad or bet- 
ter than their neighbor tend to mean-revert to the norm for 
their section of the city. We test for the import of loca- 
tion within the citi by look at the impact of proxim to the 
cbd. column 1 of tabl 3 show that a the distanc to the

cbd increas by 1 mile expect streetscor growth fall by 
0.04 points. appear upgrad be strong closer to the citi 
center, parallel kolko’ (36) find that econom gentrifica- 
tion be more pronounc closer to the citi center. 

the origin invas hypothesi postul a process under 
which low-incom area would gradual make their way out 
from the center to nearbi suburbs. the current pattern be instead 
one in which the central citi see particularli larg upgrad in 
perceiv street safety. one interpret be that we be cur- 
rentli wit the revers of the process describ by burgess 
(7): citi centers, which have alway have a strong fundament 
asset—proxim to jobs—ar experi physic chang that 
express a revers to that fundamental. 

although the data do not suggest decay eman out from a 
center, the core idea of the invas hypothesis—that neighbor- 
hood spill over into each other—i readili confirm in the data. 
column 1 of tabl 3 also show the effect of averag streetscor 
in surround area on streetchange. notably, the coeffici on 
neighbor score be more than doubl the impact of the neigh- 
borhood’ own score, impli that almost 1/10 of the streetscor 
differ between a neighborhood and it neighbor be elimi- 
nate over a 7-i period. becaus most of the movement over the 
sampl period be positive, the regress should be interpret 
a mean that growth be faster in area with more attract 
neighbors. thi strong converg be exactli the predict of 
the invas theory. 

column 2 of tabl 3 examin the effect of adjac den- 
sity. becaus adjac densiti be highli correl with adjac 
streetscore, it be not surpris to see that there be also a robust 
correl here, although the connect be not a strong a with 
adjac streetscores. column 3 of tabl 3 look at averag 
share of the popul with colleg degre in adjac areas. 
the relationship be posit and robust. As the share increas 
by 20%, streetscor increas by 0.12 points. thi again corrob- 
orat the result of kolko (36), who found that gentrif 
be faster in area with more educ neighbors. these find 
point to a process of neighborhood spillov and convergence, 
which are, in a sense, at the heart of the invas hypothesis.¶ 

¶in our work paper (37) we also look at the “filtering” hypothesis, which suggest 
the import of the age of the build stock: area should gradual declin until they 
be upgraded. To test the hypothesi that build age shape streetscap change, we 
regress streetchang on the share of the build stock (a of the year 2000) built 
dure differ decades, control for 2007 streetscore, log of density, and education. 
We found at best limit support for the filter hypothesi (si appendix, tabl s5).

fig. 3 illustr the relationship between location, education, 
popul density, and physic improv in neighborhood 
from brooklyn, new york. In SI appendix, figs. s9–s28 we pro- 
vide similar map visual for all citi in our dataset. 

conclus 
for decades, scholar from the social scienc and the humani- 
tie have discuss the import of urban appear and the 
factor that may contribut to physic urban change. here, we 
test theori of urban chang use streetchange, a metric for 
chang in urban appear obtain from street-level imageri 
with a comput vision algorithm. 

the data show that popul densiti and educ in both 
neighborhood and their surround area robustli predict 
improv in neighborhoods’ physic environments; other 
variabl show less correlation. the result also show strong sup- 
port for the invas hypothesi of neighborhood chang (7), 
which emphas spillov across neighborhoods. 

our work suggest sever open question for futur work. Is 
the correl between densiti and perceiv safeti true more 

generally, or do it mean-revert after a certain point? doe tip- 
ping appear when we examin citi with static or declin lev- 
el of streetscore? We hope that futur research, enabl in our 
part by our dataset and methods, can help address these ques- 
tion and continu explor the link between the physic citi 
and the human that resid there.
