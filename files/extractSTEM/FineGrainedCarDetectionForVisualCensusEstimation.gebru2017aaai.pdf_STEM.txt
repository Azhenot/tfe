abstract 

target socio-econom polici requir an accur under- 
stand of a country’ demograph makeup. To that end, 
the unit state spend more than 1 billion dollar a year 
gather censu data such a race, gender, education, oc- 
cupat and unemploy rates. compar to the tradi- 
tional method of collect survey across mani year which 
be costli and labor intensive, data-driven, machin learning- 
driven approach be cheaper and faster—with the potenti 
abil to detect trend in close to real time. In thi work, we 
leverag the ubiqu of googl street view imag and de- 
velop a comput vision pipelin to predict income, per caput 
carbon emission, crime rate and other citi attribut from a 
singl sourc of publicli avail visual data. We first detect 
car in 50 million imag across 200 of the larg US citi 
and train a model to predict demograph attribut use the 
detect cars. To facilit our work, we have collect the 
larg and most challeng fine-grain dataset report to 
date consist of over 2600 class of car compris of im- 
age from googl street view and other web sources, classi- 
fie by car expert to account for even the most subtl of vi- 
sual differences. We use thi data to construct the larg scale 
fine-grain detect system report to date. our predict 
result correl well with ground truth incom data (r=0.82), 
massachusett depart of vehicl registration, and sourc 
investig crime rates, incom segregation, per caput car- 
bon emission, and other market research. finally, we learn in- 
terest relationship between car and neighbourhood al- 
low u to perform the first larg scale sociolog analysi 
of citi use comput vision techniques. 

introduct 

mani govern and non-govern project be ded- 
icat to studi citi and their inhabitants. for exam- 
ple, the american commun survey (acs) collect data 
relat to the demograph makeup of the us, the en- 
vironment protect agenc gather data pertain to 
citi pollution, and privat organ such a car deal- 
ership gather inform regard the relationship be- 
tween car and demographics. traditionally, the most preva- 
lent method for obtain such personal, demograph and 
environment inform be through costli survey such 
a the US census, american commun survey (acs) and

other project conduct by dispar govern entities. 
however, the emerg of large, divers set of data gener- 
ate by peopl have enabl comput scientist and compu- 
tation sociologist to gain interest insight by analyz- 
ing massiv user text and social network (west et al. 2014; 
cheng, danescu-niculescu-mizil, and leskovec 2014). for 
instanc michel et al analyz over one million book and 
present result relat to the evolut of the english lan- 
guag a well a variou cultur phenomenon (michel et al. 
2011). and blumenstock et al use mobil phone data to 
predict poverti rate in rwanda (blumenstock, cadamuro, 
and On 2015). 

In contrast to textual data, the use of imag for compu- 
tation social scienc have be larg unexplored. A snap- 
shot of a street or neighborhood tell a detail stori of it 
socioeconom make up. however, while a few pioneer 
work have appli visual scene analysi techniqu to infer 
characterist of neighborhood and cities, they have be 
limit in scope and scale. jean et al use satellit imag 
featur to predict poverti rate in 5 african countri (jean 
et al. 2016). similarly, work from zhou et al, ordonez et al, 
naik et al and arietta et al use global imag featur from 
googl street view imag to learn variou neighborhood 
characterist (zhou et al. 2014; ordonez and berg 2014; 
naik et al. 2014; arietta et al. 2014). 

global imag features, however, contain limit informa- 
tion about individuals, neighborhood and cities. In contrast, 
affluenc (or lack thereof), culture, and even crime can be 
infer by observ houses, people, cloth style and 
type of car on the street. nineti five percent of american 
household own automobil (chase 2009), and a show 
by prior work (choo and mokhtarian 2004) car be a re- 
flection of their owners’ characterist provid signific 
person information. for instance, a larg number of tesla 
be a strong indic of a wealthi neighborhood. 

guid by thi intuit we develop a novel comput vi- 
sion pipelin to predict demograph variabl from googl 
street view images. We recogn car in 50 million imag 
from 200 of the larg american citi and use the detect 
car to predict income, segreg levels, per caput carbon 
emiss and crime rates. In addit to accur predict- 
ing ground truth data (e.g. pearson r=0.82 for income), we 
discov interest relationship between car and demo- 
graphic allow u to perform a sociolog studi of our

200 cities. for instance, we find that wealthi peopl drive 
foreign make car and that a larg quantiti of van be corre- 
late with high crime. 

while specif vehicl attribut can be associ with 
certain type of people, classifi differ type of car 
be a difficult comput vision task call fine-grain ob- 
ject recognition. In fine-grain recognit we seek to dis- 
tinguish between similar object such a differ type of 
cars, dog breed or cloth styles—a task that can even 
be challeng for humans. In thi work, we train a fast, 
larg scale fine-grain detect system abl to detect car 
in 50 million googl street view imag in less than 2 
weeks. To train our model we gather a fine-grain car 
dataset of unpreced scale. It have 2657 car class con- 
sist of nearli all car type produc in the world after 
1990: with a total of 700,000 imag from websit such a 
edmunds.com, cars.com, craigslist.com and googl street 
view (fig. 1). We make our dataset publicli avail and 
anticip it use by comput vision research focu on 
fine-grain recognition. 

finally, we use the detect car to train a model predict- 
ing socioeconom attribut such a incom and segreg 
levels. We show that from a singl sourc of publicli avail- 
abl visual data, googl street view images, we be abl to 
predict divers set of import societ inform typi- 
calli gather by differ entities. We not onli show good 
correl with socioeconom censu data but can also pre- 
dict inform absent from the censu such a citi pollu- 
tion levels, crime rates, incom segreg levels, vehicl 
registr and other data relat to cities.

A larg scale fine-grain car dataset 

In order to analyz societi via the car visibl in it, one 
must first creat a dataset of all possibl car we would like 
to study. however, thi pose a challenge. what be all of 
the car in the world, and how can we possibl collect data 
for each one of them? We cannot use exist dataset such 
a (deng et al. 2009) a they do not have an exhaust set 
of annot car images. To tackl thi problem, we lever- 
age exist knowledgebas of cars, download imag 
and data for roughli 18,000 differ type of car from the 
websit edmunds.com. We then group these car type into 
set of indistinguish class and collect more imag 
for each class from craigslist.com and cars.com. both web- 
site contain ground truth car imag from owner look to 
sell their cars. use amazon mechan turk (amt), we 
collect one bound box for each imag yield 2,657 
visual group of car for our analysis. A bound box be a

set of pixel coordin describ the locat of the imag 
contain the object of interest—in our case a car. 

however, these imag alon be not enough for an accu- 
rate studi of societi via car visibl on the street. To perform 
our social analysis, we need to recogn car appear in 
googl street view images. As show in (fig. 1), product 
shot imag typic focu on a singl car, central placed, 
and from divers viewpoints. googl street view images, 
on the otherhand, may contain multipl car per image, each 
of which can be occlud and low resolution. thi present 
a challeng for an automobil recognit system. thus, a 
part of our fine-grain car dataset we also collect bound- 
ing box for nearli 400,000 car in street view images. 
these be annot by expert human label with one 
of the 2,657 fine-grain classes, provid u with data to 
train detector and classifi effect on real-world images. 
In tab. 1 we present aggreg statist of our fine-grain 
car dataset, which have a total of 712,430 imag and 382,591 
bound boxes. 

what do thi data look like? We analyz our car class 
in fig. 2. At the most fine-grain level of car year and trim, 
differ between class becom extrem subtle. A plot 
of the class distribut further show that product imag 
have coverag over a wide varieti of class while the street 
view distribut be much more skewed. finally, to perform 
our visual census, we collect 50 million googl street 
view images, sampl 8 million gp point in 200 larg 
US citi everi 25m. imag from 6 camera rotat be 
captur per gp point. 

fine-grain detect and classif 

We train a model to distinguish car in googl street view 
imag in 2 steps. first, we local part of the imag hav- 
ing a high likelihood of contain a car; thi be the gener 
car detect step. then we take the region with the high 
likelihood and classifi the type of car they contain use a 
custom convolut neural network (cnn). 

car detect 

our goal here be to train a model that can effici and ac- 
curat detect car in 50 million imag with reason 

accuracy. To thi end, we be will to sacrific a cou- 
ple of percent in accuraci to significantli speed up train 
and test times. thus, although the current state-of-the-art 
for object detect be faster r-cnn (girshick 2015) we 
choos the simplic and effici of deform part mod- 
els(dpm) (felzenszwalb et al. 2010) for our task of larg 
scale car detection. after extens cross validation, we de- 
cide upon a singl compon dpm with 8 parts, achiev 
an averag precis (ap) of 64.2% at 5 second per street 
view image. given an input image, our train dpm out- 
put bound box of vari size in the imag with as- 
sociat score reflect the likelihood of contain a car. 
with thi architecture, we detect car on our entir dataset 
in less than two week with 200 2.1 ghz cpu cores. 

To further improv detect performance, we leverag 
knowledg of car distribut in street view images. thi 
be do by introduc a prior on the locat and size of 
predict bound boxes. concretely, we model the distri- 
bution of street view car in imag a a histogram over 
three variables: the x coordin of the center of the bound- 
ing box, the y coordin of the center, and log(area) where 
area be the area of the bound box. We divid each vari- 
abl into 20 bin result in a total of 8,000 bin in the 
histogram, and estim the probabl of each bin use 
bound box statist in the street view train data. We 
add a pseudo count of 1 in each bin for regularization. with 
P (x, y, log (area)) denot thi histogram, we augment 
each dpm detect score by: 

score 

dpm+loc = scoredpm+↵ log (P (x, y, log (area))) 
(1) 

where ↵ be a learn weight on the locat prior. thi im- 
prof detect AP by 1.92 at a neglig time cost. dure 
analysis, dpm score be convert into estim probabil- 
iti via isoton regress (barlow et al. 1972), learn on 
the valid set. the final output of the detect step pro- 
vide u with a set of bound box with vari size and 
locat in an image, and the probabl that each of these 
box contain a car. 



car classif 

To classifi the detect car into one of 2,657 fine-grain 
classes, we use a convolut neural network with an ar- 
chitectur follow (krizhevsky, sutskever, and hinton 
2012). We choos thi architectur for it effici in- 
stead of state-of-the-art fine-grain classif system 
like (kraus et al. 2015b; 2015a). discrimin learn 
method includ cnn work best when train on data 
from a similar distribut a the test set (in our case, street 
view images) (ben-david et al. 2007). however, the pro- 
hibit cost of label mani street view imag for each of 
our 2,657 categori prevent u from have enough train- 
ing data from thi source. instead, we train our cnn on a 
combin of street view and the more plenti and inex- 
pensiv label product shot images. We make three mod- 
ific to the tradit cnn train procedur to im- 
prove our classifi performance. 

first, we seek to prevent our classifi from overfit on 
product shot imag sinc they be a much larg fraction of 
our train set. inspir by domain adapt works, we 
approxim the weight method of daum (daumé 
iii 2007) by duplic each street view exampl 10 time 
dure training. thi roughli equal the number of prod- 
uct shot and street view train images. next, we appli 
transform to product shot imag to make them sim- 
ilar to those from street view. thi decreas the distanc 
between train and test data distributions, improv 
classifi performance. car in product shot imag occupi a 
much larg number of pixel in the imag (fig. 1) than those 
in street view. To compensate, we first measur the dis- 
tribut of bound box resolut in street view train- 
ing images. At train time, we dynam downsiz each 
product shot imag accord to thi distribut and rescal 
it to fit the input dimens of the cnn. resolut be 
parameter by the geometr mean of the bound box 
width and height, and the probabl distribut be give a 
a histogram over 35 differ such resolutions. 

A further challeng in classifi street view imag be 
that the input to our cnn consist of noisi bound box 
output by the previou detect step. thi stand in con- 
trast to the default classifi input—ground truth bound 
box that be tight around each car. To tackl thi challenge, 
we use our valid data to measur the distribut of in- 
tersect over union (iou) overlap between ground truth 
bound box and those produc by our car detector. for 
each street view bound box input to the cnn, we ran- 
domli sampl it sourc imag accord to thi iou distri- 
bution, simul noisi detect dure training. 

At test time, each detect bound box be input to the 
cnn, and we perform a singl forward pa to get the soft- 
max probabl specifi the likelihood of contain a 
car belong to each of the 2,657 categories. In practice, 
we onli keep the top 20 predictions, sinc store a full 
2,657-dimension float point vector for each bound 
box be prohibit expensive. On average, these top 20 pre- 
diction account for 85.5% of the softmax layer probabl 
mass. We also note that, after extens code optim to 
make thi classif step a fast a possible, we be pri- 
marili limit by the time spent read imag from disk,

analyz classif perform 

fine-grain classif across 2,657 class be a chal- 
leng task even for expert humans. our cnn achiev 
a remark classif accuraci of 31.27%, on ground 
truth bound boxes, and 33.27% on true posit dpm 
detections. sinc our model will not alway be accur at 
thi level of granularity, we close examin it errors. some 
type of mistak can undermin the accuraci of our visual 
censu where a other do not matter. for example, mis- 
classifi a 2001 honda accord LX a a 2001 honda ac- 
cord DX do not affect our social analysis. but incorrectli 
classifi a 2012 bmw 3-seri a a 1996 honda accord 
could serious impact the qualiti of our results. We list clas- 
sific accuraci for variou car attribut in tab. 2. We 
can classifi these car properti with much high accura- 
cie than the 2,657-way classification, indic that error 
significantli impact the visual censu be rare. We zoom 
in on the bodi type attribut in fig. 3 and observ that most 
error be between highli similar bodi types; e.g. sedan and 
coupe, or extend and crew cab trucks.

visual censu of citi and neighborhood 

use the output of our car classifier, we can answer divers 
question rang from which citi have the most expens 
car (new york, NY - $11,820.62), high percentag of 
hummer (el paso, TX - 0.39%), high percentag of for- 
eign car (san francisco, CA - 60.02%) or low percent- 
age of foreign car (casper wyom - 21%). We calcul 
these valu by take the expect of the variou car at- 
tribut across all imag in each city. the averag number 
of instanc of a particular car in a region be the sum of the 
expect number of instanc of that car across all imag in 
the region. thus, comput the averag number of car with 
a particular attribut in a citi (or zip code) consist of calcu- 
late thi expect for each imag in the region and ag- 
gregat thi valu over all imag in the citi (or zip code). 

with I an imag and c one of the 2,657 classes, we calcu- 
late the expect number of car of type c in a singl imag 

a 
e[#class c|i] = 

X 

bbox b 

P (car|b, i)p (class c|car, b, I) (2) 

where bbox b be the set of all detect car bound box 
in the citi (or zip code), P (car|b, I) be the probabl of a 
bound box conta a car (determin by our detect 
system) and P (class c|car, b, I) correspond to the condi- 
tional probabl output by the softmax layer of our cnn 
classifier. 

To obtain the expect valu of a particular car attribute, 
e.g. the percentag of hummer in a region, we aggreg 
categori level expect for all class whose make be 
hummer. We follow thi setup in all other experiments, and 
note that a similar procedur can be use to find expect 
valu for ani other car attribute, includ car price, mile 
per gallon, and countri of origin. 

To estim the accuraci of our city-level car attribut 
predictions, we compar the distribut of car we de- 
tect in street view imag with the distribut of regis- 
tere car in boston, worcest and springfield, MA (the 
three massachusett citi in our dataset). We perform thi 
comparison use record from massachusett dmv, the 
onli state to publicli releas extens vehicl registr 
data (dmv 2014). We measur the pearson correl co- 
effici between each detect and regist make’ dis- 
tribut across zip codes. twenti five of the top thirti 
make have a pearson’ r correl of r>0.5. beyond mas- 
sachusetts, we measur the correl between our detect 
car make distribut and the 2011 nation distribut of 
car make a r=0.97, verifi the efficaci of our approach. 

car attribut can reveal aspect of a city’ charact that 
be not directli car-related. for example, our measur 
show burlington, vermont to be the greenest city, with the 
high averag mile per gallon (mpg) of ani citi in our 
dataset (averag mpg=25.34). burlington be also the first 
citi in the unit state to be power by 100% renew- 
abl energi (pb 2015). In contrast, we measur the low- 
est averag mpg for casper, WY (averag mpg=21.28). 
wyom be the high coal-min state in the us, produc- 
ing 39 percent of the nation’ coal in 2012 and emit the 
high rate of co2 per person in the countri (eia 2015b). 
We aggreg these city-level statist by state to discov 
pattern across the country. for example, by map our 
detect averag mpg for each state in fig. 5, we can see 
that coastal state be greener than inland ones, a find that 
agre with publish carbon footprint (eia 2015a) (r=- 
0.66 between our calcul mpg and carbon footprints).

tanc a a similar metric. moran’ I of 1, -1 and 0 in- 
dicat total segregation, no segreg and a random pat- 
tern of segreg respectively. To gain further insight 
we visual statist signific cluster of expens 
and cheap car use the getis-ord statistic, a more local 
measur of spatial autocorrel (geti and ord 1992; 
ord and geti 1995). fig. 4 show our result for 22 citi 
with dens gp sampling. 

chicago be the most segreg city, with two larg clus- 
ter of expens and cheap car on the west and east 
side of the citi respectively. conversely, jacksonvil be the 
least segreg citi with a moran I onli 33% a larg 
a chicago’ and exhibit littl cluster of expens and 
cheap cars. As show in fig. 4B and fig. 4c, chicago’ 
cluster of expens and cheap car fall in high and low 
incom neighborhood respectively. our result agre with 
find from the martin prosper institut (florida and 
melland 2015), rank chicago, IL and philadelphia, PA 
among the most segreg and jacksonville, FL among the 
least segreg american cities. 

our segreg analysi suggest that we can train a 
model to accur predict a region’ incom level from 
the properti of it cars. To thi end we first repres each 
zip code by an 88 dimension vector compris of car- 
relat attribut such a the averag mpg, the percentag 
of each bodi type, the averag car price and the percent- 
age of each car make in the zip code. We then use 18% of 
our data to train a ridg regress model (hoerl and ken- 
nard 1970) predict median household incom from car 
features. remarkably, our model achiev a citi level corre- 
lation of r=0.82 and a zip code level correl of r=0.70 
with ground truth incom data obtain from ac (ac 
2012) (p<1e-7). 

investig the relationship between incom and in- 
dividu car attribut show a high correl between 
median household incom and the averag car price in a 
zip code (r=0.44, p<< 0.001). As expected, wealthi peo- 
ple drive expens cars. perhap surprisingli however, we 
found the most posit correl car attribut with in- 

come to be the percentag of foreign manufactur car 
(r=0.47). In agreement with our results, experian automo- 
tive’ 2011 rank show that all of the top 10 car model 
prefer by wealthi individu be foreign, even when 
the car itself be compar cheap (e.g. honda accord 
or toyota camry) (muller 2015). 

follow the same procedure, we predict burglari rate 
for citi in our test set and achiev a pearson correl of 
0.61 with ground truth data obtain from (reloc es- 
sential 2015). while one of the best indic of crime be 
the percentag of van (r=0.30 for total crime against peo- 
ple and properties), the singl best predictor of unsaf zip 
code be the number of car per imag (r=0.31 and r=0.36 for 
crime against peopl and properti respectively). accord- 
ing to studi conduct by law enforcement, mani crime 
be commit in area with a high densiti of car such a 
park lot (smith 1996), and some depart be help- 
ing design neighborhood with a low number of park 
car on the street in order to reduc crime (neviu 2011). 

conclus 

through our analysi of 50 million imag across 200 cities, 
we have show that car detect from googl street view 
imag contain predict inform about our neighbor- 
hoods, citi and their demograph makeup. To facilit 
thi work, we have collect the larg and most challeng- 
ing fine-grain dataset report to date and use it to train 
an ultra larg scale car detect model. use our system 
and a singl sourc of visual data, we have predict in- 
come levels, crime rates, pollut level and gain insight 
into the relationship between car and people. In contrast to 
our autom method which quickli determin these vari- 
ables, thi data be tradit collect through costli and 
labor intens survey conduct over multipl years. and 
while our method us a singl sourc of publicli avail-
