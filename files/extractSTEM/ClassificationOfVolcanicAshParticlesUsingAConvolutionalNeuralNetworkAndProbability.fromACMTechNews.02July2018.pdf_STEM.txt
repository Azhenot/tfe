classif of volcan ash 
particl use a convolut 
neural network and probabl 
daigo shoji1, rina noguchi2,5, shizuka otsuki3 & hideitsu hino4 

analys of volcan ash be typic perform either by qualit classifi ash particl by eye or 
by quantit parameter it shape and texture. while complex shape can be classifi through 
qualit analyses, the result be subject due to the difficulti of categor complex shape into 
a singl class. although quantit analysi be objective, select of shape paramet be required. 
here, we appli a convolut neural network (cnn) for the classif of volcan ash. first, 
we defin four basal particl shape (blocky, vesicular, elongated, rounded) gener by differ 
erupt mechan (e.g., brittl fragmentation), and then train the cnn use particl compos 
of onli one basal shape. the cnn could recogn the basal shape with over 90% accuracy. use the 
train network, we classifi ash particl compos of multipl basal shape base on the output of 
the network, which can be interpret a a mix ratio of the four basal shapes. cluster of sampl 
by the averag probabl and the intens be consist with the erupt type. the mix ratio 
output by the cnn can be use to quantit classifi complex shape in natur without categor 
forcibl and without the need for shape parameters, which may lead to a new taxonomy. 

the shape of volcan ash particl depend on the erupt type. therefore, by analyz ash shape, we can 
good understand the physic mechan of volcan eruptions, which can help to mitig volcan hazards. 
classif of volcan ash particl have tradit be perform visually1–3. although human can recog- 
nize and categor complex shape qualit without carri out calculations, due to bia and differ 
in level of experience, the result of such classif be often subjective. when we classifi objects, they be typi- 
calli categor into a singl class that be independ from other classes. however, the shape of natur object 
such a volcan ash be often too complex to categor into a singl class, even for experienc people. 

In order to solv thi problem, object method use shape paramet have be used4–14. shape param- 
eter be defin to quantit repres ash shape by combin geometr valu such a perimet and 
area8–14. onc the paramet be defined, the shape of an ash particl can be classifi by calcul the parame- 
ter in an object way that be free from human bias. coupl with improv in instrument for imag ash 
particl and calcul shape parameters, quantit analysi have becom regard a effect for classifi 
volcan ash shape. for example, the morpholog g3stm (malvern instrumentstm) can rapidli measur the shape 
paramet and intens of more than one thousand particles15, which be veri use for volcan ash analysis9. 

however, one problem with quantit analysi by parameter be the select of the paramet use 
to repres the ash shape correctly8, becaus the shape of volcan ash be usual so complex that it cannot be 
describ use onli a singl parameter. although instrument such a the morpholog can calcul paramet 
automatically, we still have to choos the shape paramet to be used. thu far, mani shape parameters, includ- 
ing fractal dimension, have be use for good understand and classifi ash shapes8–14. while quantit 
analysi be object onc the paramet be decided, defin and select effect paramet be difficult. In 
order to ass the effect parameters, statist analysi (multivari and discrimin analyses) have be 
performed8,13, which can reduc the number of parameters. however, prior to the statist analyses, we have to

select a limit number of shape parameters. In addition, it be uncertain whether the qualiti of the particles, such 
a complic surfac texture, be parameter in suffici detail. 

recently, in the field of machin learning, convolut neural network (cnns) have be util for shape 
recognit with great success16–18. A cnn contain layer that convolv the pixel intens and send the convo- 
lute signal to the next layer. finally, the last (fully-connected) layer of the cnn output the probabl that the 
object be evalu fall into each class. each layer contain weight that be updat dure train by min- 
imiz a loss function. If train be perform effectively, a cnn can often recogn object with an accuraci 
compar to that of humans. one advantag of cnn be that we do not have to defin complic paramet 
to repres shape becaus the network automat learn to categor object dure training. moreover, 
onc the cnn be trained, we can share the network and use it to categor new objects. thus, cnn have a larg 
potenti to improv volcan ash analysi by elimin the individu bia associ with visual analysi and 
the difficulti in choos shape paramet that can effect discrimin ash particl shapes. here, we demon- 
strate thi idea by classifi volcan ash particl gener by differ type of erupt use a cnn. 

prepar of particl imag 
locat of samples. In thi work, we consid volcan ash gener by three erupt types: mag- 
matic, phreatomagmatic, and rootless (tabl 1). magmat erupt be caus by the vapor of volatil con- 
tain in ascend magma by pressur release. If ascend magma make contact with extern water such a 
ground water, thi type of erupt be call a phreatomagmat eruption. while magmat and phreatomagmat 
erupt be induc by magma ascend through the conduit, rootless erupt be caus by the interact 
between lava and wet ground at the surface19. when lava flow on the wet ground, water in the substrat vapor 
and the pressur rise dramat between the lava flow and the substrate, which induc an explosion. due to 
the repeat overlap of activ lava flow on water-satur substrate, further explos occur. 

the locat where the ash particl be collect be show in fig. 1. everi volcano in thi studi be a 
monogenet basalt volcano that have a similar bulk composit and phenocryst mode (tabl 2). funabara, 
hachikuboyama, hachinoyama, inatori, and sukumoyama (sampl id begin with fn, hk, hn, IT and SK in 
tabl 1, respectively) be scoria cone in izu peninsula, which be form in the late quaternary20. whole sam- 
ple from miyakejima (id begin with MJ and np) be gener by the erupt in 1983. the erupt begin 
from the flank of the mountain (oyama) and then propag to the summit and the coastal area through a fis- 
sure vent system21. sampl with id begin with MJ and NP be fire fountain deposit and phreatomagmat 
surg deposit (at an outcrop of nippana tuff ring), respectively. sampl from myvatn (id begin with my) be 
product of explos lava-wat interact i.e., rootless eruption, which occur in 2170 ± 38 cal yr bp22. thi 
explos interact creat a conic edific (known a a rootless cone) through the eject of fragment lava 
and water-satur sediments.

FN and NP sampl be collect from sever layer at the outcrop (fig. 1). except for mj16102402 and 
mj16102403, everi particl be sampl from constitu materi of pyroclast cones. exampl of microscop 
imag of the volcan ash particl be show in fig. 1. each sampl be siev use screen after dri in an

vide in the supplementari information. 

particl imaging. becaus a larg number of particl imag be requir to train a cnn, we use the 
morpholog g3stm (malvern instruments) to imag volcan ash particles15. morpholog be an autom particl 
analyz that can detect the posit and measur the size and shape paramet of thousand of particl in ten 
of minutes15. the imag take by morpholog be two-dimension project of particl dispers on a glass 
plate. In thi study, we use particl with grain size of 2φ to 3φ (125 μm to 250 μm in diameter) becaus they 
exist in suffici quantiti for train a cnn and statist analysis. To place the volcan ash particl on the 
glass plate, we use a sampl dispers unit (sdu) with an inject pressur of 1.5 bar and an inject time of 
20 ms. We measur particl a 5 × magnif becaus thi be the most suitabl magnif to obtain the 
high-resolut shape of the particles9. dure the measurement, the illumin be set to diascop (bottom 
lighting) under automat light calibr (calibr intens of 80.00 and intens toler of 0.20). the 
threshold for background separ (0 to 255) be set at 80 in order to obtain a sharp focus. the measur 
last approxim 40 min for each sample. among the measur particl images, some be unsuit for use 
and be exclud by visual inspection: imag contain dust and imag of overexposed, non-isolated, or 
cut-off particles. To train the cnn, we resiz everi imag to 50 × 50 pixel use th-makerx (http://www5.

rounded23,24. consid these studies, we appli four typic basal shape for volcan ash particles: blocky, 
vesicular, elongated, and round (exampl be show in fig. 2). blocki particl be close to rectangular, with 
rel straight and nearli right-angl edges. vesicular particl have a concav and irregular shape. elong 
particl be rel long and thin. round particl have a rel smooth and round shape caus by 
surfac tension within a fluid droplet befor they cool. 

the origin of each particl shape depend on the erupt mechanism8,12,25. blocki and vesicular particl 
reflect fragment and quench of magma, while elong and round shape be relat to ductil defor- 
mation24. In magmat eruption, blocki particl be gener form due to brittl fragment of magma in 
the volcan conduit and on the ground surface. vesicular particl be form by ruptur of vesicul magma 
in the conduit dure explos eruption. On the other hand, fragment magma that have a low enough viscos 
to deform form either elong particl due to stretch or round particl due to the effect of surfac ten- 
sion. phreatomagmat and rootless explos occur due to rapid heat transfer from magma to water, which pro- 
duce explos vapor and result in brittl fragmentation1,23. blocki and vesicular particl be gener 
by the quench of such magma fractures. On the other hand, ductil deform of magma be caus by the 
fluid instabl at the interfac between magma and water11,23. elong and round particl with a smooth 
surfac be form by the effect of surfac tension dure the time when the viscos of magma be low. round 
particl with a rough and cauliflower-lik surfac be form when the surfac of magma clast cool faster than 
the effect of surfac tension26. our sampl consist of juvenil volcan ash and phenocrysts, which do not receiv 
weather or hydrotherm alter that could be count a blocki or rounded. most of the phenocryst have 
a blocki shape (plagioclase, pyroxene, magnetite, and olivine). 

train of cnn 
mix ratio determin by cnn. although the four class defin abov be the characterist shape 
of the particl in our samples, a singl particl be often a mixtur of more than two basal shapes. thi be becaus 
volcan ash particl be gener by multipl process dure fragment of magma and transport of pyro- 
clasts, which have sever compon such a melt and crystals. thus, there be mani particl with a complex 
shape that should not be forc into a singl class becaus not onli do the classif becom subject but 
the properti of the neglect class be discarded. 

one of the properti of a cnn be that it can output probabl that a singl particl fall into each class. 
for example, if a particl have primarili one basal shape, the correspond class probabl will be high and the 
probabl of the other class will be veri low. On the other hand, in the case of particl compos of multipl 
basal shapes, two or more class will have a rel high probability. thus, these probabl can be use to 
quantit express the mix ratio of basal shape present in a singl particle, which be an imposs task for 
humans. therefore, we first train the cnn use particl compos of onli one of the four basal shape be 
consid (i.e., pure shapes). then, use the train cnn, the probabl for all four shape be calcul 
for everi particl in the samples. 

select of basal imag for training. We visual select imag of particl that have onli one basal 
shape, a show in fig. 2, without ani qualit thresholds. Of the approxim 15,000 ash imag acquired, 
the number of imag correspond to particl compos of onli blocky, vesicular, elong and round 
shape be 245, 239, 248 and 245, respect (everi particl imag we select be give at https://www.research- 
gate.net/publication/324495337_training_particle_images_for_classification_of _volcanic_ash_particles_ 
using_a_convolutional_neural_network_and_probability). these basal imag be use to train the cnn. 

although the purpos of thi work be to classifi particl shape without have to select shape parameters, 
in order to verifi the shape of the particl in the basal images, we measur the averag characterist shape 
paramet (aspect ratio, convexity, high sensit (hs) circularity, and solidity) of the basal images, a show 
in tabl 3 (definit and method be show in the supplementari information). elong particl have a low 
aspect ratio, and round one have high circularity, which be consist with the definit of these classes. 
vesicular particl be less circular compar with other class becaus we select particl that have large-scal 
concav a the vesicular class. particl of the blocki class have a larg aspect ratio and small circular 
compar with those belong to the elong and round classes, respectively. thus, the basal imag we 
select visual be distinguish rel well. 

Of these images, we use 200 imag for each class a the train images, and the rest of the imag be 
place in the test set for evalu of the network accuracy. the test imag be not use for tune of cnn. 
after the train of each epoch, the accuraci of the network be evalu base on how mani test imag be 
categor into the correct classes. although we also calcul the accuraci use the train images, the accu- 
raci by the test imag be more import to evalu the robust of the cnn.

structur and train of cnn. train and test be perform use the kera packag (https:// 
keras.io), which be free and write in python27. the structur of the cnn use in thi studi be show in fig. 3. 
the imag of the volcan ash particl use be 50 × 50 pixels, and the pixel intens be normal to 
between 0 and 1 and use a the input signal of the cnn. first, the pixel intens valu be convolut use 
5 × 5 kernels. the number of kernel be set to 30, and thu 30 convolut map compos of 46 × 46 block 
be generated. although we tri train sever models, and specif investig the effect of imag pad- 
ding (includ extra space around the images), the accuraci chang littl becaus our network have onli one 
convolut layer and the detail featur around the imag boundari be not so import for the four basal 
shapes. thus, imag padding, which be import for deeper network with mani convolut layers, be not 
consid in thi work. the convolut map be pool use a 2 × 2 max pool layer, which result in 23 × 23 
block maps. the pool layer, which remov the effect of trivial movement of object in imag and increas 
the robust of the network to displac of objects, have a stride equal to the length of the filter and select 
the maximum valu in each area (2 × 2 block). after the pooling, the signal be sent to an affin layer, and then 
the probabl for each of the four class be calculated. 

one of the most seriou problem for neural network be overfitting, which happen when a network be tune 
onli for the train data and do not gener well to unseen data (accuraci be high onli on the train set). 
In the present study, the number of train imag be small, which be a common caus of overfitting. thus, in 
order to avoid overfitting, we add 50% dropout layer befor the affin layers. A dropout layer randomli sever 
a specifi percentag of interlay connect of the network dure each train iteration, which reduc 
the complex of the network and thu prevent overfitting28. In the test phase, although everi connect be 
used, signal be scale by the ratio of the cut of the connection28. the mini-batch size be set to 200 (in one 
epoch, 200 imag be select randomli from the 800 train images) and the number of iter in one epoch 
to updat the weight of each layer be 20 (updat of weight use 200 mini-batch imag be conduct 20 
time per epoch)27. the initi valu of the weight be set use a glorot uniform initializer, in which number 
be distribut uniformli within the rang depend on the layer number29. gradient descent with an adam 
optimizer30 be use to updat the weights. the probabl and loss function be calcul use the softmax 
and cross-entropi functions, respectively, in the kera library. 

becaus the number of imag be small, in order to avoid overfitting, 200 imag in one mini-batch select 
in one epoch be rotated, flip horizont and shift in one of four direct randomli at the start of each 
epoch. thi procedur can increas the number of the train imag virtually, even though the exact number 
do not chang from 800. the rang of the rotat angl be -180 degre to 180 degrees, and the maximum 
amount of shift be 10%. one imag be augment by the combin of these oper in keras27. the angl 
and width of rotat and shift be determin randomli within the maximum range, and flip occur 
randomly. thus, one epoch correspond to select of one mini-batch, data augmentation, and then 20 iter 
of weight updates. after one epoch, a new mini-batch be select and the same process be conducted. We 
train the cnn until the loss function and the accuraci becom stable.

accuraci of cnn. the loss function and network accuraci a a function of epoch be show in fig. 4. As 
the epoch number increases, the loss function use mini-batch decreas and the train and test accuraci 
increase. from the 80th epoch, the loss function becom stable, so we decid to run 100 epochs. dure train- 
ing, the train loss be high than the test loss (fig. 4). thi be becaus the regular mechan of the 
dropout layer be turn off at test time27. We confirm that the train loss and the test loss (and the accu- 
racies) becom the same if the two dropout layer be removed. the accuraci of the cnn after 100 epoch be 
evalu from test imag to be approxim 92% (fig. 4b). becaus initi valu of layer and the mini-batch 
be determin randomly, we train the cnn sever times, and confirm that the correspond chang in 
accuraci be negligible. 

We also conduct train with a small number of the train imag (the number of the test imag do not 
change). In the case of 100 imag per class (400 imag total), the accuraci of the network be approxim 
90%. approxim 90% accuraci could often be achiev even with 50 imag per class, and it decreas to

~86% at 20 train imag per class. thus, the minimum number requir for classif of our data set be 
50 per class (200 total) in order to achiev ~90% accuracy. becaus the imag take by morpholog have a rela- 
tive simpl shape (onli four class and the complic surfac textur be not shown), a suffici number of 
train imag be gener by augment (rotating, shifting, and flipping) even though the number of the 
origin imag be small. when the train data be not augmented, the accuraci be onli ~80%, even with 
200 imag per class, and overfit occurred. thus, in the case of data without augmentation, mani more imag 
(perhap more than one thousand per one class) be needed. We note that the requir number of imag strongli 
depend on the structur of the network and the imag themselves. If we be to consid the complic 
pattern in, for example, scan electron microscopi (sem) images, mani imag would be required, which be 
beyond the scope of thi work. 

mix ratio of particles. use the train network, we calcul the probabl for each of the four 
class for everi particl in the data set. exampl of probabl calcul by the train cnn be show in 
fig. 5. If these particl be primarili compos of two basal shapes, the probabl for two class be rela- 
tive high, while onli one probabl be high for the particl compos of onli one basal shape (e.g., fig. 5g). In 
the case of fig. 5h, three shape be mixed, so the probabl of the vesicular class be rel low compar 
with the particl in fig. 5a and b. however, we note that not everi combin of class be observ in our 
analyses. the round class be found to mainli mix with the blocki class. In addition, the number of particl 
compos of three basal shape (e.g., fig. 5h) be small. the round particl select a train imag have 
a high aspect ratio and circularity, which be in contrast to the elong and vesicular shape (tabl 3), i.e., the 

figur 4. (a) loss function and (b) train and test accuraci a a function of epoch number. 

figur 5. exampl of ash particl with complex shape and correspond class probabl for each of the 
four basal shapes: B (blocky), V (vesicular), E (elongated) and R (rounded). the probabl can be interpret 
a the mix ratio of the four basal shapes.

round shape be exclus from vesicular and elong shape by definit of the classes. thus, the probabl 
of the round shape be not often found in combin with the vesicular and elong shape with high 
probability. 

In thi work, the train imag be select from the large-scal structur of the particle, and thu some 
basal imag contain small-scal structur such a concavity. thus, uncertainti due to the effect of the small-scal 
structur could not be remov complet in evalu the mix ratio. for example, even though some par- 
ticl have shallow or small concav (e.g., fig. 5e,d and j), the vesicular class probabl for these particl be 
low. thi be becaus we defin the vesicular shape to be an irregular outlin and concav that can be recogn 
a a whole structur rather than part of it (fig. 2). thus, the probabl by our cnn show the mix ratio of 
large-scal structur in one particle. If we limit the train imag to more ideal shape (onli particl without 
small-scal structures), accur evalu of small vesicular shape may be possible. however, becaus volcan 
ash be not an artifici object, mani more sampl be requir to collect good train images. moreover, in the 
case of fig. 5d, the cnn might recogn that the small concav be the connect between blocki and elon- 
gate shape rather than vesicular structure, which also reduc the vesicular probability. anoth caveat be that 
we use rel low-resolut (50 × 50 pixel) imag to reduc the comput time. thus, the cnn might 
not recogn the small-scal structur of the particles. If high-resolut imag be used, although the computa- 
tional time will increase, the effect of detail morpholog may be evalu more accurately. these task requir 
more imag and can be consid in futur studies. 

averag mix ratio and cluster of samples. As a next step, we select 18 sampl from three 
areas, funabara, nippana, and myvatn (form by magmatic, phreatomagmatic, and rootless eruptions, respec- 
tively), and perform cluster of the sampl base on the mean probabl of the four basal shape averag 
over everi particl in each sample. moreover, the probabl ratio of basal shape over the three area pi be also 
calcul a = ∑ ∑p m n n/i j ij j j j, where mij and nj be the mean probabl of basal shape i (one of four classes) in 
sampl j and the number of particl in the sample, respectively. the summat be carri out for each area 
(funabara, nippana, and myvatn). 

one caveat be that, with morpholog images, detail of the surfac textur cannot be observed. however, 
morpholog can automat calcul the pixel intens for each particle15, which can provid rough infor- 
mation about the particl composit in term of the transpar under bottom lighting. transpar can be 
an effect mean of extract glass fragment and transpar crystal from volcan ash, which can play an 
import role in a discuss of the degre of quench and fragment of magma/lava3,31,32. To calcul 
ash transparency, complex parameter be not required. thus, we consid the transpar in addit to 
the class probabilities. 

use morphologi, we evalu the mean (im) and standard deviat (isd) of the intens of one particl (see 
the supplementari inform for details), and thu there be 2 paramet per particl image. We averag Im 
and isd over one sample, and consid the averag value, the standard deviation, and the median a the trans- 
parenc of each sample. thus, each sampl have 4 paramet (averag probabilities) for shape and 6 paramet 
for transparency. cluster analysi be conduct use these 10 parameters. We perform hierarch cluster- 
ing (ward’ method33) in r34 base on the euclidean distanc between each pair of samples. 

tabl 4 show the mean probabl of basal shape and transpar valu for each sample. the averag 
probabl over each area (three differ erupt types) pi be show in fig. 6. In everi sample, the most domi- 
nant shape be blocky. In particular, particl of funabara (fn) consist of more than 50% blocki shape on averag 
(fig. 6). the probabl of the vesicular and elong shape be high (more than 30% and 10%, respectively) 
for the low layer of nippana (np15113001–np15113003). the my13091305 particl also have a high proba- 
biliti for the elong shape. On the other hand, the probabl for the round shape be small for the nippana 
sampl (fig. 6). In addit to vesicular and elong of particles, transpar be also high for the nippana 
sampl (there be mani transpar particl in the nippana samples) compar with the sampl of funabara 
(fn) and myvatn (my) (tabl 4) becaus most of the particl in the nippana sampl be glass fragment (see 
the supplementari information). 

the reason whi the blocki shape be domin be that blocki particl be common in shape. As show above, 
blocki particl be gener product in brittl fragment of magma, which be typic for magmat eruption. 
the probabl of more than 50% for the blocki shape for the funabara sampl can be explain in thi way. 
furthermore, the domin of the blocki shape in the nippana and myvatn sampl can be explain a follows: 
blocky, equant shape be the most frequent found in hydrovolcan (magma-wat interactions) ash23. the 
high probabl of the vesicular shape in the low layer of nippana (np15113001–np15113003) be consist 
with gener understand for basalt phreatomagmat products: fragment due to thermal shock and 
expans of ga by the contact of vesicul basalt magma and extern water produc vesicular glassi ash 
particles23. the high ratio for the elong shape in the low layer of nippana (np15113001–np15113003) and 
my13091305 indic the exist of fluidal shape particl (e.g., supplementari fig. s6), which be caus by 
the elong of low-viscos magma dure eruption. the effect of elong crystal can be exclud becaus 
the sampl in thi work be form in a short duration, in which case it be difficult to vari the phenocryst 
compon and proportions. the domin of round particl in the myvatn sampl may correspond to the 
exist of “mossi grain”, which be describ for iceland rootless tephra11. mossi morpholog be form by 
hydrodynam fragment of deform lava if the effect of viscos be more domin than the effect of 
surfac tension11. In the case of my13091402, the high ratio of the round shape be consist with the exist 
of hollow spherul (see supplementari fig. S8 and the supplementari inform for details). for fn15101206, 
fn15101208, and np16102407, the reason for the high round shape probabl may be surfac tension11,26. 

the cluster of sampl be show in fig. 7. the cluster be consist with the differ between the three 
region (differ in erupt type). In the dendrogram, first, most nippana sampl be distinguish from 



www.nature.com/scientificreports/ 

9scientif report | (2018) 8:8111 | doi:10.1038/s41598-018-26200-2 

the others, then the funabara and myvatn sampl be separated. the cluster be also consist with the stra- 
tigraphy: np15113001–np15113003 (lower part of nippana tuff ring), and np15113004–np15113006 (upper 
part of nippana tuff ring). thi be also the case for the funabara samples, although fn15113007 do not follow. 

np16102407, my13091305, and my13091402 be not classifi consist with their erupt type. 
however, thi can be explain by the differ in the stratigraph posit and geospati distribut of the 
sampling. my13091305 be collect from the low part of a rootless cone (fig. 1), and contain inform 
about the earli stage of lava-wat interaction, which be consid to possibl be a energet a a phreatomag- 
matic explosion35. my13091402 be collect in hagi, where the lava flow down approxim 45 km from 
the fissur vent (fig. 1). therefore, thi sampl may be differ from other sampl of rootless erupt due to 
differ conditions, such a lava temperatur and avail of water dure the explosions. np16102407 be 
separ from other phreatomagmat sampl (fig. 1). It be know that, at the time of the formation, a magmat 
erupt take place concurr at an extrem close rang (less than 300 m)21. thus, np16102407 might be a 
mixtur of ash particl gener by phreatomagmat and magmat eruptions, and be therefor consid to 
be distinct from other phreatomagmat samples.

plan to appli thi method to other type of images, such a sem images, which provid such detail3,5,36, with 
the goal of train our cnn to recogn particl texture. 

In order to increas the robust of the particl classif by cnn, much more imag should be pre- 
par and test with sever condit (e.g., differ location, resolut and class). As we mentioned, our basal 
imag be select from larg structure. more accur mix ratio may be obtain if the train imag 
be limit to more ideal shapes, which do not have small-scal structure. however, the number of particl with 
ideal shape be veri small. To solv the problem of the amount of images, a databas of volcan ash images9 will be 
use for further studies. the structur of cnn also should be discuss especi when the complic textur 
of particl be take into account. 

suggest of new taxonomi approach. other than volcan ash, our approach use probabl 
(mix ratio) be applic to classif of other object in nature, such a organ and fossil that be 
difficult to categor into uniqu species37. although an import principl of classif be that one object 
be categor into one class and that everi class be independent, in the case of natur objects, characterist of 
sever class be often present in a singl object. thus, classif by the nake eye becom subject if we 
forcibl assign such natur object into a singl class. On the other hand, visual classif have the advantag 
that qualit characterist can be take into account and that unlimit parameter of complex shape 
be not required. As quantit analysi of volcan ash have shown8, the number of paramet increas a one 
seek a good represent of complex objects. A cnn can provid probabl for each class (i.e., quantifi- 
cation of human recognition), which can be interpret a a mix ratio of basal shapes. thus, in addit to 
the fact that a train cnn can be shared, even obscur object can be classifi without forcibl assign them 
into a singl class and without defin numer complex parameters, which may becom a new direct of 
taxonomy. further studi and discuss with research in differ field (e.g., geology, comput science, 
and biology) be important.
