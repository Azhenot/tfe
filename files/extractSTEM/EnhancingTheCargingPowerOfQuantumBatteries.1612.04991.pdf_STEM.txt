can collect quantum effect make a differ in a meaning thermodynam operation? focus on 
energi storag and batteries, we demonstr that quantum mechan can lead to an enhanc in the amount 
of work deposit per unit time, i.e., the charg power, when N batteri be charg collectively. We first 
deriv analyt upper bound for the collect quantum advantag in charg power for two choic of con- 
straint on the charg hamiltonian. We then demonstr that even in the absenc of quantum entangl 
thi advantag can be extensive. for our main result, we provid an upper bound to the achiev quantum 
advantag when the interact order be restricted, i.e., at most k batteri be interacting. thi constitut a 
fundament limit on the advantag offer by quantum technolog over their classic counterparts.

introduct – technolog be current be miniaturis 
at such a rate that we must give seriou thought to the funda- 
mental law and blueprint of the machin of the future. In 
the microscop domain, where these machin be expect 
to function, fluctuat of both thermal and quantum natur 
begin to proliferate, and quantum effect must be includ 
in ani reason physic description. when we deal with 
technolog work in thi quantum regime, familiar ther- 
modynam concept like work, heat, and entropi need to be 
appli with great care and consideration. It come a no sur- 
prise that there have be a recent intens effort to understand 
how the law of thermodynam generalis to arbitrari quan- 
tum system away from equilibrium. thi effort be know a 
quantum thermodynam and, give current interest in the 
develop of quantum technologies, it be receiv a great 
deal of attent across a wide rang of scientif communi- 
tie [1–3]. 

despit current momentum in the field of quantum ther- 
modynamics, the explicit role of genuin quantum featur 
in the oper of thermal machin be not fulli understood. 
A common issu rais be that the univers applic of 
thermodynam be root in the theory’ complet lack of re- 
spect for microscop details. So whi then should thermody- 
namic realli care about quantum mechanics? for example, 
the strike featur of carnot’ bound for the effici of a 
heat engin lie in the fact that it be insensit to microscop 
detail [4]. nevertheless, if one relax the assumpt of 
larg system size and quasi-stat conditions, it be absolut 
reason to get correct base on the fine detail of the 
work medium [5–8]. An import question be then: can 
such quantum featur be har to improv other thermo- 
dynam meaning figur of merit, such a power?

collect quantum phenomenon be know to offer advan- 
tage in area such a computation, secur communication, 
and metrology. veri recently, these possibl advantag have 
receiv some attent in the context of batteri [9–17]. the 
issu be subtle, in particular when one deal with mix states. 
In particular, alicki and fann suggest that entangl op- 
erat lead to increas work extract from an energi 
storag devic which they coin a “quantum battery” [9]. 
nonetheless, while entangl oper be necessari for 
optim work extraction, it have be show that protocol ex- 
ist for which no entangl be actual creat dure op- 
timal work extract [10, 11]. furthermore, consid a 
regim where entangl oper do not increas the ex- 
tractabl energy, some of the author of the present work re- 
centli show that entangl oper can, nonetheless, en- 
hanc the charg power of collect of two level quantum 
batteri [15], also see [18]. however, the demonstr be 
reliant on a highli nonloc hamiltonian, which may be diffi- 
cult to implement in practice. 

In thi letter, we first formal defin the collect quan- 
tum advantag for thermodynam power, befor deriv it 
ultim upper bound. next, we show that attain a quan- 
tum advantag requir entangl operations, but not entan- 
glement itself. We then go on to analyt prove that, for 
charg field with finit interact order, i.e., involv at 
most k-bodi interact terms, the quantum advantag be up- 
per bound by a quadrat function of k and cannot scale with 
the total number of batteries. our result be a fundament limit 
on how larg power can be for physic realis charg 
schemes, where the achiev interact order be typic 
constrained. 

quantum batteri – We begin by defin what we mean 
by a quantum battery: consid a quantum system with an 
intern hamiltonian I . such a system can be use to store 
work by manipul an extern control field V (t) over some 
time interv t ∈ (0, T ). thi gener the unitari dynam

∫ T 

0 
dth(t)}, where h(t) = I + V (t) and ~T 

be the time order oper (we set ~ = 1). note that V (t) 
vanish outsid the time interv (0, T ). dure the charg 
process, the system be take from an initi state ρ to a high 
energi final state σ = uρu† in a time T . sinc the evolu- 
tion be unitary, there be no heat gener [19], and the work 
deposit onto the system be give by W = tr[i(σ − ρ)] with 
an averag charg power give by P = w/t . 

now, consid N such batteries, whose joint initi state be 
ρ⊗n . As before, we can deposit work on all of them by trans- 
form ρ⊗n into σ⊗n . one way to implement thi transfor- 
mation be to perform the charg in parallel, follow ex- 
actli the procedur describ abov for each batteri indepen- 
dently. In thi case, the unitari transform be simplyu⊗n , 
and the time take to charg N batteri be equal to the singl 
batteri charg time: T‖ = T . sinc the deposit work 
scale extensively, W‖ = NW , lead to a charg power 
P‖ = NP that grow linearli with the number of batteries. 

alternatively, to deposit work onto an array of N batter- 
y we could appli a more gener unitari transform 
U , gener by the time-depend N -batteri hamiltonian 
h(t) = 

∑N 
j=1 I 

(j) + V (t). here, i(j) be the intern hamil- 
tonian for the j-th battery, and we requir that V (t) vanish 
outsid the time interv (0, t]). A bold font here denot 
many-bodi operators. henceforth, time-depend will be 
left implicit where it be unambiguous. the crucial differ 
betweenu⊗n andu be thatv may contain term correspond- 
ing to interact between batteri – i.e., the batteri be 
charg collectively. In thi case the collect state of N - 
batteri ρ may becom entangled. As before, we requir that 
the system be transform from state ρ⊗n to state σ⊗n via a 
cyclic operation; thi ensur that the deposit work be the 
same a in the parallel case, i.e.,w] = NW = w‖. however, 
the joint time-evolv state ρ in thi case may be entangled, 
and the time take to implement U and U could in principl 
be different, with T] ≤ T‖ in the optim case. thi in turn 
lead to differ charg powers: P] ≥ p‖. 

quantum advantag – We be now in a posit to defin 
the quantum advantag for collect charg a 

Γ := 
P] 
P‖ 

= 
T‖ 

T] 
, (1) 

where the second equal be a consequ of our requir 
that the work do be independ of the charg method. 
here, “quantum” refer specif to an enhanc over 
charg with the best local (i.e., non-entangling) operations. 
that is, to comput the quantum advantag we must take the 
optim valu for P‖ (p]) for give ρ (ρ⊗n ) and σ (σ⊗n ). 

In order for thi advantag to be meaningful, we must en- 
sure that the parallel and collect charg strategi be 
fairli compared. In particular, we would like to isol the 
advantag due to collect quantum effect without worri 
about other consequ of introduc interact between 
batteries, such a the increas energi avail to drive tran- 
sitions. In order to take thi extra energi into account, we 
must constrain the collect hamiltonian H to be similar to∑ 
j H 

(j), the total hamiltonian in the parallel charg case. 

without constraints, we could freeli increas the total energi 
of the collect charg hamiltonian to achiev faster driv- 
ing, make the advantag arbitrarili large. note that the 
varianc and mean energi be extens quantiti for non- 
interact systems, we consid two possibl constraint on 
H , namely: 

(c1) the time-averag standard deviat in energi dure 
the collect evolut for time T] should not exceed 

√ 
N 

time that of a singl battery, i.e., ∆e] ≤ 
√ 
n∆e with 

∆e] := 

∫ T] 
0 

dt 
∆hρ 
T] 

, ∆E := 

∫ T‖ 
0 

dt 
∆hρ 
T‖ 

, (2) 

where (∆xy)2 := 〈(x − 〈x〉y)2〉i and 〈x〉i = tr[xy]. 

(c2) the time-averag energi dure the collect evolut 
for time T] should not exceed N time that of a singl battery, 
i.e., E] ≤ NE with 

E] := 

∫ T] 
0 

dt 
〈H − hg〉ρ 

T] 
, E := 

∫ T‖ 
0 

dt 
〈H − hg〉ρ 

T‖ 
, (3) 

where hg (hg) be the instantan ground state energi of H 
(h), that can also depend on time. 

We be free to choos either of these rescal a a con- 
straint on H . they repres altern way of account 
for the differ energet structur of the parallel and collec- 
tive charg hamiltonians. the choic of C1 and C2 be 
addit motiv by the form of the quantum speed limit 
(see below). while C1 lead to a stricter upper bound on the 
quantum advantage, there be no reason a priori to choos one 
over the other. We be now readi to deriv our first main re- 
sult. 

upper bound – sinc the quantum advantag defin 
in eq. (1) amount to a ratio of transit times, we can 
use the quantum speed limit (qsl) to upper bound it for 
a give constraint. the qsl state that the time re- 
quir to transform ρ⊗n into σ⊗n be low bound a 
T] ≥ T (n)qsl := LN max (1/e], 1/∆e]), where Lm := 
arccos( 

√ 
F [ρ⊗m, σ⊗m]) be the bure angl and F (ρ, σ) := 

tr[ 
√√ 

ρ σ 
√ 
ρ]2 be the uhlmann fidel [20]. the two con- 

straints, C1 and c2, be clearli relat to the qsl, a ∆e] 
ande] can be comput use eqs. (2) and (3) respectively. If 
we could chang the hamiltonian at will to includ arbitrari 
interact terms, and onli concern ourselv with the state 
transformation, we could replac H with a time-independ 
hamiltonian such that the initi state travers the great circl 
connect ρ⊗n and σ⊗n in the N -partit state space [21– 
23]. In the absenc of further constraints, the evolut with 
such time-independ hamiltonian be in fact optimal. In 
thi case, the qsl reduc to the usual inequ due to 
mandelstam-tamm [24] and margolus-levitin [25], wheree] 
be replac by the averag initi energi and ∆e] be replac 
by the averag initi standard deviation. 

To deriv the upper bound, we first confin ourselv to 
constraint c1. We proceed by note that the quantum speed 
limit for collect charg N quantum batteri be give 
by T] ≥ ln/∆e]. thi mean that Γ ≤ t‖∆e]/ln . 



3 

now, use constraint c1, i.e., ∆e] ≤ 
√ 
n∆e, we get 

Γ ≤ T‖ 
√ 
n∆e/ln . A similar argument can be make with 

constraint (c2). take into account that the speed limit for 
parallel charg be not alway attainable, we arriv at the fol- 
low upper bound for the quantum advantage: 

γc1 ≤ β 
√ 
N 
L1 
LN 

and γc2 ≤ βN 
L1 
LN 

, (4) 

for constraint (c1) and (c2) respectively, where β := 
t‖/t 

(1) 
qsl quantifi the inabl to satur the qsl in the 

parallel case. 
two remark be in order: firstly, for orthogon pure ini- 

tial and final states, the qsl can be satur and β = 1. 
though the quantum advantag for power could be larg in 
other cases, includ where the batteri state be mix [26], 
the improv cannot grow with the number of batteries; 
i.e., β be a constant function ofn . secondly, we have exclud 
case where ρ and σ do not lie on the same unitari orbit, a 
there be no way of transform the former into the latter us- 
ing the scheme outlin above; the two state will therefor 
necessarili have the same spectrum [27]. 

the two bound in eq. (4) be independ from each other, 
and constraint C1 be strong than c2, a it lead to a stricter 
bound on the quantum advantage. mani other bound can be 
deriv by consid other extens constraints. the quan- 
tum advantag be tight for orthogon initi and final states, 
due to the exampl give in ref. [15]. 

the signific of entangl for quantum enhance- 
ment have previous be studi in the context of quantum 
speed limit for pure states: it be show that, for non- 
interact systems, initi entangl be requir for an 
enhanc in the speed of evolut [28, 29], while for 
interact system a speedup may be achiev for initi 
separ states, sinc intermedi entangl state be ac- 
cessibl [30–32]. In the more gener case of mix states, 
the necess of entangl for an enhanc may not be 
directli inferred, though it have be argu that, in general, 
larg quantum fisher inform of the state with respect to 
the gener of evolut lead to enhanc speed [33, 34]. 
In fact, a we now show, entangl do not appear to be 
necessari for a nontrivi quantum advantage. 

proposit 1 An extens quantum advantag can be at- 
tain even for highli mix states, includ those confin 
to the separ ball throughout the charg procedure. 

We prove thi with an explicit example: consid N two- 
level batteri with intern hamiltonian I with eigenst 
|e1〉 and |e0〉, and correspond energi E1 = 1 and 
E0 = 0. let the initi state be thermal: ρ = exp(−�i)/z 
at invers temperatur � with Z = tr[exp(−�i)], and the fi- 
nal state be σ = exp(�i)/z . the optim local charg 
scheme be achiev in time T‖ = π/2 by appli hamil- 
tonian H = |e0〉〈e1|+ |e1〉〈e0| to each battery. In contrast, 
the joint charg of N batteri be achiev in T] = t‖/α] 
use the global hamiltonianh] = α]h⊗n , where the posi- 
tive constant α] be introduc to satisfi the chosen constraint. 

In both case (local and global) the deposit work be iden- 
tical; thus, the quantum advantag be simpli the ratio of T‖ to 
t]: Γ = α], which can be evalu for the choic of con- 
straint. We find γc1 = 

√ 
N and γc2 = N (also γc0 = N for 

C0 give in eq. (5)). 
forn quantum system of d-dimensions, there exist a ball 

of radiusr(n, d), centr on the maxim mix state, con- 
tain onli separ state [35]. sinc the distanc from the 
maxim mix state cannot chang under unitari evolution, 
for a small enough choic of �, the joint state of N batter- 
y will lie within thi ball throughout the evolution; yet, the 
quantum advantag remain extensive. � 

remarkably, neither T‖ nor T] depend on �, while the to- 
tal work do does. In other words, no matter how mix the 
batteri be a quantum advantag that scale with the number of 
batteri involv be alway achievable. the trade-off of use 
highli mix state be that the charg power suffer a � be- 
come small and smaller. proposit 1 impli that, while 
a quantum advantag requir entangl operations, the joint 
state of N -batteri do not have to be entangl dure the 
charg process. 

the hamiltonian use in the exampl above, and in 
ref. [15], to satur the bound for quantum advantag in- 
volvesn -bodi interactions. such interact be notori 
difficult to engineer. In the next section, we consid physi- 
calli realis interactions, and studi the depend of the 
enhanc on the order of the charg interaction, i.e., the 
number of batteri that take part in a singl interact term. 
k-local charg – We now investig the achiev 

of a signific quantum advantag in a regim where arbi- 
trari multipartit entangl gener be possibl dure 
the charg process. In particular, we demonstr that, al- 
though a nontrivi quantum advantag be achiev in physi- 
cal system characteris by at most k-bodi interactions, thi 
advantag – upper bound by a quantiti that depend at most 
quadrat on k – cannot scale with the number N of bat- 
teri that compos the system. 

first, we consid the situat where work be deposit 
onto the batteri by mean of a piecewis unitari circuit, an 
exampl of which be depict in fig. 1 in the supplementari 
materi (sm). thi model be reminisc of the circuit model 
of univers quantum computation, which be know to out- 
perform it classic counterpart. In thi case, the collect 
state of n-batteri will, in general, be highli entangled. thi 
scheme allow u to studi how the quantum advantag be re- 
late to the number of batteri that be simultan inter- 
acting. 

We consid batteri compos ofn d-level systems, with 
intern hamiltonian I = 

∑ 
j I 

(j), a before. more explicitly, 
and without loss of generality, we assum that each term be 
give by i(j) = 

∑d 
l=1 λl|l〉j〈l|j with λd − λ1 = 2λd > 0, 

and with eigenvalu arrang in increas order. the time 
interv [0, t]] be divid up into L steps: at each step the 
hamiltonian be the sum of s = dn/ke terms, each act on 
a differ set of k batteries. In order to allow the format 
of highli entangl states, these partit could be differ 
at each step. At ani time t, the k-local hamiltonian can be 
write a H = 

∑s 
µ=1 hµ where each term hµ act on a dif- 



4 

ferent k-partit of the hilbert space, identifi by the set 
µ = (µ1, . . . , µk) of k indices. 

In order to make a meaning statement in thi scenario, 
we need to introduc a third constraint: 

(c0) the time-averag oper norm of the drive hamil- 
tonian H dure the collect evolut for time T] should 
not exceed N time that of a singl batteri drive hamilto- 
nian, i.e., E] ≤ NE with 

E] := 
1 

T] 

∫ T] 
0 

dt ‖h‖op and E := 
1 

T‖ 

∫ T‖ 
0 

dt ‖h‖op, (5) 

where the oper norm ‖a‖op be defin a the larg sin- 
gular valu of A. 

constraint C0 guarante that both the time-averag stan- 
dard deviat and the time-averag energi be bound 
from above, a show in sec. A of sm. there, we show that 
E] upper bound both e]/2 and ∆e]. In thi sense, it be a 
stricter constraint than C1 or c2. 

We now show that, with thi constraint, the upper bound on 
the quantum advantag depend on the interact order k: 

theorem 2 for a circuit base charg procedur with in- 
teract order of at most k, the achiev quantum advan- 
tage be upper bound a γc0 < γk, where γ be a constant 
that do not scale with the number N of batteries. 

proof in sec. B of sm. In the import case where ρ and σ 
be the ground and maxim excit state respectively, γ = 
π/2. By construction, the bound on the quantum advantag be 
not tight. for comparison, it have be show elsewher that 
γc1 = 

√ 
k and γc2 = k be achiev if the total number 

of batteri N can be divid by k, i.e., if n/k = s ∈ N [15, 
36]. In thi particular case, such a speed-up can be obtain 
for pure state use the time-independ hamiltonian H =√ 
s 
∑s 
µ=1 hµ, with hµ = |1〉⊗k〈d|⊗k + h.c., assum that 

each hµ act on a complet differ set of k batteries, i.e., 
[hµ, hµ′ ] = 0 ∀µ, µ′. In the same situation, use constraint 
C0 we obtain γc0 = k, suggest that the strict inequ 
in theorem 2 be onli differ by a constant factor from an 
achiev bound. 

theorem 2 can be extend to more gener cases, where 
k-bodi time-depend interact can occur between over- 
lap set of batteries, with the restrict that each batteri 
be simultan interact with at most m others. thi re- 
striction be motiv by the idea that the reach of the interac- 
tion should be limited. 

theorem 3 for a gener time-depend charg proce- 
dure, the achiev quantum advantag be upper bound a 
γc0 < γ 

( 
k2(m − 1) + k 

) 
, where k be the interact order 

and m be the maximum particip number. 

the proof be give in sec. C of sm. for mani physic 
systems, both k and m be limited: 2 or 3-bodi interact 
be the norm for fundament processes, and high interac- 
tion order be gener hard to engin here [37–39]. the 
effect particip number, or reach, m tend to be con- 
strain by the spatial arrang of system and the fact 

that interact strength often drop off with distance. excep- 
tion to thi includ the dick model [40] where collect 
coher lead to superradiance, the lipkin-meshkov-glick 
model [41], where all particl interact with each other, and 
the mølmer-sørensen interact [42], in which an ensembl 
of ion be effect coupl by a spatial uniform electro- 
magnet field. 

note that these bound be not tight; while a scale of the 
power P] with the number of batteriesn be sure not feasibl 
in the context of k-bodi interactions, it be more like that 
the quantum advantag be tightli limit by k. In fact, we 
conjectur that, for ani choic ofh , a conserv bound for 
the quantum advantag be give by γc0 < γk: 

conjectur 4 theorem 2 hold for ani time-depend k- 
bodi interact hamiltonian. 

We examin thi particular statement in SM sec. D, an- 
ticip that the result hold if a particular mathemat 
conjectur do too. while we cannot exclud measur zero 
cases, a larg sampl of charg hamiltonian (gener 
from haar-random unitari operations), with (n, k) = (3, 2), 
(4, 2), (4, 3) and (6, 2), have fail to produc ani counterex- 
amples. We believ that similar conjectur should also hold 
for constraint C1 and c2. 

conclus – In thi letter, we have introduc the notion 
of collect quantum advantag for thermodynam power. 
our result directli complement a previou strain of research 
into quantum speed limits, by deriv a concret upper bound 
on the ratio between the maximum speed of interact and 
non-interact drive between separ states. We have 
proven two fundament upper bound for the quantum ad- 
vantage, each correspond to a differ constraint on the 
charg hamiltonian. We have also show analyt that 
a quantum advantag that grow with the number of batteri 
be not achiev with ani physic reason hamiltonian 
(i.e., one with at most k-bodi interactions). nevertheless, a 
quantum advantag that grow with the interact order k can 
be achieved. 

the quantum advantag have be interpret a the re- 
sult of rapid evolut through the space of high-dimension 
quantum states, typic obtain by mean of global oper- 
ation [15]. while, in the case of pure states, entangl 
be a necessari consequ of these global operations, a fulli 
separ evolut be still access for those state that live 
in the separ ball. 

A strike consequ of our results, which hold in gen- 
eral for mix states, be that an enhanc charg power be 
avail even for arbitrarili mix states, in remark anal- 
ogi to the case of quantum metrology. there, an enhanc 
in sens be still avail for highli mix state lie insid 
the separ ball [43]. 

while collect behaviour have be demonstr to pro- 
vide an advantag in perform mani inform theoret 
tasks, such distinct from classic behaviour be few and 
far between in thermodynamics. thi letter demonstr that 
thermodynam process can inde benefit from collect 
effect when time enter the picture, though physic limita- 
tion on the interact order prevent u from utilis them.

thi result have fundament import for our understand 
of how quantum theori and thermodynam be related.

where we have use tr[h2ρ(t)] ≤ ‖h2‖op = ‖h‖2op to get 
to the final line.

thus, if the time-averag oper norm of the hamiltonian

appendix B: proof of theorem 2

follow from the fact that ani unitari charg have to have 
vanish instantan power for time t = 0 and t = t]. 
We now evalu the commut [h, I] in order to find an 
upper bound P ↑ for the averag power p], rememb that 
we have I = 

∑

(j) and H = 
∑s 
µ=1 hµ. We will use the 

subscript µ̄ to indic the set of batteri index that be not 
includ in partit defin by µ. use the commut 
relat between hµ and i(j) we obtain 

[h, I] =

use the definit for I , it follow from direct calcul 
that ‖

introduc two normal oper Xµ and ιµ, a follows: 

Xµ =

use these, we can rewrit the commut a

where Yµ = 12 [xµ, ιµ], such that ‖yµ‖op ≤ 1. 
At ani time t, the oper norm of the hamiltonian H be

where the equal hold due to the fact that, at each step 
in time, everi term hµ act on a differ k-partit of the

now we consid the express give in eq. (b4), to cal-

at each step in time there be s term act on differ k-

where the inequ in line eq. (b7) hold due to the fact that 
‖yµ‖op ≤ 1 by definition, and where the sum can be carri

fig. 1. (color online) unitari circuit with k=2. At each time 
step t, the drive hamiltonian consist of a set of s = n/2 terms, 
each of which involv a differ pair of batteri i, j. the result 
be s independ unitari oper u(t)ii+1 act on pair i, i + 1. 
note that at each step, there be no overlap between differ pair of 
batteries; at everi success step the pair be chang in order to 
allow the format of highli entangl states. A circuit of thi type 
can be use to approxim ani time-depend unitari evolut 
u(t) [47], with precis that increas with the number of step 
L. the implement of U requir an extra amount of time that 
depend on the number of non-commut term in the hamiltonian. 

We calcul the quantum advantag a in eq. (1), where P‖ be 
give by the ratio between W‖ and T‖ = βl1/min{e,∆e}.

appendix C: proof of theorem 3 

proof. here our goal be to relat a gener unitari evolut 
to a circuit base charg procedure. We first note that the 
charg hamiltonian can alway be decompos into a num- 
ber M of non-commut terms: 

h(t) = 

M∑ 
j=1 

h(j)(t) with h(j)(t) = 
s∑ 

µ=1 

h(j)µ (t), (c1) 

where [h(j)µ (t), h 
(j) 
µ′ (t)] = 0; thi decomposit be in gener 

differ for differ valu of t. the unitari evolut U 
gener by thi time-depend hamiltonian can alway be 
approximated, use the trotter-suzuki decomposit [47], 
by the follow product of unitari tranformations: 

utrot = 

L∏ 
l=1 

M∏ 
j=1 

exp 

[ 
−ih(j) 

( 
lt] 
L 

) 
T] 
L 

] 
. (c2) 

In the limit L → ∞, utrot = U ; however, they do not cor- 
respond to the same implementation: the hamiltonian gen- 
erat utrot be piecewis time-independ and in the cir- 
cuit form discuss in sec. B. sinc each of the M term at 

each time step must be implement sequentially,utrot take 
M time longer to run than U , with a correspond drop in 
power P] = mptrot. 

sinc we have an upper bound, from theorem 2, on the 
quantum advantag for circuit model hamiltonians, and the 
power for a more gener hamiltonian be at most M time 
greater, it must be that γc0 < mγk in thi case. In order to 
complet the proof, we now need to consid how the mini- 
mum necessari valu of M scale with k and m. 

the quantiti m denot the maximum number of other bat- 
teri ani one can interact with. In order for the number of 
term M in eq. (c1) to be suffici for the requir decom- 
position, it must at least equal the larg possibl number of 
differ k-partit µ that have a non-trivi amount of in- 
dice in common, while contain the same index µi at most 
m times. let u provid a few simpl exampl to clarifi the 
mean of M , where we will assum that N can be arbitrar- 
ili large. 

(k = 2,m = 1) In thi case M be trivial equal to 1. 
A possibl choic be give by the first 2-partit (1, 2), after 
which ani other partit (i, j) can contain neither 1 nor 2. 
thi have to be true for ani choic of other partitions, therefor 
M = 1. In other words, in thi case, the trotter be not 
necessari and the unitari can be perfectli simul with a 
piecewis unitari circuit. 

(k = 2,m = 2) let u start with the first 2-partit 
(1, 2), follow by (2, 3) and (1, 3). ani other choic of two 
index would form a partit that do not contain ani ele- 
ment of at least one of the previou three, thu M = 3. In thi 
case the simul circuit be at most 3 time slow than the 
actual unitary. 

(k = 3,m = 2) now the first 3-partit (1, 2, 3) be fol- 
low by (1, 4, 5), (2, 4, 6) and (3, 5, 6). ani other choic of 
three index would form a partit that do not contain ani 
element of at least one of the previou four, thu M = 4. 

In general, for a give k and a give m, we could start – 
without loss of gener – from the first order partit 
(1, . . . , k). rememb that each of those index can ap- 
pear at most m times, we can construct m set contain 1, 
follow by m − 1 set contain 2, 3, 4 and so on until 
m − 1 set contain k, for a total of k(m − 1) + 1 terms. 
In the bad case scenario, all of these partit have at least 
one element in common. however, ani subsequ partit 
cannot contain ani of the index includ in the first order 
partit (1, . . . , k), thu M ≤ k(m− 1) + 1. 

take thi most general, bad case scenario, we have a 
bound on the quantum advantag give by 

γc0 < (k(m− 1) + 1)γk = γ 
( 
k2(m− 1) + k 

) 
, (c3) 

where γ := βl1eqmin{e,∆e} . � 

appendix D: On conjectur 4. 

let u consid a gener time-depend hamiltonian that 
contain all the possibl k-bodi interact term between the

N batteri that constitut the system, i.e., H = 
∑ 
µ hµ con- 

tain N !/k!(n − k)! term in the sum. with the aim of ob- 
tain an upper bound for the quantum advantag under the 
constraint c0, we follow the proof provid for theorem 2, 
until eq. (b4). We then find an explicit relat between the 
element of Xµ and those of yµ. let u consid the product 
basi Bµ := {|a〉µ} for the subset of batteri defin by µ. 
each element |a〉µ = ⊗ki=1|ai〉µi be a product state of the par- 
tition of the hilbert space associ with µ. In thi basi we
