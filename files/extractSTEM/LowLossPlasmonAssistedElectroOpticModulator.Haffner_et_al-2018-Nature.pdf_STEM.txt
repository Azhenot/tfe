for nearli two decades, research in the field of plasmonics1— 
which studi the coupl of electromagnet wave to the motion 
of free electron near the surfac of a metal2—hav sought to realiz 
subwavelength optic devic for inform technology3–6, 
sensing7,8, nonlinear optics9,10, optic nanotweezers11 and 
biomed applications12. however, the electron motion gener 
heat through ohmic losses. although thi heat be desir for some 
applic such a photo-therm therapy, it be a disadvantag 
in plasmon devic for sens and inform technology13 
and have lead to a widespread view that plasmon be too lossi to 
be practical. here we demonstr that the ohmic loss can be 
bypass by use ‘reson switching’. In the propos approach, 
light be coupl to the lossi surfac plasmon polariton onli in the 
device’ off state (in resonance) in which attenu be desired, to 
ensur larg extinct ratio between the on and off state and 
allow subpicosecond switching. In the on state (out of resonance), 
destruct interfer prevent the light from coupl to the 
lossi plasmon section of a device. To valid the approach, 
we fabric a plasmon electro-opt ring modulator. the 
experi confirm that low on-chip optic losses, oper at 
over 100 gigahertz, good energi efficiency, low thermal drift and a 
compact footprint can be combin in a singl device. our result 
illustr that plasmon have the potenti to enabl fast, compact 
on-chip sens and commun technologies. 

telecommun devic such a electro-opt modul must 
featur low insert loss (the reduct of signal power result from 
insert of the devic into the transmiss line) while provid a 
larg chang in phase (δn) or amplitud (δα) accumul over a 
short devic length14. beyond that, modul should offer low drive 
voltag and high-spe operation. 

In recent years, silicon photon have emerg that have low propaga- 
tion loss (of the order of dB cm−1) but have struggl to achiev larg 
modul depth (that is, Δn and δα) for submillimetr devices15. 
state-of-the-art devic maxim their modul through the use 
of reson structures16, enabl compact (few squar micrometres) 
and energy-effici components17,18. and although larg qualiti 
factor (q-factors, larg valu indic low energi losses), of the order 
of sever thousand, allow consider reduct of the drive voltage, 
they limit the speed and increas the sensit of devic to temper- 
atur and fabric fluctuations19. more recently, surfac plasmon 
polariton (spp) devic have exploit the extrem confin of 
light to achiev except modul of phase and amplitud within 
a few micrometres3,20. however, the metal that give plasmon such 
promis be also the larg hindrance, a such devic suffer from larg 
on-stat loss (of the order of dB μm−1). To combat plasmon losses, 
some devic use hybrid plasmonic–photon modes4,6,21 wherea 
other minim the length of the activ section5,22. still, typic inser- 
tion loss of 10 dB due to plasmon propag and photonic-to- 
plasmon mode convers remain a concern for high-spe state- 
of-the-art devices5,6. thus, plasmon on-chip technolog have be 
unabl to replac the exist photon or electron solutions. 

We propos an approach in which loss in plasmon waveguid 
can be select use or bypass to achiev low insert loss, 
strong modulation, compact footprint and high speed, simultane- 
ously. previously, the goal have be to reduc the ohmic loss a much 
a possibl to minim the device’ loss in the on state. instead, we 
show that plasmon loss can be toler by design the devic 
geometri such that light pass through the lossi section when requir 
(in the off state). To achiev this, we use a plasmon ring reson 
coupl to a buri low-loss silicon photon waveguid (see fig. 1).

unlik previou approaches, which aim to reduc the reson loss to 
realiz high-q caviti or lasing7,23–26, our reson exhibit typic 
propag loss within the plasmon caviti and mostli bypass 
thi lossi section in the on state through destruct interference. use 
thi design, we demonstr a plasmon modul that can meet the 
key perform metric of modern optic commun links. 

figur 1 show the propos devic geometry, which compris a 
gold metal–insulator–met (mim) slot waveguid ring coupl to a 
buri silicon bu waveguide, form a notch filter with a reson 
wavelength of λre (see section II of the supplementari information). 
the slot waveguid be fill with an organ electro-opt (oeo) mate- 
rial which alter the device’ reson condit through the pockel 
effect (δnspp)27. thi permit fast and select use of the resonator’ 
ohmic loss to attenu the signal (δα) in the bu waveguid by apply- 
ing a voltage. 

figur 1c show the measur transmitt over the wavelength 
of two repres devic that differ slightli in radius. the dif- 
ferenc in radiu do not affect their optic properti (insert 
loss, extinct ratio, q-factor), but result in a distinct off-reson 
(λ0 ≠ λres) and on-reson (λ0 = λres) behaviour at the telecom- 
munic wavelength of 1.54 μm. the off-reson ring reveal an 
insert loss of about 2.5 db, the on-reson ring show a q-factor 
of about 30, and their differ in transmitt indic an extinc- 
tion ratio of about 10 db. We note that non-reson devic base on 

similar-length mim waveguid featur an insert loss rang from 
8 dB to 10 dB (refs. 5,6,22). 

the reduc insert loss can be understood by compar the 
exemplari oper principl of a non-reson mach–zehnd 
modul (mz)5 (fig. 2, left inset; white solid arrow indic the plas- 
monic section) and a reson ring (fig. 2, right inset). the insert 
loss of the devic be a function of it coupl efficiency, geometri and 
accumul ohmic loss. In both concepts, light coupl to and from 
the plasmon structur with a coupl effici C. A transmiss 
modul be then induc by the pockel effect over an activ plas- 
monic section of length or circumfer l. the modul depth δτ, 
where T be transmittance, and also the loss lspp scale with the length 
of the activ plasmon section6. figur 2 show the overal insert 
loss over the lspp in the activ plasmon area for a MZ (red curve) and 
for a critic coupl reson (blue curve). the arrow in the plot 
indic the perform of devic with an equal δτ. 

the follow point aris from fig. 2. first, the resonator’ total loss 
be alway small than that of a MZ modul (blue curv < red curve), 
owe to the bypass mechanism28. the insert loss increas with 
lspp (that is, invers to the cavity’ q-factor) a the critic coupl 
condit requir that more light coupl to the plasmon section. 
second, the reson have an insert loss 1 dB low than that of the 
MZ at lspp ≈ 0 db. thi be becaus the non-reson devic requir 
two photonic–spp convert a both the on state and the off state 
propag through the plasmon section. ohmic loss in the convert- 
er limit the convers effici to about 1 dB (refs. 22,29). In contrast, 
the select mechan of the reson (on state: bu waveguide; 
off state: ring) requir a convert which coupl onli a fraction of 
the light to the ring. third, in the ring we take advantag of the reso- 
nantli enhanc ΔΤ to reduc the devic length (see section vii of 
the supplementari information). for our reson structures, we have 
calcul an enhanc of about 1.5. consequently, our ring with a 
circumfer of l = 6 μm (lspp ≈ 4 db) offer the same transmitt 
chang a a MZ of l = 9 μm (lspp ≈ 6 db). In total, the ring devic offer 
an advantag of 6 dB insert loss over the MZ modulator. loss can 
be further reduc by under-coupl the resonator, a limit extinc- 
tion ratio of 10 dB be suffici for mani practic applications30. 

To illustr the modul perform (δτ) of the plasmon 
resonator, the effect refract index for spp (δnspp) be alter by 
appli a bia between the inner and outer rings27. figur 3a show 
the transmit power versu appli voltag for a probe wavelength 
of approxim 1.52 μm. We observ an insert loss < 3 db, an 
extinct ratio of about 10 dB and a linear respons (dash green line) 
for a peak voltag of 3.5 V with an extinct ratio of about 6 db. thi 
perform in term of insert loss and extinct ratio be similar 
to that of well-develop complementari metal oxid semiconductor 
(cmos) photon resonators19. We estim that oper under a 
digit peak-to-peak drive voltag (1 v)19 will soon be achiev 
by use other plasmon materi such a silver or copper, use the 
new oeo materi and improv fabric (see methods: futur

be reduc by more than 6 db. thi be for the follow reasons: (i) the 
bypass mechanism: onli a fraction of light experi plasmon 
losses; (ii) reson enhancement: the reson achiev the same 
modul depth (δt) for shorter activ plasmon section than their 
non-reson counterpart (indic by the horizont shift of the

improvements). To highlight the mechan of the modulation, the 
transmiss of the devic be measur under a posit and neg 
bia ( ± 3.75 V) a a function of wavelength (see fig. 3b). thi result 
in a normal sensitivity, sλ/δfwhm = δλres/(δfwhmδn), where 
δfwhm be the full-width at half-maximum, of about 17 riu−1 (riu be 
refract index unit), assum a rel chang in the oeo refract 
index of about 0.03. thi can be compar to commerci spr sensor 
that achiev valu of 50 riu−1 by use a free-spac kretschmann 
configuration31. therefore, our approach be alreadi close to the non-in- 
tegrat free-spac approaches. 

the moder q-factor guarante a high oper speed and 
provid good thermal stability. for example, the measur reson 
frequenc be plot in fig. 3c over a temperatur rang from 20 °C 
up to 90 °c. In thi case, the reson frequenc be found to follow a 
linear trend line with a slope of about 0.4% k−1. the insensit of 
the low-q plasmon reson to temperatur fluctuat be in strong 
contrast to high-q photon resonators, which be two order of magni- 
tude more sensit to temperatur fluctuat (approxim 100% 
k−1)18. thi be extrem benefici for applic in which strong 
temperatur fluctuat occur. for example, a low-q plasmon reso- 
nant sensor or modul would be immun to thermal fluctuat 
of ± 5 °C which normal occur in cpus, wherea high-q photon 
reson requir power-consum temperatur control to main- 
tain operation19. furthermore, the moder Q factor be benefici 
for high-spe operation, a desir in electro-opt modulators. As a 
result, we be abl to push the bandwidth of a reson electro-opt 
modul well beyond 100 ghz (see method section ‘speed limita- 
tions’). In comparison, photon reson be more like to be limit 
to bandwidth of about 20 ghz and below18,19. 

subsequently, we perform high-spe data experi to demon- 
strate the robustness, high speed and low power switch capability. 
although the ‘reson switching’ principl can also be use to 
optim sensors, we focu on high-spe applic becaus their 
sensit and stabil requir be stricter. 

In the experi of fig. 4a, the peak drive voltag be approxi- 
mate 3.3 V, and the laser wavelength be vari to captur the 
respons of the modulator. low devic loss of 2.5 dB and fibre-to- 
silicon waveguid loss of about 7 dB result in fibre-to-fibr coupl 
loss of 16.5 db, enabl success oper with low laser power 
of 4 dbm and below. the result bit-error ratio (ber) versu wave- 
length for a 72 gbit s−1 signal be show in fig. 4b, where a peak in the 
ber be observ at λre (dash line). the ber show a peak becaus 
the chang of transmitt (δt) have a symmetr respons to voltag 
when the probe wavelength λ equal λres. consequently, we con- 
firm that the oper mechan reli on amplitud modulation. 
off-resonance, the ber quickli drop to about 1 × 10−3, which be 

below the hard-decis forward error correct (hd-fec) limit and 
allow for success data modul and detection32. No thermal 
heater be requir for stabilization. additionally, we reduc the data 
rate to 36 gbit s−1 and 18 gbit s−1 and found ber of about 2 × 10−6 
and < 1 × 10−6, respectively, indic that the ber at 72 gbit s−1 be 
mainli limit by the electr equip (see methods: data experi- 
ments). We estim the energi consumpt of the modul to be 
about 12 fJ bit−1 at 72 gbit s−1 (ref. 14) for a devic capacit of 1.1 ff. 

We have demonstr that low-q reson design use highli 
confin spp can enabl low-loss activ plasmon devic with a good 
modul depth. We believ that our approach—unlik convent 
reson photonics—break the trade-off between sensit (high-q) 
on the one hand and speed and temperatur stabil (low-q) on the 
other. our work can be see a a step toward practic plasmon that 
ultim serf a a compact and fast gateway between electron 
(local signal processing) and photon (broad bandwidth and low- 
loss data stream). the propos slot waveguid approach could be of 
interest for sensing, becaus the reson respons could be exploit 
for mani other materi system rang from low-index materi such 
a aqueou solut to high-index materi such a silicon.

method 
futur improvements. the plasmon materi strongli influenc the perfor- 
manc of the ring reson in term of loss and reson enhancement. In thi 
section, we discu the influenc of variou plasmon materi and we show that 
the modul perform improv when replac gold with copper (cmos- 
compatible) or silver (lowest loss). 

In a first step, we investig the unload q-factor for differ plasmon 
metals. extend data fig. 1 show the unload qualiti factor Q a a function of 
the slot width and the radiu for Au (panel a), Cu (b) and Ag (c). 

both Cu and Ag featur high q-factor than au. when chang the plas- 
monic metal from Au to ag, the q-factor be more than doubl for geometri 
domin by propag loss (140 for Ag versu 60 for au). each materi show 
the trade-off between propag loss and bend loss result in the characte- 
ristic triangular contour line (see section iii of the supplementari information). 
furthermore, use low-loss materi such a Ag will increas not onli the intrin- 
sic q-factor but also the coupl effici C. three-dimension simul 
indic that C increas from 0.8 to 0.9. 

besid the plasmon material, the oeo materi provid an addit path 
for further improvement. recent experi have show that electro-opt coef- 
ficient over 300 pm v−1 be achiev by oper in close vicin of the oeo 
materi reson (λ ≈ 1,250 nm)33. additionally, other oeo materi such a 
jrd1 show electro-opt coeffici over 300 pm v−1 (refs. 34–36). 

To evalu the influenc of these improv on the modul performance, 
extend data fig. 1 show the wavelength-depend transmitt of a mim- 
ring reson obtain by the analyt model (equat (2) in the supplementari 
information). extend data fig. 1d show the transmitt for Au while 
extend data fig. 1e includ the possibl improv with Ag and jrd1 
(electro-opt coeffici of 300 pm v−1). the radiu be 1 μm, the slot width be 80 nm 
and the outer electrod height be 350 nm. the solid line correspond to posit 
(blue) and neg (red) bias of 2 V. 

such improv configur offer through-port insert loss a small a 
0.5 dB (ag) compar with 1.5 dB (au). furthermore, the switch sensit 
be increas becaus of the high nonlinear (sensit increas by 3 × ) and 
the larg q-factor (2 × ). thus, the absolut insert loss reduc from 4.3 dB to 
1.2 db, and the extinct ratio increas from 2 dB to 18 dB when driven with ± 2 V 
at the chosen probe wavelength (vertic green line, extend data fig. 1d,e). 
thus, low-pow cmo transistor may drive the plasmon reson without 
the help of electr amplification. thi would reduc the total energi consump- 
tion of the modul to below 1 fJ per bit. 
altern activ materi for modul and sensing. here, we discu the 
influenc of the refract index of the slot materi on the unload q-factor of 
plasmon ring resonators. the activ materi could be either an oeo materi for 
modul or a biosensit materi for sens purposes. extend data fig. 2 
show the simul q-factor for differ slot width and radii. the simul 
refract index rang from 1.33 up to 3.48 a show in subplot in extend 
data fig. 2a to h. 

all materi system achiev q-factor abov 30. the refract index of the 
activ materi strongli influenc the bend and propag losses. In the case 
of low nslot, for extend data fig. 2a and b, the q-factor be mainli limit by 
bend loss for all slot width a indic by the diagon contour line (dash 
lines). thi behaviour chang when nslot increas to 1.75 (extend data figs. 2c) 
or 2 (extend data fig. 2d) and typic triangular contour line can be observ 
highlight the trade-off between bend loss and propag loss (see sec- 
tion IV of the supplementari information). A further increas of the refract 
index result in domin propag losses. the triangular shape of the contour 
line chang to contour line parallel to the bottom axi (radius). In thi region (see 
subplot in extend data fig. 2e to h), the q-factor drop for the same geometr 
paramet a propag loss increas with the refract index37. 

the subplot show in extend data fig. 2a, c, e and h be of most interest a 
they repres materi that can be use for sensing: (a) nslot = 1.33 (h2o); or for 
electro-opt modulation: (c) nslot = 1.75 (oeo)35; (e) nslot = 2.25 (barium titanate, 
bto)38; and (h) nslot = 3.48 (si)22. 
sampl fabrication. all report devic be process on silicon-on-insul 
wafer with a 220-nm-thick Si devic layer and 3-μm-thick buri oxide. electron 
beam lithographi (vistec ebpg5200) in combin with icp-ri (oxford 
plasmalab system 100) be appli to pattern the Si photon components. A 
posit tone resist (poly(methyl methacrylate), pmma) and a neg tone resist 
(hydrogen silsesquioxane, hsq) be use a mask to defin the partial (70 nm) 
and fulli (220 nm) etch Si structures, respectively39. planar of the pat- 
tern Si structur be realiz by spin-coat the sampl with a 1-μm-thick 
hsq layer follow by rapid thermal anneal to convert hsq to sio2 (ref. 40). We 
observ thick variat of ± 10 nm with a period of 50 μm throughout 
the chip. thi do not affect devic performance, a the footprint of the reson 

be much small than the periodicity. We control the coupl between the ring 
and bu waveguid by use the follow protocol, which enabl u to adjust 
the averag vertic space between the gold ring and silicon bu (dau–si) to 
within 5 nm of the target value. first, we use an electron-beam-pattern pmma 
resist mask to open silicon etch mark place next to the devic to measur the 
hsq thick dure the follow wet etch process. afterwards, we use a 
second e-beam pattern pmma resist to local etch down the sio2 over the 
bu waveguid to the desir space dau,si = 70 ± 10 nm by use a buffer HF 
(7:1) solution. the slow etch-rat of 1.2 nm s–1 enabl good process control. note 
that the spin-coat process rather than the wet etch process introduc the 
uncertainti of ± 10 nm. contact pads, outer ring (height h = 350 nm), inner ring 
(h = 150 nm) and bridg (h = 350 nm) be produc with a sequenc of e-beam 
lithography, e-beam evapor of Au and lift-off process a report in ref. 5. 
extend data fig. 3 show a tilt top view of the fabric ring reson befor 
the bridg fabric step. the height of the outer electrod be 350 nm, wherea 
the inner electrod be onli 150 nm, enabl a reduct of the bend loss (see 
section IV of the supplementari information). 

We character the geometri of all devic use sem for good comparison 
to simulations. thi allow u to estim paramet such a the electro-opt 
coefficient, r33. finally, the binari oeo materi (75%hd-bb-oh/25%yld124)41 
be spin-coat then pole at it glass transit temperatur (115 °c) by appli 
electr field of approxim 130 V μm−1. It have be shown33 that thi oeo 
materi allow oper up to 80 °c. 

We chose the follow design paramet sets: slot width of 80 nm and 100 nm 
with radiu rang from 900 nm to 1,200 m and 1,400 nm to 1600 nm. 
passiv characterization. We determin the transmitt of the reson by 
subtract back-to-back measur of structur that compris the same grat- 
ing coupler and photon waveguid but lack the plasmon section. the standard 
deviat of the back-to-back measur be below ± 0.5 dB over the whole 
wavelength rang of the tunabl laser (1,465 nm to 1,635 nm). We measur the 
passiv spectrum for variou input power up to 10 dbm and do not observ ani 
drift of the reson wavelength due to self-heating. To prevent ani self-heating, 
we set the laser power to 0 dbm for the passiv characterization. 

extend data fig. 4 show two histogram of the measur insert loss 
(extend data fig. 4a) and extinct ratio (extend data fig. 4b) of 23 ring 
reson with target slot width of 80 nm. the averag insert loss be about 
2.5 dB and the mean extinct ratio be about 9.7 db. 

We design ring with vari radiu to account for fabric variations. 
extend data fig. 4c show the passiv spectrum of ring reson with radiu 
rang from 940 nm up to 990 nm. the reson wavelength shift with increas- 
ing radiu by δλres/δr ≈ 1.1. 
sensit experiments. We use the same optic set-up a the passiv characte- 
rizat measur to estim the d.c./low-frequ electro-opt respons of 
six devices. In a first experiment, we appli a 100 Hz triangular shape electr 
signal with a peak voltag amplitud of 10 V. We measur the modul of the 
optic signal when oper the reson around it 3 dB point. In a second 
experiment, we appli a d.c. bia and measur the resonators’ wavelength shift 
a a function of the voltage. extend data tabl 1 provid an overview of the 
insert loss, extinct ratio and sensit of the reson wavelength (δλre 
per volt) a extract from these two experiments. the extinct ratio (6–10 db) 
and insert loss (2–3 db) dure activ switch match the valu obtain from 
passiv characterization. thi show that the modul can be driven from 
minimum to maximum output power befor dielectr breakdown occurs. three- 
dimension simul of devic 79 reveal a δλres/v ≈ 3.1 nm v−1 for an electro- 
optic coeffici of 100 pm v−1. thus, we estim an in-devic electro-opt 
coeffici of about 90 pm v−1 and a Δn ≈ 0.03 when bias with ± 3.75 V base 
on the pockel effect. devic 79 (last row) be show in fig. 3a and b of the main text. 
speed limitations. the electro-opt bandwidth of reson electro-opt modu- 
lator be often determin by the photon lifetim of the reson cavity. In the case 
of a ring-bas electro-opt modul with a q-factor of 6,000, thi equat to an 
electro-opt bandwidth of a few ten of gigahertz42. In the case of reson plas- 
monic structures, the photon lifetim do not limit the electro-opt bandwidth, 
a these structur featur q-factor that be two order of magnitud small than 
the q-factor of photon approaches. 

In general, the slowest of the follow effect limit the electro-opt bandwidth 
of an electro-optic-modulator: (i) the RC time constant; (ii) the timescal of the 
nonlinear effect (here the pockel effect); and (iii) the caviti lifetime. In the case 
of the plasmon mim ring modul present in thi work, these contribut 
can be approxim a follows: 

• τrc: the calcul capacit of the mim ring be approxim 1.1 fF (electro- 
static 3D simulation), and it resist be a few ohm with the nanometre-scal 
bridg be the main contributor5. thi result in an RC bandwidth much great 
than 1 thz.

• τpockels: the pockel effect be base on the reorgan of π-electron within 
a nanometre-long molecul and be estim to be on the timescal of femto- or 
attoseconds27. thi result in a pockel bandwidth much great than 1 thz. 

• τcavity: the spp lifetim be give by the qualiti factor divid by the angular 
frequenc (τre ≈ q/ωphoton). the reson structur present in thi work fea- 
ture q-factor of 50, while futur implement may reach valu of up to 150. 
thus, the caviti lifetim of spp be about 100 f or less, result in a caviti lifetim 
bandwidth limit of more than 1 thz. 

base on these approximations, we expect, at worst, a terahertz bandwidth for 
a plasmon mim reson use the pockel effect. To confirm that bandwidth 
limit be not an issu for reson plasmon modul we perform 
electro-opt bandwidth measur with a plasmon reson of radiu 
1.5 μm and a design slot width of 100 nm. these design paramet be chosen 
becaus they featur the larg q-factor and therefor the long caviti life- 
times. extend data fig. 5a show the wavelength-depend transmitt of 
the plasmon reson and extend data fig. 5b show the normal modu- 
lation effici a a function of the modul frequency. the ratio between the 
unmodul carrier and the modul sideband be the modul effici 
which be measur with an optic spectrum analys and normal with 
respect to the low appli frequency43. 

the differ colour correspond to three characterist probe wavelengths. 
red, yellow and purpl be the off-resonance, 3 dB point and on-reson probe 
wavelengths, respectively. for all three curves, a similar behaviour be observed, 
and electro-opt bandwidth beyond 100 ghz be found. thi indic that 
the caviti lifetim be not yet limit the bandwidth. otherwise, a discrep 
in bandwidth between on-reson (purple) and off-reson (red) oper 
should be observed. the kink at about 110 ghz be attribut to limit in the 
electr test set-up. 

two differ measur set-up be requir to cover the broad electr 
spectrum rang from 20 ghz up to 115 ghz in step of 2.5 ghz. the first set-up 
(20 ghz to 70 ghz) use a tunabl radiofrequ (rf) signal gener (100 khz 
to 70 ghz) to gener a sinusoid RF signal. the electr output power of the 
sourc be adjust for each frequenc such that a constant power of 0 dbm be 
appli to the ring reson via ground–signal–ground probes. the second set-up 
be use to cover the frequenc rang from 70 ghz to 115 ghz with a step size 
of 2.5 ghz. We use the sixth harmon of a schottki diod to gener these 
frequencies. the electr input power to the schottki diod be kept constant. 
We compens the variat in the diode’ output power by measur the 
power with a broadband power meter. the measur power valu be use in 
a post-process step to subtract the influenc of the vari power. the power 
level of the harmon term other than the sixth harmon be negligible. 

note that the signal be appli via 100 μm × 100 μm contact pads. the reso- 
nator itself (approxim 1.1 ff) do not determin the total capacit a the 
larg contact pad interact with the substrat result in a capacit of sever 
ten of femtofarads44. the modul behav like an open circuit element owe 
to the small capacitance. 
data experiments. thi section provid detail about the experiment set-up 
show in fig. 4 of the main text. A tunable, extern caviti laser (1,465 nm to 
1,575 nm) be use a a light sourc with output power rang from 6 dbm up 
to 13 dbm. the laser light be fed to an attenu to enabl a flexibl adjust 
of the optic power. light be coupl to and from the chip via grate couplers, 
which have an effici (cgc) of −7 dB each at 1550 nm. 

all non-return-to-zero (nrz) electr data stream be random binari 
sequenc of length 218 gener by a 72 gigasampl s−1, six-bit digital-to- 
analogu convert (f3db ≈ 20 ghz). An RF amplifi (f3db ≈ 50–55 ghz) then 
amplifi the electr signal to a certain peak-to-peak drive voltag (vpp,50ω) 
measur over a 50 Ω resistor. finally, the electr signal be appli by 
ground-sign rf-probe (f3db > 67 ghz) to the devic via 100 μm × 100 μm 
contact pads. two 25-cm-long RF cabl (1.85-mm connectors) connect the 
generator, amplifi and RF probe. the modul light be detect coher- 
ently. We use a second laser for heterodyn detection. the 3 dB bandwidth of 
the coher detector’ photodiod be 70 ghz. An erbium-dop fibr amplifi 
amplifi the optic signal after the modul to power level of about 8 dbm 
to enabl best performance. the electr oscilloscop (electr bandwidth 
63 ghz and sampl rate 160 gsa s−1) sampl and digit the waveform. 
offlin digit signal-process be perform to account for time errors45, 
carrier frequenc and phase offset and the linear frequenc respons of the 
system by feedforward equal with adapt least mean squar (lms)-base 
filter updates. extend data tabl 2 show the result in term of ber obtain 
from six differ devic under variou drive voltag (vpeak), data rate (r), 
and optic input power at the grate coupler. similar ber be obtain for 
differ devic under equal conditions. for instance, low ber be obtain at 
18 gbit s−1 for small drive voltag of vpeak ≈ 3.3 V and low input powers. At 
72 gbit s−1, the ber drop to 10−3 under similar conditions. We increas the 

drive voltag twofold and the input power fourfold and measur onli a mod- 
erat reduct of the ber to 10−4. We attribut thi to the limit bandwidth 
of the electr components. devic 34 be show in the fig. 4 of the main text. 
comparison with state-of-the-art electro-opt modulators. In the following, we 
compar the plasmon ring reson with prior art. electro-optic-modul 
be expect to help replac electr commun link with their optic 
counterpart for short-rang applications. potenti candid must be compact 
(footprint of a few squar micrometres) to enabl a dens co-integr of elec- 
tronic and photonics. furthermore, electro-opt modul must be optim 
for high speed ( > 100 ghz) and low insert loss ( < 3 db) to enabl multi-gi- 
gabit operation. extend data fig. 6 show the characterist of state-of-the-art 
devic (photonic, crosses; plasmonic, circles) in term of insert loss and elec- 
tro-optic-bandwidth5,6,18,22,43,44,46–50. the differ abbrevi repres variou 
electro-opt materials. ideally, modul should occupi the bluish area at the 
bottom right of the figure. however, larg bandwidth correl with larg insert 
loss. thi be becaus the plasmon waveguid also serv a highli conduct elec- 
trodes, enabl a low RC time constant, but ohmic loss in the metal prevent low 
insert losses. conversely, the reson switch of photon modul enabl 
low loss but these suffer from limit bandwidths. combin plasmon and 
the reson switch concept break the trade-off and enabl high-spe and 
low-loss modulators. 

for the conveni of the reader, we provid a detail summari of key metric 
in extend data tabl 3 (demonstr plasmon modulators) and in extend 
data tabl 4 (photon electro-opt modulators). the perform of the plas- 
monic ring reson (last column) serf a refer in both tables. extend 
data tabl 3 compar our modul with four non-reson modul base 
on variou nonlinear effect and materi system such a χ(2) in oeo materials, 
free-carri dispers (fcd) in silicon, fcd in transpar conduct oxid 
(tco) and χ(2) in bto. 

• the reson approach (last column) outperform it direct non-reson 
counterpart (first column). 

• plasmon reson requir moder drive voltages, and onli the tco- 
base modul be driven with vpeak = 1 V a requir to enabl integr with 
electronics. however, differ data rate of 72 gbit s−1 and 2.5 gbit s−1 make a 
comparison between our modul and the tco modul challenging. 

• finally, we note that appli the reson plasmon approach to other mate- 
rial system would enabl a further boost in perform for each individu tech- 
nology. for instance, one can imagin tco-bas plasmon reson oper 
with millivolt drive voltages.

extend data fig. 2 | q-factor of variou materi fill the slot. 
a–h, the materi differ in their refract index, and one can observ 
that low-n materi be limit by bend loss (diagon lines) wherea 
high-n materi be limit by propag loss (parallel lines). these 

simul be perform with 150 nm height of the outer and inner 
electrod to account for limit in fabric process differ from 
ours.
