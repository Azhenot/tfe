doe quantit eas contribut to incom inequality? 

august 26th, 2013 by kara in case studies, econom 



background to quantit eas 

As quantit eas (qe) lack an extens history, the monetari 
technique, despit recent use by numer central banks, be fraught with 
controversy[1]. QE occur when a central 
bank increas the money supply, often by buy govern bond 
through open market oper from compani and institutions.[2] the goal be to increas liquidity, borrowing, investments, and econom activity.[3] 
however, QE be associ with some neg side effects, make it a 
last resort strategi use after tradit method – such a when 
offici interest rate be near zero – have be exhausted. one of the 
appar downsid be QE increas incom inequality. Is thi claim 
legitimate? 

incom inequ 

incom inequ (ii) be defin a the unequ distribut of incom within a population.[4] 
there be multipl common method of measur incom inequality, 
includ the gini index, the gener entropi index, and the decil 
ratio.[5] variou factor can affect the 
degre of incom inequality, such a monopolist control by lead 
families, cultur structures, legal constructs, favor tax treatment 
for the rich, regulatori favoritism, decreas labor union strength, 
or technolog change.[6] base on 
histor data, countri not in the organ for econom 
cooper and develop (oecd), such a china, have a larg incom 
dispar than those in the oecd. past research also indic that 
among oecd countries, the usa and latin america have high level of 
incom inequality. overall, the recent trend have be increas incom 
inequality.[7] 

use govern yield to measur quantit eas 

govern yield refer to the interest, or the amount of money make at maturity, on govern bonds.[8] 
specifically, we use US treasuri bill yields. due to the unit state 
feder government’ credibl and low default rate, yield on 
treasuri bill have low systemat and unsystemat risk. As a result, 
they be a good measur of qe’ impact than stock or bonds. 

QE have an invers relationship with govern yields. the more 
easing, the low the yield becaus QE increas money supply, 
decreas the suppli of treasuri through purchas by the central 
bank, which in turn, decreas yields.[9] 

It should be noted, a QE affect mani aspect of the economy, other 
measur – such a the inflat rate – can potenti be used. 
however, we use treasuri yield becaus they have a more direct 
connect to QE than other measurements. 

the associ between the PE ratio, shiller PE ratio, and incom inequ 

the typic price to earn (pe) ratio compar price per share to 
earn per share. the shiller PE ratio, an adapt of the typic 
PE ratio, divid the current price per share by the averag 
inflation-adjust earn from the past 10 years.[10] 
the share price in PE ratio be often an indic of corpor 
profits, a the ratio will be high if earn expect remain 
positive.[11] 

A high ratio be directli associ with high incom inequality. 
higher share price often increas incom inequ a the gain mainli 
go to the wealthy, who own stock at high rate than the poor.[12] In fact, the wealthi 10% own 91.4% of stock and mutual funds. 

methodolog 

first, we examin the correl between quantit eas and 
incom inequ in the usa. second, we examin the unit states’ 
histor gini index data. third, we compare, contrast, and analyz the 
observ from the qe/ii correl and gini index. 

establish a mathemat correl between quantit eas and incom inequ within the usa: 

To determin thi result, we util the begin of the year data 
for the yield of the three-month treasuri bill rate a provid by the 
feder reserv of st. louis[13], and shiller PE ratio a provid by robert shiller in hi book irrat exuberance.[14] 
yield and PE ratio be use measur of eas and incom 
inequality, respectively. We examin data from two time periods: 
1990-2008 and 2009-2013. the result be sometim label a qe/ii 
correlations. 

1) 1990-2008: 



the first time period, from 1990-2008, be significant. dure that 
time the unit state do not use qe. In thi period, the yield 
decreas from 7.64% to 2.75% and the PE ratio increas from 17.05 to 
24.21. the correl between these two variabl be -0.03658. thi 
invers relationship indic that incom inequ increas dure 
thi period. however, base on dancey and reidy’ 2004 categorizations, 
thi be essenti a nonexist correlation, a it be less than -0.1.[15] 

A) 1990-1999: 



It be worth examin two subsect of thi first time period: 
1990-1999 and 2000-2008. between 1990-1999, the PE ratio increas while 
the yield fell. the invers -0.23704 correl suggest incom 
inequ increased. however, the qe/ii correl remain weak dure 
thi period. 

B) 2000-2008: 





the 2000-2008 period wit a posit correl of 0.617692 
where both the PE ratio and treasuri yield fell. unlik the 1990 to 
1999 time frame, thi correl be gener consid to be 
rel strong, indic that incom inequ decreas in the 
absenc of qe. We investig the reason for the differ between 
these two subsect in a late section. 

2) 2009-2013: 



next, we examin the 2009 to 2013 period, dure which time the 
unit state enact quantit eas policies. quit unlik the 
2000-2008 period, there be a weak invers correl at -0.22582. We 
examin whi thi increas in incom inequ may have occur due to 
quantit eas and determin whi thi be a strong invers 
correl than the simpl correl between PE ratio and 
quantit eas suggests. 

fact about the usa’ gini index: 

We can measur the actual incom inequ that occur within the 
usa at differ time period use the gini index. the gini index 
measur incom inequ through the lorenz curve, which show the 
cumul incom earn within the popul start from the low 
earner to the highest. A gini coeffici of 0 repres no 
inequality, while 1 mean one person have all the income.[16] 
thus, the high the gini coefficient, the great the inequality. At 
the time of writing, the unit state gini coeffici be avail up 
to 2011. We therefor compar the coeffici from the 1990-2008 
period to the coeffici from the 2009-2011 period.[17] 

1) 1990-2008: 

between 1990 and 2008, the coeffici increas from 0.428 to 0.466, 
for a total increas of 0.038, or approxim 9%. when we divid thi 
by the total number of years, we wit an averag increas of 0.002 
per year, suggest that there be an increas in incom inequ 
dure thi period. 

although the trend from 1990-2008 overal show worsen incom 
inequality, there be multipl year where we wit a declin in 
incom inequality: 1994-1995, 1997-1998, 2001-2002, and 2006-2007. 

A) befor 2000 vs. after 2000: 

A closer examin of the 1990-2008 period show the increas 
occur primarili befor 2000. 1990-2000 account for 0.034 of the 
total increas of 0.038. thus, from 2000-2008, the index increas onli 
0.004, account for onli 10.5% of the total increas dure 1990-2008. 
As discuss earlier, there be a much more signific increas in 
incom inequ in the former period. It be also clear despit the 
small chang from 2000-2008, inequ increas nevertheless. 

2) 2009-2011: 

from 2009 to 2011, the coeffici grow by more than it have from 2000 
to 2008. It increas by 2%, from 0.468 to 0.477, a differ of 0.009 
in total, or 0.003 per year. there be no decreas dure ani of 
these years. thus, incom inequ worsen the most dure thi time, 
with a larg increas than that of the 1990-2008 era. 

analysi of qe/ii correl and gini indexes: 

when compar the result from the qe/ii correl and gini 
coeffici data, the 1990-2008 and post 2009 period suggest increas 
inequ overall. 

2000-2008 diverg of gini and qe/ii 

however, when take into account subsect of the first period, 
the qe/ii correl and gini index do not reach the same conclus 
for the 2000-2008 period. the gini coeffici suggest that incom 
inequ still increas from 2000 to 2008, but the qe/ii correl 
indic otherwise. 

there be sever reason for thi difference. first, PE ratio be 
not necessarili indic of corpor financi health becaus the 
share price also be a product of investor confid – which be 
unusu high dure the 2000-2008 period even though the underli 
data suggest the market would eventu falter – rather than an 
object indic of a company’ financi health or profits.[18] 
thi lead to a fals posit qe/ii correlation. second, a the 
shiller PE ratio be base on the previou 10 years’ earn and the 
2000-20008 period be not a 10 year block, therefore, other event and 
factor play a role.[19] for example, 
the 1998 crash most like lead to small earn for that year, which 
be includ when calcul the 2000-2008 shiller PE ratio. such 
event can make the denomin smaller, mean a larg PE ratio and 
an alter qe/ii correlation. 

furthermore, the PE ratio do not take into account which group be 
the key recipi of corpor profits, onli the sum total of the 
profits. thus, it fail to take into account the offshor and job 
loss that particularli harm certain group of the US population. 
thi be problemat a compani be increasingli oper 
intern with success.[20] If that 
reason be take into account, incom inequ would be high than 
the qe/ii correl suggest becaus intern competit lower 
household incomes. therefore, it appear that the qe/ii correl for 
2000-2008 suggest less inequ than there be actually. due to these 
circumstances, the gini index may be a more holist data point than the 
qe/ii correl for that period. 

thi rational can also be appli to the 2009-2011 period to 
illustr that the qe/ii correl suggest a weaker correl than 
it should. with unusu low investor confidence, the price per share 
be also unusu low. likewise, the denomin (earnings) be larg 
than it should be due to the fact that the shiller PE ratio consid 
ten year of corpor earnings, which includ earn for the year 
when the economi grew; thi mask the sharp of the increas in 
incom inequality.[21] the offshor of 
job continu dure thi time period, anoth contribut factor to 
great actual incom inequ in practic than the qe/ii correl 
suggests. 

furthermore, the declin in incom inequ suggest by the gini 
index be like caus by other factors. dure 1994-1995, 1997-1998, 
and 2001-2002, the technolog boom, rather than the lack of easing, 
may explain whi incom inequ decreased. while one may expect to see 
a decreas each year, other econom variabl may have play a role 
in the year 1995-1997 and 1999-2000. nevertheless, the boom most like 
contribut to these reversals. furthermore, 2006-2007 be the peak 
year of the hous bubble. the great number of home sell dure 
thi period may have result in a temporary, one-tim increas in 
household incom that skew the incom data to make incom appear 
high than they otherwis would be. 

similar trend of gini and qe/ii 

despit the fact there be some differ between the two, a 
gener trend exist base on the comparison of the gini coeffici and 
the qe/ii correlation. incom inequ worsen more sharpli after 
2009 than dure other periods. In contrast, it worsen the least 
dure the 2000 to 2008 period. there be logic reason whi QE 
increas incom inequality, provid support for possibl causation. 

reason behind quantit easing’ associ with incom inequ 

the list below be not exhaustive, and describ the most signific connect between eas and incom inequality. 

1) inflat 

By tri to stimul the economy, quantit eas attempt to 
increas spend and thu achiev a desir price level and desir 
inflat rate. however, it may lead to a high inflat rate than 
intended.[22] thi affect the valu of 
wages, annuities, and pensions. peopl alreadi suffer from financi 
hardship due to the weak economi will have to tighten their budget 
further to accommod an addit loss in their purchas power and 
incomes. 

2) annuiti 

mani retir program contain yields, a percentag that indic 
the annuity, or income, a person will receiv dure a specifi time 
period. under a QE regime, these yield be lowered.[23] lower yield translat into low incom for retirees, mani of whom reli on annuiti for their day-to-day needs. 

3) pension fund 

like annuities, pension fund be affect by QE in more than one 
way. lower interest rate due to quantit eas harm pension fund 
by increas their liabilities, a low interest rate result in a 
high net present valuat for liabilities. In other words, low 
rate result in a high present valu of futur liabil obligations. 
thi mean that corpor need to divert money from invest or 
hire to fund their pension plans.[24] 
however, corpor may be unabl to do so, leav those who depend 
on such plans, often lower-incom individuals, with reduc payment or 
nonpayment.[25] 

4) invest and borrow opportun 

decreas interest rates, a result of qe, often lead to increas 
borrowing. however, the opportun to borrow and invest money be 
typic limit to those who be alreadi wealthi and have good credit 
scores.[26] when these invest bear 
fruit, the money return to investor in the form of income. those who 
do not have good credit score – who be most like to be compar 
poorer – miss out on these opportunities, lead to increas incom 
inequality. 

5) corpor profit versu worker wage 

As mention earlier, QE lead to low interest rates, result in 
more borrow and invest opportunities, includ for corporations. 
success invest ultim result in high corpor profits. 
however, these typic go to execut and shareholders, who be 
wealthier; poorer worker do not experi similar benefits.[27] 

6) stock and profit versu worker wage 

As suggest by the correl show earlier, quantit eas 
lead to increas share prices. demand for the central bank’ bond 
decreas due to their low rate of return. equiti offer high return 
and investor flock toward stocks, which rais their prices.[28] 
second, a highlight in (5) above, corpor be invest more 
and consequ have great potenti to make extra profits, which be 
attract to shareholders.[29] the 
wealthi benefit more from increas share price and corpor 
profits. incom inequ be further exacerb when wage for 
workers, who do not tend to own stocks, do not increas by a similar 
amount.[30] 

consequ of quantit eas on develop countri 

As nation in global economi be interconnected, chang in unit 
state QE polici affect other countries, includ develop nations. 
there be two primari manifest of US quantit eas in other 
countries: increas inflat and liquidity.[31] 

the unit states’ QE affect the currenc exchang rate of 
develop countries. when a countri like the unit state util 
eas to devalu it currency, other emerg economi may be 
compel to depreci their currenc to maintain a competit trade 
advantage. however, further devalu by emerg economies, 
especi a perman one, lead to more unwant inflationari pressur 
on emerg economies.[32] As indic earlier, inflat can aggrav incom inequ by neg affect purchas power. 

additionally, QE lead to increas capit outflow to develop countries[33] through an increas in privat investments. these outflow often end up in emerg economies’ portfolio investments.[34] like the effect of increas share prices, such invest in secur and stock often benefit the wealthy. 

ethic implications: distribut justic 

distribut justic theori focu on society’ framework for distribut benefit and burdens.[35] 
first, in some way QE may not provid equal opportunity. access to 
money creat by QE occur primarili through stocks. As note earlier, 
the wealthi own the most stock due to their abil to invest while 
still meet their basic needs. the poor, who struggl to survive, 
cannot afford to invest in stocks. such access be also avail to 
execut who reap the benefit of corpor profits. however, the 
poor, typic retire or low skill workers, be not execut and 
tend not to enjoy trickl down benefit from corpor profits. they 
therefore, do not receiv ani financi benefit from quantit 
eas policies. 

although the correl within the usa be weak, it indic that QE 
neg affect incom inequ and thu do not achiev 
distribut justic in the us. the usa’ QE also fail to help other 
countri achiev distribut justic sinc their incom inequ be 
affect a a result. furthermore, other indicators, such a the 
dispar between the poor and rich’ consum sentiment, support the 
argument that QE aggrav incom inequality. after QE polici be 
implemented, the rich, who gain more and lose less, have significantli 
more posit sentiment about the health of the economi and their 
person financi prospect than the poor. 

practic implic of fail to achiev distribut justic 

overall, in the short run, incom inequ may encourag social 
unrest when the poor articul their dissatisfact and desir for a 
high standard of living.[36] exampl includ the 2011 london riots[37] or the occupi wall street and greek protests.[38] 
unfortunately, these implic be not onli applic to the 
present. incom inequ also hamper countries’ econom prospect in 
the long term. It creat a perman underclass and limit 
intergener econom mobility.[39] 
thi occur becaus poorer child grow up in an environ where they 
receiv a bad education, harm their futur livelihoods. 
furthermore, the poor be prompt to borrow more than they should in 
order to meet their needs[40], increas 
the risk of a financi crisis. As the poor have low incomes, they 
cannot help drive econom activity, reli on welfare, consequ 
further harm a country’ long term econom potential. 

We analyz the short and long term implic of incom inequ 
in more depth by organ countri into two categories: develop and 
develop nations. these countri have differ social, political, 
and econom characterist and thu face differ specif risk from 
incom inequality.[41] 

As develop countri have more stabl political, legal, social, and 
econom systems, their economi be like to experi some 
posit benefit of quantit eas without be destabil from 
social unrest. even so, they might experi unrest to some degree. 
the complic associ with small-scal protest and unrest may 
still harm the prospect of other, potenti better, solut and 
requir a short-term response. additionally, a these countri be not 
grow or reorgan their economies, incom inequ becom 
ingrained, creat a long-term problem.[42] 

In contrast, develop countri be less establish and stable, 
heighten the short-term risk of incom inequality. ad extra 
instabl may in fact plung such countri into violenc or intern 
strife, which can last for a signific amount of time and cancel out 
ani short-term growth that result from qe. furthermore, a develop 
countri be like to have unstabl institutions, often riddl with 
corruption, and lack institut power. thi factor put the 
country’ futur at risk if the institut make unwis decisions, 
creat the condit for financi bubbles. the run up to the 1997 
asian financi crisi be one example.[43] however, unlik a develop country, a develop country’ growth allow it a chanc to reduc incom inequality.[44] 

the failur of QE in provid distribut justic potenti risk the wellb of both develop and develop countries. 

An altern proposit 

As QE be not effect in reduc incom inequality, an altern 
tool may help the economi and be more effect at combat incom 
inequality. 

implement a direct job program may resolv the problem pose by 
qe, especi if the program strengthen infrastructure, enhanc a 
country’ growth prospects.[45] thi 
would natur help busi grow a well a bolster the incom of 
workers, so long a they earn more than unemploy benefit give 
them. furthermore, such a program train workers, help their long 
term earn potential, and decreas incom inequality. 

some may argu thi be attempt in the 1930’ and be not 
successful. the attempt by roosevelt befor the war be unpreced 
for it time, but not larg enough to revers the depression. however, 
the economi reviv with world war ii, which be essenti a job 
program. thi do not necessarili mean we should enter more wars; thi 
simpli suggest a job program can work. the mathemat correl 
from 1934 to 1941, befor the US enter the war, and from 1941-1955, 
which includ the war and some time after the war, support thi 
proposition. the correl between the shiller PE ratio and treasuri 
yield from 1934 to 1941 be -0.23445, wherea it be 0.222655 in the 
late period. while the correl be weak, it seem to indic that 
the war revers the trend from increas inequ to decreas 
inequ and do a good job than qe. 









furthermore, some may claim that such a program be difficult to 
implement a it must pa the legislature. If the govern need to 
act quickly, then it should consid do both a quantit eas 
program and a direct job program simultaneously. QE can be enact 
easili by the feder reserv and bring posit benefit in the short 
term. the direct job program, which can be execut in a decent time 
frame, give pressur from a public that understand the benefit of a 
job program, can limit or revers the incom inequ caus by 
quantit eas policies. however, it should be emphas that a 
pure jobs-centr approach be probabl the best way to tackl 
long-term econom problem of econom disparity.

the real inequ of the qe’ have be the reduct in 
interest rate which directli impact all non-borrowers. It exemplifi 
the robin hood approach, take from those who have, and give to those who 
don’t. I have see first hand retiree’ who labor for year to save 
enough money to retire, yet over the past 5 year their incom on such 
save have be reduc to zero and they have be forc to eat up 
their princip rather than live off the interest income. the variou 
qe’ have have littl effect on job creation, it have allow the bank 
industri to recapitalix itself at the expens of the non-borrower. the 
rate on home loan have littl impact on the hous recoveri until 
recently. corpor be sit on record amount of cash never 
befor see in thi magnitude. bank be awash with deposit and be 
competit heavili on the qualiti loan with veri thin margins. bank 
be also extend their secur portfolio to longer and longer 
durations, which when interest rate do rise, will forc bank to take 
loss on massiv amount of securities, which will wipe out much of the 
gain in capit earn by those same bank over the past 5 years. the 
fed have creat the larg hedg fund in the world current at $3.7 
trillion. It appear when interest rate rise they will be forc to 
also take loss or hold those secur until maturity, creat 
massiv loss for tax payers. the 300+ billion in profit which have 
be earn to date by the fed on the qe’ have go down the drain, 
rather than keep those profit to offset potenti losses, the money be 
give to the treasuri to reduc the debt/spend more. anytim the 
finaici market be tinker with, bad thing will eventu result. 
the qe’ be no exception. I fear the outcom of thi debacl will be 
much bad and more broad than the hous crisi ever was. when will 
they ever learn?
