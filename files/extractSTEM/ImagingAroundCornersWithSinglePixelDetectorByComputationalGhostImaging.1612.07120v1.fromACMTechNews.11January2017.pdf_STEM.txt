abstract 

We have design a single-pixel camera with imag around corner base on comput 

ghost imaging. It can obtain the imag of an object when the camera cannot look at the object 

directly. our imag system explor the fact that a bucket detector in a ghost imag setup 

have no spatial resolut capability. A seri of experi have be design to confirm our 

predictions. thi camera have potenti applic for imag around corner or other similar 

environ where the object cannot be observ directly.

I. introduct 

ghost imag (gi) be first realiz by pittman et.al. in 1995 by employ entangl 

photon pair gener from spontan parametr down convers [1]. At the begin 

of the 21st century, it be realiz that GI could also be perform with classic light 

[2–10]. In thi system, a thermal light beam be split into two beam by a beam splitter. 

one beam be project onto an object. the light reflect from or pass through the 

object be collect by a bucket detector with no spatial resolution. the other beam be sent 

to a detector with spatial resolution. final the imag be reconstruct by correl the 

signal from these two detectors. the possibl applic of GI in militari and civilian have 

be studi by mani groups, such a high-ord correl ghost imag [11, 12], lensless 

ghost imag [13–18], ghost imag through turbul [19–22]. nevertheless, a charg 

coupl devic (ccd) be need to measur the intens fluctuat in a typic thermal 

light gi, becaus the intens fluctuat with spatial resolut of a typic thermal light 

can not be predicted. meanwhile, a beam splitter be also needed. these factor limit the 

develop of the practic applic of GI system in daili life. 

comput ghost imag (cgi) be propos in 2008 by shapiro [23]. the intens 

fluctuat of light in cgi be artifici modulated. the random, yet known, speckl 

pattern be project onto an unknown object. the spatial inform of detector signal 

be not needed, therefor a photodiod (pd) can be use to replac a ccd [24]. the need for 

the beam splitter and camera be remov in cgi, which help GI system becom simpler and 

more applicable. the practic applic of cgi be develop by more and more group 

[25–34]. the speed and qualiti of imag have both be improved, such a the real-tim 

video with the single-pixel detector [31] and the improv of the signal-to-nois ratio 

for differ system [32, 33]. moreover, some featur of cgi which the tradit camera 

do not have have be also propos and realized, such a 3D imag of cgi [34], imag 

of cgi through turbul and against scatter [26, 35]. they make cgi more signific 

in real life. 

In thi paper, we studi a featur of cgi that imag an object without look at 

it directly, which can be thought a a single-pixel camera with imag around corners. 

thi camera be base on the techniqu of single-pixel detector with cgi system. tradit 

camera cannot obtain the imag when it dose not see the object directly. however, the single- 

2 



pixel camera with imag around corner can get the imag under the same condition. other 

group also have achiev imag with similar abil [36]. their experi be base on the 

speckl autocorrel and phase-retriev algorithm. the scatter medium be need a 

lens. We use a differ approach to achiev the same idea and onli a single-pixel detector 

be needed. 

the articl be organ a follows. In sec.ii, we report the experiment result of cgi 

and imag around corner with the single-pixel detector, respectively. the discuss 

about the physic of the single-pixel camera with imag around corner be in sec.iii. 

section IV summari our conclusions. 

ii. experi 

In thi article, a seri of experi be design to studi the single-pixel camera with 

imag around corners. the first experi be show in fig. 1 (a), which be the basic 

scheme of cgi with a single-pixel detector. the light sourc be a projector (benq mw526). 

speckl patterns, control by computer, be project onto an object. the object be a 

transpar pattern “xjtu” and the size of each letter be 0.2 cm∗0.3 cm. the distanc 

between the projector and object be 30 cm. the transmit light through the object be 

receiv by a single-pixel detector (thorlab det36a/m). the function of the detector be 

to obtain the intens of light in one position. figur 2(a) show the imag of the object in 

the common cgi. 

To test cgi against scattering, a ground glass be place between the object and the 

detector a show in fig. 1 (b). light through the scatter medium will be scatter in 

all directions. figur 2(b) show the imag of xjtu under thi condition. the signal- 

to-nois ratio (snr) of fig. 2(a) and 2(b) be 18.02 dB and 17.92 db, respectively. the 

result indic that the qualiti of the imag be nearli the same a that of the imag in cgi 

without scatter media. snr be defin a snr = s̄(2)/σn, where s̄ be averag of the signal 

intensity, and σn be the varianc of the background intens [27]. the differ between 

the averag intens of the bright and dark region of imag be regard a the signal, and 

the variat of dark background be consid a the noise. 

base on the abov results, thi imag technolog be exploit a a single-pixel camera 

with imag around corners. the characterist of cgi against scatter be employed.

fig. 1. experiment setup of cgi. (a) be the basic scheme of cgi. A projector be control by 

comput which project a seri of speckl pattern onto an object. the object be transpar 

letter “xjtu”. the transmit light be receiv by a single-pixel detector. (b) be the scheme of 

cgi with scatter media. A ground glass be place between the object and the detector. the 

light transmit through the object will be disturb by thi media. 

fig. 2. the imag of the letter “xjtu” in cgi. (a) be the result of letter “xjtu” without 

scatter media. (b) be the imag in cgi with scatter media. two result be both calcul 

by 18,000 random patterns. 

figur 3(a) show the experiment scheme of the single-pixel camera with imag around 

corners. the same object “xjtu” be used. speckl pattern be control a 40∗40 matrix 

of black and white squar by computer. and the ratio of white and black squar be 0.11 

in the patterns. the chang speckl pattern be project onto the object. the distanc

fig. 3. the scheme of single-pixel camera with imag around corners. (a) be the basic scheme. 

the transpar letter “xjtu” be imaged. A light tight baffl between the object and the single- 

pixel detector be use for prevent the detector obtain the light from the object directly. (b) 

be the scheme with scatter media. (c) be the scheme of imag a three-dimension object with 

rough surface. thi diffus object be a common toy for child (a plane model). 

between the projector and object be 30 cm. the transmit light through the letter be 

reflect by the rough white wall. the distanc between the object and the wall be 15 cm. 

the single-pixel detector, which be 12 cm away from the wall, collect the reflect light. A 

light tight baffl be insert between the object and the single-pixel detector to avoid the 

detector receiv the signal from the object directly. the result be show in fig. 4(a), 

where the letter be imag clearly. To studi the abil of thi camera against scattering, 

a rotat ground glass (5 cm behind the object) be place between the object and the 

detector. the rotat speed of the ground glass be 1,200 cycles/min. the result be show 

in fig. 4(b). the snr of the imag in fig. 4(a) and fig. 4(b) be 17.34 dB and 17.51 db, 

5 



respectively. they indic that imag around corner with the single-pixel detector can 

imag clearli whether there be the scatter medium or not. especially, we use white paper a 

the distraction. two piec of paper be place at the differ locat behind the object. 

one be 120 mm behind the object and the other be 10 mm in front of the detector. the result 

be show in fig. 4(c) and the snr be 18.58 db. 

fig. 4. the imag of the letter “xjtu” by the single-pixel camera with imag around corners. 

(a) be the result of letter “xjtu” without scatter media. (b) be the imag through a rotat 

ground glass. (c) show the result when the ground glass be replac by the white paper. two 

piec of paper be place at two differ locations. the thick of paper be 0.05 mm. 

figur 3(c) show the scheme of imag the diffus object by the single-pixel camera 

with imag around corners. A three-dimension object with rough surfac be use a 

the imag target. the inset in fig. 5(a) be thi diffus object (a common toy plane for 

children). the size of object be 55 mm∗32 mm. speckl pattern be irradi on thi 

diffus object. the intens of light reflect from the object and the wall be veri weak. 

In addition, the environ light be significantli strong. under the circumstances, the 

detector will receiv more light from environ than from the object. tradit camera 

gener get a pictur with the misti light. the light becom disord and the imag be 

blur becaus of the reflect on the diffus object and the wall. however, the single-pixel 

camera with imag around corner can imag the object under the same condition. the 

result of imag by the camera with imag around corner be show in fig. 5(a), where 

the toy be imag clearly. the snr of the imag in fig. 5(a) be 23 db. the diffus object 

be more difficult to be imag than the simpl transmiss object, therefor the number 

of speckl pattern be increas to 50,000 to get a clear image. In addition, the resolut 

can be control by the computer. when the size of speckl pattern becom smaller, the 

resolut of the imag becom higher. fig. 5(b) be the result when the resolut increas 

to 4 time good than (a). all the detail of the object in fig. 5(b) becom more obvious. 

the snr of the imag becom 20 db. all result show that the single-pixel camera with 

6 



imag around corner can imag the diffus object when the camera cannot look at object 

directly. 

fig. 5. the imag and object in the experi of imag around corner with the single-pixel 

detector. the inset pictur in (a) be the diffus object (a common toy for children). (a) and (b) 

show the result of image. the number of pattern which be use to imag in two pictur be both 

50,000. the resolut ratio of (b) be 4 time good than (a). 

iii. theori and discuss 

the imag of the object in cgi be obtain via calcul the second-ord correlation, 

g(2)(x, y) = 
〈icom(x, y)idet〉 

〈icom(x, y)〉 〈idet〉 
, (1) 

where 〈〉 mean ensembl average. icom(x, y) be the intens distribut of speckl pattern 

which be control by computer. idet be the intens detect by the single-pixel detector. 

idet = 

∫∫ 
iobj(x 

′, y′)t (x′, y′)dx′dy′, (2) 

where iobj(x 
′, y′) be the intens of light in the object plane. T (x′, y′) be the transmiss 

function of the object. equat (1) can be simplifi a [4] 

g(2)(x, y) = 1 + 
〈∆icom(x, y)∆idet〉 

〈icom(x, y)〉 〈idet〉 
, (3) 

where ∆icom(x, y) and ∆idet be the intens fluctuat to their ensembl averages, respec- 

tively. It show that g(2)(x, y) depend on the second-ord intens fluctuat correl 

〈∆icom(x, y)∆idet〉. light first propag from the sourc to one point on object, and then 

7 



through thi point arriv in the detector plane. when the intens fluctuat of the de- 

tector signal contain the intens fluctuat of light through thi point on the object, the 

valu of g(2)(x, y) on the same locat of that point in the pictur would be great than 

1. At last, the object would be imag on the picture. when a ground glass be insert 

between the object and the detector, light be scatter in all directions. If the scatter be 

strong enough, the intens of the transmit light through all point on the object would 

be close to homogen distribut in space. the single-pixel detector can onli obtain 

part of light which be fulli scattered. furthermore, the light intens be rel weak. 

nevertheless, thi part of light still contain all inform of object, which mean that the 

single-pixel detector can get the inform of the intens fluctuat of light from everi 

point on the object. In addition, the signal of detector idet also contain the intens of 

light from the ground glass. becaus the intens from the glass and that from comput 

be independent, there be no correl between them. the effect from the ground glass 

will disappear when 〈∆icom(x, y)∆idet〉 be calcul [22]. the imag of the object can 

still be recov successfully. however, the visibl of the imag will becom low sinc 

the background 〈icom(x, y)〉 〈idet〉 rel increases. accord to the abov equat and 

discussions, cgi can still imag letter of xjtu through the scatter media. figur 2(b) 

show the result with scatter medium be similar a the imag in cgi without scatter 

media. furthermore, the snr of the imag of the transpar object in cgi be studied. 

figur 6 show the snr of the imag chang with the number of collect pattern in both 

cases. the differ of two case be whether the scatter medium exists. under two differ 

conditions, the curv have a good coincide. It illustr that the scatter medium behind 

object have littl effect to the qualiti of the image. 

when the scatter medium becom a reflect type, imag around corner with the 

single-pixel detector can be achieved. the transmit light through the object reach the 

white wall which replac the former ground glass. light with the inform of the object 

will be scatter into everi direct in the room, so the inform of the object can be 

obtain in mani places. idet will contain the intens of light reflect from the object, 

the white wall and optic noise. however, there be no correl between the intens of 

light control by comput and all intens of light except reflect from the object. It 

will be the same calcul a the one of cgi with scatter medium if the transmiss 

function of the scatter medium be replac by the reflect function of the white wall. the 

8 



fig. 6. the snr of images. the snr of the imag of the transpar object in cgi be measur 

in two cases. one case, which be repres a square, be that the scatter medium exists. the 

other case, which be repres a circle, be that the scatter medium do not exist. the tendenc 

of snr with the increas number of speckl pattern be shown. 

imag of the object will be show in the area where g(2)(x, y) be great than 1. imag 

through scatter layer and around corner be also studi by some research [36, 37]. 

they appli the memory-effect for speckl correl [36] and the fourier-domain shower- 

curtain effect [37] to imag the object. the differ between the strategi be that our 

imag system be a kind of “direct imaging” which be base on simpl product of intens 

of a bucket detector and preset speckl patterns. It do not need a complex comput 

such a phase retriev algorithms. the imag onli need that the correl be calculated. 

moreover, the detector in our experi be a single-pixel detector which be simpler than the 

high-megapixel camera. 

when a diffus object instead of the transmiss object be imaged, the intens would 

multipli by the reflect function instead of the transmiss function of the object in 

eq.(2). light with the inform of the object will be scatter again. the inform of 

the object can be obtain in mani place even though the intens of light be still extrem 

weak. under thi condition, there be still correl between the intens of light control 

by comput and the intens of light from the object. In the end, the imag of object will 

appear a if the sight of the single-pixel camera with imag around corner can bypass the 

barrier.

iv. conlus 

In conclusion, we design and accomplish the imag around corner with the single- 

pixel detector by a seri of experi about cgi with a single-pixel detector. thi 

imag around corner with the single-pixel detector obtain part of light reflect from 

the wall and cannot “see” the diffus object directly. however, it still can obtain the imag 

of the object. We analyz the featur of the camera without imag optimisation, so thi 

camera still have great potenti in enhanc imag qualiti and speed. with optim 

algorithm to make cgi faster and the experiment equip connect by a wireless 

system, the single-pixel camera with imag around corner can be a power equip 

in imag around corner and obstacl in real world.
