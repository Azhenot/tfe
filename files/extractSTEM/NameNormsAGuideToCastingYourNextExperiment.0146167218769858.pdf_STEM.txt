earli in the year 2016, oppon of donald trump’ candi- 
daci for presid of the unit states, base on their belief 
that it would undermin hi popularity, make an effort to 
public the origin version of hi surnam (chang centu- 
rie ago by hi ancestors): “drumpf.” concern with name 
and whether they should be chang be certainli not 
restrict to celebrities. In 2011, approxim 58,000 peo- 
ple in the unit kingdom have their name legal chang 
(mcclatchey, 2011). 

evid for the idea that person name matter—that is, 
that they have effect on how peopl be perceiv and treat 
by others—i more than anecdot (for review of the empiri- 
cal literature, see christopher, 1998; joubert, 1993; lawson, 
1984). for example, harari and mcdavid (1973) found that 
ident essay receiv significantli differ grade from 
teacher depend on whether they be attribut to chil- 
dren with what be at the time popular, evalu favor- 
abl name (e.g., “karen,” “lisa”), or to child with less 
desir name (e.g., “bertha,” “adelle”). In a studi by 
garwood, sulzer, levine, cox, and kaplan (1983), partici- 
pants’ decis about whether peopl describ in vignett 
should be reward or punish be significantli affect 
by the desir of those people’ names. brune and husa 
(1972) found that even elementari school student have 

differ behavior expect for peopl a a function of 
whether they have name with “active” (e.g., “otto,” “bruno”) 
or “passive” (e.g., “alfred,” “milton”) connotations. and 
research by topolinski, maschmann, pecher, and winkielman 
(2014) indic that subtl differ in the movement of 
the tongu and lip a one articul a person’ name can 
influenc one’ attitud toward that person.

abstract 
psychologist often test hypothesi by construct vignett depict peopl engag in behavior and display 
characterist design to operation specif variables. peopl describ in these vignett be typic give names, but 
name have a varieti of connot that could lead to unwant varianc between condit of an experi and in other 
way have implic for the result of a study. An up-to-d sourc of inform to help guid the select of name 
would be use for researchers. particip from four differ region of the unit state rat a larg sampl of name in 
term of perceiv age, warmth, and competence. the full set of name be presented, along with some simpl demonstr 
studi concret illustr the implic of name choice.

in these vignett be give names; if the vignett involv 
more than one character, do so be especi import so 
that research particip can more easili follow the narra- 
tive. these name can be select at random, or for idiosyn- 
cratic reasons. A research present a stori about a person 
engag in a seri of evalu ambigu behavior for 
the purpos of test trait prim effect might name the 
protagonist “donald” (higgins, rholes, & jones, 1977; srull 
& wyer, 1979). anoth research interest in the bias 
effect of stereotyp on memori might give the central 
charact in the vignett present to particip the name 
“betty” (snyder & uranowitz, 1978). the first author of thi 
articl onc creat a seri of vignett popul entir 
with the name of hi graduat school classmat (newman, 
duff, & baumeister, 1997, appendic A and b). 

however, the specif name select for charact in 
vignett could have implic for the result of one’ 
studies. researchers, of course, know thi intuitively. for 
example, their vignett rare if ever includ highli 
unusual, low frequenc names. In addition, unless an inves- 
tigat focu specif on stereotyping, prejudice, or 
discrimination, name strongli associ with specif 
national, ethnic, or racial group (e.g., “carlo ramirez”— 
bodenhausen & wyer, 1985) be also avoided. such intu- 
ition be well-founded. perhap the most well-known 
empir demonstr of the consequ of name selec- 
tion be kasof’ (1993) analysi of the materi use in 
hundr of studi of sexism. He found a tendenc to select 
“male name that be more attractive, more youthful, and 
more intellectu compet in their connot than 
be the femal name with which research contrast 
them” (p. 148). for example, of the 340 studi he reviewed, 
there be 204 case in which a “younger” male name be 
pair with an “older” femal name; the number of time 
that an old male name be pair with a young femal 
name be 15. In addition, these name bia systemati- 
calli covari with the outcom of such studies. overall, 
the name confound kasof (1993) reveal threaten the 
intern valid of not just individu studi but an entir 
program of research. 

other line of research could be prone to similar threat to 
validity, such a those consist of correspond audit 
studi (e.g., bertrand & mullainathan, 2014; gaddis, 2015, 
2017; pager, 2007). such studi might involv send 
almost-ident job applic to multipl employers, 
vari onli in the name of the applicants. manipul of 
the names’ gender, ethnicity, and race could also be con- 
found with those names’ other connotations. 

kasof’ (1993) articl includ more than a critic analy- 
si of prior research. He also make a contribut to subse- 
quent research by present a set of age-match name 
along with data on those names’ perceiv attract and 
compet (see hi appendix B and tabl 4 and 5). kasof 
suggest that research could consult hi list of name 
when design their own studies. By care select 

name from among those he provided, one could perhap 
avoid the confound that plagu sexism research. 

quit a few research have util kasof’ name 
data—and they continu to do so (e.g., brown & diekman, 
2013; gerhardstein & anderson, 2010; greitemeyer, 2009; 
rosett & tost, 2010; ruthig & holfeld, 2016; schneider, 
2014; uhlmann & zhu, 2014; weine, kim, & lincoln, 2016). 
note, though, that kasof’ norm be establish close to 
25 year ago; he himself point out that “becaus of histori- 
cal variat in forenam attract and connotation, the 
name pair that surviv thi statist select will sure 
becom mismatch at some futur time” (p. 153). hence, 
continu use of kasof’ name for experiment vignett 
would seem to be in violat of the spirit of hi work. In 
fact, close inspect of the specif name and how they 
be classifi reveal mani of them to be quit outdated. 
the name “linda,” for example, be say to be a “younger 
adult” name. A search of syracus university’ onlin direc- 
tori (on march 2, 2017) reveal onli five undergradu 
woman with that name, compar with 28 faculti and staff 
members. similarly, onli four undergradu student have 
the first name “gary” (also classifi a “younger adult” by 
kasof), compar with 23 faculti and staff members. By 
way of comparison, a search of the directori reveal 28 
undergradu woman with the name “kelsey,” compar 
with one solitari staff member. and although the onlin 
directori reveal that there be just one faculti member at 
the institut with the first name “dylan,” after list 50 
dylan from among the students, it could onli display the 
follow message: “the maximum number of result 
allow have be exceeded. pleas refin your search.” 

It be the natur of such norm to becom outdated. As just 
one more example, although kasof (1993) identifi the 
name “anne” a be an “older adult” name, 30 year ear- 
lier, most research particip in a studi by sheppard (1963) 
assum that ann be a young woman. thus, the primari 
goal of thi articl be to provid an up to date and extens 
databas of name and their connotations. As alreadi noted, 
kasof (1993) focu not just on age associ with first 
name but also on how the name be rat in term of 
compet and attractiveness. the current investig 
also includ percept of competence. but give the 
major role that the dimens of compet and warmth 
have play and continu to play in research and theori in 
the area of impress format (see fiske, cuddy, & glick, 
2007; judd, james-hawkins, yzerbyt, & kashima, 2005; 
rosenberg, nelson, & vivekananthan, 1968), we measur 
percept of warmth rather than gener attractiveness. 

A strength of thi studi be that particip be recruit 
from four differ geograph region of the unit states. 
the purpos of thi data collect plan be to help ensur 
that our result would not just reflect local idiosyncrasi (cf. 
buchanan & bruning, 1971, who publish an earli list of 
name connot base entir on a sampl of particip 
from ohio). 



newman et al. 3 

A second goal of the articl be to provid evid for the 
valid of the name norm by provid some simpl empir- 
ical demonstr of the consequ of use name that 
vari along the measur dimensions. studi 2 provid that 
evidence. 

studi 1 

method 

participants. particip (n = 497) be recruit in late 
2015 and earli 2016 from four differ studi sites. one 
hundr thirty-four colleg student be recruit from 
syracus univers (in the northeastern unit states), 154 
from mississippi state univers (in the south), 71 from 
dominican univers (the midwest), and 138 from cerrito 
colleg (the west coast). student volunt or receiv 
cours credit for their particip at each respect site. 

materials. name be extract from the social secur 
databas for our use (https://www.ssa.gov/oact/baby- 
names). all the name in the databas be from social secu- 
riti card applic for birth that occur in the unit 
state between 1879 and the end of februari 2015 (exclud- 
ing peopl born befor 1937 who never appli for a social 
secur card, and those who appli without indic the 
place of birth). 

for the purpos of the current research, we assembled, 
from the social secur database, name of peopl born in 
the six decad between the 1950 (1950-1959) and the 
aught (2000-2009). thi rang cover name of peopl who 
would now be a old a 67 or so year of age and a young a 
8 year old. use the rank inform provid by the 
social secur website,1 we identifi the top 200 most pop- 
ular name for each decad (the top 200 list). then, to select 
a manag number of name in a systemat way (and to 
includ both rel common and rel uncommon 
names), we identifi the top 20 most common male and 
femal names, and also name with posit number 91 to 
110 and 181 to 200 in the top 200 list for each decade. As a 
result, we be left with 120 repres name from the 
top 200 list (60 male name and 60 femal names) for each 
of the six decades. 

becaus the popular of some name remain some- 
what consist across the six decades, a number of name 
overlap across the six lists. for example, “william” be 
rank 6, 7, 9, 15, 18, 10, respectively, in each of the six 
decades. when combin the six list of 120 popular names, 
we retain onli one copi of each name that appear in one 
or more of our lists. thi procedur yield a list of 485 
uniqu spell name (233 male name and 252 femal 
names). In thi list, there be a number of case of altern 
spell of name that, in the judgment of the authors, would 
not have be consid by particip to be distinct in ani 
meaning way (e.g., “isabel” vs. “isabelle,” “jeffery” vs. 

“jeffrey,” “nichole” vs. “nicole”). We retain onli one 
form of spell for the studi in such cases. 

the final list consist of 200 male name and 200 femal 
names. To reduc the burden place on our particip 
(while also tri to ensur that all name would be rat an 
approxim equal number of times), these name be 
then randomli divid within gender into four list of 50 
names.2 each particip be randomli assign to receiv 
one of the set of 50 male name and one of the set of 50 
femal name (100 name total per participant).3 

procedure. the studi be run use qualtric software, and 
particip complet the studi online. particip be 
ask to complet three rate task for the 100 name pre- 
sent to them. they provid rate of perceiv age (how 
old do you think he or she is?), compet (how compet 
do you think he or she is?), and warmth (how warm do you 
think he or she is?) for those names. particip alway pro- 
vide age rate for all the name first; the order of the com- 
petenc and warmth rate be then random between 
participants. name for each rate task be group by 
gender, so that particip rat name for one gender first, 
and then for the other gender. whether a particip receiv 
male or femal name first be randomized. 

age rate task. particip be ask to “imagin that you 
be about to meet femal (or male, for the male names) 
individu with the follow names. how old do you think 
she (or he) be when you see the name? pleas rate her (or 
him) in term of age. If you feel uncertain, pleas use your 
intuit and make your best guess.” for each name, partici- 
pant be ask “how old do you think he or she is?” par- 
ticip be ask to provid rate on the follow 
9-point scale: <12, 12 to 17, 18 to 24, 25 to 34, 35 to 44, 45 
to 54, 55 to 64, 65 to 74, >75. for a give participant, the 
order in which the name be present be randomized, so 
that no one particip receiv the name in the same order. 

compet and warmth rate task. after particip com- 
plete the age rate task, they provid rate of compe- 
tenc and warmth for the names. first, the concept of 
“competence” and “warmth” be defin for them. partici- 
pant be present with the follow information: 

accord to research on person percept (fiske, cuddy, & 
glick, 2006), when peopl form impress of others, they 
usual evalu them in term of two fundament dimensions: 
compet and warmth. the compet dimens includ 
trait such a clever, competent, creative, efficient, foresighted, 
ingenious, intellig and knowledgeable. the warmth 
dimens includ trait such a popular, honest, humorous, 
fair, generous, helpful, righteous, sincere, and tolerant. 

particip then begin either the compet or warmth 
task, depend on the random order. for the compet 
rate task, particip be ask to “imagin that you be

about to meet femal (or male, for the male names) indi- 
vidual with the follow names. how compet do you 
think she be when you see the name? pleas rate her in term of 
competence. again, the compet dimens includ trait 
such a clever, competent, creative, efficient, foresighted, 
ingenious, intelligent, and knowledgeable. If you feel uncer- 
tain, pleas use your intuit and make your best guess.” for 
each name, particip be ask “how compet do you 
think she or he is?” under each question, we remind partici- 
pant of competence’ mean by restat that “compet 
= clever, competent, creative, efficient, foresighted, ingenious, 
intelligent, and knowledgeable.” particip rat compe- 
tenc on a 5-point scale rang from 1 = not at all to 5 = 
extremely. like the age rate task, the order in which a give 
particip rat the name be randomized. 

the procedur for the warmth rate task be identical, 
but particip be ask to “imagin that you be about to 
meet femal (or male) individu with the follow 
names. how warm do you think he be when you see the 
name? pleas rate him in term of warmth. again, the warmth 
dimens includ trait such a popular, honest, humorous, 
fair, generous, helpful, righteous, sincere, and tolerant. If you 
feel uncertain, pleas use your intuit and make your best 
guess.” for each of the rate question, particip be 
remind that “warmth = popular, honest, humorous, fair, 
generous, helpful, righteous, sincere, and tolerant.” 

result and discuss 

particip with 10 or more miss valu (n = 39, less than 
8% of participants) be drop from analysi so a to 
exclud particip who might not have be put suffi- 
cient effort into the (admittedli laborious) rate task. In 
addition, for 11 participants, there be no varianc on one or 
more of the judgment tasks. they be also drop from 
analyses, leav a final sampl of 447 participants. 

mixed-effect model be appli to the data use the 
proc mix procedur in the sa softwar package.4 the 
simultan nest of age/warmth/comp (Y 

ijk 
) respons 

within both rater and target name result in a cross-classifi 
data structur describ by the follow level 1 (response- 
level) equation: 

Y rijk jk ijk= +β0 , 

in which rate i provid by rater j evalu name k be 
compris of an intercept term that vari across both rater 
and name targets, in addit to a level 1 residu rijk . base 
on the standard “slope a outcomes” formul (see 
raudenbush & bryk, 2001), we decompos the level 1 
intercept term into it constitu fix and random compo- 
nents, a describ by the follow level 2 equation: 

β γ γ0 00 01 0 0jk j ku u= + + +×maletarget , 

where γ 
00 

be the fix compon of the intercept, which due 
to our use of an effect-cod scheme for gender (1 = female, 
–1 = male) correspond to the grand mean rate of Y (age, 
warmth, or competence) across all observations. γ 

01 
repre- 

sent the averag differ between male and femal name 
ratings, averag across all raters. finally, u 

0j 
and u0k repre- 

sent the subject-specif random effect (deviations) for rater 
j and target k. more specifically, the u 

0j 
term be rater specific, 

in the sens that everi particip provid hi or her own 
rate repres the participant’ deviat from the grand 
mean (in addit to the fixed-effect of target gender). for 
instance, particip with posit deviat rat all of 
their name a older, warmer, and more competent, averag- 
ing across all names. On the contrary, the u 

0k 
term be name 

target specific, in the sens that everi name target have it 
own rate score repres it deviat from the grand 
mean. name with posit deviat suggest that those 
name be rat older, warmer, and more competent, aver- 
age across all raters. these subject-specif deviat be 
typic summar a varianc ( τ00j 

2 
, τ00k 
2 ), along with the 

varianc of the aforement level 1 residu (σ2), which 
when combin will equal (within rounding) the observ 
margin varianc of all rate Y 

ijk 
. 

estim averag rate of each name (e-b estimates) 
be then calcul base on the follow equation: 

EB maletarget= + +×γ γ00 01 0u k . 

these estim mean rate (see tabl 1) take into account 
the disagr between rater (and do not differ substan- 
tialli from the raw mean ratings). 

reliability. the goal of the initi analysi be to determin 
whether or not particip be abl to make the age, 
warmth, and compet judgment with a reason degre 
of reliability. reliabl in the current studi take the form 
of a consensu or agreement estim (see kenny, 1994, for 
a thorough discussion). accord to generaliz theori 
(cronbach, gleser, nanda, & rajaratnam, 1972; see raykov 
& marcoulides, 2010, chapter 9 for a parallel explanation), 
consensu (reliabl of target ratings) be comput use 
the follow formula:

which describ the proport of total varianc in rate 
that be attribut to consensu across participant- 
rater regard the attribut of specif name targets. In the 
present data, we found moder consensu across rater 
regard age, ρ = 0.31, but low consensu across rater 
regard competence, ρ = 0.05, and warmth, ρ = 0.04. 

To provid other evid for the meaning of the

assess take a differ analyt approach. within 
each of the four set of names, pairwis correl be 
comput for each of the three differ rate (with indi- 
vidual name a the unit of analysis). for age ratings, these 
correl between site rang from r = .80 to r = .92, 
with a mean of .88 (calcul after fisher’ r to z transfor- 
mations, and convert back to r). for compet ratings, 
the rang be r = .44 to r = .75, with a mean of .58, while 
for warmth ratings, it be r = .40 to r = .69, with a mean of 
.54.5 parallel analysi run separ for male and femal 
name reveal correl similar to those found for both 
gender combined. 

In addition, to provid anoth estim of reliability, 
split-half correl be computed. within each of the 
four set of names, particip be randomli assign to 
two groups, and mean for the three rate be calcul 
for each group. for the age rate of the names, correl 
rang from r = .96 to r = .98. for compet ratings, the 
rang be r = .71 to r = .86, while for warmth ratings, it be 
r = .73 to r = .83. 

thus, the fact that consensu on warmth and compet 
be quit limit should not undermin the ratings’ utility. 
the mean present in tabl 1 can still serv a a guid to 
how differ name will, on average, be perceiv in term 
of those attributes.

SE = 0.01, t(400) = 4.53, p < .001 (for a similar finding, see

p < .001 (see also suitner & maass, 2008; wojciszk & 
abele, 2008; cf. imhoff & koch, 2017; judd et al., 2005). 
the correl for male name onli (r = .42) and femal 
name onli (r = .47) be consist with that relationship. 
given the posit correl between the warmth and 
compet dimensions, a number of name be evalu- 
ate similarli on both of them. but a might be expected, 
give the modest size of that correlation, a number of name 
elicit rel posit rate on one dimens and 
neg rate on the other. thus, certain names, for dif- 
ferent reasons, can trigger ambival reactions. the name 
associ with rel extrem estim mean rate 
on both dimens (identifi by mean of quintil split 
of the distributions) can be found in tabl 2. consist 
with cross-cultur gender stereotyp (fiske, 2017), the 
“high-competence, low warmth” pattern be domin by 
male names, while the “low-competence, high warmth” 
pattern be domin by femal names.6 

consist with past research on ageism among colleg 
student (nelson, 2005; north & fiske, 2012), a markedli 
neg correl between perceiv age and warmth 
be found, r = –.50, p < .001. the correl for male 
name onli (r = –.54) and femal name onli (r = –.45) 
be quit similar. interestingly, perceiv age and compe- 
tenc be posit correlated, r = .28, p < .001, and a 
similar relationship be found when male (r = .30) and 
femal (r = .26) name be analyz separately. thi find- 
ing be arguabl consist with other in the literatur 
reveal ambival attitud about aging; old peopl 
be often perceiv a be rel wise and honest, 
despit be neg evalu in a more general, global 
way (e.g., chonody, 2016; mueller-johnson, toglia, 
sweeney, & ceci, 2007).7 

studi 2 

the data collect in studi 1 could potenti be of interest 
in and of themselves, but for experiment psychologists, 
they will be of valu primarili to the extent that they help 
them control for unwant varianc in their depend vari- 
ables. the goal of studi 2 be to provid a few straightfor- 
ward exampl of how the name select by research for 
the target of people’ social judgment could meaning 
affect those judgments.

materials. An onlin imag search yield headshot photo- 
graph of two peopl (one man, one woman) whose age 
were—in the opinion of the first two author and their 
research assistants—ambigu (both peopl could have 
be anywher from their late 20 to earli 50s). We select 
two male name that be rat in studi 1 to be among those 
associ with the old peopl (“earl” and “herbert”) and 
two that be at the other end of the distribut and associ- 
ate with young peopl (“dylan” and “logan”).8 the same 
procedur be follow for femal names, result in the 
select of two “old” name (“maureen” and “delores”) 
and two young one (“abby” and “isabella”). the rate for 
these eight name were, on average, 1.9 sd abov or below 
the grand mean for perceiv age. the pictur be pre- 
sent to particip along with a name promin appear- 
ing at the bottom of the image. To simplifi the design (and to 
reduc the possibl that a particip would becom suspi- 
ciou if present with two name clearli associ with 
much old people), four version of the age rate materi 
be prepar with these combin of pictur and name 
(in all cases, one “young” and one “old”): dylan/maureen, 
earl/isabella, herbert/abby, and logan/delores. the instruc- 
tion to particip be a follows: “below be photo- 
graph of two people. pleas guess how old (in years) each 
one is.” A space be provid for each guess. 

the data collect in studi 1 be also use to select 
name that repres rel extrem level (both high 
and low) of compet and warmth. for the compet 
rate task, particip be present with a vignett 
describ the behavior of a femal protagonist that be 
write to be ambigu with respect to the intellig or 
compet it indic (see the appendix). they be ask 
to provid intellig and compet rate for the pro- 
tagonist (in that order), whose name varied. two femal 
name that be rat high on compet in studi 
1—“elizabeth” and “olivia”—and two that be rat 
low—“crystal” and “mercedes”—wer select for the 
name manipul (rate for these four name were, on 
average, 2.0 sd abov or below the grand mean for per- 
ceiv competence). rate be make on 5-point scale (1 
= not at all, 2 = slightly, 3 = somewhat, 4 = very, and 5 = 
extremely). 

for the warmth rate task, particip be present 
with a vignett describ the behavior of a male protagonist 
that be ambigu with respect to the warmth or hostil it 
indicated; it be a modifi version of the well-known 
“donald” paragraph develop by srull and wyer (1979) 
and use by subsequ research (see the appendix). they 
be ask to provid warmth and hostil rate for the 
protagonist (in that order), whose name varied. two male 

name that be rat high in warmth in studi 1—“charlie” 
and “thomas”—and two that be rat low—“dominic” 
and “brett”—wer select for the name manipul (rat- 
ing for these four name were, on average, 1.2 sd abov or 
below the grand mean for perceiv warmth). warmth and 
hostil rate be again make on 5-point scale rang 
from not at all to extremely. 

procedure. particip receiv a booklet that includ all 
three tasks. all particip complet the age rate task 
first; whether the booklet they receiv present the compe- 
tenc or warmth rate task next be randomized. A give 
participant’ booklet includ one of the follow pair of 
name for the compet and warmth rate tasks: mer- 
cedes/charlie, crystal/thomas, elizabeth/dominic, or 
olivia/brett. thus, when a participant’ booklet includ a 
name expect to elicit rel high rate of warmth, it 
also includ a name expect to elicit rel low rate 
of competence. similarly, “hostile” name be pair with 
“competent” names. 

result 

age judgments. given the studi design, each particip be 
present with one pictur of a person with an “older” name, 
and one with a “younger” name. A paired-sampl t test 
reveal that peopl label with name associ with 
old peopl be perceiv to be significantli old (39.7 
years) than peopl label with name associ with 
young peopl (38.6 years), t(370) = 2.19, p = .029, 95% 
confid interv (ci) = [0.112, 2.109], d = 0.11.9 

competence/intellig judgments. intellig and compe- 
tenc rate be surprisingli uncorrelated, r = .09, p = .10. 
there be also significantli more varianc in compet 
(s2 = 0.71) than intellig (s2 = 0.49) judgments, f(370, 
370) = 1.45, p < .001. particip might have be uncer- 
tain how to defin “competence.” thus, perceiv intelli- 
genc and perceiv compet be analyz a separ 
depend variables. 

when particip read vignett about someon with a 
question level of intelligence, they be significantli 
more like to see her a be intellig when her name be 
one associ by studi 1 particip with intellig (M = 
3.49) than when her name be one associ by studi 1 
particip with low level intellig (M = 3.31), t(369) = 
2.45, p = .013, d = 0.26, 95% CI = [0.038, 0.322]. although 
the differ be in the same direction, the comparison for 
compet judgment do not reveal a signific differ 
(M = 2.86 vs. M = 2.79, p = .39). 

warmth/hostil judgments. warmth and hostil rate be 
neg correlated, a expect (r = –.24, p < .001). hostil- 
iti rate be revers scored; the mean rate for hostil 
and warmth be then averag to yield an overal measur

of warmth. when particip read vignett about someon 
whose behavior be ambigu with respect to warmth/hos- 
tility, they saw him a be warmer when hi name be one 
associ by studi 1 particip with warmth (M = 2.57) 
than when hi name be one associ by studi 1 partici- 
pant with low level of warmth (M = 2.48). however, in thi 
case, the differ do not reach convent level of sta- 
tistic significance, t(369) = 1.35, p = .18, d = 0.14, 95% CI 
= [–0.045, 0.240]. post hoc rate of warmth and hostil 
judgment separ also do not yield signific differ 
(p = .16 and p = .44, respectively). 

discuss 

the goal of studi 2 be to provid some preliminari valida- 
tion of the data collect in studi 1 by demonstr how 
the name select by research for the target of people’ 
social judgment could be associ with variat in those 
judgments. the small sampl of name use for the stimulu 
person in studi 2 be select simpli becaus they be 
exampl of name perceiv to be associ with young 
and older, warmer and less warm, and compet and less 
compet people. 

the mean differ be in the predict direct for 
all three judgment type (age, intelligence, and warmth) and 
be statist signific in the case of the first two. the 
differ found be modest in magnitude, but there be no 
reason to assum that studi 2’ find be repres 
of the effect size that might be associ with name differ- 
ences. those effect size will undoubtedli vari a a function 
of a number of factors, includ the complex and ambi- 
guiti of the other social inform present to research 
participants. for example, past research indic that when 
a great deal of addit inform be present along 
with names, name be more like to have modest effect 
on judgment (o’sullivan, chen, mohapatra, sigelman, & 
lewis, 1988; young, kennedy, newhouse, browne, & 
thiessen, 1993).10 thi could have play a role in the non- 
signific effect for warmth judgment (over and abov 
the fact that the warm/cold exemplar be not a extrem 
a be those for the other two dimensions); the vignett 
present for that purpos be over 20% longer than the 
vignett present for intelligence/compet judgments. 

gener discuss 

experiment design, at the most abstract level, be an exercis 
in varianc control. research seek to minim unwant 
varianc between condit of an experiment, and maxim 
the potenti of their independ variabl to account for 
varianc in their depend variables. If they be interest in 
the effect of categor peopl a male or females, they 
would like to avoid have the conclus they reach cloud 
by the consequ of have name a particular target per- 
son “deborah” and anoth “duane.” If they be interest in 
the effect on social judgment and impress format of 

manipul the kind of behavior inform provid to 
participants, they would prefer that the size of their effect 
not be constrain a a result of have name a target person 
“marcia” or “grace.” kasof (1993), among others, have alert 
experiment to the consequ of arbitrarili name 
one’ stimulu persons. thus, the goal of thi investig 
be to provid research an extens and up to date data- 
base of person name and their connotations. 

the name of stimulu person could also have implica- 
tion for the replic of research findings. van bavel, 
mende-siedlecki, brady, and reinero (2016) found that the 
replic of a studi be depend to an extent on the likeli- 
hood that the studi a it be origin run be context- 
dependent—that is, whether the procedur and/or materi 
have the potenti to be constru differ by differ 
group of particip a a function of time and place. one of 
the variabl that might lead to chang in the construal of 
research materi could be the name of stimulu persons. 
for example, conduct an exact replic of higgins, 
rholes, and jones’ (1977) and srull and wyer’ (1979) clas- 
sic trait prim studi from the 1970 would requir one to 
name the person engag in the ambigu behavior pre- 
sent to particip “donald.” however, a glanc at the 
data present in studi 1 suggest that do so today could 
be a mistake; it could lead one to find a bia toward negativ- 
iti in impress format that overshadow the prim 
effect. the result of previou research could fail to replicate, 
for reason have noth to do with the valid and reli- 
abil of the effect in the origin studies. 

the data present in thi articl be collect from par- 
ticip in the unit states. the name in tabl 1 could of 
cours have differ connot elsewhere, includ in 
other english speak countries. anoth limit of thi 
research be that although a person’ age, warmth, and compe- 
tenc be import piec of inform for social perceivers, 
other characterist have an impact on the impress form 
of others, and name could signal people’ stand on some 
of those characterist too. for example, name can signal 
socioeconom statu (gaddis, 2015; joubert, 1994); indeed, it 
be like that social class infer play a signific role in 
the compet rate make by our participants. slepian and 
galinski (2016) found that how name be pronounced— 
more specifically, the vocal cord vibrat involved—ha 
implic for percept of people’ genders. name 
requir more vibrat of the vocal chord to pronounc be 
associ with males, but those involv unvoic pho- 
neme (which requir no vibrat of the vocal chords) be 
more like to be associ with females. name sure signal 
other social characterist a well. 

also unaddress in thi articl be the possibl that the 
effect of have specif name could interact with other 
characterist of the peopl with those names—for example, 
people’ ethnic or racial identities. there be no reason to 
assum that the consequ of assign a give name to a 
black, white, asian, latino, or ani other kind of target per- 
son will be identical.

finally, the data present here will ultim meet the 
same fate a kasof’s; they will becom outdated. however, 
for the forese future, we hope they will be of valu to 
experiment seek both to avoid confound in their 
experi and to maxim the control of unwant vari- 
anc in their outcom variables. 

appendix 

vignettes, studi 2 (with repres names) 

ambigu intelligent/competent. crystal be late to the 
offic yesterday becaus she forgot to set her alarm the night 
before. but she get right to work, and be one of the first of 
her colleagu to figur out how to use the new softwar that 
have be instal on everyone’ computers. unfortunately, 
she have troubl teach anyon els how to use the soft- 
ware—they kept get confus by her explanations. 

crystal and one of her colleagu then ate lunch together. 
they have to take an extra long lunch break, becaus the first 
restaur they go to be closed; crystal actual knew that 
the place have go out of business, but she have forgotten. 
becaus of that, she have to stay at the offic extra hour last 
night to get her work completed. she get it done, though, and 
be abl to hand it in to her bo just a few minut past the 
time it be due today. later, crystal left work 25 min early, 
becaus she have an appoint to meet up with an onlin 
date for the first time and do not want to get stuck in traffic. 

ambigu warm/hostile. I ran into my old acquaint 
brett the other day, and I decid to go over and visit him, 
sinc by coincid we take our vacat at the same time. 
soon after I arrived, a salesman knock at the door, but 
brett didn’t want to talk to him. He also told me that he be 
not go to pay hi rent until the landlord do some repair 
in hi apartment. We talk for a while, have lunch, and then 
go out for a ride. We use my car, a brett’ car have broken 
down that morning, and he told the garag mechan that he 
would have to go somewher els if he couldn’t fix hi car 
that same day. We go to the park for about an hour and then 
stop at a hardwar store. I couldn’t find what I be look- 
ing for, but brett suggest we walk a few block to anoth 
store. the red cross have set up a stand by the door and ask 
u to donat blood. brett hate give blood, and he get out 
of it by claim he have diabet and therefor could not 
donate. By the time we get to the other store, it be closed. It 
be get kind of late, so I take brett to pick up hi car and 
we agre to meet again a soon a possible.

2. some of the names—for example, “chris,” “robin”—ar

ticip knew whether ani give name be be rat a a 
male or femal name. 

3. our procedur for assembl a set of name lead u to come 
up with veri few that would be uncommon among european 
americans. however, seventeen name on the final list— 
aaliyah, antonio, cesar, fernando, jaden, jaime, jalen, javier, 
jermaine, jesus, jose, latasha, latoya, miguel, pedro, sergio, 
and yesenia—wer strongli associ with latin- or african 
american individuals. research in the unit state (for 
whom the norm present in thi articl would be most rele- 
vant) would be unlik to select such name for their vignett 
unless they be explicitli attempt to manipul perceiv 
race or ethnicity. particip judgment about these name 
also rais veri import issu that the current studi be not 
design to address; no attempt be make to systemat 
select repres set of name associ with specif eth- 
nic or racial groups. thus, these data be not present in the 
tabl or includ in the analysi report here (although they 
be avail upon request). note that if our procedur have lead 
to the select of name such a mingxuan, yitzhak, lyudmila, 
or ahmed, the same consider would have arisen. 

4. We be grate for the extraordinarili gener technic 
assist provid by robert wickham with the analysi 
report in thi section and their write-up. 

5. all r be associ with p valu of less than .001. 
6. relax the criterion a bit (use tertiari splits) allow for 

the identif of chase, jesse, justin, logan, riley, and 
tyler a male name rel low in perceiv compet 
and high in perceiv warmth, and carol, deborah, donna, 
margaret, maureen, and mildr a femal name rel 
high in perceiv compet and low in perceiv warmth. 
note, however, that the male name tend to be “younger” and 
the femal name “older.” 

7. follow-up analysi reveal no evid for a curvilinear 
trend; thus, the linear effect do not obscur ani tendenc 
for compet rate to drop off for name more like to be 
associ with the old people. 

8. for the rate associ with these and all other name use 
in studi 2, see tabl 1. 

9. inspect of the mean for individu name reveal that 
within gender, the name associ with old peopl elicit 
mean age judgment that be high than name associ 
with young peopl with one exception: earl be see a 
be young than dylan and logan. 

10. but not always—cf. kasof (1993). It be not clear, though, 
what variabl moder the extent to which the quantiti and 
complex of social inform will dampen the effect of 
names.
