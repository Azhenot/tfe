the modern scienc of network have brought signific advanc to our understand of complex 
systems. one of the most relev featur of graph repres real system be commun 
structure, or clustering, i. e. the organ of vertex in clusters, with mani edg join 
vertex of the same cluster and compar few edg join vertex of differ clusters. such 
clusters, or communities, can be consid a fairli independ compart of a graph, play 
a similar role like, e. g., the tissu or the organ in the human body. detect commun 
be of great import in sociology, biolog and comput science, disciplin where system be 
often repres a graphs. thi problem be veri hard and not yet satisfactorili solved, despit 
the huge effort of a larg interdisciplinari commun of scientist work on it over the past few 
years. We will attempt a thorough exposit of the topic, from the definit of the main element 
of the problem, to the present of most method developed, with a special focu on techniqu 
design by statist physicists, from the discuss of crucial issu like the signific of 
cluster and how method should be test and compar against each other, to the descript 
of applic to real networks.

I. introduct 

the origin of graph theori date back to euler’ solu- 
tion of the puzzl of königsberg’ bridg in 1736 (euler, 
1736). sinc then a lot have be learn about graph 
and their mathemat properti (bollobas, 1998). In 
the 20th centuri they have also becom extrem use 
a represent of a wide varieti of system in differ 
areas. biological, social, technological, and inform 
network can be studi a graphs, and graph analysi 
have becom crucial to understand the featur of these 
systems. for instance, social network analysi start in 
the 1930’ and have becom one of the most import 
topic in sociolog (scott, 2000; wasserman and faust, 
1994). In recent times, the comput revolut have pro- 
vide scholar with a huge amount of data and computa- 
tional resourc to process and analyz these data. the 
size of real network one can potenti handl have also 
grown considerably, reach million or even billion of 
vertices. the need to deal with such a larg number of 
unit have produc a deep chang in the way graph be 
approach (albert and barabási, 2002; barrat et al., 
2008; boccaletti et al., 2006; mend and dorogovtsev, 
2003; newman, 2003; pastor-satorra and vespignani, 
2004). 

graph repres real system be not regular like, 
e. g., lattices. they be object where order coexist with 
disorder. the paradigm of disord graph be the ran- 
dom graph, introduc by P. erdö and A. rényi (erdö 
and rényi, 1959). In it, the probabl of have an 
edg between a pair of vertex be equal for all possibl 
pair (see appendix). In a random graph, the distribu- 
tion of edg among the vertex be highli homogeneous. 
for instance, the distribut of the number of neigh- 
bour of a vertex, or degree, be binomial, so most ver- 
tice have equal or similar degree. real network be 
not random graphs, a they display big inhomogeneities, 
reveal a high level of order and organization. the de- 
gree distribut be broad, with a tail that often follow 
a power law: therefore, mani vertex with low degre 
coexist with some vertex with larg degree. further- 
more, the distribut of edg be not onli globally, but 
also local inhomogeneous, with high concentr of 
edg within special group of vertices, and low concen- 
tration between these groups. thi featur of real net- 
work be call commun structur (girvan and new- 
man, 2002), or clustering, and be the topic of thi review 
(for earli review see refs. (danon et al., 2007; fortu- 
nato and castellano, 2009; newman, 2004a; porter et al., 
2009; schaeffer, 2007)). communities, also call cluster 
or modules, be group of vertex which probabl share 
common properti and/or play similar role within the 
graph. In fig. 1 a schemat exampl of a graph with 
commun be shown. 

societi offer a wide varieti of possibl group organi- 
zations: families, work and friendship circles, villages, 
towns, nations. the diffus of internet have also lead 
to the creation of virtual groups, that live on the web,

like onlin communities. indeed, social commun have 
be studi for a long time (coleman, 1964; freeman, 
2004; kottak, 2004; moodi and white, 2003). communi- 
tie also occur in mani network system from biology, 
comput science, engineering, economics, politics, etc. 
In protein-protein interact networks, commun be 
like to group protein have the same specif function 
within the cell (chen and yuan, 2006; rive and galitski, 
2003; spirin and mirny, 2003), in the graph of the world 
wide web they may correspond to group of page deal- 
ing with the same or relat topic (dourisbour et al., 
2007; flake et al., 2002), in metabol network they may 
be relat to function modul such a cycl and path- 
way (guimerà and amaral, 2005; palla et al., 2005), 
in food web they may identifi compart (kraus 
et al., 2003; pimm, 1979), and so on. 

commun can have concret applications. cluster- 
ing web client who have similar interest and be ge- 
ograf near to each other may improv the perfor- 
manc of servic provid on the world wide web, in 
that each cluster of client could be serv by a dedi- 
cat mirror server (krishnamurthi and wang, 2000). 
identifi cluster of custom with similar interest 
in the network of purchas relationship between cus- 
tomer and product of onlin retail (like, e. g., 
www.amazon.com) enabl to set up effici recommen- 
dation system (reddi et al., 2002), that good guid 
custom through the list of item of the retail and 
enhanc the busi opportunities. cluster of larg 
graph can be use to creat data structur in order 
to effici store the graph data and to handl naviga- 



3 

tional queries, like path search (agraw and jagadish, 
1994; Wu et al., 2004). Ad hoc network (perkins, 2001), 
i. e. self-configur network form by commun 
node act in the same region and rapidli chang 
(becaus the devic move, for instance), usual have 
no central maintain rout tabl that specifi how 
node have to commun to other nodes. group the 
node into cluster enabl one to gener compact rout- 
ing tabl while the choic of the commun path 
be still effici (steenstrup, 2001). 

commun detect be import for other reasons, 
too. identifi modul and their boundari allow for 
a classif of vertices, accord to their structur 
posit in the modules. so, vertex with a central posi- 
tion in their clusters, i. e. share a larg number of edg 
with the other group partners, may have an import 
function of control and stabil within the group; ver- 
tice lie at the boundari between modul play an im- 
portant role of mediat and lead the relationship and 
exchang between differ commun (alik to cser- 
mely’ “creativ elements” (csermely, 2008)). such clas- 
sific seem to be meaning in social (burt, 1976; 
freeman, 1977; granovetter, 1973) and metabol net- 
work (guimerà and amaral, 2005). finally, one can 
studi the graph where vertex be the commun and 
edg be set between cluster if there be connect be- 
tween some of their vertex in the origin graph and/or 
if the modul overlap. In thi way one attain a coarse- 
grain descript of the origin graph, which unveil 
the relationship between modul 1. recent studi indi- 
cate that network of commun have a differ degre 
distribut with respect to the full graph (palla et al., 
2005); however, the origin of their structur can be ex- 
plain by the same mechan (pollner et al., 2006). 

anoth import aspect relat to commun struc- 
ture be the hierarch organ display by most 
network system in the real world. real network be 
usual compos by commun includ small com- 
munities, which in turn includ small communities, etc. 
the human bodi offer a paradigmat exampl of hier- 
archic organization: it be compos by organs, organ 
be compos by tissues, tissu by cells, etc. anoth 
exampl be repres by busi firms, who be char- 
acter by a pyramid organization, go from the 
worker to the president, with intermedi level corre- 
spond to work groups, depart and management. 
herbert A. simon have emphas the crucial role play 
by hierarchi in the structur and evolut of complex 

1 coarse-grain a graph gener mean map it onto a 
small graph have similar properties, which be easi to handle. 
for thi purpose, the vertex of the origin graph be not nec- 
essarili group in communities. gfeller and De lo rio have 
propos coarse-grain scheme that keep the properti of dy- 
namic process act on the graph, like random walk (gfeller 
and De lo rios, 2007) and synchron (gfeller and De lo 
rios, 2008). 

system (simon, 1962). the gener and evolut of 
a system organ in interrel stabl subsystem be 
much quicker than if the system be unstructured, be- 
caus it be much easi to assembl the small subpart 
first and use them a build block to get larg struc- 
tures, until the whole system be assembled. In thi way 
it be also far more difficult that error (mutations) occur 
along the process. 

the aim of commun detect in graph be to iden- 
tifi the modul and, possibly, their hierarch orga- 
nization, by onli use the inform encod in the 
graph topology. the problem have a long tradit and it 
have appear in variou form in sever disciplines. the 
first analysi of commun structur be carri out by 
weiss and jacobson (weiss and jacobson, 1955), who 
search for work group within a govern agency. 
the author studi the matrix of work relationship 
between member of the agency, which be identifi by 
mean of privat interviews. work group be separ 
by remov the member work with peopl of differ- 
ent groups, which act a connector between them. thi 
idea of cut the bridg between group be at the ba- 
si of sever modern algorithm of commun detect 
(section v). research on commun actual start 
even earli than the paper by weiss and jacobson. al- 
readi in 1927, stuart rice look for cluster of peopl 
in small polit bodies, base on the similar of their 
vote pattern (rice, 1927). two decad later, georg 
homan show that social group could be reveal by 
suitabl rearrang the row and the column of matri- 
ce describ social ties, until they take an approxim 
block-diagon form (homans, 1950). thi procedur be 
now standard. meanwhile, tradit techniqu to find 
commun in social network be hierarch cluster- 
ing and partit cluster (section iv.b and iv.c), 
where vertex be join into group accord to their 
mutual similarity. 

identifi graph commun be a popular topic in 
comput science, too. In parallel computing, for in- 
stance, it be crucial to know what be the best way to 
alloc task to processor so a to minim the commu- 
nicat between them and enabl a rapid perform 
of the calculation. thi can be accomplish by split 
the comput cluster into group with roughli the same 
number of processors, such that the number of physi- 
cal connect between processor of differ group be 
minimal. the mathemat formal of thi prob- 
lem be call graph partit (section iv.a). the first 
algorithm for graph partit be propos in the 
earli 1970’s. 

In a semin paper appear in 2002, girvan and new- 
man propos a new algorithm, aim at the identifica- 
tion of edg lie between commun and their suc- 
cessiv removal, a procedur that after some iter 
lead to the isol of the commun (girvan and 
newman, 2002). the intercommun edg be detect 
accord to the valu of a central measure, the edg 
betweenness, that express the import of the role

of the edg in process where signal be transmit 
across the graph follow path of minim length. the 
paper trigger a big activ in the field, and mani new 
method have be propos in the last years. In partic- 
ular, physicist enter the game, bring in their tool 
and techniques: spin models, optimization, percolation, 
random walks, synchronization, etc., becom ingredi 
of new origin algorithms. the field have also take ad- 
vantag of concept and method from comput science, 
nonlinear dynamics, sociology, discret mathematics. 

In thi manuscript we tri to cover in some detail the 
work do in thi area. We shall pay a special atten- 
tion to the contribut make by physicists, but we shall 
also give proper credit to import result obtain by 
scholar of other disciplines. section II introduc com- 
muniti in real networks, and be suppos to make the 
reader acquaint with the problem and it relevance. In 
section iii we defin the basic element of commun 
detection, i. e. the concept of commun and parti- 
tion. tradit cluster method in comput and 
social sciences, i. e. graph partitioning, hierarchical, 
partit and spectral cluster be review in sec- 
tion iv. modern methods, divid into categori base 
on the type of approach, be present in section V 
to X. algorithm to find overlap communities, mul- 
tiresolut and hierarch techniques, be separ 
describ in section XI and xii, respectively, wherea 
section xiii be devot to the detect of commun 
evolv in time. We stress that our categor of the 
algorithm be not sharp, becaus mani algorithm may 
enter more categories: we tri to classifi them base 
on what we believ be their main feature/purpose, even 
if other aspect may be present. section xiv and XV 
be devot to the issu of defin when commun 
structur be significant, and decid about the qualiti of 
algorithms’ performances. In section xvi and xvii we 
describ gener properti of cluster found in real net- 
works, and specif applic of cluster algorithms. 
section xviii contain the summari of the review, along 
with a discuss about futur research direct in thi 
area. the review make use of sever concept of graph 
theory, that be defin and explain in the appendix. 
reader not acquaint with these concept be urg to 
read the appendix first. 

ii. commun IN real-world network 

In thi section we shall present some strike exampl 
of real network with commun structure. In thi way 
we shall see what commun look like and whi they 
be important. 

social network be paradigmat exampl of graph 
with communities. the word commun itself refer to 
a social context. peopl natur tend to form groups, 
within their work environment, family, friends. 

In fig. 2 we show some exampl of social networks. 
the first exampl (fig. 2a) be zachary’ network of karat 

club member (zachary, 1977), a well-known graph reg- 
ularli use a a benchmark to test commun detect 
algorithm (section xv.a). It consist of 34 vertices, the 
member of a karat club in the unit states, who be 
observ dure a period of three years. edg connect 
individu who be observ to interact outsid the ac- 
tiviti of the club. At some point, a conflict between 
the club presid and the instructor lead to the fission of 
the club in two separ groups, support the instruc- 
tor and the president, respect (indic by squar 
and circles). the question be whether from the origin 
network structur it be possibl to infer the composit 
of the two groups. indeed, by look at fig. 2a one 
can distinguish two aggregations, one around vertex 33 
and 34 (34 be the president), the other around vertex 1 
(the instructor). one can also identifi sever vertex 
lie between the two main structures, like 3, 9, 10; such 
vertex be often misclassifi by commun detect 
methods. 

fig. 2b display the larg connect compon of 
a network of collabor of scientist work at the 
santa Fe institut (sfi). there be 118 vertices, repre- 
sent resid scientist at sfi and their collaborators. 
edg be place between scientist that have publish 
at least one paper together. the visual layout al- 
low to distinguish disciplinari groups. In thi network 
one observ mani cliques, a author of the same pa- 
per be all link to each other. there be but a few 
connect between most groups. 

In fig. 2c we show the network of bottlenos dol- 
phin live in doubt sound (new zealand) analyz 
by lusseau (lusseau, 2003). there be 62 dolphin and 
edg be set between anim that be see togeth 
more often than expect by chance. the dolphin sep- 
arat in two group after a dolphin left the place for 
some time (squar and circl in the figure). such group 
be quit cohesive, with sever intern cliques, and eas- 
ili identifiable: onli six edg join vertex of differ- 
ent groups. due to thi natur classif lusseau’ 
dolphins’ network, like zachary’ karat club, be often 
use to test algorithm for commun detect (sec- 
tion xv.a). 

protein-protein interact (ppi) network be subject 
of intens investig in biolog and bioinformatics, 
a the interact between protein be fundament for 
each process in the cell (zhang, 2009). fig. 3 illustr 
a ppi network of the rat proteom (jonsson et al., 2006). 
each interact be deriv by homolog from experimen- 
talli observ interact in other organisms. In our 
example, the protein interact veri frequent with each 
other, a they belong to metastat cells, which have a 
high motil and invas with respect to normal 
cells. commun correspond to function groups, i. e. 
to protein have the same or similar functions, which 
be expect to be involv in the same processes. the 
modul be label by the overal function or the dom- 
inat protein class. most commun be associ 
to cancer and metastasis, which indirectli show how im-

portant detect modul in ppi network is. 

relationships/interact between element of a sys- 
tem need not be reciprocal. In mani case they have a 
precis direction, that need to be take into account to 
understand the system a a whole. As an exampl we can 
cite predator-prey relationship in food webs. In fig. 4 
we see anoth example, take from technology. the 
system be the world wide web, which can be see a a 
graph by repres web page a vertex and the hy- 
perlink that make user move from one page to anoth 
a edg (albert et al., 1999). hyperlink be directed: 
if one can move from page A to page B by click on a 

hyperlink of A, one usual do not find on B a hyper- 
link take back to A. In fact, veri few hyperlink (less 
than 10%) be reciprocal. commun of the web graph 
be group of page have topic similarities. detect- 
ing commun in the web graph may help to identifi 
the artifici cluster creat by link farm in order to 
enhanc the pagerank (brin and page, 1998) valu of 
web site and grant them a high googl ranking. In 
thi way one could discourag thi unfair practice. one 
usual assum that the exist of a hyperlink between 
two page impli that they be content-related, and that 
thi similar be independ of the hyperlink direction.

therefor it be customari to neglect the directed of 
the hyperlink and to consid the graph a undirected, 
for the purpos of commun detection. On the other 
hand, take properli into account the directed of 
the edg can consider improv the qualiti of the par- 
tition(s), a one can handl a lot of preciou inform 
about the system. moreover, in some instanc neglect- 
ing edg directed may lead to strang result (leicht 

and newman, 2008; rosval and bergstrom, 2008). de- 
velop method of commun detect for direct 
graph be a hard task. for instance, a direct graph be 
character by asymmetr matrix (adjac ma- 
trix, laplacian, etc.), so spectral analysi be much more 
complex. onli a few techniqu can be easili extend 
from the undirect to the direct case. otherwise, the 
problem must be formul from scratch.

edg directed be not the onli complic to deal 
with when face the problem of graph clustering. In 
mani real network vertex may belong to more than 
one group. In thi case one speak of overlap com- 
muniti and us the term cover, rather than partition, 
whose standard definit forbid multipl membership 
of vertices. classic exampl be social networks, where 
an individu usual belong to differ circl at the 
same time, from that of work colleagu to family, sport 
associations, etc.. tradit algorithm of commun 
detect assign each vertex to a singl module. In so do- 
ing, they neglect potenti relev information. ver- 
tice belong to more commun be like to play 
an import role of intermedi between differ 
compart of the graph. In fig. 5 we show a net- 
work of word associ deriv start from the word 
“bright”. the network build on the univers of south 
florida free associ norm (nelson et al., 1998). An

play four communities, correspond to the categori 
intelligence, astronomy, light and colors. the word 
“bright” be relat to all of them by construction. other 
word belong to more categories, e.g. “dark” (color 
and light). account for overlap commun in- 
troduc a further variable, the membership of vertex 
in differ communities, which enorm increas the 
number of possibl cover with respect to standard parti- 
tions. therefore, search for overlap commun 
be usual much more comput demand than 
detect standard partitions. 

So far we have discuss exampl of unipartit graphs. 
however, it be not uncommon to find real network with 
differ class of vertices, and edg join onli ver- 
tice of differ classes. An exampl be a network of 
scientist and papers, where edg join scientist and the 
paper they have authored. here there be no edg be- 
tween ani pair of scientist or papers, so the graph be 
bipartite. for a multipartit network the concept of com- 
muniti do not chang much with respect to the case of 
unipartit graphs, a it remain relat to a larg den- 
siti of edg between member of the same group, with 
the onli differ that the element of each group be-

black labels, event a fill symbol with white labels. the

a modifi version of the modular by newman and girvan, 
tailor on bipartit graph (barber, 2007) (section vi.b).

long to differ vertex classes. multipartit graph be 
usual reduc to unipartit project of each vertex 
class. for instance, from the bipartit network of scien- 
tist and paper one can extract a network of scientist 
only, who be relat by coauthorship. In thi way one 
can adopt standard techniqu of network analysis, in 
particular standard cluster methods, but a lot of infor- 
mation get lost. detect commun in multipartit 
network can have interest applic in, e.g., mar- 
keting. larg shop networks, in which custom be 
link to the product they have bought, allow to classifi 
custom base on the type of product they purchas 
more often: thi could be use both to organ target 
advertising, a well a to give recommend about 
futur purchas (adomaviciu and tuzhilin, 2005). the 
problem of commun detect in multipartit network 
be not trivial, and usual requir ad hoc methodologies. 
fig. 6 illustr the famou bipartit network of south- 
ern women studi by davi et al. (davi et al., 1941). 
there be 32 vertices, repres 18 woman from the 
area of natchez, mississippi, and 14 social events. edg 
repres the particip of the woman in the events. 
from the figur one can see that the network have a clear 
commun structure. 

In some of the previou examples, edg have (or can 
have) weights. for instance, the edg of the collabora- 
tion network of fig. 2b could be weight by the number 
of paper coauthor by pair of scientists. similarly, 

the edg of the word associ network of fig. 5 be 
weight by the number of time pair of word have be 
associ by people. weight be preciou addit in- 
format on a graph, and should be consid in the 
analysis. In mani case method work on unweight 
graph can be simpli extend to the weight case. 

iii. element OF commun detect 

the problem of graph clustering, intuit at first sight, 
be actual not well defined. the main element of the 
problem themselves, i. e. the concept of commun and 
partition, be not rigor defined, and requir some 
degre of arbitrari and/or common sense. indeed, 
some ambigu be hidden and there be often mani 
equal legitim way of resolv them. therefore, it 
be not surpris that there be plenti of recip in the 
literatur and that peopl do not even tri to ground the 
problem on share definitions. 

It be import to stress that the identif of struc- 
tural cluster be possibl onli if graph be sparse, i. e. if 
the number of edg m be of the order of the number of 
node n of the graph. If m� n, the distribut of edg 
among the node be too homogen for commun to 
make sense2. In thi case the problem turn into some- 
thing rather different, close to data cluster (gan et al., 
2007), which requir concept and method of a differ 
nature. the main differ be that, while commun in 
graph be related, explicitli or implicitly, to the concept 
of edg densiti (insid versu outsid the community), in 
data cluster commun be set of point which be 
“close” to each other, with respect to a measur of dis- 
tanc or similarity, defin for each pair of points. some 
classic techniqu for data clustering, like hierarchical, 
partit and spectral cluster will be discuss late 
in the review (section iv.b, iv.c and iv.d), a they 
be sometim adopt for graph cluster too. other 
standard procedur for data cluster includ neural 
network cluster techniqu like, e. g., self-organ 
map and multi-dimension scale techniqu like, e. 
g., singular valu decomposit and princip compon 
analysi (gan et al., 2007). 

In thi section we shall attempt an order exposit 
of the fundament concept of commun detection. af- 
ter a brief discuss of the issu of comput com- 
plexiti for the algorithms, we shall review the notion of 
commun and partition. 

2 thi be not necessarili true if graph be weight with a hetero- 
geneou distribut of weights. In such case commun may 
still be identifi a subgraph with a high intern densiti of 
weight.

A. comput complex 

the massiv amount of data on real network current 
avail make the issu of the effici of cluster al- 
gorithm essential. the comput complex of an 
algorithm be the estim of the amount of resourc re- 
quir by the algorithm to perform a task. thi involv 
both the number of comput step need and the 
number of memori unit that need to be simultan 
alloc to run the computation. such demand be 
usual express by their scalabl with the size of the 
system at study. In the case of a graph, the size be typ- 
ical indic by the number of vertex n and/or the 
number of edg m. the comput complex of 
an algorithm cannot alway be calculated. In fact, some- 
time thi be a veri hard task, or even impossible. In 
these cases, it be howev import to have at least an 
estim of the worst-cas complex of the algorithm, 
which be the amount of comput resourc need 
to run the algorithm in the most unfavor case for a 
give system size. 

the notat o(nαmβ) indic that the comput 
time grow a a power of both the number of vertex 
and edges, with expon α and β, respectively. ideally, 
one would like to have the low possibl valu for the 
exponents, which would correspond to the low possi- 
ble comput demands. sampl of the web graph, 
with million of vertex and billion of edges, cannot be 
tackl by algorithm whose run time grow faster 
than o(n) or o(m). 

algorithm with polynomi complex form the class 
P. for some import decis and optim prob- 
lems, there be no know polynomi algorithms. find- 
ing solut of such problem in the worst-cas scenario 
may demand an exhaust search, which take a time 
grow faster than ani polynomi function of the sys- 
tem size, e.g. exponentially. problem whose solut 
can be verifi in a polynomi time span the class NP 
of non-determinist polynomi time problems, which in- 
clude P. A problem be np-hard if a solut for it can be 
translat into a solut for ani np-problem. however, 
a np-hard problem need not be in the class np. If it 
do belong to NP it be call np-complete. the class 
of np-complet problem have drawn a special attent 
in comput science, a it includ mani famou prob- 
lem like the travel salesman, boolean satisfi 
(sat), linear programming, etc. (garey and johnson, 
1990; papadimitriou, 1994). the fact that NP prob- 
lem have a solut which be verifi in polynomi 
time do not mean that NP problem have polynomi 
complexity, i. e., that they be in P. In fact, the ques- 
tion of whether np=p be the most import open prob- 
lem in theoret comput science. np-hard problem 
need not be in NP (in which case they would be np- 
complete), but they be at least a hard a np-complet 
problems, so they be unlik to have polynomi com- 
plexity, although a proof of that be still missing. 

mani cluster algorithm or problem relat to 

cluster be np-hard. In thi case, it be pointless to 
use exact algorithms, which could be appli onli to 
veri small systems. moreover, even if an algorithm have a 
polynomi complexity, it may still be too slow to tackl 
larg system of interest. In all such case it be common 
to use approxim algorithms, i. e. method that do 
not deliv an exact solut to the problem at hand, 
but onli an approxim solution, with the advantag of 
a low complexity. approxim algorithm be often 
non-deterministic, a they deliv differ solut for 
the same problem, for differ initi condit and/or 
paramet of the algorithm. the goal of such algorithm 
be to deliv a solut which differ by a constant fac- 
tor from the optim solution. In ani case, one should 
give provabl bound on the good of the approxi- 
mate solut deliv by the algorithm with respect to 
the optim solution. In mani case it be not possibl 
to approxim the solut within ani constant, a the 
good of the approxim strongli depend on the 
specif problem at study. approxim algorithm be 
commonli use for optim problems, in which one 
want to find the maximum or minimum valu of a give 
cost function over a larg set of possibl system configu- 
rations. 

B. commun 

1. basic 

the first problem in graph cluster be to look for a 
quantit definit of community. No definit be 
univers accepted. As a matter of fact, the defini- 
tion often depend on the specif system at hand and/or 
applic one have in mind. from intuit and the ex- 
ampl of section II we get the notion that there must 
be more edg “inside” the commun than edg link- 
ing vertex of the commun with the rest of the graph. 
thi be the refer guidelin at the basi of most com- 
muniti definitions. but mani altern recip be 
compat with it. moreover, in most cases, commu- 
niti be algorithm defined, i. e. they be just the 
final product of the algorithm, without a precis a priori 
definition. 

let u start with a subgraph C of a graph G, with 
|c| = nc and |g| = n vertices, respectively. We defin 
the intern and extern degre of vertex v ∈ C, kintv 
and kextv , a the number of edg connect v to other 
vertex of C or to the rest of the graph, respectively. If 
kextv = 0, the vertex have neighbor onli within C, which be 
like to be a good cluster for v; if kintv = 0, instead, the 
vertex be disjoint from C and it should good be assign 
to a differ cluster. the intern degre kcint of C be 
the sum of the intern degre of it vertices. likewise, 
the extern degre kcext of C be the sum of the extern 
degre of it vertices. the total degre kC be the sum 
of the degre of the vertex of C. By definition, kC = 
kcint + k 

C 
ext. 



10 

We defin the intra-clust densiti δint(c) of the sub- 
graph C a the ratio between the number of intern edg 
of C and the number of all possibl intern edges, i. e. 

δint(c) = 
# intern edg of C 

nc(nc − 1)/2 
. (1) 

similarly, the inter-clust densiti δext(c) be the ratio be- 
tween the number of edg run from the vertex of 
C to the rest of the graph and the maximum number of 
inter-clust edg possible, i. e. 

δext(c) = 
# inter-clust edg of C 

nc(n− nc) 
. (2) 

for C to be a community, we expect δint(c) to be ap- 
preciabl larg than the averag link densiti δ(g) of 
G, which be give by the ratio between the number of 
edg of G and the maximum number of possibl edg 
n(n − 1)/2. On the other hand, δext(c) have to be much 
small than δ(g). search for the best tradeoff be- 
tween a larg δint(c) and a small δext(c) be implicitli 
or explicitli the goal of most cluster algorithms. A 
simpl way to do that is, e. g., maxim the sum of 
the differ δint(c) − δext(c) over all cluster of the 
partition3 (mancoridi et al., 1998). 

A requir properti of a commun be connectedness. 
We expect that for C to be a commun there must be 
a path between each pair of it vertices, run onli 
through vertex of C. thi featur simplifi the task 
of commun detect on disconnect graphs, a in 
thi case one just analyz each connect compon 
separately, unless special constraint be impos on the 
result clusters. 

with these basic requir in mind, we can now 
introduc the main definit of community. social 
network analyst have devis mani definit of sub- 
group with variou degre of intern cohes among 
vertex (moodi and white, 2003; scott, 2000; wasser- 
man and faust, 1994). mani other definit have be 
introduc by comput scientist and physicists. We 
distinguish three class of definitions: local, global and 
base on vertex similarity. other definit will be give 
in the context of the algorithm for which they be in- 
troduced. 

2. local definit 

commun be part of the graph with a few tie 
with the rest of the system. To some extent, they can 
be consid a separ entiti with their own auton- 
omy. so, it make sens to evalu them independ 

3 In ref. (mancoridi et al., 1998) one actual comput the inter- 
cluster densiti by sum the densiti for each pair of clusters. 
therefor the function to minim be not exactli 

∑ 
C [δint(c)− 

δext(c)], but essenti equivalent. 

of the graph a a whole. local definit focu on the 
subgraph under study, includ possibl it immedi 
neighborhood, but neglect the rest of the graph. We 
start with a list of the main definit adopt in 
social network analysis, for which we shall close fol- 
low the exposit of ref. (wasserman and faust, 1994). 
there, four type of criterion be identified: complet 
mutuality, reachability, vertex degre and the comparison 
of intern versu extern cohesion. the correspond 
commun be mostli maxim subgraphs, which can- 
not be enlarg with the addit of new vertex and 
edg without lose the properti which defin them. 

social commun can be defin in a veri strict 
sens a subgroup whose member be all “friends” to 
each other (luce and perry, 1949) (complet mutual- 
ity). In graph terms, thi correspond to a clique, i. e. 
a subset whose vertex be all adjac to each other. 
In social network analysis, a cliqu be a maxim sub- 
graph, wherea in graph theori it be common to call 
cliqu also non-maxim subgraphs. triangl be the 
simplest cliques, and be frequent in real networks. but 
larg cliqu be less frequent. moreover, the condit 
be realli too strict: a subgraph with all possibl intern 
edg except one would be an extrem cohes sub- 
group, but it would not be consid a commun un- 
der thi recipe. anoth problem be that all vertex of 
a cliqu be absolut symmetric, with no differentia- 
tion between them. In mani practic examples, instead, 
we expect that within a commun there be a whole hi- 
erarchi of role for the vertices, with core vertex co- 
exist with peripher ones. We remark that vertex 
may belong to more cliqu simultaneously, a properti 
which be at the basi of the cliqu percol method of 
palla et al. (palla et al., 2005) (see section xi.a). from 
a practic point of view, find cliqu in a graph be an 
np-complet problem (bomz et al., 1999). the bron- 
kerbosch method (bron and kerbosch, 1973) run in a 
time grow exponenti with the size of the graph. 

It be howev possibl to relax the notion of clique, 
defin subgroup which be still clique-lik objects. A 
possibl be to use properti relat to reachability, i. e. 
to the exist (and length) of path between vertices. 
An n-cliqu be a maxim subgraph such that the distanc 
of each pair of it vertex be not larg than n (alba, 
1973; luce, 1950). for n = 1 one recov the definit 
of clique, a all vertex be adjacent, so each geodes 
path between ani pair of vertex have length 1. thi def- 
inition, more flexibl than that of clique, still have some 
limitations, deriv from the fact that the geodes path 
need not run on the vertex of the subgraph at study, but 
may run on vertex outsid the subgraph. In thi way, 
there may be two disturb consequences. first, the 
diamet of the subgraph may exceed n, even if in princi- 
ple each vertex of the subgraph be less than n step away 
from ani of the others. second, the subgraph may be 
disconnected, which be not consist with the notion of 
cohes one tri to enforce. To avoid these problems, 
mokken (mokken, 1979) have suggest two possibl al- 



11 

ternatives, the n-clan and the n-club. An n-clan be an 
n-cliqu whose diamet be not larg than n, i. e. a sub- 
graph such that the distanc between ani two of it ver- 
tices, comput over shortest path within the subgraph, 
do not exceed n. An n-club, instead, be a maxim 
subgraph of diamet n. the two definit be quit 
close: the differ be that an n-clan be maxim under 
the constraint of be an n-clique, wherea an n-club be 
maxim under the constraint impos by the length of 
the diameter. 

anoth criterion for subgraph cohes reli on the 
adjac of it vertices. the idea be that a vertex must 
be adjac to some minumum number of other vertex 
in the subgraph. In the literatur on social network anal- 
ysi there be two complementari way of express this. 
A k-plex be a maxim subgraph in which each vertex be 
adjac to all other vertex of the subgraph except at 
most k of them (seidman and foster, 1978). similarly, 
a k-core be a maxim subgraph in which each vertex be 
adjac to at least k other vertex of the subgraph (sei- 
dman, 1983). so, the two definit impos condit 
on the minim number of absent or present edges. the 
correspond cluster be more cohes than n-cliques, 
just becaus of the exist of mani intern edges. In 
ani graph there be a whole hierarchi of core of differ 
order, which can be identifi by mean of a recent effi- 
cient algorithm (batagelj and zaversnik, 2003). A k-core 
be essenti the same a a p-quasi complet subgraph, 
which be a subgraph such that the degre of each vertex 
be larg than p(k − 1), where p be a real number in [0, 1] 
and k the order of the subgraph (matsuda et al., 1999). 
determin whether a graph includ a 1/2-quasi com- 
plete subgraph of order at least k be np-complete. 

As cohes a a subgraph can be, it would hardli be a 
commun if there be a strong cohes a well between 
the subgraph and the rest of the graph. therefore, it 
be import to compar the intern and extern cohe- 
sion of a subgraph. In fact, thi be what be usual do 
in the most recent definit of community. the first 
recipe, however, be not recent and stem from social net- 
work analysis. An ls-set (luccio and sami, 1969), or 
strong commun (radicchi et al., 2004), be a subgraph 
such that the intern degre of each vertex be great 
than it extern degree. thi condit be quit strict 
and can be relax into the so-cal weak definit of 
commun (radicchi et al., 2004), for which it suffic 
that the intern degre of the subgraph exce it ex- 
ternal degree. An ls-set be also a weak community, while 
the convers be not gener true. Hu et al. (hu et al., 
2008) have introduc altern definit of strong 
and weak communities: a commun be strong if the in- 
ternal degre of ani vertex of the commun exce the 
number of edg that the vertex share with ani other 
community; a commun be weak if it total intern de- 
gree exce the number of edg share by the commu- 
niti with the other communities. these definit be 
in the same spirit of the plant partit model (sec- 
tion xv). An ls-set be a strong commun also in the 

sens of Hu et al.. likewise, a weak commun accord 
to radicchi et al. be also a weak commun for Hu et al.. 
In both case the convers be not true, however. anoth 
definit focu on the robust of cluster to edg 
remov and us the concept of edg connectivity. the 
edg connect of a pair of vertex in a graph be the 
minim number of edg that need to be remov in or- 
der to disconnect the two vertices, i. e. such that there be 
no path between them. A lambda set be a subgraph such 
that ani pair of vertex of the subgraph have a larg edg 
connect than ani pair form by one vertex of the 
subgraph and one outsid the subgraph (borgatti et al., 
1990). however, vertex of a lambda-set need not be 
adjac and may be quit distant from each other. 

commun can also be identifi by a fit mea- 
sure, express to which extent a subraph satisfi a 
give properti relat to it cohesion. the larg the 
fitness, the more definit be the community. thi be the 
same principl behind qualiti functions, which give an 
estim of the good of a graph partit (see sec- 
tion iii.c.2). the simplest fit measur for a clus- 
ter be it intra-clust densiti δint(c). one could as- 
sume that a subgraph C with k vertex be a cluster if 
δint(c) be larg than a threshold, say ξ. find such 
subgraph be an np-complet problem, a it coincid 
with the np-complet cliqu problem when the thresh- 
old ξ = 1 (garey and johnson, 1990). It be good to fix 
the size of the subgraph because, without thi conditions, 
ani cliqu would be one of the best possibl communities, 
includ trivial two-cliqu (simpl edges). variant of 
thi problem focu on the number of intern edg of 
the subgraph (asahiro et al., 2002; feig et al., 2001; 
holzapfel et al., 2003). anoth measur of interest be the 
rel densiti ρ(c) of a subgraph C, defin a the ratio 
between the intern and the total degre of C. find 
subgraph of a give size with ρ(c) larg than a thresh- 
old be np-complet (š́ıma and schaeffer, 2006). fit 
measur can also be associ to the connect of 
the subgraph at studi to the other vertex of the graph. 
A good commun be expect to have a small cut size 
(see section a.1), i. e. a small number of edg join 
it to the rest of the graph. thi set a bridg between 
commun detect and graph partitioning, which we 
shall discu in section iv.a. 

3. global definit 

commun can also be defin with respect to the 
graph a a whole. thi be reason in those case in 
which cluster be essenti part of the graph, which can- 
not be take apart without serious affect the func- 
tion of the system. the literatur offer mani global 
criterion to identifi communities. In most case they be 
indirect definitions, in which some global properti of the 
graph be use in an algorithm that deliv commun 
at the end. however, there be a class of proper definitions, 
base on the idea that a graph have commun structur

if it be differ from a random graph. A random graph 
à la erdös-rényi (section a.3), for instance, be not ex- 
pect to have commun structure, a ani two vertex 
have the same probabl to be adjacent, so there should 
be no preferenti link involv special group of ver- 
tices. therefore, one can defin a null model, i. e. a graph 
which match the origin in some of it structur fea- 
tures, but which be otherwis a random graph. the null 
model be use a a term of comparison, to verifi whether 
the graph at studi display commun structur or not. 
the most popular null model be that propos by new- 
man and girvan and consist of a random version of 
the origin graph, where edg be rewir at random, 
under the constraint that the expect degre of each 
vertex match the degre of the vertex in the origin 
graph (newman and girvan, 2004). thi null model be 
the basic concept behind the definit of modularity, a 
function which evalu the good of partit of 
a graph into clusters. modular will be discuss at 
length in thi review, becaus it have the uniqu privi- 
lege of be at the same time a global criterion to de- 
fine a community, a qualiti function and the key ingredi- 
ent of the most popular method of graph clustering. In 
the standard formul of modularity, a subgraph be a 
commun if the number of edg insid the subgraph 
exce the expect number of intern edg that the 
same subgraph would have in the null model. thi ex- 
pect number be an averag over all possibl realiz 
of the null model. sever modif of modular 
have be propos (section vi.b). A gener class of 
null models, includ modular a a special case, have 
be design by reichardt and bornholdt (reichardt 
and bornholdt, 2006a) (section vi.b). 

4. definit base on vertex similar 

It be natur to assum that commun be group of 
vertex similar to each other. one can comput the sim- 
ilar between each pair of vertex with respect to some 
refer property, local or global, no matter whether 
they be connect by an edg or not. each vertex end 
up in the cluster whose vertex be most similar to it. 
similar measur be at the basi of tradit meth- 
ods, like hierarchical, partit and spectral clustering, 
to be discuss in section iv.b, iv.c and iv.d. here 
we discu some popular measur use in the literature. 

If it be possibl to emb the graph vertex in an n- 
dimension euclidean space, by assign a posit to 
them, one could use the distanc between a pair of ver- 
tice a a measur of their similar (it be actual a mea- 
sure of dissimilar becaus similar vertex be expect 
to be close to each other). given the two data point 
A = (a1, a2, ..., an) and B = (b1, b2, ..., bn), one could use 
ani norm lm, like the euclidean distanc (l2-norm), 

deab = 

n∑ 
k=1 

√ 
(ak − bk)2, (3) 

the manhattan distanc (l1-norm) 

dmab = 

n∑ 
k=1 

|ak − bk|, (4) 

and the l∞-norm 

d∞ab = max 
k∈[1,n] 

|ak − bk|. (5) 

anoth popular spatial measur be the cosin similarity, 
defin a 

ρab = arcco 
a · b√∑n 

k=1 a 
2 
k 

√∑n 
k=1 b 

2 
k 

, (6) 

where a ·b be the dot product of the vector a and b. the 
variabl ρab be defin in the rang [0, π). 

If the graph cannot be emb in space, the sim- 
ilar must be necessarili infer from the adjac 
relationship between vertices. A possibl be to defin 
a distanc (burt, 1976; wasserman and faust, 1994) be- 
tween vertex like 

dij = 

√∑ 
k 6=i,j 

(aik −ajk)2, (7) 

where A be the adjac matrix. thi be a dissimilar- 
iti measure, base on the concept of structur equiv- 
alenc (f.lorrain and white, 1971). two vertex be 
structur equival if they have the same neighbors, 
even if they be not adjac themselves. If i and j be 
structur equivalent, dij = 0. vertic with larg de- 
gree and differ neighbour be consid veri “far” 
from each other. alternatively, one could measur the 
overlap between the neighborhood γ(i) and γ(j) of ver- 
tice i and j, give by the ratio between the intersect 
and the union of the neighborhoods, i. e. 

ωij = 
|γ(i) ∩ γ(j)| 
|γ(i) ∪ γ(j)| 

. (8) 

anoth measur relat to structur equival be the 
pearson correl between column or row of the ad- 
jacenc matrix, 

cij = 

∑ 
k(aik − µi)(ajk − µj) 

nσiσj 
, (9) 

where the averag µi = ( 
∑ 
j aij)/n and the varianc 

σi = 
√∑ 

j(aij − µi)2/n. 
An altern measur be the number of edge- (or 

vertex-) independ path between two vertices. inde- 
pendent path do not share ani edg (vertex), and their 
number be relat to the maximum flow that can be con- 
vey between the two vertex under the constraint that 
each edg can carri onli one unit of flow (max-flow/min- 
cut theorem (elia et al., 1956)). the maximum flow 
can be calcul in a time o(m), for a graph with m 



13 

edges, use techniqu like the augment path algo- 
rithm (ahuja et al., 1993). similarly, one could consid 
all path run between two vertices. In thi case, there 
be the problem that the total number of path be infinite, 
but thi can be avoid if one perform a weight sum 
of the number of paths. for instance, path of length l 
can be weight by the factor αl, with α < 1. anoth 
possibility, suggest by estrada and hatano (estrada 
and hatano, 2008, 2009), be to weigh path of length l 
with the invers factori 1/l!. In both cases, the contri- 
bution of long path be strongli suppress and the sum 
converges. 

anoth import class of measur of vertex similar- 
iti be base on properti of random walk on graphs. 
one of thi properti be the commute-tim between a 
pair of vertices, which be the averag number of step 
need for a random walker, start at either vertex, 
to reach the other vertex for the first time and to come 
back to the start vertex. saeren and cowork (fouss 
and renders, 2007; saeren et al., 2004; yen et al., 2007, 
2009) have extens studi and use the commute- 
time (and variant thereof) a (dis)similar measure: 
the larg the time, the farther (less similar) the vertices. 
the commute-tim be close relat (chandra et al., 
1989) to the resist distanc introduc by klein and 
randic (klein and randic, 1993), express the effect 
electr resist between two vertex if the graph be 
turn into a resistor network. white and smyth (white 
and smyth, 2003) and zhou (zhou, 2003a) use instead 
the averag first passag time, i. e. the averag number 
of step need to reach for the first time the target ver- 
tex from the source. harel and koren (harel and koren, 
2001) propos to build measur out of quantiti like 
the probabl to visit a target vertex in no more than 
a give number of step after it leaf a sourc vertex4 

and the probabl that a random walker start at a 
sourc visit the target exactli onc befor hit the 
sourc again. anoth quantiti use to defin similar 
measur be the escap probability, defin a the prob- 
abil that the walker reach the target vertex befor 
come back to the sourc vertex (palmer and falout- 
sos, 2003; tong et al., 2008). the escap probabl be 
relat to the effect conduct between the two ver- 
tice in the equival resistor network. other author 
have exploit properti of modifi random walks. for 
instance, the algorithm by gori and pucci (gori and 
pucci, 2007) and that by tong et al. (tong et al., 2008) 
use similar measur deriv from google’ pager- 
ank process (brin and page, 1998). 

4 In the cluster method by latapi and pon (latapi and pons, 
2005) (discuss in section viii.b) and in a recent analysi by 
nadler et al. (nadler et al., 2006), one defin a dissimilar 
measur call “diffus distance”, which be deriv from the 
probabl that the walker visit the target after a fix number 
of steps. 

C. partit 

1. basic 

A partit be a divis of a graph in clusters, such that 
each vertex belong to one cluster. As we have see in 
section ii, in real system vertex may be share among 
differ communities. A divis of a graph into over- 
lap (or fuzzy) commun be call cover. 

the number of possibl partit in k cluster of a 
graph with n vertex be the stirl number of the sec- 
ond kind s(n, k) (andrews, 1976). the total number 
of possibl partit be the n-th bell number Bn =∑n 
k=0 s(n, k) (andrews, 1976). In the limit of larg n, 

Bn have the asymptot form (lovász, 1993) 

Bn ∼ 
1√ 
n 

[λ(n)]n+1/2eλ(n)−n−1, (10) 

where λ(n) = eW (n) = n/w (n), W (n) be the lam- 
bert W function (pólya and szegö, 1998). therefore, Bn 
grow faster than exponenti with the graph size n, 
which mean that an enumer and/or evalu of 
all partit of a graph be impossible, unless the graph 
consist of veri few vertices. 

partit can be hierarch ordered, when the 
graph have differ level of organization/structur at 
differ scales. In thi case, cluster display in turn 
commun structure, with small commun inside, 
which may again contain small communities, and so on 
(fig. 7). As an example, in a social network of child 
live in the same town, one could group the child 
accord to the school they attend, but within each 
school one can make a subdivis into classes. hier- 
archic organ be a common featur of mani real 
networks, where it be reveal by a peculiar scale of the 
cluster coeffici for vertex have the same degre 
k, when plot a a function of k (ravasz and barabási, 
2003; ravasz et al., 2002). A natur way to repres 
the hierarch structur of a graph be to draw a dendro- 
gram, like the one illustr in fig. 8. here, partit 
of a graph with twelv vertex be shown. At the bot- 
tom, each vertex be it own modul (the “leaves” of the 
tree). By move upwards, group of vertex be suc- 
cessiv aggregated. merger of commun be repre- 
sent by horizont lines. the uppermost level repre- 
sent the whole graph a a singl community. cut 
the diagram horizont at some height, a show in the 
figur (dash line), display one partit of the graph. 
the diagram be hierarch by construction: each com- 
muniti belong to a level be fulli includ in a commu- 
niti at a high level. dendrogram be regularli use in 
sociolog and biology. the techniqu of hierarch clus- 
tering, describ in section iv.b, lend itself natur to 
thi kind of representation.

2. qualiti functions: modular 

reliabl algorithm be suppos to identifi good par- 
titions. but what be a good clustering? In order to dis- 
tinguish between “good” and “bad” clusterings, it would 
be use to requir that partit satisfi a set of basic 
properties, intuit and easi to agre upon. In the wider 
context of data clustering, thi issu have be studi by 
jon kleinberg (kleinberg, 2002), who have prove an im- 

portant imposs theorem. given a set S of points, a 
distanc function d be defined, which be posit definit 
and symmetr (the triangular inequ be not explicitli 
required). one wish to find a cluster f base on the 
distanc between the points. kleinberg show that no 
cluster satisfi at the same time the three follow 
properties: 

1. scale-invariance: give a constant α, multipli 
ani distanc function d by α yield the same clus- 
tering. 

2. richness: ani possibl partit of the give point 
set can be recov if one choos a suitabl dis- 
tanc function d. 

3. consistency: give a partition, ani modif of 
the distanc function that do not decreas the dis- 
tanc between point of differ cluster and that 
do not increas the distanc between point of the 
same cluster, yield the same clustering. 

the theorem cannot be extend to graph cluster be- 
caus the distanc function cannot be in gener defin 
for a graph which be not complete. for weight com- 
plete graphs, like correl matrix (tumminello et al., 
2008), it be often possibl to defin a distanc function. 
On a gener graph, except for the first property, which 



15 

do not make sens without a distanc function5, the 
other two be quit well defined. the properti of rich 
impli that, give a partition, one can set edg between 
the vertex in such a way that the partit be a natur 
outcom of the result graph (e.g., it could be achiev 
by set edg onli between vertex of the same clus- 
ter). consist here impli that delet inter-clust 
edg and add intra-clust edg yield the same par- 
tition. 

mani algorithm be abl to identifi a subset of mean- 
ing partitions, ideal one or just a few, wherea some 
others, like techniqu base on hierarch cluster 
(section iv.b), deliv a larg number of partitions. that 
do not mean that the partit found be equal good. 
therefor it be help (sometim even necessary) to have 
a quantit criterion to ass the good of a graph 
partition. A qualiti function be a function that assign a 
number to each partit of a graph. In thi way one can 
rank partit base on their score give by the qualiti 
function. partit with high score be “good”, so the 
one with the larg score be by definit the best. nev- 
ertheless, one should keep in mind that the question of 
when a partit be good than anoth one be ill-posed, 
and the answer depend on the specif concept of com- 
muniti and/or qualiti function adopted. 

A qualiti function Q be addit if there be an elemen- 
tari function q such that, for ani partit P of a graph 

q(p) = 
∑ 
c∈p 

q(c), (11) 

where C be a gener cluster of partit P. eq. 11 state 
that the qualiti of a partit be give by the sum of the 
qualiti of the individu clusters. the function q(c) 
could be ani of the cluster fit function discuss 
in section iii.b.2, for instance. most qualiti function 
use in the literatur be additive, although it be not a 
necessari requirement. 

An exampl of qualiti function be the perform P , 
which count the number of correctli “interpreted” pair 
of vertices, i. e. two vertex belong to the same com- 
muniti and connect by an edge, or two vertex be- 
long to differ commun and not connect by 
an edge. the definit of performance, for a partit 
P, be 

P (p) = |{(i, j) ∈ e,ci = cj}|+ |{(i, j) /∈ e,ci 6= cj}| 
n(n− 1)/2 

. 

(12) 
By definition, 0 ≤ P (p) ≤ 1. anoth exampl be cov- 
erage, i. e. the ratio of the number of intra-commun 
edg by the total number of edges: by definition, an 
ideal cluster structure, where the cluster be discon- 
nect from each other, yield a coverag of 1, a all 
edg of the graph fall within clusters. 

5 the tradit shortest-path distanc between vertex be not 
suitabl here, a it be integ by definition. 

the most popular qualiti function be the modular 
of newman and girvan (newman and girvan, 2004). It 
be base on the idea that a random graph be not expect 
to have a cluster structure, so the possibl exist of 
cluster be reveal by the comparison between the actual 
densiti of edg in a subgraph and the densiti one would 
expect to have in the subgraph if the vertex of the graph 
be attach regardless of commun structure. thi 
expect edg densiti depend on the chosen null model, 
i. e. a copi of the origin graph keep some of it 
structur properti but without commun structure. 
modular can then be write a follow 

Q = 
1 

2m 

∑ 
ij 

(aij − pij) δ(ci, cj), (13) 

where the sum run over all pair of vertices, A be the 
adjac matrix, m the total number of edg of the 
graph, and pij repres the expect number of edg 
between vertex i and j in the null model. the δ-function 
yield one if vertex i and j be in the same commun 
(ci = cj), zero otherwise. the choic of the null model 
graph be in principl arbitrary, and sever possibl 
exist. for instance, one could simpli demand that the 
graph keep the same number of edg a the origin 
graph, and that edg be place with the same proba- 
biliti between ani pair of vertices. In thi case (bernoulli 
random graph), the null model term in eq. 13 would be a 
constant (i. e. pij = p = 2m/[n(n− 1)], ∀i, j). howev 
thi null model be not a good descriptor of real networks, 
a it have a poissonian degre distribut which be veri 
differ from the skew distribut found in real net- 
works. due to the import implic that broad de- 
gree distribut have for the structur and function of 
real network (albert and barabási, 2002; barrat et al., 
2008; boccaletti et al., 2006; dorogovtsev and mendes, 
2002; newman, 2003; pastor-satorra and vespignani, 
2004), it be prefer to go for a null model with the 
same degre distribut of the origin graph. the stan- 
dard null model of modular impos that the expect 
degre sequenc (after averag over all possibl configu- 
ration of the model) match the actual degre sequenc 
of the graph. thi be a stricter constraint than mere 
requir the match of the degre distributions, and be 
essenti equival 6 to the configur model, which 
have be subject of intens investig in the recent 
literatur on network ( luczak, 1992; molloy and reed, 
1995). In thi null model, a vertex could be attach to 
ani other vertex of the graph and the probabl that 
vertex i and j, with degre ki and kj , be connected, 

6 the differ be that the configur model maintain the 
same degre sequenc of the origin graph for each realization, 
wherea in the null model of modular the degre sequenc of a 
realiz be in gener different, and onli the average/expect 
degre sequenc coincid with that of the graph at hand. the 
two model be equival in the limit of infinit graph size. 



16 

can be calcul without problems. In fact, in order to 
form an edg between i and j one need to join two stub 
(i. e. half-edges), incid with i and j. the probabl 
pi to pick at random a stub incid with i be ki/2m, a 
there be ki stub incid with i out of a total of 2m. 
the probabl of a connect between i and j be then 
give by the product pipj , sinc edg be place inde- 
pendent of each other. the result be kikj/4m 

2, which 
yield an expect number pij = 2mpipj = kikj/2m of 
edg between i and j. so, the final express of modu- 
lariti read 

Q = 
1 

2m 

∑ 
ij 

( 
aij − 

kikj 
2m 

) 
δ(ci, cj). (14) 

sinc the onli contribut to the sum come from vertex 
pair belong to the same cluster, we can group these 
contribut togeth and rewrit the sum over the ver- 
tex pair a a sum over the cluster 

Q = 

nc∑ 
c=1 

[ lc 
m 
− 
( 
dc 
2m 

)2 ] 
. (15) 

here, nc be the number of clusters, lc the total number of 
edg join vertex of modul c and dc the sum of the 
degre of the vertex of c. In eq. 15, the first term of 
each summand be the fraction of edg of the graph insid 
the module, wherea the second term repres the ex- 
pect fraction of edg that would be there if the graph 
be a random graph with the same expect degre for 
each vertex. 

A nice featur of modular be that it can be equiva- 
lentli express both in term of the intra-clust edges, 
a in eq. 15, and in term of the inter-clust edg (djid- 
jev, 2007). In fact, the maximum of modular can be 
express a 

qmax = maxp

where maxp and minp indic the maximum and 
the minimum over all possibl graph partit P and 
ex(lc) = d 

2 
c/4m indic the expect number of link 

in cluster c in the null model of modularity. By add 
and subtract the total number of edg m of the graph 
one final get

minp(|cutp | − excutp). (17) 

In the last express |cutp | = m− 
∑nc 
c=1 lc be the number 

of inter-clust edg of partit P, and excutp = m−∑nc 
c=1 ex(lc) be the expect number of inter-clust edg 

of the partit in modularity’ null model. 
accord to eq. 15, a subgraph be a modul if the 

correspond contribut to modular in the sum be 
positive. the more the number of intern edg of the 
cluster exce the expect number, the good defin 
the community. so, larg posit valu of the modular- 
iti indic good partitions7. the maximum modular 
of a graph gener grow if the size of the graph and/or 
the number of (well-separated) cluster increas (good 
et al., 2009). therefore, modular should not be use 
to compar the qualiti of the commun structur of 
graph which be veri differ in size. the modular 
of the whole graph, take a a singl community, be zero, 
a the two term of the onli summand in thi case be 
equal and opposite. modular be alway small than 
one, and can be neg a well. for instance, the parti- 
tion in which each vertex be a commun be alway nega- 
tive: in thi case the sum run over n terms, which be all 
neg a the first term of each summand be zero. thi 
be a nice featur of the measure, impli that, if there 
be no partit with posit modularity, the graph have 
no commun structure. On the contrary, the exist 
of partit with larg neg modular valu may 
hint to the exist of subgroup with veri few intern 
edg and mani edg lie between them (multipartit 
structure) (newman, 2006a). holmström et al. (holm- 
ström et al., 2009) have show that the distribut of 
modular valu across the partit of variou graphs, 
real and artifici (includ random graph with no ap- 
parent commun structure), have some stabl features, 
and that the most like modular valu correspond to 
partit in cluster of approxim equal size. 

modular have be employ a qualiti function in 
mani algorithms, like some of the divis algorithm 
of section V. In addition, modular optim be it- 
self a popular method for commun detect (see sec- 
tion vi.a). modular also allow to ass the stabil 
of partit (massen and doye, 2006) (section xiv), 
it can be use to design layout for graph visualiza- 
tion (noack, 2009) and to perform a sort of renormaliza- 
tion of a graph, by transform a graph into a small 
one with the same commun structur (arena et al., 
2007).

the problem of graph partit consist in divid 
the vertex in g group of predefin size, such that the

fig. 9 graph partitioning. the dash line show the so- 
lution of the minimum bisect problem for the graph illus- 
trated, i. e. the partit in two group of equal size with min- 
imal number of edg run between the groups. reprint 
figur with permiss from ref. (fortunato and castellano, 
2009). c©2009 by springer. 

number of edg lie between the group be minimal. 
the number of edg run between cluster be call 
cut size. fig. 9 present the solut of the problem for 
a graph with fourteen vertices, for g = 2 and cluster of 
equal size. 

specifi the number of cluster of the partit be 
necessary. If one simpli impos a partit with the 
minim cut size, and left the number of cluster free, 
the solut would be trivial, correspond to all ver- 
tice end up in the same cluster, a thi would yield 
a vanish cut size. specifi the size be also neces- 
sary, a otherwis the most like solut of the problem 
would consist in separ the low degre vertex from 
the rest of the graph, which be quit uninteresting. thi 
problem can be actual avoid by choos a differ 
measur to optim for the partitioning, which account 
for the size of the clusters. some of these measur will 
be briefli introduc at the end of thi section. 

graph partit be a fundament issu in parallel 
computing, circuit partit and layout, and in the 
design of mani serial algorithms, includ techniqu 
to solv partial differenti equat and spars linear 
system of equations. most variant of the graph parti- 
tion problem be np-hard. there be howev sever 
algorithm that can do a good job, even if their solut 
be not necessarili optim (pothen, 1997). mani algo- 
rithm perform a bisect of the graph. partit into 
more than two cluster be usual attain by iter 
bisectioning. moreover, in most case one impos the 
constraint that the cluster have equal size. thi prob- 
lem be call minimum bisect and be np-hard. 

the kernighan-lin algorithm (kernighan and lin, 
1970) be one of the earli method propos and be still 

frequent used, often in combin with other tech- 
niques. the author be motiv by the problem of 
partit electron circuit onto boards: the node 
contain in differ board need to be link to each 
other with the least number of connections. the pro- 
cedur be an optim of a benefit function Q, which 
repres the differ between the number of edg in- 
side the modul and the number of edg lie between 
them. the start point be an initi partit of the 
graph in two cluster of the predefin size: such initi 
partit can be random or suggest by some informa- 
tion on the graph structure. then, subset consist of 
equal number of vertex be swap between the two 
groups, so that Q have the maxim increase. the sub- 
set can consist of singl vertices. To reduc the risk to 
be trap in local maximum of Q, the procedur includ 
some swap that decreas the function Q. after a seri 
of swap with posit and neg gains, the partit 
with the larg valu of Q be select and use a start- 
ing point of a new seri of iterations. the kernighan- 
lin algorithm be quit fast, scale a o(n2 log n) (n be- 
ing a usual the number of vertices), if onli a constant 
number of swap be perform at each iteration. the 
most expens part be the identif of the subset to 
swap, which requir the comput of the gains/loss 
for ani pair of candid subsets. On spars graphs, a 
slightli differ heurist allow to low the complex- 
iti to o(n2). the partit found by the procedur be 
strongli depend on the initi configur and other 
algorithm can do better. It be prefer to start with 
a good guess about the sought partition, otherwis the 
result be quit poor. therefor the method be typi- 
calli use to improv on the partit found through 
other techniques, by use them a start configura- 
tion for the algorithm. the kernighan-lin algorithm 
have be extend to extract partit in ani number 
of part (suari and kedem, 1988), howev the run-tim 
and storag cost increas rapidli with the number of 
clusters. 

anoth popular techniqu be the spectral bisect 
method (barnes, 1982), which be base on the properti 
of the spectrum of the laplacian matrix. spectral clus- 
tere will be discuss more thoroughli in section iv.d, 
here we focu on it applic to graph partitioning. 

everi partit of a graph with n vertex in two group 
can be repres by an index vector s, whose compo- 
nent si be +1 if vertex i be in one group and −1 if it be in 
the other group. the cut size R of the partit of the 
graph in the two group can be write a 

R = 
1 

4 
stls, (18) 

where L be the laplacian matrix and sT the transpos of 
vector s. vector s can be write a s = 

∑ 
i aivi, where 

vi, i = 1, ..., n be the eigenvector of the laplacian. If s 
be properli normalized, then 

R = 
∑ 
i 

a2iλi, (19) 



18 

where λi be the laplacian eigenvalu correspond to 
eigenvector vi. It be worth remark that the sum con- 
tain at most n−1 terms, a the laplacian have at least one 
zero eigenvalue. minim R equal to the minimiza- 
tion of the sum on the right-hand side of eq. 19. thi task 
be still veri hard. however, if the second low eigenvec- 
tor λ2 be close enough to zero, a good approxim of 
the minimum can be attain by choos s parallel to 
the correspond eigenvector v2, which be call fiedler 
vector (fiedler, 1973): thi would reduc the sum to λ2, 
which be a small number. but the index vector cannot 
be perfectli parallel to v2 by construction, becaus all 
it compon be equal in modulus, wherea the com- 
ponent of v2 be not. the best choic be to match the 
sign of the components. so, one can set si = +1 (−1) 
if vi2 > 0 (< 0). It may happen that the size of the two 
correspond group do not match the predefin size 
one wish to have. In thi case, if one aim at a split in 
n1 and n2 = n−n1 vertices, the best strategi be to order 
the compon of the fiedler vector from the low to 
the larg valu and to put in one group the vertex 
correspond to the first n1 compon from the top 
or the bottom, and the remain vertex in the second 
group. thi procedur yield two partitions: the good 
solut be natur the one that give the small cut 
size. 

the spectral bisect method be quit fast. the first 
eigenvector of the laplacian can be comput by use 
the lanczo method (lanczos, 1950). the time requir 
to comput the first k eigenvector of a matrix with the 
lanczo method depend on the size of the eigengap 
|λk+1 − λk| (golub and loan, 1989). If the eigenval- 
ue λk+1 and λk be well separated, the run time of 
the algorithm be much shorter than the time requir to 
calcul the complet set of eigenvectors, which scale a 
o(n3). the method give in gener good partitions, that 
can be further improv by appli the kernighan-lin 
algorithm. 

the well know max-flow min-cut theorem by ford 
and fulkerson (ford and fulkerson, 1956) state that the 
minimum cut between ani two vertex s and t of a graph, 
i. e. ani minim subset of edg whose delet would 
topolog separ s from t, carri the maximum flow 
that can be transport from s to t across the graph. In 
thi context edg play the role of water pipes, with a 
give carri capac (e.g. their weights), and vertex 
the role of pipe junctions. thi theorem have be use 
to determin minim cut from maxim flow in clus- 
tere algorithms. there be sever effici routin to 
comput maximum flow in graphs, like the algorithm 
of goldberg and tarjan (goldberg and tarjan, 1988). 
flake et al. (flake et al., 2000; flake et al., 2002) have 
recent use maximum flow to identifi commun in 
the graph of the world wide web. the web graph be 
direct but for the purpos of the calcul flake et 
at. treat the edg a undirected. web commun 
be defin to be “strong” (ls-sets), i. e. the intern de- 
gree of each vertex must not be small than it extern 

degre (radicchi et al., 2004). An artifici sink t be add 
to the graph and one calcul the maximum flow from 
a sourc vertex s to the sink t: the correspond mini- 
mum cut identifi the commun of vertex s, provid s 
share a suffici larg number of edg with the other 
vertex of it community, otherwis one could get trivial 
separ and meaningless clusters. 

other popular method for graph partit in- 
clude level-structur partitioning, the geometr algo- 
rithm, multilevel algorithms, etc. A good descript of 
these algorithm can be found in ref. (pothen, 1997). 

graph can be also partit by minim mea- 
sure that be affin to the cut size, like conduct (bol- 
lobas, 1998). the conduct φ(c) of the subgraph C 
of a graph G be defin a 

φ(c) = c(c,g \ C) 
min(kc , kg\c) 

, (20) 

where c(c,g \c) be the cut size of C, and kC , kg\c be the 
total degre of C and of the rest of the graph g\c, respec- 
tively. cut be defin onli between non-empti sets, 
otherwis the measur would not be defin (a the de- 
nomin in eq. 20 would vanish). the minimum of the 
conduct be obtain in correspond of low valu 
of the cut size and of larg valu for the denomin in 
eq. 20, which peak when the total degre of the cluster 
and it complement be equal. In practic applications, 
especi on larg graphs, close valu of the total de- 
gree correspond to cluster of approxim equal size. 
the problem of find a cut with minim conduct 
be np-hard (š́ıma and schaeffer, 2006). similar mea- 
sure be the ratio cut (wei and cheng, 1989) and the 
normal cut (shi and malik, 1997, 2000). the ratio 
cut of a cluster C be defin a 

φc(c) = 
c(c,g \ C) 
ncng\c 

, (21) 

where nC and ng\c be the number of vertex of the two 
subgraphs. the normal cut of a cluster C be 

ΦN (c) = 
c(c,g \ C) 

kC 
, (22) 

where kC be again the total degre of C. As for the 
conductance, minim the ratio cut and the normal- 
ize cut favor partit into cluster of approxim 
equal size, measur in term of the number of vertex 
or edges, respectively. On the other hand, graph par- 
tition requir preliminari assumpt on the clus- 
ter sizes, wherea the minim of conductance, ratio 
cut and normal cut do not. the ratio cut be in- 
troduc for circuit partit (wei and cheng, 1989) 
and it optim be an np-hard problem (matula and 
shahrokhi, 1990). the normal cut be frequent use 
in imag segment (blake and zisserman, 1987) and 
it optim be np-complet (shi and malik, 2000). 
the cut ratio and the normal cut can be quit well 



19 

minim via spectral cluster (chan et al., 1993; ha- 
gen and kahng, 1992) (section iv.d). 

algorithm for graph partit be not good for 
commun detection, becaus it be necessari to provid 
a input the number of group and in some case even 
their sizes, about which in principl one know nothing. 
instead, one would like an algorithm capabl to produc 
thi inform in it output. besides, from the method- 
olog point of view, use iter bisect to split 
the graph in more piec be not a reliabl procedure. for 
instance, a split into three cluster be necessarili obtain 
by break either cluster of the origin bipartit in 
two parts, wherea in mani case a minimum cut parti- 
tion be obtain if the third cluster be a merger of part 
of both initi clusters. 

B. hierarch cluster 

In general, veri littl be know about the commun 
structur of a graph. It be uncommon to know the num- 
ber of cluster in which the graph be split, or other in- 
dicat about the membership of the vertices. In such 
case cluster procedur like graph partit meth- 
od can hardli be of help, and one be forc to make some 
reason assumpt about the number and size of the 
clusters, which be often unjustified. On the other hand, 
the graph may have a hierarch structure, i. e. may 
display sever level of group of the vertices, with 
small cluster includ within larg clusters, which be 
in turn includ in larg clusters, and so on. social net- 
works, for instance, often have a hierarch structur 
(section iii.c.1). In such cases, one may use hierarch 
cluster algorithm (hasti et al., 2001), i. e. cluster- 
ing techniqu that reveal the multilevel structur of the 
graph. hierarch cluster be veri common in social 
network analysis, biology, engineering, marketing, etc. 

the start point of ani hierarch cluster 
method be the definit of a similar measur between 
vertices. after a measur be chosen, one comput the 
similar for each pair of vertices, no matter if they be 
connect or not. At the end of thi process, one be left 
with a new n×n matrix X, the similar matrix. In sec- 
tion iii.b.4 we have list sever possibl definit of 
similarity. hierarch cluster techniqu aim at iden- 
tifi group of vertex with high similarity, and can be 
classifi in two categories: 

1. agglom algorithms, in which cluster be it- 
er merg if their similar be suffici 
high; 

2. divis algorithms, in which cluster be iter 
split by remov edg connect vertex with 
low similarity. 

the two class refer to opposit processes: agglomera- 
tive algorithm be bottom-up, a one start from the ver- 
tice a separ cluster (singletons) and end up with 

the graph a a uniqu cluster; divis algorithm be 
top-down a they follow the opposit direction. divis 
techniqu have be rare use in the past (meanwhil 
they have becom more popular, see section v), so we 
shall concentr here on agglom algorithms. 

sinc cluster be merg base on their mutual sim- 
ilarity, it be essenti to defin a measur that estim 
how similar cluster are, out of the matrix X. thi in- 
volv some arbitrari and sever prescript exist. 
In singl linkag clustering, the similar between two 
group be the minimum element xij , with i in one group 
and j in the other. On the contrary, the maximum el- 
ement xij for vertex of differ group be use in the 
procedur of complet linkag clustering. In averag link- 
age cluster one have to comput the averag of the xij . 

the procedur can be good illustr by mean of 
dendrogram (section iii.c.1), like the one in fig. 8. 
sometimes, stop condit be impos to select a 
partit or a group of partit that satisfi a special 
criterion, like a give number of cluster or the optimiza- 
tion of a qualiti function (e.g. modularity). 

hierarch cluster have the advantag that it do 
not requir a preliminari knowledg on the number and 
size of the clusters. however, it do not provid a way 
to discrimin between the mani partit obtain by 
the procedure, and to choos that or those that good 
repres the commun structur of the graph. the 
result of the method depend on the specif similar 
measur adopted. the procedur also yield a hierarchi- 
cal structur by construction, which be rather artifici 
in most cases, sinc the graph at hand may not have a 
hierarch structur at all. moreover, vertex of a com- 
muniti may not be correctli classified, and in mani case 
some vertex be miss even if they have a central role 
in their cluster (newman, 2004a). anoth problem be 
that vertex with just one neighbor be often classifi 
a separ clusters, which in most case do not make 
sense. finally, a major weak of agglom hier- 
archic cluster be that it do not scale well. If point 
be emb in space, so that one can use the distanc 
a dissimilar measure, the comput complex 
be o(n2) for singl linkage, o(n2 log n) for the complet 
and averag linkag schemes. for graph clustering, where 
a distanc be not trivial defined, the complex can be- 
come much heavier if the calcul of the chosen simi- 
lariti measur be costly. 

C. partit cluster 

partit cluster indic anoth popular class 
of method to find cluster in a set of data points. here, 
the number of cluster be preassigned, say k. the point 
be emb in a metric space, so that each vertex be 
a point and a distanc measur be defin between pair 
of point in the space. the distanc be a measur of dis- 
similar between vertices. the goal be to separ the 
point in k cluster such to maximize/minim a give 



20 

cost function base on distanc between point and/or 
from point to centroids, i. e. suitabl defin posit in 
space. some of the most use function be list below: 

• minimum k-clustering. the cost function here be 
the diamet of a cluster, which be the larg dis- 
tanc between two point of a cluster. the point 
be classifi such that the larg of the k cluster 
diamet be the small possible. the idea be to 
keep the cluster veri “compact”. 

• k-cluster sum. same a minimum k-clustering, 
but the diamet be replac by the averag distanc 
between all pair of point of a cluster. 

• k-center. for each cluster i one defin a refer- 
enc point xi, the centroid, and comput the max- 
imum di of the distanc of each cluster point from 
the centroid. the cluster and centroid be self- 
consist chosen such to minim the larg 
valu of di. 

• k-median. same a k-center, but the maximum dis- 
tanc from the centroid be replac by the averag 
distance. 

the most popular partit techniqu in the literatur 
be k-mean cluster (macqueen, 1967). here the cost 
function be the total intra-clust distance, or squar 
error function 

k∑ 
i=1 

∑ 
xj∈si 

||xj − ci||2, (23) 

where Si indic the subset of point of the i-th clus- 
ter and ci it centroid. the k-mean problem can be 
simpli solv with the lloyd’ algorithm (lloyd, 1982). 
one start from an initi distribut of centroid such 
that they be a far a possibl from each other. In the 
first iteration, each vertex be assign to the near cen- 
troid. next, the center of mass of the k cluster be 
estim and becom a new set of centroids, which al- 
low for a new classif of the vertices, and so on. 
after a small number of iterations, the posit of the 
centroid be stable, and the cluster do not chang ani 
more. the solut found be not optimal, and it strongli 
depend on the initi choic of the centroids. neverthe- 
less, lloyd’ heurist have remain popular due to it 
quick convergence, which make it suitabl for the anal- 
ysi of larg data sets. the result can be improv by 
perform more run start from differ initi con- 
ditions, and pick the solut which yield the mini- 
mum valu of the total intra-clust distance. extens 
of k-mean cluster to graph have be propos by 
some author (hlaoui and wang, 2004; rattigan et al., 
2007; schenker et al., 2003). 

anoth popular technique, similar in spirit to k-mean 
clustering, be fuzzi k-mean cluster (bezdek, 1981; 
dunn, 1974). thi method account for the fact that 
a point may belong to two or more cluster at the same 

time and be wide use in pattern recognition. the as- 
sociat cost function be 

Jm = 

n∑ 
i=1 

k∑ 
j=1 

umij ||xi − cj||2, (24) 

where uij be the membership matrix, which measur the 
degre of membership of point i (with posit xi) in 
cluster j, m be a real number great than 1 and cj be the 
center of cluster j 

cj = 

∑n 
i=1 u 

m 
ijxi∑n 

i=1 u 
m 
ij 

. (25) 

the matrix uij be normal so that the sum of the mem- 
bership of everi point in all cluster yield 1. the mem- 
bership uij be relat to the distanc of point i from the 
center of cluster j, a it be reason to assum that the 
larg thi distance, the low uij . thi can be express 
by the follow relat 

uij = 
1∑k 

l=1 

( 
||xi−cj|| 
||xi−cl|| 

) 2 
m−1 

. (26) 

the cost function Jm can be minim by iter 
eqs. 25 and 26. one start from some initi guess for 
uij and us eq. 25 to comput the centers, which be 
then plug back into eqs. 26, and so on. the pro- 
ce stop when the correspond element of the mem- 
bership matrix in consecut iter differ from each 
other by less than a predefin tolerance. It can be show 
that thi procedur inde deliv a local minimum of 
the cost function Jm of eq. 24. thi procedur have the 
same problem of lloyd’ algorithm for k-mean cluster- 
ing, i. e. the minimum be a local minimum, and depend 
on the initi choic of the matrix uij . 

the limit of partit cluster be the same a 
that of the graph partit algorithms: the number of 
cluster must be specifi at the beginning, the method 
be not abl to deriv it. In addition, the emb in a 
metric space can be natur for some graphs, but rather 
artifici for others. 

D. spectral cluster 

let u suppos to have a set of n object x1, x2, ..., xn 
with a pairwis similar function S defin between 
them, which be symmetr and non-neg (i. e., 
s(xi, xj) = s(xj , xi) ≥ 0, ∀i, j = 1, ..n). spectral clus- 
tere includ all method and techniqu that partit 
the set into cluster by use the eigenvector of matrices, 
like S itself or other matrix deriv from it. In partic- 
ular, the object could be point in some metric space, 
or the vertex of a graph. spectral cluster consist of 
a transform of the initi set of object into a set of 
point in space, whose coordin be element of eigen- 
vectors: the set of point be then cluster via standard 



21 

techniques, like k-mean cluster (section iv.c). one 
may wonder whi it be necessari to cluster the point ob- 
tain through the eigenvectors, when one can directli 
cluster the initi set of objects, base on the similar 
matrix. the reason be that the chang of represent 
induc by the eigenvector make the cluster properti 
of the initi data set much more evident. In thi way, 
spectral cluster be abl to separ data point that 
could not be resolv by appli directli k-mean clus- 
tering, for instance, a the latter tend to deliv convex 
set of points. 

the first contribut on spectral cluster be a pa- 
per by donath and hoffmann (donath and hoffman, 
1973), who use the eigenvector of the adjac matrix 
for graph partitions. In the same year, fiedler (fiedler, 
1973) realiz that from the eigenvector of the second 
small eigenvalu of the laplacian matrix it be pos- 
sibl to obtain a bipartit of the graph with veri low 
cut size, a we have explain in section iv.a. for a 
histor survey see ref. (spielman and teng, 1996). 
In thi section we shall follow the nice tutori by von 
luxburg (von luxburg, 2006), with a focu on spectral 
graph clustering. the concept and method discuss 
below appli to both unweight and weight graphs. 

the laplacian be by far the most use matrix in spec- 
tral clustering. In section a.2 we see that the unnormal- 
ize laplacian of a graph with k connect compon 
have k zero eigenvalues. In thi case the laplacian can 
be write in block-diagon form, i. e. the vertex can 
be order in such a way that the laplacian display 
k squar block along the diagonal, with (some) entri 
differ from zero, wherea all other element vanish. 
each block be the laplacian of the correspond sub- 
graph, so it have the trivial eigenvector with compon 
(1, 1, 1, ..., 1, 1). therefore, there be k degener eigen- 
vector with equal non-vanish compon in corre- 
spondenc of the vertex of a block, wherea all other 
compon be zero. In thi way, from the compon 
of the eigenvector one can identifi the connect com- 
ponent of the graph. for instance, let u consid the 
n×k matrix, whose column be the k eigenvector abov 
mentioned. the i-th row of thi matrix be a vector with k 
compon repres vertex i of the graph. vector 
repres vertex in the same connect compon of 
the graph coincide, and their tip lie on one of the ax of 
a k-dimension system of coordin (i. e. they be all 
vector of the form (0, 0, ...0, 1, 0, ..., 0, 0)). so, by draw- 
ing the vertex vector one would see k distinct points, 
each on a differ axis, correspond to the graph com- 
ponents. 

If the graph be connected, but consist of k subgraph 
which be weakli link to each other, the spectrum of 
the unnorm laplacian will have one zero eigen- 
value, all other be positive. now the laplacian can- 
not be put in block-diagon form: even if one enumer- 
ate the vertex in the order of their cluster membership 
(bi list first the vertex of one cluster, then the ver- 
tice of anoth cluster, etc.) there will alway be some 

non-vanish entri outsid of the blocks. however, the 
low k − 1 non-vanish eigenvalu be still close to 
zero, and the vertex vector of the first k eigenvector 
should still enabl one to clearli distinguish the cluster 
in a k-dimension space. vertex vector correspond 
to the same cluster be now not coincident, in general, but 
still rather close to each other. so, instead of k points, 
one would observ k group of points, with the point of 
each group local close to each other and far from the 
other groups. techniqu like k-mean cluster (sec- 
tion iv.c) can then easili recov the clusters. 

the scenario we have describ be expect from per- 
turbat theori (bhatia, 1997; stewart and sun, 1990). 
In principl all symmetr matrix that can be put in 
block-diagon form have a set of eigenvector (a mani 
a the blocks), such that the element of each eigenvec- 
tor be differ from zero on the vertex of a block and 
zero otherwise, just like the laplacian. the adjac 
matrix itself have the same property, for example. thi be 
a necessari condit for the eigenvector to be success- 
fulli use for graph clustering, but it be not sufficient. In 
the case of the laplacian, for a graph with k connect 
components, we know that the eigenvector correspond- 
ing to the k low eigenvalu come each from one of 
the components. In the case of the adjac matrix A 
(or of it weight counterpart w), instead, it may hap- 
pen that larg eigenvalu refer to the same component. 
so, if one take the eigenvector correspond to the k 
larg eigenvalues8, some compon will be overrepre- 
sented, while other will be absent. therefore, use the 
eigenvector of A (or W) in spectral graph cluster be 
in gener not reliable. moreover, the element of the 
eigenvector correspond to the compon should be 
suffici far from zero. To understand why, suppos 
that we take a (symmetric, block-diagonal) matrix, and 
that one or more element of one of the eigenvector cor- 
respond to the connect compon be veri close 
to zero. If one perturb the graph by add edg be- 
tween differ components, all entri of the perturb 
eigenvector will becom non-zero and some may have 
compar valu a the low element of the eigenvec- 
tor on the blocks. therefor distinguish vertex of 
differ compon may becom a problem, even when 
the perturb be fairli small, and misclassif be 
likely. On the other hand, the non-vanish element of 
the (normalized) eigenvector of the unnorm lapla- 
cian, for instance, be all equal to 1/ 

√ 
ni, where ni be the 

number of vertex in the i-th component. In thi way, 
there be a gap between the low element (here they be 
all equal for the same eigenvector) and zero. thi hold a 
well for the normal laplacian lrw (section a.2). for 
the other normal laplacian lsym (section a.2), the 

8 larg eigenvalu of the adjac matrix be the counterpart of 
the low eigenvalu of the laplacian, sinc L = d−a, where D 
be the diagon matrix whose element be the vertex degrees. 



22 

non-zero element of the eigenvector correspond to 
the connect compon be proport to the squar 
root of the degre of the correspond vertex. so, if de- 
gree be veri differ from each other, and especi if 
there be vertex with veri low degree, some eigenvec- 
tor element may be quit small. As we shall see below, 
in the context of the techniqu by Ng et al. (ng et al., 
2001), a suitabl normal procedur be introduc 
to allevi thi problem. 

now that we have explain whi the laplacian matrix 
be particularli suitabl for spectral clustering, we proceed 
with the descript of three popular methods: unnor- 
maliz spectral cluster and two normal spectral 
cluster techniques, propos by shi and malik (shi 
and malik, 1997, 2000) and by Ng et al. (ng et al., 2001), 
respectively. 

unnorm spectral cluster us the unnormal- 
ize laplacian L. the input be the adjac matrix 
A (W for weight graphs) and the number k of cluster 
to be recovered. the first step consist in comput the 
eigenvector correspond to the low k eigenvalu of 
L. then, one build the n× k matrix V, whose column 
be the k eigenvectors. the n row of V be use to rep- 
resent the graph vertex in a k-dimension euclidean 
space, through a cartesian system of coordinates. the 
point be then group in k cluster by use k-mean 
cluster or similar techniqu (section iv.c). normal- 
ize spectral cluster work in the same way. In the 
version by shi and malik (shi and malik, 1997, 2000), 
one us the eigenvector of the normal laplacian 
lrw (section a.2). In the algorithm by Ng et al. (ng 
et al., 2001) one adopt the normal laplacian lsym 
(section a.2). here, however, the matrix V be normal- 
ize by divid the element of each row by their sum, 
obtain a new matrix U, whose row be then use to 
repres the vertex in space, a in the other methods. 
By do so, it be much more unlik that eigenvector 
compon for a well-separ cluster be close to zero, 
a scenario which would make the classif of the cor- 
respond vertex problematic, a we have say above. 
however, if the graph have some vertex with low degree, 
they may still be misclassified. 

spectral cluster be close relat to graph parti- 
tioning. relax version of the minim of ratio cut 
and normal cut (see section iv.a) can be turn into 
spectral cluster problems, by follow similar proce- 
dure a in spectral graph partitioning. the measur 
to minim can be express in matrix form, obtain- 
ing similar express a for the cut size (see eq. 18), 
with index vector defin the partit of the graph in 
group through the valu of their entries. for instance, 
for the minimum cut bipartit of section iv.a, there 
be onli one index vector s, whose compon equal ±1, 
where the sign indic the two clusters. the relax 
consist in perform the minim over all possibl 
vector s, allow for real-valu compon a well. 
thi version of the problem be exactli equival to spec- 
tral clustering. the relax minim of ratio cut 

for a partit in k cluster yield the n k-dimension 
vertex vector of unnorm spectral cluster (von 
luxburg, 2006); for normal cut one obtain the n k- 
dimension vertex vector of normal spectral cluster- 
ing, with the normal laplacian lrw (shi and malik, 
1997). the problem be then to turn the result vector 
into a partit of the graph, which can be do by us- 
ing techniqu like k-mean clustering, a we have see 
above. however, it be still unclear what be the relat 
between the origin minimum cut problem over actual 
graph partit and the relax version of it, in par- 
ticular how close one can come to the real solut via 
spectral clustering. 

random walk on graph be also relat to spec- 
tral clustering. In fact, by minim the number of 
edg between cluster (properli normal for measur 
like, e. g., ratio cut and normal cut) one forc ran- 
dom walker to spend more time within cluster and to 
move more rare from one cluster to another. In par- 
ticular, unnorm spectral cluster with the lapla- 
cian lrw have a natur link with random walks, becaus 
lrw = I − d−1a (section a.2), where d−1a be the 
transfer matrix T. thi have interest consequences. 
for instance, meilă and shi have proven that the nor- 
maliz cut for a bipartit equal the total probabl 
that a random walker move from one of the cluster to 
the other in either sens (meila and shi, 2001). In thi 
way, minim the normal cut mean look for 
a partit minim the probabl of transit be- 
tween clusters. 

spectral cluster requir the comput of the 
first k eigenvector of a laplacian matrix. If the graph 
be large, an exact comput of the eigenvector be 
impossible, a it would requir a time o(n3). fortu- 
nate there be approxim techniques, like the power 
method or krylov subspac techniqu like the lanczo 
method (golub and loan, 1989), whose speed depend 
on the size of the eigengap |λk+1 − λk|, where λk and 
λk+1 be the k-th and (k + 1)-th small eigenvalu of 
the matrix. the larg the eigengap, the faster the con- 
vergence. In fact, the exist of larg gap between 
pair of consecut eigenvalu could suggest the num- 
ber of cluster of the graph, an inform which be not 
deliv by spectral cluster and which have to be give 
a input. We know that, for a disconnect graph with k 
components, the first k eigenvalu of the laplacian ma- 
trix (normal or not) be zero, whether the (k+ 1)-th 
be non-zero. If the cluster be weakli connect to each 
other, one expect that the first k eigenvalu remain 
close to zero, and that the (k + 1)-th be clearli differ 
from zero. By revers thi argument, the number of 
cluster of a graph could be deriv by check whether 
there be an integ k such that the first k eigenvalu be 
small and the (k+1)-th be rel large. however, when 
the cluster be veri mix with each other, it may be 
hard to identifi signific gap between the eigenvalues. 

the last issu we want to point out concern the choic 
of the laplacian matrix to use in the applications. If the 



23 

graph vertex have the same or similar degrees, there 
be no substanti differ between the unnorm 
and the normal laplacians. If there be big inhomo- 
geneiti among the vertex degrees, instead, the choic 
of the laplacian consider affect the results. In gen- 
eral, normal laplacian be more promis becaus 
the correspond spectral cluster techniqu implic- 
itli impos a doubl optim on the set of partitions, 
such that the intraclust edg densiti be high and, at 
the same time, the interclust edg densiti be low. On 
the contrary, the unnorm laplacian be relat to 
the interclust edg densiti only. moreover, unnormal- 
ize spectral cluster do not alway converge, and 
sometim yield trivial partit in which one or more 
cluster consist of a singl vertex. Of the normal 
laplacians, lrw be more reliabl than lsym becaus the 
eigenvector of lrw correspond to the low eigenval- 
ue be cluster indic vectors, i. e., they have equal 
non-vanish entri in correspond of the vertex 
of each cluster, and zero elsewhere, if the cluster be 
disconnected. the eigenvector of lsym, instead, be ob- 
tain by (left-) multipli those of lrw by the matrix 
d1/2: in thi way, eigenvector compon correspond- 
ing to vertex of the same cluster be no longer equal, in 
general, a complic that may induc artefact in the 
spectral cluster procedure. 

V. divis algorithm 

A simpl way to identifi commun in a graph be to 
detect the edg that connect vertex of differ com- 
muniti and remov them, so that the cluster get dis- 
connect from each other. thi be the philosophi of 
divis algorithms. the crucial point be to find a prop- 
erti of intercommun edg that could allow for their 
identification. divis method do not introduc sub- 
stantial conceptu advanc with respect to tradit 
techniques, a they just perform hierarch cluster 
on the graph at studi (section iv.b). the main differ- 
enc with divis hierarch cluster be that here one 
remov inter-clust edg instead of edg between pair 
of vertex with low similar and there be no guarante a 
priori that inter-clust edg connect vertex with low 
similarity. In some case vertex (with all their adja- 
cent edges) or whole subgraph may be removed, instead 
of singl edges. be hierarch cluster techniques, 
it be customari to repres the result partit by 
mean of dendrograms. 

A. the algorithm of girvan and newman 

the most popular algorithm be that propos by gir- 
van and newman (girvan and newman, 2002; newman 
and girvan, 2004). the method be histor important, 
becaus it mark the begin of a new era in the field 
of commun detect and open thi topic to physi-

fig. 10 edg between be high for edg connect 
communities. In the figure, the edg in the middl have a much 
high between than all other edges, becaus all shortest 
path connect vertex of the two commun run through 
it. reprint figur with permiss from ref. (fortunato and 
castellano, 2009). c©2009 by springer. 

cists. here edg be select accord to the valu of 
measur of edg centrality, estim the import of 
edg accord to some properti or process run on 
the graph. the step of the algorithm are: 

1. comput of the central for all edges; 

2. remov of edg with larg centrality: in case 
of tie with other edges, one of them be pick at 
random; 

3. recalcul of central on the run graph; 

4. iter of the cycl from step 2. 

girvan and newman focu on the concept of between- 
ness, which be a variabl express the frequenc of the 
particip of edg to a process. they consid 
three altern definitions: geodes edg betweenness, 
random-walk edg between and current-flow edg be- 
tweenness. In the follow we shall refer to them a edg 
betweenness, random-walk between and current-flow 
betweenness, respectively. 

edg between be the number of shortest path be- 
tween all vertex pair that run along the edge. It be an 
extens to edg of the popular concept of site between- 
ness, introduc by freeman in 1977 (freeman, 1977) 
and express the import of edg in process like 
inform spreading, where inform usual flow 
through shortest paths. histor edg between 
be introduc befor site between in a never pub- 
lish technic report by anthoniss (anthonisse, 1971). 
It be intuit that intercommun edg have a larg 
valu of the edg betweenness, becaus mani shortest 
path connect vertex of differ commun will 
pa through them (fig. 10). As in the calcul of 
site betweenness, if there be two or more geodes path 
with the same endpoint that run through an edge, the 
contribut of each of them to the between of the 
edg must be divid by the multipl of the paths, 
a one assum that the signal/inform propag 
equal along each geodes path. the between of all 
edg of the graph can be calcul in a time that scale 
a o(mn), or o(n2) on a spars graph, with techniqu 



24 

base on breadth-first-search (brandes, 2001; newman 
and girvan, 2004; zhou et al., 2006). 

In the context of inform spreading, one could 
imagin that signal flow across random rather than 
geodes paths. In thi case the between of an edg 
be give by the frequenc of the passag across the edg 
of a random walker run on the graph (random-walk 
betweenness). A random walker move from a vertex 
follow each adjac edg with equal probability. A pair 
of vertex be chosen at random, s and t. the walker start 
at s and keep move until it hit t, where it stops. one 
comput the probabl that each edg be cross by 
the walker, and averag over all possibl choic for the 
vertex s and t. It be meaning to comput the net 
cross probability, which be proport to the num- 
ber of time the walk cross the edg in one direction. 
In thi way one neglect back and forth passag that 
be accid of the random walk and tell noth about 
the central of the edge. calcul of random-walk 
between requir the invers of an n × n matrix 
(once), follow by obtain and averag the flow for 
all pair of nodes. the first task requir a time o(n3), 
the second o(mn2), for a total complex o[(m+n)n2], 
or o(n3) for a spars matrix. the complet calcul 
requir a time o(n3) on a spars graph. 

current-flow between be defin by consid the 
graph a resistor network, with edg have unit resis- 
tance. If a voltag differ be appli between ani two 
vertices, each edg carri some amount of current, that 
can be calcul by solv kirchoff’ equations. the 
procedur be repeat for all possibl vertex pairs: the 
current-flow between of an edg be the averag valu 
of the current carri by the edge. It be possibl to show 
that thi measur be equival to random-walk between- 
ness, a the voltag differ and the random walk net 
flow across the edg satisfi the same equat (new- 
man, 2005). therefore, the calcul of current-flow 
between have the same complex o[(m + n)n2], or 
o(n3) for a spars graph. 

calcul edg between be much faster than 
current-flow or random walk between [o(n2) versu 
o(n3) on spars graphs]. In addition, in practic ap- 
plicat the girvan-newman algorithm with edg be- 
tween give good result than adopt the other 
central measur (newman and girvan, 2004). nu- 
meric studi show that the recalcul step 3 of 
girvan-newman algorithm be essenti to detect mean- 
ing communities. thi introduc an addit factor 
m in the run time of the algorithm: consequently, 
the edg between version scale a o(m2n), or o(n3) 
on a spars graph. On graph with strong commun 
structure, that quickli break into communities, the re- 
calcul step need to be perform onli within the 
connect compon includ the last remov edg 
(or the two compon bridg by it if the remov of 
the edg split a subgraph), a the edg between of all 
other edg remain the same. thi can help save some 
comput time, although it be imposs to give estim 

of the gain sinc it depend on the specif graph at hand. 
nevertheless, the algorithm be quit slow, and applic 
to spars graph with up to n ∼ 10000 vertices, with 
current comput resources. In the origin version 
of girvan-newman’ algorithm (girvan and newman, 
2002), the author have to deal with the whole hierar- 
chi of partitions, a they have no procedur to say which 
partit be the best. In a success refin (new- 
man and girvan, 2004), they select the partit with 
the larg valu of modular (see section iii.c.2), a 
criterion that have be frequent use ever since. the 
method can be simpli extend to the case of weight 
graphs, by suitabl gener the edg betweenness. 
the between of a weight edg equal the between- 
ness of the edg in the correspond unweight graph, 
divid by the weight of the edg (newman, 2004). there 
have be countless applic of the girvan-newman 
method: the algorithm be now integr in well know 
librari of network analysi programs. 

tyler et al. propos a modif of the girvan- 
newman algorithm, to improv the speed of the calcula- 
tion (tyler et al., 2003; wilkinson and huberman, 2004). 
the gain in speed be requir by the analysi of graph 
of gene co-occurrences, which be too larg to be ana- 
lyze by the algorithm of girvan and newman. algo- 
rithm comput site/edg between start from ani 
vertex, take a center, and comput the contribut to 
between from all path origin at that vertex; the 
procedur be then repeat for all vertex (brandes, 2001; 
newman and girvan, 2004; zhou et al., 2006). tyler et 
al. propos to calcul the contribut to edg be- 
tween onli from a limit number of centers, chosen 
at random, deriv a sort of mont carlo estimate. nu- 
meric test indic that, for each connect subgraph, 
it suffic to pick a number of center grow a the log- 
arithm of the number of vertex of the component. for 
a give choic of the centers, the algorithm proce just 
like that of girvan and newman. the stop criterion 
be different, though, a it do not requir the calcula- 
tion of modular on the result partitions, but reli 
on a particular definit of community. accord to 
such definition, a connect subgraph with n0 vertex be 
a commun if the edg between of ani of it edg 
do not exceed n0 − 1. indeed, if the subgraph consist 
of two part connect by a singl edge, the between- 
ness valu of that edg would be great than or equal to 
n0 − 1, with the equal hold onli if one of the two 
part consist of a singl vertex. therefore, the condit 
on the between of the edg would exclud such sit- 
uations, although other type of cluster structur might 
still be compat with it. In thi way, in the method of 
tyler et al., edg be remov until all connect com- 
ponent of the partit be “communities” in the sens 
explain above. the mont carlo sampl of the edg 
between necessarili induc statist errors. As a 
consequence, the partit be in gener differ for 
differ choic of the set of center vertices. however, 
the author show that, by repeat the calcul 



25 

mani times, the method give good result on a network 
of gene co-occurr (wilkinson and huberman, 2004), 
with a substanti gain of comput time. the techniqu 
have be also appli to a network of peopl correspond- 
ing via email (tyler et al., 2003). In practic examples, 
onli vertex lie at the boundari between commun 
may not be clearli classified, and be assign sometim 
to a group, sometim to another. thi be actual a nice 
featur of the method, a it allow to identifi overlap 
between communities, a well a the degre of member- 
ship of overlap vertex in the cluster they belong 
to. the algorithm of girvan and newman, which be de- 
terministic, be unabl to accomplish this9. anoth fast 
version of the girvan-newman algorithm have be pro- 
pose by rattigan et al. (rattigan et al., 2007). here, 
a quick approxim of the edg between valu 
be carri out by use a network structur index, which 
consist of a set of vertex annot combin with a 
distanc measur (rattigan et al., 2006). basic one 
divid the graph into region and comput the distanc 
of everi vertex from each region. In thi way rattigan et 
al. show that it be possibl to low the complex of 
the algorithm to o(m), by keep a fair accuraci in the 
estim of the edg between values. thi version of 
the girvan-newman algorithm give good result on the 
benchmark graph propos by brand et al. (brand 
et al., 2003) (see also section xv.a), a well a on a col- 
labor network of actor and on a citat network. 

chen and yuan have point out that count all pos- 
sibl shortest path in the calcul of the edg be- 
tween may lead to unbalanc partitions, with com- 
muniti of veri differ size, and propos to count onli 
non-redund paths, i. e. path whose endpoint be 
all differ from each other: the result between 
yield good result than standard edg between for 
mix cluster on the benchmark graph of girvan and 
newman (chen and yuan, 2006). holm et al. have use 
a modifi version of the algorithm in which vertices, 
rather than edges, be remov (holm et al., 2003). A 
central measur for the vertices, proport to their 
site betweenness, and invers proport to their in- 
degree, be chosen to identifi boundari vertices, which 
be then iter remov with all their edges. thi 
modification, appli to studi the hierarch organiza- 
tion of biochem networks, be motiv by the need to 
account for reaction kinet information, that simpl site 
between do not include. the indegre of a vertex be 
sole use becaus it indic the number of substrat 
to a metabol reaction involv that vertex; for the pur- 
pose of cluster the graph be consid undirected, a 
usual. 

9 It may happen that, at a give iteration, two or more edg of the 
graph have the same valu of maxim betweenness. In thi case 
one can pick ani of them at random, which may lead in gener 
to (slightly) differ partit at the end of the computation. 

the algorithm of girvan and newman be unabl to 
find overlap communities, a each vertex be assign 
to a singl cluster. pinney and westhead have propos 
a modif of the algorithm in which vertex can 
be split between commun (pinney and westhead, 
2006). To do that, they also comput the between 
of all vertex of the graph. unfortun the valu of 
edg and site between cannot be simpli compared, 
due to their differ normalization, but the author re- 
mark that the two endvertic of an inter-clust edg 
should have similar between values, a the shortest 
path cross one of them be like to reach the other 
one a well through the edge. So they take the edg with 
larg between and remov it onli if the ratio of the 
between valu of it endvertic be between α and 
1/α, with α = 0.8. otherwise, the vertex with high 
between (with all it adjac edges) be temporarili 
removed. when a subgraph be split by vertex or edg 
removal, all delet vertex belong to that subgraph 
be “copied” in each subcomponent, along with all their 
edges. gregori (gregory, 2007) have propos a similar 
approach, name conga (cluster overlap newman- 
girvan algorithm), in which vertex be split among 
cluster if their site between exce the maximum 
valu of the between of the edges. A vertex be split 
by assign some of it edg to one of it duplicates, 
and the rest to the other. there be sever possibl 
to do that, gregori propos to go for the split that 
yield the maximum of a new central measure, call 
split betweenness, which be the number of shortest path 
that would run between two part of a vertex if the latter 
be split. the method have a worst-cas complex 
o(m3), or o(n3) on a spars graph, like the algorithm 
of girvan and newman. the code can be found at 
http://www.cs.bris.ac.uk/∼steve/networks/index. 
html. 

B. other method 

anoth promis track to detect inter-clust edg 
be relat to the presenc of cycles, i. e. close non- 
intersect paths, in the graph. commun be char- 
acter by a high densiti of edges, so it be reason 
to expect that such edg form cycles. On the contrary, 
edg lie between commun will hardli be part of 
cycles. base on thi intuit idea, radicchi et al. pro- 
pose a new measure, the edg cluster coefficient, such 
that low valu of the measur be like to correspond 
to intercommun edg (radicchi et al., 2004). the 
edg cluster coeffici gener to edg the notion 
of cluster coeffici introduc by watt and stro- 
gatz for vertex (watt and strogatz, 1998) (fig. 11). 
the cluster coeffici of a vertex be the number of 
triangl includ the vertex divid by the number of 
possibl triangl that can be form (section a.1). the 



26 

fig. 11 schemat illustr of the edg cluster coef- 
ficient introduc by radicchi et al. (radicchi et al., 2004). 
the two grey vertex have five and six other neighbors, re- 
spectively. Of the five possibl triangl base on the edg 
connect the grey vertices, three be actual there, yield- 
ing an edg cluster coeffici C3 = 3/5. courtesi by F. 
radicchi. 

edg cluster coeffici be defin a 

C̃ 
(g) 
i,j = 

z 
(g) 
i,j + 1 

s 
(g) 
i,j 

, (27) 

where i and j be the extrem of the edge, z 
(g) 
i,j the 

number of cycl of length g built upon edg ij and s 
(g) 
i,j 

the possibl number of cycl of length g that one could 
build base on the exist edg of i, j and their neigh- 
bors. the number of actual cycl in the numer be 
augment by 1 to enabl a rank among edg with- 

out cycles, which would all yield a coeffici C̃ 
(g) 
i,j equal 

to zero, independ of the degre of the extrem 
i and j and their neighbors. usually, cycl of length 
g = 3 (triangles) or 4 be considered. the measur be 
(anti)correl with edg betweenness: edg with low 
edg cluster coeffici usual have high between 
and vice versa, although the correl be not perfect. 
the method work a the algorithm by girvan and new- 
man. At each iteration, the edg with small cluster 
coeffici be removed, the measur be recalcul again, 
and so on. If the remov of an edg lead to a split 
of a subgraph in two parts, the split be accept onli 
if both cluster be ls-set (“strong”) or “weak” com- 
muniti (see section iii.b.2). the verif of the 
commun condit on the cluster be perform on the 
full adjac matrix of the initi graph. If the condi- 
tion be satisfi onli for one of the two clusters, the 
initi subgraph may be a random graph, a it can be 
easili see that by cut a random graph á la erdö 
and rényi in two parts, the larg of them be a strong (or 
weak) commun with veri high probability, wherea the 
small part be not. enforc the commun condit 
on both clusters, it be more like that the subgraph to 

be split inde have a cluster structure. therefore, the al- 
gorithm stop when all cluster produc by the edg re- 
moval be commun in the strong or weak sense, and 
further split would violat thi condition. the author 
suggest to use the same stop criterion for the al- 
gorithm of girvan and newman, to get structur well- 
defin clusters. sinc the edg cluster coeffici be a 
local measure, involv at most an extend neighbor- 
hood of the edge, it can be calcul veri quickly. the 
run time of the algorithm to complet iso(m4/n2), 
or o(n2) on a spars graph, if g be small, so it be much 
shorter than the run time of the girvan-newman 
method. the recalcul step becom slow if g be not 
so small, a in thi case the number of edg whose co- 
effici need to be recalcul may reach a sizeabl 
fraction of the edg of the graph; likewise, count the 
number of cycl base on one edg becom lengthier. 
If g ∼ 2d, where d be the diamet of the graph (which 
be usual a small number for real networks), the cycl 
span the whole graph and the measur becom global 
and no more local. the comput complex in 
thi case exce that of the algorithm of girvan and 
newman, but it can come close to it for practic pur- 
pose even at low valu of g. so, by tune g one can 
smoothli interpol between a local and a global cen- 
traliti measure. the softwar of the algorithm can be 
found in http://filrad.homelinux.org/data/. In a 
success paper (c. castellano et al., 2004) the author 
extend the method to the case of weight networks, 
by modifi the edg cluster coeffici of eq. 27, 

in that the number of cycl z 
(g) 
i,j be multipli by the 

weight of the edg ij. the definit of strong and 
weak commun can be trivial extend to weight 
graph by replac the internal/extern degre of the 
vertices/clust with the correspond strengths. more 
recently, the method have be extend to bipartit net- 
work (zhang et al., 2007), where onli cycl of even 
length be possibl (g = 4, 6, 8, etc.). the algorithm by 
radicchi et al. may give poor result when the graph have 
few cycles, a it happen in some social and mani non- 
social networks. In thi case, in fact, the edg cluster 
coeffici be small and fairli similar for most edges, and 
the algorithm may fail to identifi the bridg between 
communities. 

An altern measur of central for edg be in- 
format centrality. It be base on the concept of ef- 
ficienc (latora and marchiori, 2001), which estim 
how easili inform travel on a graph accord to 
the length of shortest path between vertices. the effi- 
cienci of a network be defin a the averag of the in- 
vers distanc between all pair of vertices. If the ver- 
tice be “close” to each other, the effici be high. the 
inform central of an edg be the rel varia- 
tion of the effici of the graph if the edg be removed. 
In the algorithm by fortunato et al. (fortunato et al., 
2004), edg be remov accord to decreas valu 
of inform centrality. the method be analog to 
that of girvan and newman. comput the informa- 



27 

tion central of an edg requir the calcul of the 
distanc between all pair of vertices, which can be do 
with breadth-first-search in a time o(mn). so, in order 
to comput the inform central of all edg one re- 
quir a time o(m2n). At thi point one remov the edg 
with the larg valu of inform central and recal- 
culat the inform central of all remain edg 
with respect to the run graph. sinc the procedur be 
iter until there be no more edg in the network, the 
final complex be o(m3n), or o(n4) on a spars graph. 
the partit with the larg valu of modular be cho- 
sen a most repres of the commun structur of 
the graph. the method be much slow than the algo- 
rithm of girvan and newman. partit obtain with 
both techniqu be rather consistent, mainli becaus in- 
format central have a strong correl with edg 
betweenness. the algorithm by fortunato et al. give 
good result when commun be mixed, i. e. with a 
high degre of interconnectedness, but it tend to isol 
leaf vertex and small loos bound subgraphs. 

A measur of vertex central base on loops, similar 
to the cluster coeffici by watt and strogatz (watt 
and strogatz, 1998), have be introduc by vragoviĉ 
and loui (vragović and louis, 2006). the idea be that 
neighbor of a vertex well insid a commun be “close” 
to each other, even in the absenc of the vertex, due to 
the high densiti of intra-clust edges. suppos that j 
and k be neighbor of a vertex i: djk/i be the length of 
a shortest path between j and k, if i be remov from 
the graph. naturally, the exist of altern path 
to j − i − k impli the exist of loop in the graph. 
vragoviĉ and loui defin the loop coeffici of i a 
the averag of 1/djk/i over all pair of neighbor of i, 
somewhat remind of the concept of inform cen- 
traliti use in the method by fortunato et al. (fortunato 
et al., 2004). high valu of the loop coeffici be like 
to identifi core vertex of communities, wherea low val- 
ue correspond to vertex lie at the boundari between 
communities. cluster be built around the vertex with 
high valu of the loop coefficient. the method have 
time complex o(nm); it result be not so accurate, 
a compar to popular cluster techniques. 

vi. modularity-bas method 

newman-girvan modular Q (section iii.c.2), orig- 
inal introduc to defin a stop criterion for the 
algorithm of girvan and newman, have rapidli becom 
an essenti element of mani cluster methods. mod- 
ular be by far the most use and best know qual- 
iti function. It repres one of the first attempt to 
achiev a first principl understand of the cluster 
problem, and it emb in it compact form all essenti 
ingredi and questions, from the definit of commu- 
nity, to the choic of a null model, to the express of the 
“strength” of commun and partitions. In thi section 
we shall focu on all cluster techniqu that requir 

modularity, directli and/or indirectly. We will examin 
fast techniqu that can be use on larg graphs, but 
which do not find good optimum for the measur (blon- 
del et al., 2008; clauset et al., 2004; danon et al., 2006; 
Du et al., 2007; mei et al., 2009; newman, 2004b; noack 
and rotta, 2009; pujol et al., 2006; schuetz and caflisch, 
2008a,b; wakita and tsurumi, 2007; xiang et al., 2009); 
more accur methods, which be comput de- 
mand (guimerà et al., 2004; massen and doye, 2005; 
medu et al., 2005); algorithm give a good tradeoff be- 
tween high accuraci and low complex (duch and are- 
nas, 2005; lehmann and hansen, 2007; newman, 2006b; 
ruan and zhang, 2007; white and smyth, 2005). We 
shall also point out other properti of modularity, dis- 
cuss some extensions/modif of it, a well a high- 
light it limits. 

A. modular optim 

By assumption, high valu of modular indic 
good partitions10. so, the partit correspond to it 
maximum valu on a give graph should be the best, or 
at least a veri good one. thi be the main motiv 
for modular maximization, by far the most popular 
class of method to detect commun in graphs. An 
exhaust optim of Q be impossible, due to the 
huge number of way in which it be possibl to partit 
a graph, even when the latter be small. besides, the true 
maximum be out of reach, a it have be recent prove 
that modular optim be an np-complet prob- 
lem (brand et al., 2006), so it be probabl imposs 
to find the solut in a time grow polynomi with 
the size of the graph. however, there be current sev- 
eral algorithm abl to find fairli good approxim 
of the modular maximum in a reason time. 

1. greedi techniqu 

the first algorithm devis to maxim modular 
be a greedi method of newman (newman, 2004b). It 
be an agglom hierarch cluster method, where 
group of vertex be success join to form larg 
commun such that modular increas after the 
merging. one start from n clusters, each contain 
a singl vertex. edg be not initi present, they be 
add one by one dure the procedure. however, the 
modular of partit explor dure the procedur 
be alway calcul from the full topolog of the graph, 
a we want to find the modular maximum on the space 
of partit of the full graph. ad a first edg to the 
set of disconnect vertex reduc the number of group 
from n to n−1, so it deliv a new partit of the graph. 

10 thi be not true in general, a we shall discu in section vi.c. 



28 

the edg be chosen such that thi partit give the max- 
imum increas (minimum decrease) of modular with 
respect to the previou configuration. all other edg 
be add base on the same principle. If the insert 
of an edg do not chang the partition, i. e. the edg 
be intern to one of the cluster previous formed, mod- 
ular stay the same. the number of partit found 
dure the procedur be n, each with a differ number 
of clusters, from n to 1. the larg valu of modular 
in thi subset of partit be the approxim of the 
modular maximum give by the algorithm. At each 
iter step, one need to comput the variat ∆Q of 
modular give by the merger of ani two commun 
of the run partition, so that one can choos the best 
merger. however, merg commun between which 
there be no edg can never lead to an increas of Q, 
so one have to check onli the pair of commun which 
be connect by edges, of which there cannot be more 
than m. sinc the calcul of each ∆Q can be do 
in constant time, thi part of the calcul requir a 
time o(m). after decid which commun be to be 
merged, one need to updat the matrix eij express 
the fraction of edg between cluster i and j of the run- 
ning partit (necessari to comput q), which can be 
do in a worst-cas time o(n). sinc the algorithm re- 
quir n − 1 iter (commun mergers) to run to 
completion, it complex be o((m + n)n), or o(n2) on 
a spars graph, so it enabl one to perform a cluster 
analysi on much larg network than the algorithm of 
girvan and newman (up to an order of 100000 vertex 
with current computers). In a late paper (clauset et al., 
2004), clauset et al. point out that the updat of the 
matrix eij in newman’ algorithm involv a larg num- 
ber of useless operations, due to the sparsiti of the adja- 
cenci matrix. thi oper can be perform more ef- 
ficient by use data structur for spars matrices, like 
max-heaps, which rearrang the data in the form of bi- 
nari trees. clauset et al. maintain the matrix of mod- 
ular variat ∆qij , which be also sparse, a max-heap 
contain the larg element of each row of the matrix 
∆qij a well a the label of the correspond commu- 
nities, and a simpl array whose element be the sum 
of the element of each row of the old matrix eij . the 
optim of modular can be carri out use these 
three data structures, whose updat be much quicker than 
in newman’ technique. the complex of the algorithm 
be o(md log n), where d be the depth of the dendrogram 
describ the success partit found dure the ex- 
ecut of the algorithm, which grow a log n for graph 
with a strong hierarch structure. for those graphs, 
the run time of the method be then o(n log2 n), which 
allow to analys the commun structur of veri larg 
graphs, up to 106 vertices. the greedi optim of 
clauset et al. be current one of the few algorithm that 
can be use to estim the modular maximum on such 
larg graphs. the code can be freeli download from 
http://cs.unm.edu/∼aaron/research/fastmodulari 
ty.htm. 

thi greedi optim of modular tend to form 
quickli larg commun at the expens of small ones, 
which often yield poor valu of the modular maxima. 
danon et al. suggest to normal the modular 
variat ∆Q produc by the merger of two communi- 
tie by the fraction of edg incid to one of the two 
communities, in order to favor small cluster (danon 
et al., 2006). thi trick lead to good modular 
optimum a compar to the origin recip of newman, 
especi when commun be veri differ in size. 
wakita and tsurumi (wakita and tsurumi, 2007) have 
notic that, due to the bia toward larg communities, 
the fast algorithm by clauset et al. be inefficient, becaus 
it yield veri unbalanc dendrograms, for which the 
relat d ∼ log n do not hold, and a a consequ 
the method often run at it worst-cas complexity. To 
improv the situat they propos a modif in 
which, at each step, one seek the commun merger 
deliv the larg valu of the product of the modu- 
lariti variat ∆Q time a factor (consolid ratio), 
that peak for commun of equal size. In thi way 
there be a tradeoff between the gain in modular and 
the balanc of the commun to merge, with a big gain 
in the speed of the procedure, that enabl the analysi 
of system with up to 107 vertices. interestingly, thi 
modif often lead to good modular maximum 
than those found with the version of clauset et al., at 
least on larg social networks. the code can be found at 
http://www.is.titech.ac.jp/∼wakita/en/softwar 
/community-analysis-software/. anoth trick to 
avoid the format of larg commun be propos 
by schuetz and caflisch and consist in allow for the 
merger of more commun pairs, instead of one, at each 
iter (schuetz and caflisch, 2008a,b). thi gener 
sever “centers” around which commun be formed, 
which grow simultan so that a condens into a 
few larg cluster be unlikely. thi modifi version of the 
greedi algorithm be combin with a simpl refin 
procedur in which singl vertex be move to the neigh- 
bore commun that yield the maximum increas of 
modularity. the method have the same complex of 
the fast optim by clauset et al., but come closer 
to the modular maximum. the softwar be avail at 
http://www.biochem-caflisch.uzh.ch/public/5/net 
work-clusterization-algorithm.html. the accu- 
raci of the greedi optim can be significantli 
improv if the hierarch agglomer be start 
from some reason intermedi configuration, rather 
than from the individu vertex (du et al., 2007; 
pujol et al., 2006). xiang et al. suggest to start 
from a configur obtain by merg the origin 
isol vertex into larg subgraphs, accord to the 
valu of a measur of topolog similar between 
subgraph (xiang et al., 2009). A similar approach have 
be describ by Ye et al. (ye et al., 2008): here the 
initi partit be such that no singl vertex can be 
move from it cluster to anoth without decreas 
Q. higher-qu modular can be also achiev by 



29 

appli refin strategi base on local search at 
variou step of the greedi agglomer (noack and 
rotta, 2009). such refin procedur be similar 
to the techniqu propos by newman to improv 
the result of hi spectral optim of modular 
((newman, 2006b) and section vi.a.4). anoth good 
strategi consist in altern greedi optim with 
stochast perturb of the partit (mei et al., 
2009). 

A differ greedi approach have be introduc by 
blondel et al. (blondel et al., 2008), for the gener case 
of weight graphs. initially, all vertex of the graph be 
put in differ communities. the first step consist of 
a sequenti sweep over all vertices. given a vertex i, 
one comput the gain in weight modular (eq. 35) 
come from put i in the commun of it neighbor 
j and pick the commun of the neighbor that yield 
the larg increas of Q, a long a it be positive. At the 
end of the sweep, one obtain the first level partition. In 
the second step commun be replac by superver- 
tices, and two supervertic be connect if there be at 
least an edg between vertex of the correspond com- 
munities. In thi case, the weight of the edg between 
the supervertic be the sum of the weight of the edg 
between the repres commun at the low level. 
the two step of the algorithm be then repeated, yield- 
ing new hierarch level and supergraph (fig. 12). We 
remark that modular be alway comput from the ini- 
tial graph topology: oper on supergraph enabl 
one to consid the variat of modular for parti- 
tion of the origin graph after merg and/or split- 
ting of group of vertices. therefore, at some iteration, 
modular cannot increas anymore, and the algorithm 
stops. the techniqu be more limit by storag demand 
than by comput time. the latter grow like o(m), 
so the algorithm be extrem fast and graph with up 
to 109 edg can be analyz in a reason time on 
current comput resources. the softwar can be 
found at http://findcommunities.googlepages.com/. 
the modular maximum found by the method be bet- 
ter than those found with the greedi techniqu by 
clauset et al. (clauset et al., 2004) and wakita and 
tsurumi (wakita and tsurumi, 2007). however, clos- 
ing commun within the immedi neighborhood of 
vertex may be inaccur and yield spuriou partit 
in practic cases. so, it be not clear whether some of the 
intermedi partit could correspond to meaning 
hierarch level of the graph. moreover, the result 
of the algorithm depend on the order of the sequenti 
sweep over the vertices. 

We conclud by stress that, despit the improve- 
ment and refin of the last years, the accuraci of 
greedi optim be not that good, a compar with 
other techniques. 

2. simul anneal 

simul anneal (kirkpatrick et al., 1983) be a 
probabilist procedur for global optim use in 
differ field and problems. It consist in perform 
an explor of the space of possibl states, look for 
the global optimum of a function F , say it maximum. 
transit from one state to anoth occur with proba- 
biliti 1 if F increas after the change, otherwis with a 
probabl exp(β∆f ), where ∆F be the decreas of the 
function and β be an index of stochast noise, a sort of 
invers temperature, which increas after each iteration. 
the nois reduc the risk that the system get trap 
in local optima. At some stage, the system converg to a 
stabl state, which can be an arbitrarili good approxima- 
tion of the maximum of F , depend on how mani state 
be explor and how slowli β be varied. simul an- 
neal be first employ for modular optim 
by guimerà et al. (guimerà et al., 2004). it standard 
implement (guimerà and amaral, 2005) combin 
two type of “moves”: local moves, where a singl vertex 
be shift from one cluster to another, take at random; 
global moves, consist of merger and split of com- 
munities. split can be carri out in sever distinct 
ways. the best perform be achiev if one optim 
the modular of a bipartit of the cluster, take a 
an isol graph. thi be do again with simul an- 
nealing, where one consid onli individu vertex move- 
ments, and the temperatur be decreas until it reach 
the run valu for the global optimization. global 
move reduc the risk of get trap in local min- 
ima and they have proven to lead to much good optimum 
than use simpli local move (massen and doye, 2005; 
medu et al., 2005). In practic applications, one typi- 
calli combin n2 local move with n global one in one 
iteration. the method can potenti come veri close 
to the true modular maximum, but it be slow. the 
actual complex cannot be estimated, a it heavili de- 
pend on the paramet chosen for the optim (ini- 
tial temperature, cool factor), not onli on the graph 
size. simul anneal can be use for small graphs, 
with up to about 104 vertices. 

3. extrem optim 

extrem optim (eo) be a heurist search pro- 
cedur propos by boettcher and percu (boettcher and 
percus, 2001), in order to achiev an accuraci compara- 
ble with simul annealing, but with a substanti gain 
in comput time. It be base on the optim of local 
variables, express the contribut of each unit of the 
system to the global function at study. thi techniqu 
be use for modular optim by duch and are- 
na (duch and arenas, 2005). modular can be inde 
write a a sum over the vertices: the local modular 
of a vertex be the valu of the correspond term in thi 
sum. A fit measur for each vertex be obtain by 



30 

fig. 12 hierarch optim of modular by blondel et al. (blondel et al., 2008). the diagram show two iter of 
the method, start from the graph on the left. each iter consist of a step, in which everi vertex be assign to the (local) 
cluster that produc the larg modular increase, follow by a success transform of the cluster into vertex of a 
small (weighted) graph, repres the next high hierarch level. reprint figur with permiss from ref. (blondel 
et al., 2008). c©2008 by iop publish and sissa. 

divid the local modular of the vertex by it degree, 
a in thi case the measur do not depend on the degre 
of the vertex and be suitabl normalized. one start from 
a random partit of the graph in two group with the 
same number of vertices. At each iteration, the vertex 
with the low fit be shift to the other cluster. the 
move chang the partition, so the local fit of mani 
vertex need to be recalculated. the process continu 
until the global modular Q cannot be improv ani 
more by the procedure. thi techniqu remind one of 
the kernighan-lin (kernighan and lin, 1970) algorithm 
for graph partit (section iv.a), but here the size 
of the commun be determin by the process itself, 
wherea in graph partit they be fix from the be- 
ginning. after the bipartition, each cluster be consid 
a a graph on it own and the procedur be repeated, a 
long a Q increas for the partit found. the pro- 
cedure, a described, proce determinist from the 
give initi partition, a one shift systemat the 
vertex with low fitness, and be like to get trap 
in local optima. better result can be obtain if one 
introduc a probabilist selection, in which vertex be 
rank base on their fit valu and one pick the 
vertex of rank q with the probabl P (q) ∼ q−τ (τ -eo, 

(boettcher and percus, 2001)). the algorithm find veri 
good estim of the modular maximum, and per- 
form veri well on the benchmark of girvan and new- 
man (girvan and newman, 2002) (section xv.a) . rank- 
ing the fit valu have a cost o(n log n), which can be 
reduc to o(n) if heap data structur be used. choos- 
ing the vertex to be shift can be do with a binari 
search, which amount to an addit factor o(log n). 
finally, the number of step need to verifi whether 
the run modular maximum can be improv or 
not be also o(n). the total complex of the method 
be then o(n2 log n). We conclud that EO repres a 
good tradeoff between accuraci and speed, although the 
use of recurs bisect may lead to poor result on 
larg network with mani communities. 

4. spectral optim 

modular can be optim use the eigenvalu and 
eigenvector of a special matrix, the modular matrix 
B, whose element be

. (28)

here the notat be the same use in eq. 14. let s be 
the vector repres ani partit of the graph in two 
cluster A and B: si = +1 if vertex i belong to A, 
si = −1 if i belong to B. modular can be write a

where βi be the eigenvalu of B correspond to the 
eigenvector ui. eq. 30 be analog to eq. 19 for the 
cut size of the graph partit problem. thi sug- 
gest that one can optim modular on bipartit 
via spectral bisect (section iv.a), by replac the 
laplacian matrix with the modular matrix (newman, 
2006a,b). like the laplacian matrix, B have alway the 
trivial eigenvector (1, 1, ..., 1) with eigenvalu zero, be- 
caus the sum of the element of each row/column of 
the matrix vanishes. from eq. 30 we see that, if B have 
no posit eigenvalues, the maximum coincid with the 
trivial partit consist of the graph a a singl cluster 
(for which Q = 0), i. e. it have no commun structure. 
otherwise, one have to look for the eigenvector of B with 
larg (positive) eigenvalue, u1, and group the vertex 
accord to the sign of the compon of u1, just like 
in section iv.a. here, however, one do not need to 
specifi the size of the two groups: the vertex with pos- 
itiv compon be all in one group, the other in the 
other group. if, for example, the compon of u1 cor- 
respond to vertex i be positive, but we set si = −1, 
the modular be low than by set si = +1. the 
valu of the compon of u1 be also informative, a 
they indic the level of the particip of the ver- 
tice to their communities. In particular, compon 
whose valu be close to zero lie at the border between 
the two cluster and can be well consid a belong 
to both of them. the result obtain from the spectral 
bipartit can be further improv by shift singl ver- 
tice from one commun to the other, such to have the 
high increas (or low decrease) of the modular of 
the result graph partition. thi refin technique, 
similar to the kernighan-lin algorithm (section iv.a), 
can be also appli to improv the result of other op- 
timiz techniqu (e.g. greedi algorithms, extrem 
optimization, etc.). the procedur be repeat for each 

of the cluster separately, and the number of communi- 
tie increas a long a modular does. At varianc 
with graph partitioning, where one need to fix the num- 
ber of cluster and their size beforehand, here there be a 
clear-cut stop criterion, repres by the fact that 
cluster subdivis be admit onli if they lead to a 
modular increase. We stress that modular need 
to be alway comput from the full adjac matrix 
of the origin graph11. the drawback of the method 
be similar a for spectral bisection, i. e. the algorithm 
give the best result for bisections, wherea it be less ac- 
curat when the number of commun be larg than 
two. recently, sun et al. (sun et al., 2009) have add a 
step after each bipartit of a cluster, in that singl ver- 
tice can be move from one cluster to anoth and even 
form the seed of new clusters. We remark that the pro- 
cedur be differ from the kernighan-lin-lik refin 
steps, a here the number of cluster can change. thi 
variant, which do not increas the complex of the 
origin spectral optimization, lead to good modular- 
iti maxima. moreover, one do not need to stick to 
bisectioning, if other eigenvector with posit eigenval- 
ue of the modular matrix be used. given the first p 
eigenvectors, one can construct n p-dimension vectors, 
each correspond to a vertex, just like in spectral par- 
tition (section iv.d). the compon of the vector 
of vertex i be proport to the p entri of the eigen- 
vector in posit i. then one can defin commun 
vectors, by sum the vector of vertex in the same 
community. It be possibl to show that, if the vector of 
two commun form an angl larg that π/2, keep 
the commun separ yield larg modular than if 
they be merg (fig. 13). In thi way, in a p-dimension 
space the modular maximum correspond to a parti- 
tion in at most p + 1 clusters. commun vector be 
use by wang et al. to obtain high-modular partit 
into a number of commun small than a give max- 
imum (wang et al., 2008). In particular, if one take the 
eigenvector correspond to the two larg eigenval- 
ues, one can obtain a split of the graph in three clusters: 
in a recent work, richardson et al. present a fast tech- 
niqu to obtain graph tripartit with larg modular 
along these line (richardson et al., 2009). the eigenvec- 
tor with the most neg eigenvalu can also be use 
to extract use information, like the presenc of a pos- 
sibl multipartit structur of the graph, a they give the 
most relev contribut to the modular minimum. 

the spectral optim of modular be quit fast.

u1). the number of requir iter to reach con- 
vergenc be o(n). each multipl seem to requir a 
time o(n2), a B be a complet matrix, but the peculiar 
form of B allow for a much quicker calculation, take 
time o(m + n). so, a graph bipartit requir a time 
o[n(m + n)], or o(n2) on a spars graph. To find the 
modular optimum one need a number of subsequ 
bipartit that equal the depth d of the result hier- 
archic tree. In the worst-cas scenario, d = o(n), but in 
practic case the procedur usual stop much befor 
reach the leaf of the dendrogram, so one could go 
for the averag valu 〈d〉 ∼ log n, for a total complex 
of o(n2 log n). the algorithm be faster than extrem op- 
timiz and it be also slightli more accurate, especi 
for larg graphs. the modular matrix and the corre- 
spond spectral optim can be trivial extend 
to weight graphs. 

A differ spectral approach have be previous pro- 
pose by white and smyth (white and smyth, 2005). 
let W indic the weight adjanc matrix of a 

graph G. A partit of G in k cluster can be describ 
through an n× k assign matrix X, where xic = 1 if 
vertex i belong to cluster c, otherwis xic = 0. It can 
be easili show that, up to a multipl constant, 
modular can be rewrit in term of the matrix X a 

Q ∝ tr[xt (W −d)x] = −tr[xtlqx], (31) 

where W be a diagon matrix with ident elements, 
equal to the sum of all edg weights, and the entri of 
D be dij = kikj , where ki be the degre of vertex i. the 
matrix LQ = D −W be call the q-laplacian. find 
the assign matrix X that maxim Q be an NP - 
complet problem, but one can get a good approxim 
by relax the constraint that the element of X have to 
be discrete. By do so Q becom a sort of continu 
function of X and one can determin the extrem of Q 
by set it first deriv (with respect to X) to zero. 
thi lead to the eigenvalu problem 

lqx = xλ. (32) 

here Λ be a diagon matrix. eq. 32 turn modular 
maxim into a spectral graph partit problem 
(section iv.d), use the q-laplacian matrix. A nice 
featur of the q-laplacian be that, for graph which be 
not too small, it can be approxim (up to constant 

factors) by the transit matrix w̃, obtain by nor- 
maliz W such that the sum of the element of each 
row equal one. eq. 32 be at the basi of the algorithm 
develop by white and smyth, which search for parti- 
tion with at most K clusters, where K be a predefin 
input paramet that may be suggest by preliminari 
inform on the graph cluster structure. the first 
k−1 eigenvector of the transit matrix W̃ (exclud 
the trivial eigenvector with all equal components) can be 
comput with a variant of the lanczo method (demmel 
et al., 2000). sinc the eigenvector compon be not 
integer, the eigenvector do not correspond directli to a 
partit of the graph in clusters. however, a usual in 
spectral graph partitioning, the compon of the eigen- 
vector can be use a coordin of the graph vertex 
in an euclidean space and k-mean cluster be appli 
to obtain the desir partition. white and smyth pro- 
pose two method to deriv the cluster after embed- 
ding the graph in space. both method have a worst- 
case complex o(k2n + km), which be essenti lin- 
ear in the number of vertex of the graph if the latter 
be spars and K � n. however, on larg and spars 
graphs, K could scale with the number of vertex n, 
so the procedur might becom quit slow. In order to 
speed up calcul without lose much accuraci in 
the final estim of the maximum modularity, ruan 
and zhang (ruan and zhang, 2007) have propos an al- 
gorithm, call kcut, that appli recurs the method 
by white and smyth, in a slightli modifi form: after 
a first applic to the full graph, in the next iter 
the method be appli to all cluster of the first partition, 
treat a independ networks, and so on. the proce- 
dure go on a long a the modular of the result

partit keep growing. the advantag of kcut be that 
one can play with low valu for the (maximal) number 
of cluster ` at each iteration; if partit be balanced, 
after a level of recursions, the number of cluster of the 
partit be approxim K = `a. therefor the com- 
plexiti of kcut be o[(n+m) logk] for a final partit in 
(at most) K clusters, which be much low than the com- 
plexiti of the algorithm by white and smyth. ruan and 
zhang test kcut on artifici graph gener with the 
plant `-partit model (section xv), and on real net- 
work includ zachary’ karat club (zachary, 1977), 
the american colleg footbal network (girvan and new- 
man, 2002) and two collabor network of jazz musi- 
cian (gleiser and danon, 2003) and physicist (newman, 
2001): the accuraci of kcut be compar to that of the 
algorithm by white and smyth, though gener lower. 

5. other optim strategi 

agarw and kemp have suggest to maxim mod- 
ular within the framework of mathemat program- 
ming (agarw and kempe, 2008). In fact, modular 
optim can be formul both a a linear and a 
a quadrat program. In the first case, the variabl be 
defin on the links: xij = 0 if i and j be in the same 
cluster, otherwis xij = 1. the modular of a partition, 
up to a multipl constant, can then be write a 

Q ∝ 
∑ 
ij 

bij(1− xij), (33) 

where B be the modular matrix defin by newman 
(see section vi.a.4). eq. 33 be linear in the variabl 
{x}, which must obey the constraint xij ≤ xik +xkj , be- 
cause, if i and j be in the same cluster, and so be i and 
k, then j and k must be in that cluster too. maximiz- 
ing the express in eq. 33 under the abov constraint 
be NP -hard, if the variabl have to be integ a re- 
quired. however, if one relax thi condit by use 
real-valu {x}, the problem can be solv in polyno- 
mial time (karloff, 1991). On the other hand, the solu- 
tion do not correspond to an actual partition, a the 
x variabl be fractional. To get cluster out of the {x} 
one need a round step. the valu of the x variabl 
be use a sort of distanc in a metric space (the trian- 
gular inequ be satisfi by construction): cluster of 
vertex “close” enough to each other (i. e. whose mutual 
x variabl be close to zero) be form and remov 
until each vertex be assign to a cluster. the result 
partit be further refin with the same post-process 
techniqu use by newman for the spectral optim 
of modularity, i. e. by a sequenc of step similar to 
those of the algorithm by kernighan and lin (see sec- 
tion vi.a.4). quadrat program can be use to 
get bisect of graph with high modularity, that can 
be iter to get a whole hierarchi of partit a in 
newman’ spectral optimization. one start from one of 

the ident in eq. 29 

Q = 
1 

4m 

∑ 
ij 

bij(1 + sisj), (34) 

where si = ±1, depend on whether the vertex belong 
to the first or the second cluster. sinc the optimiza- 
tion of the express in eq. 34 be NP -complete, one 
must relax again the constraint on the variabl s be- 
ing integer. A possibl be to transform each s into an 
n-dimension vector s and each product in the scalar 
product between vectors. the vector be normal so 
that their tip lie on the unit-spher of the n-dimension 
space. thi vector problem be polynomi solvable, but 
one need a method to associ a bipartit to the set 
of n vector of the solution. ani (n − 1)-dimension 
hyperplan center at the origin cut the space in two 
halves, separ the vector in two subsets. one can 
then choos multipl random hyperplan and pick the 
one which deliv the partit with high modular- 
ity. As in the linear program, a post-process tech- 
niqu á la newman (see section vi.a.4) be use to im- 
prove the result of the procedure. the two method 
propos by agarw and kemp be strongli limit by 
their high comput complexity, due mostli to the 
larg storag demands, make graph with more than 
104 vertex intractable. On the other hand, the idea of 
appli mathemat program to graph cluster 
be promising. the code of the algorithm can be down- 
load from http://www-scf.usc.edu/∼gaurava/. In 
a recent work (g. Xu et al., 2007), Xu et al. have opti- 
mize modular use mixed-integ mathemat pro- 
gramming, with both integ and continu variables, 
obtain veri good approxim of the modular 
optimum, at the price of high comput costs. chen 
et al. have use integ linear program to transform 
the initi graph into an optim target graph consist- 
ing of disjoint cliques, which effect yield a parti- 
tion (chen et al., 2008). berri et al. have formul 
the problem of graph cluster a a facil locat prob- 
lem (hillier and lieberman, 2004), consist in the min- 
imiz of a cost function base on a local variat of 
modular (berri et al., 2007). 

lehmann and hansen (lehmann and hansen, 2007) 
optim modular via mean field anneal (peterson 
and anderson, 1987), a determinist altern to sim- 
ulat anneal (kirkpatrick et al., 1983). the method 
us gibb probabl to comput the condit mean 
valu for the variabl of a vertex, which indic it 
commun membership. By make a mean field ap- 
proxim on the variabl of the other vertex in the 
gibb probabl one deriv a self-consist set of 
non-linear equations, that can be solv by iter in 
a time o[(m+ n)n]. the method yield good modular- 
iti maximum than the spectral optim by newman 
(section vi.a.4), at least on artifici graph with built- 
in commun structure, similar to the benchmark graph 
by girvan and newman (section xv.a). 



34 

genet algorithm (holland, 1992) have also be 
use to optim modularity. In a standard genet algo- 
rithm one have a set of candid solut to a problem, 
which be numer encod a chromosomes, and an 
object function to be optim on the space of solu- 
tions. the object function play the role of biolog 
fit for the chromosomes. one usual start from 
a random set of candid solutions, which be progres- 
sive chang through manipul inspir by bio- 
logic process regard real chromosomes, like point 
mutat (random variat of some part of the chro- 
mosome) and cross over (gener new chromosom 
by merg part of exist chromosomes). then, the fit- 
ness of the new pool of candid be comput and the 
chromosom with the high fit have the great 
chanc to surviv in the next generation. after sev- 
eral iter onli solut with larg fit survive. 
In a work by tasgin et al. (tasgin et al., 2007), parti- 
tion be the chromosom and modular be the fit 
function. with a suitabl choic of the algorithm param- 
eters, like the number of chromosom and the rate of 
mutat and cross over, tasgin et al. could obtain 
result of compar qualiti a greedi modular op- 
timiz on zachary’ karat club (zachary, 1977), the 
colleg footbal network (girvan and newman, 2002) and 
the benchmark by girvan and newman (section xv.a). 
genet algorithm be also adopt by liu et al. (liu 
et al., 2007). here the maximum modular partit be 
obtain via success bipartit of the graph, where 
each bipartit be determin by appli a genet algo- 
rithm to each subgraph (start from the origin graph 
itself), which be consid isol from the rest of the 
graph. A bipartit be accept onli if it increas the 
total modular of the graph. 

In section iii.c.2 we have see that the modular 
maximum be obtain for the partit that minim 
the differ between the cut size and the expect cut 
size of the partit (eq. 17). In the complet weight 
graph Gw such that the weight wij of an edg be 1 − 
kikj/2m, if i and j be connect in G, and −kikj/2m if 
they be not, the differ |cutp | − excutp be simpli 
the cut size of partit P. so, maxim modular 
for G be equival to the problem of find the partit 
with minim cut size of the weight graph gw, i. e. 
to a graph partit problem. the problem can then 
be effici solv by use exist softwar for graph 
partit (djidjev, 2007). 

B. modif of modular 

In the most recent literatur on graph cluster sev- 
eral modif and extens of modular can be 
found. they be usual motiv by specif class of 
cluster problem and/or graph that one may want to 
analyze. 

modular can be easili extend to graph with 
weight edg (newman, 2004). one need to replac 

the degre ki and kj in eq. 14 with the strength si 
and sj of vertex i and j. We remind that the strength 
of a vertex be the sum of the weight of edg adjac 
to the vertex (section a.1). for a proper normalization, 
the number of edg m in eq. 14 have to be replac by 
the sum W of the weight of all edges. the product 
sisj/2w be now the expect weight of the edg ij in 
the null model of modularity, which have to be compar 
with the actual weight wij of that edg in the origin 
graph. thi can be understood if we consid the case in 
which all weight be multipl of a unit weight, so they 
can be rewrit a integers. the weight of the connec- 
tion between two node can then be replac by a mani 
edg between the node a express by the number of 
weight units. for the result multigraph we can use 
the same procedur a in the case of unweight graphs, 
which lead to the formal ident express 

Qw = 
1 

2W 

∑ 
ij 

( 
wij − 

sisj 
2W 

) 
δ(ci, cj), (35) 

which can be also write a a sum over the modul 

Q = 

nc∑ 
c=1 

[wc 
W 
− 
( 
Sc 

2W 

)2 ] 
, (36) 

where Wc be the sum of the weight of the intern edg 
of modul c and Sc be the sum of the strength of the 
vertex of c. If edg weight be not mutual commen- 
surable, one can alway repres them a integ with 
good approximation, provid a suffici small weight 
unit be adopted, so the express for weight modu- 
lariti of eqs. 35, 36 be gener valid. In principle, 
weight can be assign to the edg of an undirect 
graph, by use ani measur of similarity/correl be- 
tween the vertex (like, e. g., the measur introduc 
in section iii.b.4). In thi way, one could deriv the 
correspond weight modular and use it to detect 
communities, with a potenti good exploit of the 
structur inform of the graph a compar to stan- 
dard modular (feng et al., 2007; ghosh and lerman, 
2008). 

modular have also a straightforward extens to the 
case of direct graph (arena et al., 2007; leicht and 
newman, 2008). If an edg be directed, the probabil- 
iti that it will be orient in either of the two possibl 
direct depend on the in- and out-degre of the end- 
vertices. for instance, take two vertex A and B, where 
A (b) have a high (low) indegre and low (high) outde- 
gree, in the null model of modular an edg will be 
much more like to point from B to A than from A to 
B. therefore, the express of modular for direct 
graph read 

Qd =

where the factor 2 in the denomin of the second sum- 
mand have be drop becaus the sum of the indegre

arena et al. (arena et al., 2007). the two situat illus-

In thi way, the optim of direct modular be not

the vertex of an undirect graph equal 2m; the factor 
2 in the denomin of the prefactor have be drop 
becaus the number of non-vanish element of the ad- 
jacenc matrix be m, not 2m a in the symmetr case 
of an undirect graph. If a graph be both direct and 
weighted, formula 35 and 37 can be combin a

δ(ci, cj), (38) 

which be the most gener (available) express of mod- 
ular (arena et al., 2007). kim et al. (kim et al., 
2009) have remark that the direct modular of 
eq. 37 may not properli account for the directed 
of the edg (fig. 14), and propos a differ defi- 
nition base on diffus on direct graphs, inspir 
by google’ pagerank algorithm (brin and page, 1998). 
rosval and bergstrom rais similar object (rosval 
and bergstrom, 2008). 

If vertex may belong to more clusters, it be not obviou 
how to find a proper gener of modularity. In fact, 
there be no uniqu recipe. shen et al. (shen et al., 2009), 
for instance, suggest the simpl definit 

Q =

ij

) 
δ(ci, cj). (39) 

here Oi be the number of commun includ vertex i. 
the contribut of each edg to modular be then the 

smaller, the larg the number of commun includ 
it endvertices. nicosia et al. (nicosia et al., 2009) have 
make some more gener consider on the problem of 
extend modular to the case of overlap commu- 
nities. they consid the case of direct unweight 
networks, start from the follow gener express 

qov = 
1 

m 

nc∑ 
c=1 

∑ 
i,j 

[ 
rijcaij − sijc 

kouti k 
in 
j 

m 

] 
, (40) 

where kini and k 
out 
j be the indegre and outdegre of ver- 

tice i and j, the index c label the commun and rijc, 
sijc express the contribut to the sum correspond 
to the edg ij in the network and in the null model, due 
to the multipl membership of i and j. If there be no 
overlap between the communities, rijc = sijc = δcicjc, 
where ci and cj correspond to the commun of i and 
j. In thi case, the edg ij contribut to the sum onli 
if ci = cj , a in the origin definit of modularity. for 
overlap communities, the coeffici rijc, sijc must 
depend on the membership coeffici αi,c, αj,c of ver- 
tice i and j. one can assum that rijc = f(αi,c, αj,c), 
where F be some function. the term sijc be relat to 
the null model of modularity, and it must be handl 
with care. In modularity’ origin null model edg be 
form by join two random stubs, so one need to 
defin the membership of a random stub in the variou 
communities. If we assum that there be no correl 
a priori between the membership coeffici of ani two 
vertices, we can assign to a stub origin from a vertex 
i in commun c the averag membership correspond 
to all edg which can be form with i. On a direct 
graph we have to distinguish between outgo and in- 
come stubs, so one have 

βouti→,c = 

∑ 
j f(αi,c, αj,c) 

n 
, (41) 

βini←,c = 

∑ 
j f(αj,c, αi,c) 

n 
, (42) 

and one can write the follow gener express for 
modular 

qov =

c=1 

∑ 
i,j 

[ 
rijcaij − 

βouti→,ck

] 
. (43) 

the question now concern the choic of the function 
f(αi,c, αj,c). If the formula of eq. 43 be to be an exten- 
sion of modular to the case of overlap communi- 
ties, it have to satisfi some gener properti of classi- 
cal modularity. for instance, the modular valu of a 
cover consist of the whole network a a singl cluster 
should be zero. It turn out that a larg class of func- 
tion yield an express for modular that fulfil thi 
requirement. otherwise, the choic of F be rather arbi- 
trari and good choic can be onli test a posteriori, 



36 

base on the result of the optimization. membership co- 
effici be also present in an extens of modular to 
overlap commun propos by shen et al. (shen 
et al., 2009). here the membership coeffici of vertex 
v in commun c be a sum over the edg of v belong 
to c, where each edg have a weight proport to the 
number of maxim cliqu of c contain the edge. 

gaertler et al. have introduc qualiti measur base 
on modularity’ principl of the comparison between a 
variabl rel to the origin graph and the correspond- 
ing variabl of a null model (gaertler et al., 2007). they 
remark that modular be just the differ between 
the coverag of a partit and the expect coverag 
of the partit in the null model. We remind that the 
coverag of a partit be the ratio between the number 
of edg within cluster and the total number of edg 
(section iii.c.2). base on thi observation, gaertler et 
al. suggest that the comparison between the two term 
can be do with other binari oper a well. for 
instance, one could consid the ratio 

s÷cov = 

∑nc 
c=1 lc/m∑nc 

c=1(dc/2m) 
2 
, (44) 

where the notat be the same a in eq. 15. thi can 
be do a well for ani variabl other than coverage. 
By use performance, for instance, (section iii.c.2) one 
obtain two new qualiti function s−perf and S 

÷ 
perf , cor- 

respond to take the differ or the ratio between 
perform and it null model expect value, respec- 
tively. gaertler et al. compar the result obtain with 
the four function s−cov = Q, S 

÷ 
cov, S 

− 
perf and S 

÷ 
perf , on 

a class of benchmark graph with built-in cluster struc- 
ture (section xv.a) and social networks. they found 
that the “absolute” variant s−cov and S 

− 
perf be good 

than the “relative” variant s÷cov and S 
÷ 
perf on the arti- 

ficial benchmarks, wherea s÷perf be good on social net- 

works12. furthermor s−perf be good than the standard 

modular s−cov. 
modif of modularity’ null model have be in- 

troduc by massen and doy (massen and doye, 2005) 
and muff et al. (muff et al., 2005). massen and doye’ 
null model be still a graph with the same expect degre 
sequenc a the original, and with edg rewir at ran- 
dom among the vertices, but one impos the addit 
constraint that there can be neither multipl edg be- 
tween a pair of vertex nor edg join a vertex with 
itself (loop or self-edges). thi null model be more realis- 
tic, a multipl edg and loop be usual absent in real 
graphs. the maxim of the correspond modifi 
modular yield partit with small averag cluster 
size than standard modularity. the latter tend to dis- 
favor small communities, becaus the actual densiti of 

12 the comparison be do by comput the valu of signific 
index like coverag and perform on the final partitions. 

edg insid small commun hardli exceed the null 
model densities, which be appreci enhanc by the 
contribut from multipl connect and loops. muff 
et al. propos a local version of modularity, in which the 
expect number of edg within a modul be not calcu- 
late with respect to the full graph, but consid just 
a portion of it, name the subgraph includ the mod- 
ule and it neighbour modules. their motiv be 
the fact that modularity’ null model implicitli assum 
that each vertex could be attach to ani other, wherea 
in real case a cluster be usual connect to few other 
clusters. On a direct graph, their local modular 
LQ read 

LQ =

In eq. 45 lc be the number of edg insid cluster c, d

and lcn the total number of edg in the subgraph com- 
prise cluster c and it neighbor clusters. the local- 
ize modular be not bound by 1, but can take ani 
value. it maxim deliv more accur partit

reichardt and bornholdt have show that it be possibl 
to reformul the problem of commun detect a 
the problem of find the ground state of a spin glass 
model (reichardt and bornholdt, 2006a). each vertex i 
be label by a pott spin variabl σi, which indic the 
cluster includ the vertex. the basic principl of the 
model be that edg should connect vertex of the same 
class (i. e. same spin state), wherea vertex of differ 
class (i. e. differ spin states) should be disconnect 
(ideally). so, one have to energet favor edg between 
vertex in the same class, a well a non-edg between 
vertex in differ classes, and penal edg between 
vertex of differ classes, along with non-edg between 
vertex in the same class. the result hamiltonian of 
the spin model be

purposes, so in the follow we set J = 1. the rang of 
the spin-spin interact be infinite, a there be a non-zero 
coupl between ani pair of spins. eq. 46 bear a strong 
resembl with the express of modular of eq. 14. 
In fact, if γ = 1 and pij = kikj/2m we recov exactli 
modularity, up to a factor −1/m. In thi case, find the 
spin configur for which the hamiltonian be minim 
be equival to maxim modularity. eq. 46 be much 
more gener than modularity, though, a both the null 
model and the paramet γ can be arbitrarili chosen. In 
particular, the valu of γ determin the import of 
the null model term pij in the qualiti function. eq. 46

here, the sum run over the clusters: l and lr indi- 
cate the number of edg within cluster s and between 
cluster r and s, respectively; (ls)pij and (lrs)pij be the 
correspond null model expect values. eq. 47 de- 
fine the coeffici cs of cohes and ar of adhesion. 
If a subset of a cluster s have a larg coeffici of adhe- 
sion with anoth cluster r than with it complement in 
s, the energi can be reduc by merg the subset with 
cluster r. In the particular case in which the coeffici 
of adhes of a subset G′ of a cluster s with it com- 
plement in the cluster exactli match the coeffici of 
adhes of G′ with anoth cluster r, the partit in 
which G′ stay within s or be merg with r have the same 
energy. In thi case one can say that cluster r and s be 
overlapping. In general, the partit with minimum en- 
ergi have the follow properties: 1) everi subset of each 
cluster have a coeffici of adhes with it complement 
in the cluster not small than with ani other cluster; 
2) everi cluster have non-neg coeffici of cohesion; 
3) the coeffici of adhes between ani two cluster be 
non-positive. 

By tune the paramet γ one can vari the number 
of cluster in the partit with minimum energy, go 
from a singl cluster compris all vertex (γ = 0), to n 
cluster with a singl vertex (γ →∞). so, γ be a resolu- 
tion paramet that allow to explor the cluster struc- 
ture of a graph at differ scale (see section vi.c). the 
author use singl spin heatbath simul anneal al- 
gorithm to find the ground state of the hamiltonian of 
eq. 46. 

anoth gener of modular be recent sug- 
gest by arena et al. (arena et al., 2008a). they re- 
mark that the fundament unit to defin modular be 
the edge, but that high edg densiti insid cluster usu- 
alli impli the exist of long-rang topolog correla- 
tion between vertices, which be reveal by the presenc 
of motif (milo et al., 2002), i. e. connect undirect 
subgraphs, like cycl (section a.1). for instance, a high 
edg densiti insid a cluster usual mean that there 
be also sever triangl in the cluster, and compara- 

tive few between clusters, a criterion that have inspir 
on it own popular graph cluster algorithm (palla 
et al., 2005; radicchi et al., 2004). modular can then 
be simpli gener by compar the densiti of motif 
insid cluster with the expect densiti in modularity’ 
null model (motif modularity). As a particular case, the 
triangl modular of a partit C read 

q4(c) = 

∑ 
ijk 

aij(c)ajk(c)aki(c)∑ 
ijk 

aijajkaki 
− 

∑ 
ijk 

nij(c)njk(c)nki(c)∑ 
ijk 

nijnjknki 

(48) 
where aij(c) = aijδ(ci, cj) (ci be the label of the clus- 
ter i belong to), nij = kikj (ki be the degre of vertex 
i) and nij(c) = nijδ(ci, cj). If one choos a motif 
path with even length, and remov the constraint that 
all vertex of the motif/path should stay insid the same 
cluster, maxim motif modular could reveal the ex- 
istenc of multipartit structure. for example, if a graph 
be bipartite, one expect to see mani 2-path start 
from one vertex class and return to it from the other 
class. motif modular can be trivial extend to the 
case of weight graphs. 

sever graph repres real system be built out 
of correl data between elements. correl ma- 
trice be veri common in the studi of complex sys- 
tems: well-known exampl be the correl of price 
returns, which be intens studi by economist and 
econophysicist (mantegna and stanley, 2000). corre- 
lation may be posit a well a negative, so the cor- 
respond weight edg indic both attract and 
repuls between pair of vertices. usual the correla- 
tion valu be filter or otherwis transform such to 
elimin the weak correl and anticorrel 
and to maintain strictli posit weight for the edges, 
yield graph that can be treat with standard tech- 
niques. however, ignor neg correl mean to 
give up use inform on the relationship between 
vertices. find cluster in a graph with both posit 
and neg weight be call correl cluster prob- 
lem (bansal et al., 2004). accord to intuition, one 
expect that vertex of the same cluster be link by 
posit edges, wherea vertex of differ cluster be 
link by neg edges. the best cluster structur be 
the partit that maxim the sum of the strength 
(in absolut value) of posit edg within cluster and 
neg edg between clusters, or, equivalently, the par- 
tition that minim the sum of the strength (in abso- 
lute value) of posit edg between cluster and neg- 
ativ edg within clusters. thi can be formul by 
mean of modularity, if one account for the contribu- 
tion of the neg edges. A natur way to proceed be 
to creat two copi of the graph at study: in one copi 
onli the weight of the posit edg be kept, in the 
other onli the weight of the neg edg (in abso- 
lute value). By appli eq. 35 to the same partit 
of both graphs, one deriv the contribut Q+ and 



38 

Q− to the modular of that partit for the origin 
graph. gómez et al. defin the global modular a 
a linear combin of Q+ and q−, that account for 
the rel total strength of posit and neg edg 
weight (gómez et al., 2009). kaplan and forrest (ka- 
plan and forrest, 2008) have propos a similar expres- 
sion, with two import differences. first, they have 
use the total strength of the graph, i. e. the sum of 
the absolut valu of all weights, to normal Q+ and 
q−; gómez et al. instead have use the posit and the 
neg strengths, for Q+ and q−, respectively, which 
seem to be the more natur choic look at eq. 35. 
second, kaplan and forrest have give equal weight to 
the contribut of Q+ and Q− to their final express 
of modularity, which be just the differ Q+ − q−. In 
anoth work, traag and bruggeman (traag and brugge- 
man, 2009) have introduc neg link in the gener 
spin glass formul of modular of reichardt and 
bornholdt (reichardt and bornholdt, 2006a). here the 
rel import of the contribut of posit and 
neg edg weight be a free parameter, the tune of 
which allow to detect commun of variou size and 
densiti of positive/neg edges. 

some author have point out that the origin ex- 
pression of modular be not ideal to detect communi- 
tie in bipartit graphs, which describ sever real sys- 
tems, like food web (william and martinez, 2000), sci- 
entif (newman, 2001) and artist (gleiser and danon, 
2003) collabor networks, etc.. express of mod- 
ular for bipartit graph be suggest by guimerà 
et al. (guimerà et al., 2007) and barber (barber, 2007; 
barber et al., 2008). guimerà et al. call the two class 
of vertex actor and teams, and indic with ti the de- 
gree of actor i and ma the degre of team a. the null 
model graph be random graph with the same expect 
degre for the vertices, a usual. the bipartit modu- 
lariti mb(p) for a partit P (of the actors) have the 
follow express 

mb(p) =

c=1

ama(ma − 1) 
− 
∑

] 
. (49) 

here, cij be the number of team in which actor i and 
j be togeth and the sum 

∑ 
ama(ma − 1) give the 

number of order pair of actor in the same team. the 
second ratio of each summand be the null model term, 
indic the expect (normalized) number of team 
for pair of actor in cluster c. the bipartit modular 
can also be appli to (unipartite) direct graphs: each 
vertex can be duplic and assign to both classes, 
base on it twofold role of sourc and target for the 
edges. 

anoth interest altern be introduc by bar- 
ber (barber, 2007; barber et al., 2008) and be a simpl 
extens of eq. 14. let u suppos that the two vertex 
class (red and blue) be make out of p and q vertices, re- 
spectively. the degre of a red vertex i be indic with 
ki, that of a blue vertex j with dj . the adjac ma- 
trix A of the graph be in block off-diagon form, a there 

be edg onli between red and blue vertices. becaus 
of that, barber assum that the null model matrix P, 
whose element pij indic a usual the expect num- 
ber of edg between vertex i and j in the null model, 
also have the block off-diagon form 

P = 

[ 
op×p p̃p×q 
p̃tq×p oq×q 

] 
, (50) 

where the O be squar matrix with all zero element 
and p̃ij = kidj/m, a in the null model of standard mod- 
ular (though other choic be possible). the modular- 
iti maximum can be comput through the modular 
matrix B = A − P, a we have see in section vi.a.4. 
however, spectral optim of modular give excel- 
lent result for bipartitions, while it perform wors- 
en when the number of cluster be unknown, a it be 
usual the case. barber have propos a differ opti- 
mizat technique, call bipartit recurs induc 
modul (brim), base on the bipartit natur of the 
graph. the algorithm be base on the special express 
of modular for the bipartit case, for which onc the 
partit of the red or the blue vertex be known, it be 
easi to get the partit of the other vertex class that 
yield the maximum modularity. therefore, one start 
from an arbitrari partit in c cluster of, say, the blue 
vertices, and recov the partit of the red vertices, 
which be in turn use a input to get a good partit of 
the blue vertices, and so on until modular converges. 
brim do not predict the number of cluster c of the 
graph, but one can obtain good estim for it by ex- 
plore differ valu with a simpl bisect approach. 
typically, for a give c the algorithm need a few step 
to converge, each step have a complex o(m). An 
express of the number of converg step in term 
of n and/or m still need to be derived. 

C. limit of modular 

In thi section we shall discu some featur of mod- 
ularity, which be crucial to identifi the domain of it 
applic and ultim to ass the issu of the re- 
liabil of the measur for the problem of graph cluster- 
ing. 

An import question concern the valu of the max- 
imum modular qmax for a graph. We know that it 
must be non-negative, a there be alway at least a par- 
tition with zero modularity, consist in a singl clus- 
ter with all vertex (section iii.c.2). however, a larg 
valu for the modular maximum do not necessarili 
mean that a graph have commun structure. random 
graph be suppos to have no commun structure, 
a the link probabl between vertex be either con- 
stant or a function of the vertex degrees, so there be no 
bia a priori toward special group of vertices. still, ran- 
dom graph may have partit with larg modular 
valu (guimerà et al., 2004; reichardt and bornholdt, 
2006a). thi be due to fluctuat in the distribut of 



39 

edg in the graph, which in mani graph realiz be 
not homogen even if the link probabl be con- 
stant, like in erdös-rényi graphs. the fluctuat de- 
termin concentr of link in some subset of the 
graph, which then appear like communities. accord 
to the definit of modularity, a graph have commun 
structur with respect to a random graph with equal size 
and expect degre sequence. therefore, the modular- 
iti maximum of a graph reveal a signific commun 
structur onli if it be appreci larg than the modu- 
lariti maximum of random graph of the same size and 
expect degre sequence. the signific of the mod- 
ular maximum qmax for a graph can be estim by 
calcul the maximum modular for mani realiza- 
tion of the null model, obtain from the origin graph 
by randomli rewir it edges. one then comput the 
averag 〈q〉nm and the standard deviat σnmq of the 
results. the statist signific of qmax be indic 
by the distanc of qmax from the null model averag 
〈q〉nm in unit of the standard deviat σnmq , i. e. by 
the z-score 

z = 
qmax − 〈q〉nm 

σnmq 
. (51) 

If z � 1, qmax indic strong commun structure. 
cutoff valu of 2 − 3 for the z-score be customary. 
thi approach have problems, though. It can gener 
both fals posit and fals negatives: a few graph that 
most peopl would consid without a signific commu- 
niti structur have a larg z-score; on the other hand, 
some graph that be agre to display cluster structur 
have veri low valu for the z-score. besides, the dis- 
tribut of the maximum modular valu of the null 
model, though peaked, be not gaussian. therefore, one 
cannot attribut to the valu of the z-score the signifi- 
canc correspond to a gaussian distribution, and one 
would need instead to comput the statist signific 
for the right distribution. 

reichardt and bornholdt have studi the issu of the 
modular valu for random graph in some depth (re- 
ichardt and bornholdt, 2006b, 2007), use their gener 
spin glass formul of the cluster problem (sec- 
tion vi.b). they consid the gener case of a ran- 
dom graph with arbitrari degre distribut P (k) and 
without degree-degre correlations. they set γ = 1, so 
that the energi of the ground state coincid with mod- 
ular (up to a constant factor). for modularity’ null 
model graphs, the modular maximum correspond to 
an equipartit of the graph, i. e. the magnet of 
the ground state of the spin glass be zero, a result con- 
firm by numer simul (reichardt and born- 
holdt, 2006b, 2007). thi be becaus the distribut of 
the coupl have zero mean, and the mean be onli cou- 
plead to magnet (fu and anderson, 1986). for a 
partit of ani graph with n vertex and m edg in q 
cluster with equal number of vertices, there be a simpl 
linear relat between the cut size Cq of the partit 
and it modular qq: Cq = m[(q − 1)/q − qq]. We 

remind that the cut size Cq be the total number of inter- 
cluster edg of the partit (section iv.a). In thi way, 
the partit with maximum modular be also the one 
with minimum cut size, and commun detect be- 
come equival to graph partitioning. reichardt and 
bornholdt deriv analyt the ground state energi 
for ise spin (q = 2), which correspond to the fol- 
low express of the expect maximum modular 
qmax2 for a bipartit (reichardt and bornholdt, 2007) 

qmax2 = u0j 
〈k1/2〉 
〈k〉 

. (52) 

here 〈kα〉 = 
∫ 
P (k)kαdk and U0 be the ground state en- 

ergi of the sherrington-kirkpatrick model (sherrington 
and kirkpatrick, 1975). the most interest featur of 
eq. 52 be the simpl scale with 〈k1/2〉/〈k〉. numer 
calcul show that thi scale hold for both erdös- 
rényi and scale-fre graph (section a.3). interestingly, 
the result be valid for partit in q clusters, where q be 
left free, not onli for q = 2. the number of cluster of the 
partit with maximum modular decreas if the av- 
erag degre 〈k〉 increases, and tend to 5 for larg valu 
of 〈k〉, regardless of the degre distribut and the size 
of the graph. from eq. 52 we also see that the expect 
maximum modular for a random graph increas when 
〈k〉 decreases, i. e. if the graph get sparser. So it be par- 
ticularli hard to detect commun in spars graph by 
use modular optimization. As we shall see in sec- 
tion xiv, the sparsiti of a graph be gener a seriou 
obstacl for graph cluster methods, no matter if one 
us modular or not. 

A more fundament issue, rais by fortunato and 
barthélemi (fortunato and barthélemy, 2007), concern 
the capabl of modular to detect “good” partitions. 
If a graph have a clear cluster structure, one expect that 
the maximum modular of the graph reveal it. the 
null model of modular assum that ani vertex i “sees” 
ani other vertex j, and the expect number of edg 
between them be pij = kikj/2m. similarly, the expect 
number of edg between two cluster A and B with total 
degre KA and kb, respectively, be pab = kakb/2m. 
the variat of modular determin by the merger of 
A and B with respect to the partit in which they be 
separ cluster be ∆qab = lab/m−kakb/2m2, with 
lab number of edg connect A to B. If lab = 1, i. e. 
there be a singl edg join A to B, we expect that the 
two subgraph will often be kept separated. instead, if 
kakb/2m < 1, ∆qab > 0. let u suppos for simplic- 
iti that KA ∼ KB = K, i. e. that the two subgraph 
be of about the same size, measur in term of edges. 
We conclud that, if K <∼ 

√ 
2m and the two subgraph 

A and B be connected, modular be great if they be 
in the same cluster (fortunato and barthélemy, 2007). 
the reason be intuitive: if there be more edg than 
expect between A and B, there be a strong topologi- 
cal correl between the subgraphs. If the subgraph 
be suffici small (in degree), the expect number 
of edg for the null model can be small than one, so

fig. 15 resolut limit of modular optimization. the 
natur commun structur of the graph, repres by the 
individu cliqu (circles), be not recogn by optim 
modularity, if the cliqu be small than a scale depend 
on the size of the graph. In thi case, the maximum modu- 
lariti correspond to a partit whose cluster includ two 
or more cliqu (like the group indic by the dash con- 
tours). reprint figur with permiss from ref. (fortunato 
and barthélemy, 2007). c©2007 from the nation academi 
of scienc of the usa. 

even the weak possibl connect (a singl edge) suf- 
fice to keep the subgraph together. interestingly, thi 
result hold independ of the structur of the sub- 
graphs. In particular it remain true if the subgraph be 
cliques, which be the subgraph with the larg possi- 
ble densiti of intern edges, and repres the strong 
possibl communities. In fig. 15 a graph be make out of 
nc ident cliques, with l vertex each, connect by 
singl edges. It be intuit to think that the cluster of 
the best partit be the individu cliques: instead, if 
nc be larg than about l 

2, modular would be high 
for partit in which the cluster be group of cliqu 
(like the cliqu pair indic by the dash line in the 
figure). 

the conclus be striking: modular optim 
have a resolut limit that may prevent it from detect 
cluster which be compar small with respect to 
the graph a a whole, even when they be well defin 
commun like cliques. so, if the partit with maxi- 
mum modular includ cluster with total degre of the 
order of 

√ 
m or smaller, one cannot know a priori whether 

the cluster be singl commun or combin of 
small weakli interconnect communities. thi resolu- 
tion problem have a larg impact in practic applications. 

real graph with commun structur usual contain 
commun which be veri divers in size (clauset et al., 
2004; danon et al., 2005; guimerà et al., 2003; palla 
et al., 2005), so mani (small) commun may remain 
undetected. besides, modular be extrem sensit to 
even individu connections. mani real graphs, in biol- 
ogi and in the social sciences, be reconstruct through 
experi and surveys, so edg may occasion be 
fals positives: if two small subgraph happen to be con- 
nect by a few fals edges, modular will put them in 
the same cluster, infer a relationship between entiti 
that in realiti may have noth to do with each other. 

the resolut limit come from the veri definit of 
modularity, in particular from it null model. the weak 
point of the null model be the implicit assumpt that 
each vertex can interact with everi other vertex, which 
impli that each part of the graph know about every- 
thing else. thi be howev questionable, and certainli 
wrong for larg system like, e.g., the web graph. It 
be certainli more reason to assum that each vertex 
have a limit horizon within the graph, and interact just 
with a portion of it. however, nobodi know yet how to 
defin such local territori for the graph vertices. the 
null model of the local modular of muff et al. (sec- 
tion vi.b) be a possibility, sinc it limit the horizon of 
a vertex to a local neighborhood, compris the cluster 
of the vertex and the cluster link to it by at least one 
edg (neighbor clusters). however, there be mani 
other possibl choices. In thi respect, the null model 
of girvan and newman, though unrealistic, be the sim- 
plest one can think of, which partli explain it success. 
qualiti function that, like modularity, be base on a 
null model such that the horizon of vertex be of the or- 
der of the size of the whole graph, be like to be affect 
by a resolut limit (fortunato, 2007). the problem be 
more general, though. for instance, Li et al. (li et al., 
2008b) have introduc a qualiti function, call modu- 
lariti density, which consist in the sum over the cluster 
of the ratio between the differ of the intern and 
extern degre of the cluster and the cluster size. the 
modular densiti do not requir a null model, and de- 
liver good result than modular optim (e. g. 
it correctli recov the natur partit of the graph in 
fig. 15 for ani number/s of the cliques). however, it 
be still affect by a resolut limit. To avoid that, Li et 
al. propos a more gener definit of their measure, 
includ a tunabl paramet that allow to explor the 
graph at differ resolutions, in the spirit of the method 
of section xii. 

A way to go around the resolut limit problem could 
be to perform further subdivis of the cluster ob- 
tain from modular optimization, in order to elim- 
inat possibl artifici merger of communities. for 
instance, one could recurs optim modular for 
each singl cluster, take the cluster a a separ en- 
titi (fortunato and barthélemy, 2007; ruan and zhang, 
2008). however, thi be not a reliabl procedure, for two 
reasons: 1) the local modular use to find partit 



41 

within the cluster have differ null models, a they de- 
pend on the cluster sizes, so they be inconsist with 
each other; 2) one need to defin a criterion to decid 
when one have to stop partit a cluster, but there be 
no obviou prescription, so ani choic be necessarili base 
on arbitrari assumptions13. 

resolut limit aris a well in the more gener for- 
mulat of commun detect by reichardt and born- 
holt (kumpula et al., 2007b). here the limit scale for the 
undetect cluster be 

√ 
γm. We remind that γ weigh 

the contribut of the null model term in the qualiti 
function. for γ = 1 one recov the resolut limit of 
modularity. By tune the paramet γ it be possibl to 
arbitrarili vari the resolut scale of the correspond 
qualiti function. thi in principl solv the problem of 
the resolut limit, a one could adjust the resolut of 
the method to the actual scale of the commun to de- 
tect. the problem be that usual one have no inform 
about the commun sizes, so it be not possibl to decid 
a priori the proper value(s) of γ for a specif graph. In 
the most recent literatur on graph cluster quit a few 
multiresolut method have be introduced, address- 
ing thi problem in sever ways. We will discu them 
in some detail in section xii. 

the resolut limit can be easili extend to the case 
of weight graphs. In a recent paper (berri et al., 
2009), berri et al. have consid the special case in 
which intraclust edg have weight 1, wherea inter- 
cluster edg have weight �. By repeat the same pro- 
cedur a in ref. (fortunato and barthélemy, 2007), they 
conclud that cluster with intern strength (i. e. sum 
of all weight of intern edges) w may remain unde- 

tect if w < 
√ 
w�/2− �, where W be the total strength 

of the graph. so, the resolut limit decreas when 
� decreases. berri et al. use thi result to show that, 
by properli weight the edg of a give unweight 
graph, it becom possibl to detect cluster with veri 
high resolut by still use modular optimization. 

veri recently, good et al. (good et al., 2009) have 
make a care analysi of modular and it perfor- 
mance. they discov that the modular landscap 
be character by an exponenti number of distinct 
states/partitions, whose modular valu be veri close 
to the global maximum (fig. 16). thi problem be partic- 
ularli dramat if a graph have a hierarch commun 
structure, like most real networks. such enorm num- 

13 ruan and zhang (ruan and zhang, 2008) propos a stop 
criterion base on the statist signific of the maximum 
modular valu of the subgraph. the maximum modular 
of a subgraph be compar with the expect maximum modu- 
lariti for a random graph with the same size and expect de- 
gree sequenc of the subgraph. If the correspond z-score be 
suffici high, the subgraph be suppos to have commun 
structur and one accept the partit in small pieces. the 
procedur stop when none of the subgraph of the run parti- 
tion have signific commun structure, base on modularity. 

fig. 16 low-dimension visual of the modular 
landscap for the metabol network of the spirochet tre- 
ponema pallidum. the big degeneraci of suboptim high- 
modular partit be reveal by the plateau (whose shape 
be detail in the inset), which be larg and veri irregular. 
modular valu in the plateau be veri close to the absolut 
maximum, although they may correspond to quit differ 
partitions. reprint figur with permiss from ref. (good 
et al., 2009). 

ber of solut explain whi mani heurist be abl to 
come veri close to modularity’ global maximum, but it 
also impli that the global maximum be basic impos- 
sibl to find. In addition, high-modular partit be 
not necessarili similar to each other, despit the proxim- 
iti of their modular scores. the optim partit from 
a topolog point of view, which usual do not corre- 
spond to the modular maximum due to the resolut 
limit, may howev have a larg modular score. there- 
fore the optim partit be basic indistinguish 
from a huge number of high-modular partitions, which 
be in gener structur dissimilar from it. the larg 
structur inhomogen of the high-modular parti- 
tion impli that one cannot reli on ani of them, at 
least in principle, in the absenc of addit informa- 
tion on the particular system at hand and it structure. 

vii. spectral algorithm 

In section iv.a and iv.d we have learn that spec- 
tral properti of graph matrix be frequent use 
to find partitions. A paradigmat exampl be spectral 
graph clustering, which make use of the eigenvector of 
laplacian matrix (section iv.d). We have also see 
that newman-girvan modular can be optim by 
use the eigenvector of the modular matrix (sec- 
tion vi.a.4). most spectral method have be intro- 
duce and develop in comput scienc and gener 
focu on data clustering, although applic to graph 



42 

be often possibl a well. In thi section we shall review 
recent spectral techniqu propos mostli by physicist 
explicitli for graph clustering. 

earli work have show that the eigenvector of the 
transfer matrix T (section a.2) can be use to extract 
use inform on commun structure. the trans- 
fer matrix act a a time propag for the process of 
random walk on a graph. given the eigenvector cα of 
the transpos transfer matrix t†, correspond to the 
eigenvalu λα, c 

α 
i be the outgo current flow from 

vertex i, correspond to the eigenmod α. the partic- 
ipat ratio (pr) 

χα =

(53) 

indic the effect number of vertex contribut to 
eigenvector cα. If χα receiv contribut onli from 
vertex of the same cluster, i. e. eigenvector cα be “lo- 
calized”, the valu of χα indic the size of that clus- 
ter (eriksen et al., 2003; simonsen et al., 2004). the sig- 
nific of the cluster can be assess by compar χα 
with the correspond particip ratio for a random 
graph with the same expect degre sequenc a the 
origin graph. eigenvector of the adjac matrix may 
be local a well if the graph have a clear commun 
structur (slanina and zhang, 2005). A recent compre- 
hensiv analysi of spectral properti of modular graph 
have be carri out by mitrović and tadić (mitrović and 
tadić, 2009). 

donetti and muñoz have devis an eleg method 
base on the eigenvector of the laplacian ma- 
trix (donetti and muñoz, 2004). the idea be the same 
a in spectral graph cluster (section iv.d): sinc the 
valu of the eigenvector compon be close for vertex 
in the same community, one can use them a coordinates, 
such that vertex turn into point in a metric space. so, 
if one us M eigenvectors, one can emb the vertex in 
an M -dimension space. commun appear a group 
of point well separ from each other, a illustr in 
fig. 17. the separ be the more visible, the larg the 
number of dimensions/eigenvector M . the origin of 
the method consist in the procedur to group the point 
and to extract the partition. donetti and muñoz use 
hierarch cluster (see section iv.b), with the con- 
straint that onli pair of cluster which have at least one 
interconnect edg in the origin graph be merged. 
among all partit of the result dendrogram, the 
one with larg modular be chosen. for the similar- 
iti measur between vertices, donetti and muñoz use 
both the euclidean distanc and the angl distance. the 
angl distanc between two point be the angl between 
the vector go from the origin of the M -dimension 
space to either point. test on the benchmark by girvan 
and newman (section xv.a) show that the best result 
be obtain with complete-linkag clustering. the most 
comput expens part of the algorithm be the 
calcul of the laplacian eigenvectors. sinc a few

eigenvector suffic to get good partitions, one can de- 
termin them with the lanczo method (lanczos, 1950). 
the number M of eigenvector that be need to have a 
clean separ of the cluster be not know a priori, but 
one can comput a number M0 > 1 of them and search 
for the high modular partit among those deliv- 
ere by the method for all 1 ≤ M ≤ m0. In a relat 
work, simonsen have emb graph vertex in space by 
use a coordin the compon of the eigenvector 
of the right stochast matrix (simonsen, 2005). 

eigenvalu and eigenvector of the laplacian matrix 
have be use by alv to comput the effect con- 
ductanc for pair of vertex in a graph, assum that 
the latter be an electr network with edg of unit re- 
sistanc (alves, 2007). the conduct enabl one to 
comput the transit probabl for a random walker 
move on the graph, and from the transit proba- 
biliti one build a similar matrix between vertex 
pairs. hierarch cluster be appli to join vertex 
in groups. the method can be trivial extend to the 
case of weight graphs. the algorithm by alv be rather 
slow, a one need to comput the whole spectrum of the 
laplacian, which requir a time o(n3). moreover, there 
be no criterion to select which partition(s) of the dendro- 
gram be (are) the best. 

capocci et al. (capocci et al., 2005) use eigenvec- 
tor compon of the right stochast matrix R (sec- 
tion a.2), that be deriv from the adjac matrix by 
divid each row by the sum of it elements. the right 
stochast matrix have similar properti a the laplacian.

eigenvalu be equal to 1, with eigenvector character- 
ize by have equal-valu compon for vertex be- 
long to the same component. In thi way, by list 
the vertex accord to the connect compon they 
belong to, the compon of ani eigenvector of R, cor- 
respond to eigenvalu 1, display a step-wis profile, 
with plateau indic vertex in the same connect 
component. for connect graph with cluster structure, 
one can still see plateaus, if commun be onli loos 
connect to each other (fig. 18). here the communi- 
tie can be immedi deduct by an inspect of 
the compon of ani eigenvector with eigenvalu 1. In 
practic cases, plateau be not clearli visible, and one 
eigenvector be not enough. however, one expect that 
there should be a strong correl between eigenvector 
compon correspond to vertex in the same clus- 
ter. capocci et al. deriv a similar matrix, where the 
similar between vertex i and j be the pearson correla- 
tion coeffici between their correspond eigenvector 

components, averag over a small set of eigenvectors. 
the eigenvector can be calcul by perform a con- 
strain optim of a suitabl cost function. the 
method can be extend to weight and direct graphs. 
It be use to estim vertex similarities, howev it do 
not provid a well-defin partit of the graph. 

yang and liu (yang and liu, 2008) adopt a recurs 
bisect procedure. commun be subgraph such 
that the extern degre of each vertex do not exceed 
the intern degre (strong commun or ls-sets, see 
section iii.b.2). In the first step of the algorithm, the 
adjac matrix of the graph be put in approxim 
block-diagon form. thi be do by comput a new 
central measur for the vertices, call cluster cen- 
trality. thi measur be similar to bonacich’ eigenvector 
central (bonacich, 1972, 1987), which be give by the 
eigenvector of the adjac matrix correspond to the 
larg eigenvalue. the cluster central of a vertex 
basic measur the probabl that a random walker 
start at that vertex hit a give target. such proba- 
biliti be larg if the origin and the target vertex belong 
to the same cluster than if they do not. If the graph have 
well-separ communities, the valu of the cluster 
central would be similar for vertex in the same clus- 
ter. In thi way, one can rearrang the origin adjac 
matrix by list the vertex in non-decreas order of 
their cluster centralities, and block would be visi- 
ble. the block be then identifi by iter bisection: 
each cluster found at some step be split in two a long a 
the result part be still commun in the strong 
sense, otherwis the procedur stops. the worst-cas 
complex of the method be o[kt(n log n + m)], where 
K be the number of cluster of the final partit and t 
the (average) number of iter requir to comput 
the cluster central with the power method (golub 
and loan, 1989). sinc t be fairli independ of the 
graph size, the method scale quit well on spars graph 
[o(n log n)]. the main limit of thi techniqu be the 
assumpt that commun be defin in the strong 
sense, which be too restrictive. On the other hand, one 
could think of use altern definitions. 

viii. dynam algorithm 

thi section describ method employ process 
run on the graph, focu on spin-spin interactions, 
random walk and synchronization. 

A. spin model 

the pott model be among the most popular model in 
statist mechan (wu, 1982). It describ a system 
of spin that can be in q differ states. the interact 
be ferromagnetic, i. e. it favour spin alignment, so at 
zero temperatur all spin be in the same state. If an- 
tiferromagnet interact be also present, the ground 



44 

state of the system may not be the one where all spin 
be aligned, but a state where differ spin valu co- 
exist, in homogen clusters. If pott spin variabl 
be assign to the vertex of a graph with commun 
structure, and the interact be between neighbour- 
ing spins, it be like that the structur cluster could 
be recov from like-valu spin cluster of the sys- 
tem, a there be mani more interact insid com- 
muniti than outside. base on thi idea, inspir by 
an earli paper by blatt et al. (blatt et al., 1996), re- 
ichardt and bornholdt propos a method to detect com- 
muniti that map the graph onto a zero-temperatur 
q-pott model with nearest-neighbour interact (re- 
ichardt and bornholdt, 2004). the hamiltonian of the 
model, i. e. it energy, read 

H = −J 
∑ 
i,j 

aijδ(σi, σj) + γ 

q∑ 
s=1 

ns(n − 1) 
2 

, (54) 

where aij be the element of the adjac matrix, δ be 
kronecker’ function, n the number of spin in state s, 
J and γ be coupl parameters. the energi H be the 
sum of two compet terms: the first be the classic 
ferromagnet pott model energy, and favor spin align- 
ment; the second term instead peak when the spin be 
homogen distributed. the ratio γ/j express the 
rel import of the two terms: by tune γ/j one 
can explor differ level of modular of the system, 
from the whole graph see a a singl cluster to cluster 
consist of individu vertices. If γ/j be set to the valu 
δ(g) of the averag densiti of edg of the graph G, the 
energi of the system be small if spin align within sub- 
graph such that their intern edg densiti exce δ(g), 
wherea the extern edg densiti be small than δ(g), 
i. e. if the subgraph be cluster (section iii.b.1). the 
minim of H be carri out via simul anneal 
((kirkpatrick et al., 1983) and section vi.a.2), start 
from a configur where spin be randomli assign 
to the vertex and the number of state q be veri high. 
the procedur be quit fast and the result do not de- 
pend on q (provid q be suffici high). the method 
also allow to identifi vertex share between communi- 
ties, from the comparison of partit correspond to 
global and local energi minima. the hamiltonian H can 
be rewrit a 

H = 
∑ 
i<j 

δ(σi, σj)(γ −aij), (55) 

which be the energi of an infinite-rang pott spin glass, 
a all pair of spin be interact (neighbor or not) 
and there may be both posit and neg couplings. 
the method can be simpli extend to the analysi of 
weight graphs, by introduc spin coupl propor- 
tional to the edg weights, which amount to replac 
the adjac matrix A with the weight matrix W in 
eq. 54. ispolatov et al. (ispolatov et al., 2006) have 
adopt a similar hamiltonian a in eq. 54, with a tun- 
abl antiferromagnet term interpol between the 

correspond term of eq. 54 and the entropi term (pro- 
portion to n log ns) of the free energy, whose mini- 
mizat be equival to find the state of the finite- 
temperatur pott model use by blatt et al. (blatt et al., 
1996). eq. 55 be at the basi of the success generaliza- 
tion of modular with arbitrari null model propos 
by reichardt and bornholdt, that we have discuss in 
section vi.b. 

In anoth work (s.-w. son et al., 2006), son et al. 
have present a cluster techniqu base on the fer- 
romagnet random field ise model (frfim). given a 
weight graph with weight matrix W, the hamiltonian 
of the frfim on the graph be 

H = −1 
2 

∑ 
i,j 

wijσiσj − 
∑ 
i 

biσi. (56) 

In eq. 56 σi = ±1 and Bi be the spin and the ran- 
dom magnet field of vertex i, respectively. the frfim 
have be studi to understand the natur of the spin 
glass phase transit (middleton and fisher, 2002) and 
the disorder-driven roughen transit of interfac in 
disord medium (noh and rieger, 2001, 2002). the 
behavior of the model depend on the choic of the mag- 
netic fields. son et al. set to zero the magnet field 
of all vertex but two, say s and t, for which the field 
have infinit strength and opposit signs. thi amount 
to fix the spin of s and t to opposit values, introduc- 
ing frustrat in the system. the idea be that, if s and t 
be central vertex of differ communities, they impos 
their spin state to the other commun members. so, 
the state of minimum energi be a configur in which 
the graph be polar into a subgraph with all posit 
spin and a subgraph with all neg spins, coincid 
with the communities, if they be well defined. find 
the minimum of H be equival to solv a maximum- 
flow/minimum-cut problem, which can be do through 
well know techniqu of combinatori optimization, like 
the augment path algorithm (ahuja et al., 1993). for 
a give choic of s and t, mani ground state can be 
found. the vertex that end up in the same cluster in 
all ground state repres the core of the clusters, which 
be call coteries. possibl vertex not belong to the 
coteri indic that the two cluster overlap. In the 
absenc of inform about the cluster structur of the 
graph, one need to repeat the procedur for ani pair 
of vertex s and t. pick vertex of the same cluster, 
for instance, would not give meaning partitions. son 
et al. distinguish relev cluster if they be of about 
the same size. the procedur can be iter appli 
to each of the detect clusters, consid a a separ 
graph, until all cluster have no commun structur ani 
more. On spars graphs, the algorithm have complex 
o(n2+θ), where θ ∼ 1.2, so it be veri slow and can be cur- 
rentli use for graph of up to few thousand vertices. If 
one happen to know which be the import vertex 
of the clusters, e.g. by comput appropri central 
valu (like degre or site between (freeman, 1977)), 
the choic for s and t be constrain and the complex 



45 

can becom a low a o(nθ), which enabl the analysi 
of system with million of vertices. test on barabási- 
albert graph (section a.3) show that the latter have no 
commun structure, a expected. 

B. random walk 

random walk (hughes, 1995) can also be use to 
find communities. If a graph have a strong commun 
structure, a random walker spend a long time insid a 
commun due to the high densiti of intern edg and 
consequ number of path that could be followed. here 
we describ the most popular cluster algorithm base 
on random walks. all of them can be trivial extend 
to the case of weight graphs. 

zhou use random walk to defin a distanc between 
pair of vertex (zhou, 2003a): the distanc dij between 
i and j be the averag number of edg that a random 
walker have to cross to reach j start from i. close 
vertex be like to belong to the same community. 
zhou defin a “global attractor” of a vertex i to be a 
closest vertex to i (i. e. ani vertex lie at the small 
distanc from i), wherea the “local attractor” of i be 
it closest neighbour. two type of commun be 
defined, accord to local or global attractors: a vertex 
i have to be put in the same commun of it attractor 
and of all other vertex for which i be an attractor. 
commun must be minim subgraphs, i. e. they 
cannot includ small subgraph which be commun 
accord to the chosen criterion. applic to real 
networks, like zachary’ karat club (zachary, 1977) and 
the colleg footbal network compil by girvan and 
newman (girvan and newman, 2002) (section xv.a), 
along with artifici graph like the benchmark by 
girvan and newman (girvan and newman, 2002) (sec- 
tion xv.a), show that the method can find meaning 
partitions. the method can be refined, in that vertex i 
be associ to it attractor j onli with a probabl 
proport to exp(−βdij), β be a sort of invers 
temperature. the comput of the distanc matrix 
requir solv n linear-algebra equat (a mani 
a the vertices), which requir a time o(n3). On 
the other hand, an exact comput of the distanc 
matrix be not necessary, a the attractor of a vertex 
can be identifi by consid onli a local portion 
of the graph around the vertex; therefor the method 
can be appli to larg graph a well. In a success 
paper (zhou, 2003b), zhou introduc a measur of 
dissimilar between vertex base on the distanc 
defin above. the measur resembl the definit 
of distanc base on structur equival of eq. 7, 
where the element of the adjac matrix be replac 
by the correspond distances. graph partit be 
obtain with a divis procedur that, start from 
the graph a a singl community, perform success 
split base on the criterion that vertex in the same 
cluster must be less dissimilar than a run threshold, 

which be decreas dure the process. the hierarchi 
of partit deriv by the method be repres of 
actual commun structur for sever real and artifi- 
cial graphs, includ zachary’ karat club (zachary, 
1977), the colleg footbal network (girvan and 
newman, 2002) and the benchmark by girvan and 
newman (girvan and newman, 2002) (section xv.a). 
the time complex of the procedur be again o(n3). 
the code of the algorithm can be download from 
http://www.mpikg-golm.mpg.de/theory/people/zh 
/networkcommunity.html. 

In anoth work (zhou and lipowsky, 2004), zhou and 
lipowski adopt bia random walkers, where the bia 
be due to the fact that walker move preferenti toward 
vertex share a larg number of neighbour with the 
start vertex. they defin a proxim index, which 
indic how close a pair of vertex be to all other ver- 
tices. commun be detect with a procedur call 
netwalk, which be an agglom hierarch cluster- 
ing method (section iv.b), where the similar between 
vertex be express by their proximity. the method have 
a time complex o(n3): however, the proxim index 
of a pair of vertex can be comput with good approx- 
imat by consid just a small portion of the graph 
around the two vertices, with a consider gain in time. 
the perform of the method be compar with that 
of the algorithm of girvan and newman (section v.a). 

A differ distanc measur between vertex base on 
random walk be introduc by latapi and pon (lat- 
api and pons, 2005). the distanc be calcul from 
the probabl that the random walker move from 
a vertex to anoth in a fix number of steps. the 
number of step have to be larg enough to explor 
a signific portion of the graph, but not too long, 
a otherwis one would approach the stationari limit 
in which transit probabl trivial depend on 
the vertex degrees. vertic be then group into 
commun through an agglom hierarch 
cluster techniqu base on ward’ method (ward, 
1963). modular (section iii.c.2) be use to select the 
best partit of the result dendrogram. the algo- 
rithm run to complet in a time o(n2d) on a spars 
graph, where d be the depth of the dendrogram. sinc 
d be often small for real graph [o(log n)], the expect 
complex in practic comput be o(n2 log n). 
the softwar of the algorithm can be found at 
http://www-rp.lip6.fr/∼latapy/pp/walktrap.html. 

Hu et al. (hu et al., 2008) design a graph cluster 
techniqu base on a signal process between vertices, 
somewhat resembl diffusion. initi a vertex s be as- 
sign one unit of signal, all the other have no signal. In 
the first step, the sourc vertex s send one unit of signal 
to each of it neighbors. next, all vertex send a mani 
unit of signal they have to each of their neighbors. the 
process be continu until a give number of iter T 
be reached. the intens of the signal at vertex i, nor- 
maliz by the total amount of signal, be the i-th entri of 
a vector us, repres the sourc vertex s. the proce- 



46 

dure be then repeat by choos each vertex a source. 
In thi way one can associ an n-dimension vector to 
each vertex, which correspon to a point in an euclidean 
space. the vector u be actual the s-th column of the 
matrix (I + a)t , where I and A be the ident and 
adjac matrix, respectively. the idea be that the vec- 
tor u describ the influenc that vertex s exert on the 
graph through signaling. vertic of the same commu- 
niti be expect to have similar influenc on the graph 
and thu to correspond to vector which be “close” in 
space. the vector be final group via fuzzi k-mean 
cluster (section iv.c). the optim number of clus- 
ter correspond to the partit with the shortest aver- 
age distanc between vector in the same commun and 
the larg averag distanc between vector of differ 
communities. the signal process be similar to diffu- 
sion, but with the import differ that here there be 
no flow conservation, a the amount of signal at each ver- 
tex be not distribut among it neighbor but transfer 
entir to each neighbor (a if the vertex sent multipl 
copi of the same signal). the complex of the algo- 
rithm be o[t (〈k〉+ 1)n2], where 〈k〉 be the averag degre 
of the graph. like in the previou algorithm by latapi 
and pon (latapi and pons, 2005), find an optim 
valu for the number of iter T be non-trivial. 

delvenn et al. (delvenn et al., 2008) have show that 
random walk enabl one to introduc a gener qualiti 
function, express the persist of cluster in time. A 
cluster be persist with respect to a random walk after 
t time step if the probabl that the walker escap the 
cluster befor t step be low. such probabl be comput 
via the cluster autocovari matrix rt, which, for a 
partit of the graph in c clusters, be defin a 

Rt = H 
T (πmt − πtπ)h. (57) 

here, H be the n× c membership matrix, whose element 
hij equal one if vertex i be in cluster j, zero otherwise; 
M be the transit matrix of the random walk; Π the 
diagon matrix whose element be the stationari prob- 
abil of the random walk, i. e. πii = ki/2m, ki be 
the degre of vertex i; π be the vector whose entri be 
the diagon element of Π. the element (rt)ij express 
the probabl for the walk to start in cluster i and end 
up in cluster j after t steps, minu the stationari proba- 
biliti that two independ random walker be in i and 
j. In thi way, the persist of a cluster i be relat to 
the diagon element (rt)ii. delvenn et al. defin the 
stabil of the cluster 

r(t; H) = min 
0≤s≤t 

c∑ 
i=1 

(rs)ii = min 
0≤s≤t 

trace[rs]. (58) 

the aim be then, for a give time t, find the partit 
with the larg valu for r(t; h). for t = 0, the most 
stabl partit be that in which all vertex be their own 
clusters. interestingly, for t = 1, maxim stabil 
be equival to maxim newman-girvan modular- 
iti (section iii.c.2). the cut size of the partit (sec- 
tion iv.a) equal [r(0) − r(1)], so it be also a one-step 

measure. In the limit t → ∞, the most stabl partit 
coincid with the fiedler partit (fiedler, 1973, 1975), 
i. e. the bipartit where vertex be put in the same 
class accord to the sign of the correspond compo- 
nent of the fiedler eigenvector (section iv.a). therefore, 
the measur r(t; H) be veri general, and give a unify- 
ing interpret in the framework of the random walk 
of sever measur that be defin in differ con- 
texts. In particular, modular have a natur interpre- 
tation in thi dynam pictur (lambiott et al., 2008). 
sinc the size of stabl cluster increas with t, time 
can be consid a a resolut parameter. resolut 
can be fine tune by take time a a continu vari- 
abl (the extens of the formal be straightforward); 
the linear of the stabil measur at small (con- 
tinuous) time deliv multiresolut version of mod- 
ular (arena et al., 2008b; reichardt and bornholdt, 
2006a) (section xii.a). 

In a method by weinan et al. (weinan et al., 2008), 
the best partit of a graph in k cluster be such that the 
markov chain describ a random walk on the meta- 
graph, whose vertex be the cluster of the origin 
graph, give the best approxim of the full random 
walk dynam on the whole graph. the qualiti of the 
approxim be give by the distanc between the left 
stochast matrix of the two processes, which thu need 
to be minimized. the minim be perform by use 
a variant of the k-mean algorithm (section iv.c), and 
the result be the best obtain out of l run start from 
differ initi conditions, a strategi that consider 
improv the qualiti of the optimum. the time com- 
plexiti be o[tlk(n + m)], where t be the number of step 
requir to reach convergence. the optim number of 
cluster could in principl be determin by analyz 
how the qualiti of the approxim vari with k, but 
the author do not give ani gener recipe. the method 
be rather accur on the benchmark by girvan and new- 
man (girvan and newman, 2002) (section xv.a) and on 
zachary’ karat club network. the algorithm by weinan 
et al. be asymptot equival to spectral graph par- 
tition (section iv.d) when the markov chain describ- 
ing the random walk present a sizeabl spectral gap be- 
tween some of the larg eigenvalu of the transfer ma- 
trix (section a.2), approxim equal to one, and the 
others. 

We conclud thi section by describ the markov 
cluster algorithm (mcl), which be invent by van 
dongen (dongen, 2000a). thi method simul a pe- 
culiar process of flow diffus in a graph. one start 
from the transfer matrix of the graph T (section a.2). 
the element tij of the transfer matrix give the proba- 
biliti that a random walker, sit at vertex j, move to 
i. the sum of the element of each column of T be one. 
each iter of the algorithm consist of two steps. In 
the first step, call expansion, the transfer matrix of the 
graph be rais to an integ power p (usual p = 2). the 
entri mij of the result matrix give the probabl 
that a random walker, start from vertex j, reach i 



47 

in p step (diffus flow). the second step, which have no 
physic counterpart, consist in rais each singl entri 
of the matrix M to some power α, where α be now real- 
valued. thi operation, call inflation, enhanc the 
weight between pair of vertex with larg valu of the 
diffus flow, which be like to be in the same commu- 
nity. next, the element of each column must be divid 
by their sum, such that the sum of the element of the 
column equal one and a new transfer matrix be recov- 
ered. after some iterations, the process deliv a stabl 
matrix, with some remark properties. it element 
be either zero or one, so it be a sort of adjac matrix. 
most importantly, the graph describ by the matrix be 
disconnected, and it connect compon be the com- 
muniti of the origin graph. the method be realli sim- 
ple to implement, which be the main reason of it success: 
a of now, the mcl be one of the most use cluster al- 
gorithm in bioinformatics. the code can be download 
from http://www.micans.org/mcl/. due to the ma- 
trix multipl of the expans step, the algorithm 
should scale a o(n3), even if the graph be sparse, a the 
run matrix becom quickli dens after a few step 
of the algorithm. however, while comput the matrix 
multiplication, mcl keep onli a maximum number k of 
non-zero element per column, where k be usual much 
small than n. so, the actual worst-cas run time of 
the algorithm be o(nk2) on a spars graph. A problem of 
the method be the fact that the final partit be sensit 
to the paramet α use in the inflat step. therefor 
sever differ partit can be obtained, and it be not 
clear which be the most meaning or representative. 

C. synchron 

synchron (pikovski et al., 2001) be an emerg 
phenomenon occur in system of interact unit 
and be ubiquit in nature, societi and technology. In 
a synchron state, the unit of the system be in the 
same or similar state(s) at everi time. synchron 
have also be appli to find commun in graphs. If 
oscil be place at the vertices, with initi random 
phases, and have nearest-neighbour interactions, oscilla- 
tor in the same commun synchron first, wherea 
a full synchron requir a longer time. so, if one 
follow the time evolut of the process, state with syn- 
chroniz cluster of vertex can be quit stabl and long- 
lived, so they can be easili recognized. thi be first 
show by arenas, dı́az-guilera and pérez-vicent (are- 
na et al., 2006). they use kuramoto oscil (ku- 
ramoto, 1984), which be coupl two-dimension vec- 
tor endow with a proper frequenc of oscillations. In 
the kuramoto model, the phase θi of oscil i evolv 
accord to the follow dynam 

dθi 
dt 

= ωi + 
∑ 
j 

K sin(θj − θi), (59) 

where ωi be the natur frequenc of i, K the strength of 
the coupl between oscil and the sum run over 
all oscil (mean field regime). If the interact cou- 
pling exce a threshold, depend on the width of the 
distribut of natur frequencies, the dynam lead to 
synchronization. If the dynam run on a graph, each 
oscil be coupl onli to it near neighbors. In or- 
der to reveal the effect of local synchronization, arena 
et al. introduc the local order paramet 

ρij(t) = 〈cos[θi(t)− θj(t)]〉, (60) 

measur the averag correl between oscil i 
and j. the averag be comput over differ initi con- 
ditions. By visual the correl matrix ρ(t) at a 
give time t, one may distinguish group of vertex that 
synchron together. the group can be identifi by 
mean of the dynam connect matrix dt(t ), which 
be a binari matrix obtain from ρ(t) by threshold it 
entries. the dynam connect matrix embodi in- 
format about both the synchron dynam and 
the underli graph topology. from the spectrum of 
dt(t ) it be possibl to deriv the number of disconnect 
compon at time t. By plot the number of compo- 
nent a a function of time, plateau may appear at some 
characterist time scales, indic structur scale of 
the graph with robust commun (fig. 19). partit 
correspond to long plateau be character by high 
valu of the modular of newman and girvan (sec- 
tion iii.c.2) on graph with homogen degre distri- 
butions, wherea such correl be poor in the presenc 
of hub (arena and dı́az-guilera, 2007). indeed, it have 
be proven that the stabil (eq. 58) of the dynam 
associ to the standard laplacian matrix, which de- 
scribe the converg toward synchron of the 
kuramoto model with equal intrins frequencies, coin- 
cide with modular onli for graph whose vertex have 
the same degre (lambiott et al., 2008). the appear- 
anc of plateau at differ time scale hint to a hierar- 
chical organ of the graph. after a suffici long 
t all oscil be synchron and the whole system be- 
have a a singl component. interestingly, arena et al. 
found that the structur scale reveal by synchroniza- 
tion correspond to group of eigenvalu of the laplacian 
matrix of the graph, separ by gap (fig. 19). 

base on the same principle, boccaletti et al. de- 
sign a commun detect method base on synchro- 
nizat (boccaletti et al., 2007). the synchron 
dynam be a variat of kuramoto’ model, the opin- 
ion chang rate (ocr) model (pluchino et al., 2005). 
here the interact coupl between adjac vertex 
be weight by a term proport to a (negative) power 
of the between of the edg connect the vertex 
(section v.a), with expon α. the evolut equa- 
tion of the model be solv by decreas the valu of 
α dure the evolut of the dynamics, start from a 
configur in which the system be fulli synchron 
(α = 0). the graph tend to get split into cluster of 
synchron elements, becaus the interact strength

across inter-clust edg get suppress due to their high 
between scores. By vari α, differ partit be 
recovered, from the graph a a whole until the vertex 
a separ communities: the partit with the larg 
valu of modular be take a the most relevant. the 
algorithm scale in a time o(mn), or o(n2) on spars 
graphs, and give good result in practic examples, in- 
clude zachary’ karat club (zachary, 1977) and the 
benchmark by girvan and newman (girvan and new- 
man, 2002) (section xv.a). the method can be refin 
by homogen the natur frequenc of the oscilla- 
tor dure the evolut of the system. In thi way, the 
system becom more stabl and partit with high 
modular valu can be recovered. 

In a recent paper by Li et al. (li et al., 2008a), it be 

show that synchron cluster in modular network 
be character by interfaci vertices, whose oscil 
frequenc be intermedi between those of two or more 
clusters, so that they do not belong to a specif commu- 
nity. Li et al. use thi result to devis a techniqu abl 
to detect overlap communities. 

synchronization-bas algorithm may not be reliabl 
when commun be veri differ in size; test in thi 
direct be still missing. 

ix. method base ON statist infer 

statist infer (mackay, 2003) aim at deduc 
properti of data sets, start from a set of observa- 



49 

tion and model hypotheses. If the data set be a graph, 
the model, base on hypothesi on how vertex be con- 
nect to each other, have to fit the actual graph topol- 
ogy. In thi section we review those cluster tech- 
niqu attempt to find the best fit of a model to the 
graph, where the model assum that vertex have some 
sort of classification, base on their connect pat- 
terns. We mainli focu on method adopt bayesian 
infer (winkler, 2003), in which the best fit be ob- 
tain through the maxim of a likelihood (gen- 
er models), but we also discu relat techniques, 
base on blockmodel (doreian et al., 2005), model se- 
lection (burnham and anderson, 2002) and inform 
theori (mackay, 2003). 

A. gener model 

bayesian infer us observ to estim the 
probabl that a give hypothesi be true. It con- 
sist of two ingredients: the evidence, express by 
the inform D one have about the system (e.g., 
through measurements); a statist model with param- 
eter {θ}. bayesian infer start by write the like- 
lihood P (d|{θ}) that the observ evid be produc 
by the model for a give set of paramet {θ}. the aim 
be to determin the choic of {θ} that maxim the pos- 
terior distribut P ({θ}|d) of the paramet give the 
model and the evidence. By use bayes’ theorem one 
have 

P ({θ}|d) = 1 
Z 
P (d|{θ})p ({θ}), (61) 

where P ({θ}) be the prior distribut of the model pa- 
ramet and 

Z = 

∫ 
P (d|{θ})p ({θ})dθ. (62) 

unfortunately, comput the integr 62 be a major chal- 
lenge. moreover, the choic of the prior distribut 
P ({θ}) be non-obvious. gener model differ from 
each other by the choic of the model and the way they 
address these two issues. 

bayesian infer be frequent use in the analysi 
and model of real graphs, includ social (handcock 
et al., 2007; koskinen and snijders, 2007; rhode and 
keefe, 2007) and biolog network (berg and lässig, 
2006; rowicka and kudlicki, 2004). graph cluster can 
be consid a specif exampl of infer problem. 
here, the evid be repres by the graph structur 
(adjac or weight matrix) and there be an addit 
ingredient, repres by the classif of the ver- 
tice in groups, which be a hidden (or missing) informa- 
tion that one wish to infer along with the paramet 
of the model which be suppos to be respons for the 
classification. thi idea be at the basi of sever recent 
papers, which we discu here. In all these works, one 
essenti maxim the likelihood P (d|{θ}) that the 

model be consist with the observ graph structure, 
with differ constraints. We specifi the set of param- 
eter {θ} a the triplet ({q}, {π}, k), where {q} indic 
the commun assign of the vertices, {π} the model 
parameters, and k the number of clusters. In the follow- 
ing we shall stick to the notat of the papers, so the 
variabl abov may be indic by differ symbols. 
however, to good show what each method specif 
do we shall refer to our gener notat at the end of 
the section. 

hast (hastings, 2006) choos a a model of net- 
work with commun the plant partit model (sec- 
tion xv). In it, n vertex be assign to q groups: ver- 
tice of the same group be link with a probabl pin, 
while vertex of differ group be link with a prob- 
abil pout. If pin > pout, the model graph have a built-in 
commun structure. the vertex classif be indi- 
cat by the set of label {qi}. the probabl that, 
give a graph, the classif {qi} be the right one ac- 
cord to the model is14 

p({qi}) ∝ {exp[− 
∑ 
〈ij〉 

jδqiqj − 
∑ 
i 6=j 

J ′δqiqj/2]}−1, (63) 

where J = log{[pin(1 − pout)]/[pout(1 − pin)]}, J ′ = 
log[(1−pin)/(1−pout)] and the first sum run over near 
neighbor vertices. maxim p({qi}) be equival 
to minim the argument of the exponential, which be 
the hamiltonian of a pott model with short- and long- 
rang interactions. for pin > pout, J > 0 and J 

′ < 0, 
so the model be a spin glass with ferromagnet nearest- 
neighbor interact and antiferromagnet long-rang 
interactions, similar to the model propos by reichardt 
and bornholdt to gener newman-girvan modular- 
iti (reichardt and bornholdt, 2006a) (section vi.b). 
hast use belief propag (gallager, 1963) to 
find the ground state of the spin model. On spars 
graphs, the complex of the algorithm be expect to 
be o(n logα n), where α need to be estim numeri- 
cally. In principl one need to input the paramet pin 
and pout, which be usual unknown in practic appli- 
cations. however, it turn out that they can be chosen 
rather arbitrarily, and that bad choic can be recogn 
and corrected. 

newman and leicht (newman and leicht, 2007) 
have recent propos a similar method base on a 
mixtur model and the expectation-maxim tech- 
niqu (dempster et al., 1977). the method bear some 
resembl with an a posteriori blockmodel previous 
introduc by snijder and nowicki (nowicki and sni- 
jders, 2001; snijder and nowicki, 1997). they start from 
a direct graph with n vertices, whose vertex fall into 
c classes. the group of vertex i be indic by gi, πr the 

14 the actual likelihood includ an addit factor express the 
a priori probabl of the commun sizes. hast assum 
that thi probabl be constant.

fraction of vertex in group r, and θri the probabl 
that there be a direct edg from vertex of group r to 
vertex i. By definition, the set {πi} and {θri} satisfi the 
normal condit 

∑c 
r=1 πr = 1 and 

∑n 
i=1 θri = 1. 

apart from normalization, the probabl {θri} be as- 
sum to be independ of each other. the best classifi- 
cation of the vertex correspond to the maximum of the 
averag log-likelihood L̄ that the model, describ by the 
valu of the paramet {πi} and {θri} fit the adjac 
matrix A of the graph. the express of the averag 
log-likelihood L̄ requir the definit of the probabl 
qir = pr(gi = r|a, π, θ), that vertex i belong to group r. 
By appli bayes’ theorem the probabl {qir} can 
be comput in term of the {πi} and the {θri}, a

where ki be the outdegre of vertex i. equat 64 and 65 
be self-consistent, and can be solv by iter them 
to convergence, start from a suitabl set of initi con- 
ditions. converg be fast, so the algorithm could be 
appli to fairli larg graphs, with up to about 106 ver- 
tices. 

the method, design for direct graphs, can be eas- 
ili extend to the undirect case, wherea an extens 
to weight graph be not straightforwad. A nice featur 
of the method be that it do not requir ani preliminari 
indic on what type of structur to look for; the re- 
sult structur be the most like classif base on 
the connect pattern of the vertices. therefore, var- 
iou type of structur can be detected, not necessarili 
communities. for instance, multipartit structur could 
be uncovered, or mix pattern where multipartit sub- 
graph coexist with communities, etc.. In thi respect, it 
be more power than most method of commun de- 
tection, which be bound to focu onli on proper commu- 
nities, i. e. subgraph with more intern than extern 
edges. In addition, sinc partit be defin by as- 
sign probabl valu to the vertices, express the 
extent of their membership in a group, it be possibl that 
some vertex be not clearli assign to a group, but to 
more groups, so the method be abl to deal with overlap- 
ping communities. the main drawback of the algorithm 
be the fact that one need to specifi the number of group 
c at the begin of the calculation, a number that be 
typic unknown for real networks. It be possibl to de- 
rive thi inform self-consist by maxim the 
probabl that the data be reproduc by partit 
with a give number of clusters. but thi procedur in- 
volv some degre of approximation, and the result be 
often not good.

In a recent studi it have be show that the method 
by newman and leicht enabl one to rank vertex 
base on their degre of influenc on other vertices, 
which allow to identifi the vertex respons for the 
group structur and it stabil (mungan and ramasco, 
2008). A veri similar techniqu have also be appli 
by vázquez (vazquez, 2008) to the problem of popula- 
tion stratification, where anim popul and their 
attribut be repres a hypergraph (section a.1). 
vázquez also suggest an interest criterion to decid 
the optim number of clusters, name pick the num- 
ber c̄ whose solut have the great similar with so- 
lution obtain at differ valu of c. the similar 
between two partit can be estim in variou ways, 
for instanc by comput the normal mutual infor- 
mation (section xv). In a success paper (vazquez, 
2008), vázquez show that good result be obtain 
if the classif likelihood be maxim by use vari- 
ation bay (beal, 2003; jordan et al., 1999). 

ramasco and mungan (ramasco and mungan, 2008) 
remark that the normal condit on the prob- 
abil {θri} impli that each group r must have non- 
zero outdegre and that therefor the method fail to 
detect the intuit group structur of (directed) bi- 
partit graph (fig. 20). To avoid thi problem, they 
propos a modification, that consist in introduc 
three set for the edg probabl {θri}, rel to 
edg go from group r to vertex i (a before), from 
i to r and in both directions, respectively. further- 
more, they use the averag entropi of the classif 
Sq = −( 

∑ 
i,r qir ln qir)/n, where the qir be the analog 

of the probabl in eq. 64, to infer the optim num- 
ber of groups, that the method of newman and leicht be 



51 

unabl to provide. anoth techniqu similar to that by 
newman and leicht have be design by ren et al. (ren 
et al., 2009). the model be base on the group fraction 
{πi}, defin a above, and a set of probabl {βr,i}, 
express the relev of vertex i for group r; the basic 
assumpt be that the probabl that two vertex of 
the same group be connect by an edg be proport 
to the product of the relev of the two vertices. In 
thi way, there be an explicit relat between group mem- 
bership and edg density, and the method can onli de- 
tect commun structure. the commun assign 
be recov through an expectation-maxim pro- 
cedur that close follow that by newman and leicht. 

maximum likelihood estim have be use by 
čopič et al. to defin an axiomat of the prob- 
lem of graph cluster and it relat concept (čopič 
et al., 2005). the start point be again the plant 
partit model (section xv), with probabl pin and 
pout. A novelti of the approach be the introduct of 
the size matrix S, whose element sij indic the max- 
imum strength of interact between vertex i and j. 
for instance, in a graph with unweight connections, 
all element of S equal 1. In thi case, the probabil- 
iti that the graph conceal a commun structur co- 
incid with the express (63) by hastings. čopič et 
al. use thi probabl a a qualiti function to defin 
rank between graph partit (likelihood rankings). 
the author show that the likelihood rank satisfi a 
number of gener properties, which should be satisfi 
by ani reason ranking. they also propos an algo- 
rithm to find the maximum likelihood partition, by use 
the auxiliari concept of pseudo-commun structure, i. 
e. a group of the graph vertex in which it be speci- 
fie which pair of vertex stay in the same commun 
and which pair instead stay in differ communities. A 
pseudo-commun may not be a commun becaus the 
transit properti be not gener valid, a the focu be 
on pairwis vertex relationships: it may happen that i 
and j be classifi in the same group, and that j and 
k be classifi in the same group, but that i and k be 
not classifi a belong to the same group. We believ 
that the work by čopič et al. be an import first step 
toward a more rigor formal of the problem of 
graph clustering. 

zanghi et al. (zanghi et al., 2008) have design a 
cluster techniqu that lie somewhat in between the 
method by hast and that by newman and leicht. 
As in ref. (hastings, 2006), they use the plant parti- 
tion model to repres a graph with commun struc- 
ture; a in ref. (newman and leicht, 2007), they max- 
imiz the classif likelihood use an expectation- 
maxim algorithm (dempster et al., 1977). the 
algorithm run for a fix number of cluster q, like that 
by newman and leicht; however, the optim number 
of cluster can be determin by run the algorithm 
for a rang of q-valu and select the solut that 
maxim the integr classif likelihood intro- 
duce by biernacki et al. (biernacki et al., 2000). the 

time complex of the algorithm be o(n2). 

hofman and wiggin have propos a gener bayesian 
approach to the problem of graph cluster (hofman 
and wiggins, 2008). like hast (hastings, 2006), 
they model a graph with commun structur a in the 
plant partit problem (section xv), in that there 
be two probabl θc and θd that there be an edg 
between vertex of the same or differ clusters, re- 
spectively. the unobserv commun structur be in- 
dicat by the set of label ~σ for the vertices; πr be 
again the fraction of vertex in group r. the con- 

jugat prior distribut p(~θ) and p(~π) be chosen to 
be beta and dirichlet distributions. the most prob- 
abl number of cluster K∗ maxim the condit 
probabl p(k|a) that there be K clusters, give the 
matrix A. like hastings, hofman and wiggin as- 
sume that the prior probabl p(k) on the number 
of cluster be a smooth function, therefor maxim 
p(k|a) amount to maxim the bayesian evid 
p(a|k) ∝ p(k|a)/p(k), obtain by integr the 
joint distribut p(a, ~σ|~π, ~θ,k), which be factorizable, 
over the model paramet ~θ and ~π. the integr 
can be perform exactli onli for small graphs. hofman 
and wiggin use variat bay (beal, 2003; jordan 
et al., 1999), in order to comput control approxima- 
tion of p(a|k). the complex of the algorithm be es- 
timat numer on synthet graphs, yield o(nα), 
with α = 1.44. In fact, the main limit come from 
high memori requirements. the method be more power- 
ful than the one by hast (hastings, 2006), in that the 

edg probabl ~θ be infer by the procedur itself 
and need not be specifi (or guessed) at the beginning. 
It also includ the expectation-maxim approach 
by newman and leicht (newman and leicht, 2007) a a 
special case, with the big advantag that the number of 
cluster need not be give a an input, but be an output of 
the method. the softwar of the algorithm can be found 
at http://www.columbia.edu/∼chw2/. 

We conclud with a brief summari of the main tech- 
niqu describ above, come back to our notat 
at the begin of the section. In the method by 
hastings, one maxim the likelihood P (d|{q}, {π}, k) 
over the set of all possibl commun assign 
{q}, give the number of cluster k and the model 
paramet (i. e. the link probabl pin and 
pout). newman and leicht maxim the likelihood 
P (d|{q}, {π}, k) for a give number of clusters, over the 
possibl choic for the model paramet and commu- 
niti assignments, by deriv the optim choic for 
both variabl with a self-consist procedure. hof- 
man and wiggin maxim the likelihood phw (k) =∑ 
{q} 
∫ 
P (d|{q}, {π}, k)p ({q}|{π})p ({π})dπ over the 

possibl choic for the number of clusters.

B. blockmodeling, model select and inform theori 

block model be a common approach in statist and 
social network analysi to decompos a graph in class 
of vertex with common properties. In thi way, a sim- 
pler descript of the graph be attained. vertic be 
usual group in class of equivalence. there be two 
main definit of topolog equival for vertices: 
structur equival (f.lorrain and white, 1971) (sec- 
tion iii.b.4), in which vertex be equival if they have 
the same neighbors15; regular equival (everett and 
borgatti, 1994; white and reitz, 1983), in which vertex 
of a class have similar connect pattern to vertex of 
the other class (ex. parents/children). regular equiv- 
alenc do not requir that ties/edg be restrict to 
specif target vertices, so it be a more gener concept 
than structur equivalence. indeed, vertex which be 
structur equival be also regularli equivalent, but 
the invers be not true. the concept of structur equiva- 
lenc can be gener to probabilist models, in which 
one compar class of graphs, not singl graphs, charac- 
teriz by a set of link probabl between the ver- 
tices. In thi case, vertex be organ in class such 
that the link probabl of a vertex with all other 
vertex of the graph be the same for vertex in the same 
class, which be call stochast equival (fienberg 
and wasserman, 1981; holland et al., 1983). 

A thorough discuss of blockmodel be beyond the 
scope of thi review: we point the reader to ref. (doreian 
et al., 2005). here we discu a recent work by reichardt 
and white (reichardt and white, 2007). let u suppos 
to have a direct graph with n vertex and m edges. A 
classif of the graph be indic by the set of label 
{σ}, where σi = 1, 2, ..., q be the class of vertex i. the 
correspond blockmodel, or imag graph, be express 
by a q×q adjac matrix B: bq1q2 = 1 if edg between 
class q1 and q2 be allowed, otherwis it be zero. the 
aim be find the classif {σ} and the matrix B 
that best fit the adjac matrix A of the graph. the 
good of the fit be express by the qualiti function 

qb({σ}) = 1 
m 

∑ 
i 6=j 

[aijaijbσiσj + bij(1−aij)(1−bσiσj )], 

(66) 
where aij (bij) reward the presenc (absence) of edg 
between vertex if there be edg (non-edges) between 
the correspond classes, and m be the number of edg 
of the graph, a usual. eq. 66 can be rewrit a a sum 
over the class 

qb({σ}) = 
q∑ 
r, 

(er − [ers])brs, (67) 

15 more generally, if they have the same ties/edg to the same 
vertices, a in a social network there may be differ type of 
ties/edges. 

by set er = (1/m) 
∑ 
i6=j(aij + bij)aijδσirδσj and 

[ers] = (1/m) 
∑ 
i 6=j bijδσirδσjs. If one set aij = 1 − pij 

and bij = pij , pij can be interpret a the link prob- 
abil between i and j, in some null model. thereof, 
er becom the number of edg run between ver- 
tice of class r and s, and [ers] the expect number 
of edg in the null model. reichardt and white set 
pij = k 

out 
i k 

in 
j /m, which defin the same null model 

of newman-girvan modular for direct graph (sec- 
tion vi.b). In fact, if the imag graph have onli self- 
edges, i. e. br = δrs, the qualiti function qb({σ}) 
exactli match modularity. other choic for the im- 
age graph be possible, however. for instance, a matrix 
br = 1 − δr describ the class of a q-partit graph 
(section a.1). from eq. 67 we see that, for a give clas- 
sific {σ}, the imag graph that yield the larg 
valu of the qualiti function qb({σ}) be that in which 
br = 1 when the term er − [ers] be non-negative, and 
br = 0 when the term er − [ers] be non-positive. so, 
the best classif be the one maxim the qualiti 
function 

q∗({σ}) = 1 
2 

q∑ 
r, 

||er − [ers]||, (68) 

where all term of the sum be take in absolut value. 
the function q∗({σ}) be maxim via simul an- 
nealing. the absolut maximum qmax be obtain by 
construct when q match the number q∗ of structur 
equival class of the graph. however, the absolut 
maximum qmax do not have a mean by itself, a 
one can achiev fairli high valu of q∗({σ}) also for 
null model instanc of the origin graph, i. e. if one 
random the graph by keep the same expect in- 
degre and outdegre sequences. In practic applica- 
tions, the optim number of class be determin by 
compar the ratio q∗(q)/qmax [Q 

∗(q) be the maximum 
of q∗({σ}) for q classes] with the expect ratio for the 
null model. sinc classif for differ q-valu be 
not hierarch ordered, overlap between class may 
be detected. the method can be trivial extend to 
the case of weight graphs. 

model select (burnham and anderson, 2002) aim 
at find model which be at the same time simpl and 
good at describ a system/process. A basic exampl of 
a model select problem be curv fitting. there be no 
clear-cut recip to select a model, but a bunch of heuris- 
tics, like akaik inform criterion (aic) (akaike, 
1974), bayesian inform criterion (bic) (schwarz, 
1978), minimum descript length (mdl) (grünwald 
et al., 2005; rissanen, 1978), minimum messag length 
(mml) (wallac and boulton, 1968), etc.. 

the modular structur of a graph can be consid 
a a compress descript of the graph to approxim 
the whole inform contain in it adjac matrix. 
base on thi idea, rosval and bergstrom (rosval and 
bergstrom, 2007) envis a commun process in 
which a partit of a graph in commun repres a 



53 

synthesi Y of the full structur that a signal send to 
a receiver, who tri to infer the origin graph topolog 
X from it (fig. 21). the same idea be at the basi of an 
earli method by sun et al. (sun et al., 2007), which be 
origin design for bipartit graph evolv in time 
and will be describ in section xiii. the best partit 
correspond to the signal Y that contain the most infor- 
mation about X. thi can be quantit assess by 
the minim of the condit inform h(x|i ) 
of X give Y , 

h(x|i ) = log

where q be the number of clusters, ni the number of ver- 
tice in cluster i, lij the number of edg between cluster 
i and j. We remark that, if one impos no constraint 
on q, h(x|i ) be minim in the trivial case in which 
X = Y (h(x|x) = 0). thi solut be not accept 
becaus it do not correspond to a compress of infor- 
mation with respect to the origin data set. one have to 
look for the ideal tradeoff between a good compress 
and a small enough inform h(x|i ). the minimum 
descript length (mdl) principl (grünwald et al., 
2005; rissanen, 1978) provid a solut to thi prob- 
lem, which amount to the minim of a function 
give by h(x|i ) plu a function of the number n of 
vertices, m of edg and q of clusters. the optimiza- 
tion be perform by simul annealing, so the method 
be rather slow and can be appli to graph with up to 
about 104 vertices. however, faster techniqu may in 
principl be used, even if they impli a loss in accuracy. 
the method appear superior than modular optimiza- 
tion, especi when commun be of differ sizes. 
thi come from test perform on the benchmark of 
girvan and newman (girvan and newman, 2002) (sec- 
tion xv.a), both in it origin version and in asymmet- 
ric versions, propos by the authors, where the cluster 
have differ size or differ averag degrees. In ad- 
dition, it can detect other type of vertex classif 
than communities, a in eq. 69 there be no constraint 
on the rel import of the edg densiti within 
commun with respect to the edg densiti between 
communities. the softwar of the algorithm can be found 
at http://www.tp.umu.se/∼rosvall/code.html. 

In a recent paper (rosval and bergstrom, 2008), ros- 
vall and bergstrom pursu the same idea of describ 
a graph by use less inform than that encod in 
the full adjac matrix. the goal be to optim com- 
press the inform need to describ the process of 
inform diffus across the graph. random walk 
be chosen a a proxi of inform diffusion. A two- 
level description, in which one give uniqu name to im- 
portant structur of the graph and to vertex within 
the same structure, but the vertex name be recycl 
among differ structures, lead to a more compact de- 
scription than by simpli cod all vertex with differ 
names. thi be similar to the procedur usual adopt 

in geograph maps, where the structur be citi and 
one usual choos the same name for street of dif- 
ferent cities, a long a there be onli one street with a 
give name in the same city. huffman cod (huffman, 
1952) be use to name vertices. for the random walk, the 
above-ment structur be communities, a it be in- 
tuitiv that walker will spend a lot of time within them, 
so they play a crucial role in the process of inform 
diffusion. graph cluster turn then into the follow- 
ing cod problem: find the partit that yield the 
minimum descript length of an infinit random walk. 
such descript length consist of two terms, express 
the shannon entropi of the random walk within and be- 
tween clusters. everi time the walker step to a differ 
cluster, one need to use the codeword of that cluster 
in the description, to inform the decod of the transi- 
tion16. clearly, if cluster be well separ from each 
other, transit of the random walker between cluster 
will be unfrequent, so it be advantag to use the map, 
with the cluster a regions, becaus in the descript 
of the random walk the codeword of the cluster will 
not be repeat mani times, while there be a consider- 
abl save in the descript due to the limit length 
of the codeword use to denot the vertices. instead, if 
there be no well-defin cluster and/or if the partit 
be not repres of the actual commun structur 
of the graph, transit between the cluster of the par- 
tition will be veri frequent and there will be littl or 
no gain by use the two-level descript of the map. 
the minim of the descript length be carri out 
by combin greedi search with simul annealing. 
In a success paper (rosval et al., 2009), the author 
adopt the fast greedi techniqu design by blondel 
et al. for modular optim (blondel et al., 2008), 
with some refinements. the method can be appli to 
weight graphs, both undirect and directed. In the 
latter case, the random walk process be modifi by intro- 
duce a teleport probabl τ , to guarante ergod- 
icity, just like in google’ pagerank algorithm (brin and 
page, 1998). the partit of direct graph obtain 
by the method differ from those deriv by optim 
the direct version of newman-girvan modular (sec- 
tion vi.b): thi be due to the fact that modular focu 
on pairwis relationship between vertices, so it do not 
captur flows. the code of the method be avail at 
http://www.tp.umu.se/∼rosvall/code.html. 

chakrabarti (chakrabarti, 2004) have appli the mdl 
principl to put the adjac matrix of a graph into 
the (approximately) block diagon form repres the 
best tradeoff between have a limit number of blocks, 
for a good compress of the graph topology, and hav- 
ing veri homogen blocks, for a compact descript 

16 instead, for a one-level description, in which all vertex have 
differ names, it be enough to specifi the codeword of the vertex 
reach at everi step to complet defin the process, but thi 
may be costly.

fig. 21 basic principl of the method by rosval and bergstrom (rosval and bergstrom, 2007). An encod send to a 
decod a compress inform about the topolog of the graph on the left. the inform give a coars descript 
of the graph, which be use by the decod to deduc the origin graph structure. reprint figur with permiss from

of their structure. the total encod cost T includ 
the inform on the total number of vertex of the 
graph, on the number of block and the number of ver- 
tice and edg in each block, along with the adjac 
matrix of the blocks. the minim of T be carri 
out by start from the partit in which the graph be 
a singl cluster. At each step, one oper a bipartit 
of the cluster of the partit with the maximum shan- 
non entropi per vertex. the split be carri out in order 
to remov from the origin cluster those vertex carry- 
ing the high contribut to the entropi per vertex of 
the cluster. then, start from the result partition, 
which have one more cluster than the previou one, T be 
optim among those partit with the same number 
of clusters. the procedur continu until one reach 
a number of cluster k?, for which T cannot be further 
decreased. the method by chakrabarti have complex 
o[i(k?)2m], where I be the number of iter requir 
for the converg of the optim for a give num- 
ber of clusters, which be usual small (I ≤ 20 in the 
experi perform by the author). therefor the 
algorithm can be appli to fairli larg graphs. 

inform theori have also be use to detect com- 
muniti in graphs. ziv et al. (ziv et al., 2005) have de- 
sign a method in which the inform contain in 
the graph topolog be compress such to preserv some 
predefin information. thi be the basic principl of the 
inform bottleneck method (tishbi et al., 1999). To 
understand thi criterion, we need to introduc an impor- 
tant measure, the mutual inform i(x,i ) (mackay, 
2003) of two random variabl X and Y . It be defin a 

i(x,i ) = 
∑ 
x 

∑ 
y 

P (x, y) log 
P (x, y) 

P (x)p (y) 
, (70) 

where P (x) indic the probabl that X = x (simi- 
larli for P (y)) and P (x, y) be the joint probabl of X 
and Y , i. e. P (x, y) = P (X = x, Y = y). the measur 
i(x,i ) tell how much we learn about X if we know 
Y , and viceversa. If X be the input variable, Z the vari- 
abl specifi the partit and Y the variabl encod 
the inform we want to keep, which be call relev 
variable, the goal be to minim the mutual inform 
between X and Z (to achiev the larg possibl data 
compression), under the constraint that the inform 
on Y extract from Z be accurate. the optim trade- 
off between the valu of i(x,z) and i(y,z) (i. e. com- 
pression versu accuracy) be express by the minimiza- 
tion of a functional, where the rel weight of the two 
contribut be give by a paramet play the role of a 
temperature. In the case of graph clustering, the question 
be what to choos a relev inform variable. ziv 
et al. propos to adopt the structur inform en- 
cod in the process of diffus on the graph. they also 
introduc the concept of network modularity, which char- 
acter the graph a a whole, not a specif partit like 
the modular by newman and girvan (section iii.c.2). 
the network modular be defin a the area under the 
inform curve, which essenti repres the rela- 
tion between the extent of compress and accuraci for 
all solut found by the method and all possibl num- 
ber of clusters. the softwar of the algorithm by ziv et 
al. can be found at http://www.columbia.edu/∼chw2/. 

X. altern method 

In thi section we describ some algorithm that do 
not fit in the previou categories, although some overlap 



55 

be possible. 

raghavan et al. (raghavan et al., 2007) have design 
a simpl and fast method base on label propagation. 
vertic be initi give uniqu label (e.g. their ver- 
tex labels). At each iteration, a sweep over all vertices, 
in random sequenti order, be performed: each vertex 
take the label share by the major of it neighbors. 
If there be no uniqu majority, one of the major label 
be pick at random. In thi way, label propag across 
the graph: most label will disappear, other will domi- 
nate. the process reach converg when each vertex 
have the major label of it neighbors. commun 
be defin a group of vertex have ident label 
at convergence. By construction, each vertex have more 
neighbor in it commun than in ani other commu- 
nity. thi resembl the strong definit of commun 
we have discuss in section iii.b.2, although the latter 
be stricter, in that each vertex must have more neighbor 
in it commun than in the rest of the graph. the al- 
gorithm do not deliv a uniqu solution. due to the 
mani tie encount along the process it be possibl 
to deriv differ partit start from the same ini- 
tial condition, with differ random seeds. test on real 
graph show that all partit found be similar to each 
other, though. the most precis inform that one can 
extract from the method be contain by aggreg the 
variou partit obtained, which can be do in variou 
ways. the author propos to label each vertex with the 
set of all label it have in differ partitions. aggregat- 
ing partit enabl one to detect possibl overlap 
communities. the main advantag of the method be the 
fact that it do not need ani inform on the num- 
ber and the size of the clusters. It do not need ani 
parameter, either. the time complex of each itera- 
tion of the algorithm be o(m), the number of iter 
to converg appear independ of the graph size, or 
grow veri slowli with it. So the techniqu be realli 
fast and could be use for the analysi of larg systems. 
In a recent paper (tibéli and kertész, 2008), tibéli and 
kertész show that the method be equival to find 
the local energi minimum of a simpl zero-temperatur ki- 
netic pott model, and that the number of such energi 
minimum be consider larg than the number of vertex 
of the graph. aggreg partit a raghavan et al. 
suggest lead to a fragment of the result partit 
in cluster that be the smaller, the larg the number of 
aggreg partitions. thi be potenti a seriou prob- 
lem of the algorithm by raghavan et al., especi when 
larg graph be investigated. In order to elimin unde- 
sire solutions, barber and clark introduc some con- 
straint in the optim process (barber and clark, 
2009). thi amount to add some term to the ob- 
jectiv function H whose maxim be equival to 
the origin label propag algorithm17. interestingly, 

17 H = 1/2 
∑ 
ij aijδij , where A be the adjac matrix of the 

if one impos the constraint that partit have to be 
balanced, i. e. that cluster have similar total degrees, 
the object function becom formal equival to 
newman-girvan modular Q (section iii.c.2), so the 
correspond version of the label propag algorithm 
be essenti base on a local optim of modularity. 
leung et al. have found that the origin algorithm by 
raghavan et al., appli on onlin social networks, often 
yield partit with one giant commun togeth with 
much small one (leung et al., 2009). In order to avoid 
thi disturb feature, which be an artefact of the algo- 
rithm, leung et al. propos to modifi the method by 
introduc a score for the labels, which decreas a the 
label propag far from the vertex to which the label 
be origin assigned. when choos the label of a 
vertex, the label of it neighbor be weight by their 
scores, therefor a singl label cannot span too larg por- 
tion of the graph (a it weight fade away with the dis- 
tanc from the origin), and no giant commun can be 
recovered. test of the modifi algorithm on the lfr 
benchmark (lancichinetti et al., 2008) (section xii.a) 
give good result and encourag further investigations. 

bagrow and bollt design an agglom tech- 
nique, call l-shell method (bagrow and bollt, 2005). 
It be a procedur that find the commun of ani ver- 
tex, although the author also present a more gen- 
eral procedur to identifi the full commun structur 
of the graph. commun be defin locally, base 
on a simpl criterion involv the number of edg in- 
side and outsid a group of vertices. one start from a 
vertex-origin and keep add vertex lie on succes- 
sive shells, where a shell be defin a a set of vertex at 
a fix geodes distanc from the origin. the first shell 
includ the near neighbour of the origin, the second 
the next-to-nearest neighbours, and so on. At each it- 
eration, one calcul the number of edg connect 
vertex of the new layer to vertex insid and outsid 
the run cluster. If the ratio of these two number 
(“emerg degree”) exce some predefin threshold, 
the vertex of the new shell be add to the cluster, oth- 
erwis the process stops. the idea of close a commun 
by expand a shell have be previous introduc by 
costa (da fontoura costa, 2004), in which shell be cen- 
tere on hubs. however, in thi procedur the number of 
cluster be preassign and no cluster can contain more 
than one hub. becaus of the local natur of the process, 
the l-shell method be veri fast and can identifi commu- 
niti veri quickly. unfortun the method work well 
onli when the sourc vertex be approxim equidist 
from the boundari of it community. To overcom thi 
problem, bagrow and bollt suggest to repeat the pro- 
ce start from everi vertex and deriv a membership 

graph and δ be kronecker’ function. It be just the neg of 
the energi of a zero-temperatur pott model, a found by tibéli 
and kertész (tibéli and kertész, 2008)

matrix M : the element mij be one if vertex j belong 
to the commun of vertex i, otherwis it be zero. the 
membership matrix can be rewrit by suitabl permu- 
tat row and column base on their mutual distances. 
the distanc between two row (or columns) be defin a 
the number of entri whose element differ. If the graph 
have a clear commun structure, the membership ma- 
trix take a block-diagon form, where the block iden- 
tifi the communities. the method enabl one to de- 
tect overlap between commun a well (porter et al., 
2007). unfortunately, the rearrang of the matrix 
requir a time o(n3), so it be quit slow. A variant 
of the algorithm by bagrow and bollt, in which bound- 
ari vertex be examin separ and both first and 
second near neighbor of the run commun be 
simultan investigated, be suggest by rodrigu 
et al. (rodrigu et al., 2007). 

A recent methodolog introduc by papadopoulo et 
al. (papadopoulo et al., 2009), call bridg bounding, 
be similar to the l-shell algorithm, but here the clus- 
ter around a vertex grow until one “hits” the boundari 
edges. such edg can be recogn from the valu of 
variou measures, like between (girvan and newman, 
2002) or the edg cluster coeffici (radicchi et al., 
2004). the problem be that there be often no clear gap 
in the distribut of the valu of such measures, so 
one be forc to set a threshold to automat iden- 
tifi the boundari edg from the others, and there be no 
obviou way to do it. the best result of the algorithm 
be obtain by use a measur consist of a weight 
sum of the edg cluster coeffici over a wider neigh- 
borhood of the give edge. thi version of the method 
have a time complex o(〈k〉2m+ 〈k〉n), where 〈k〉 be the 
averag degre of the graph. 

In anoth algorithm by clauset, local commun be 
discov through greedi maxim of a local mod- 
ular measur (clauset, 2005). given a commun C, 
the boundari B be the set of vertex of C with at least one 
neighbor outsid C (fig. 22). the local modular R by 
clauset be the ratio of the number of edg have both 
endpoint in C (but at least one in b), with the number 
of edg have at least one endpoint in B. It be a mea- 
sure of the sharp of the commun boundary. it 
optim consist of a local explor of the com- 
muniti start from a sourc vertex: at each step the 
neighbor vertex yield the larg increas (smallest 
decrease) of R be added, until the commun have reach 
a predefinit size nc. thi greedi optim take a 
time o(n2c〈k〉), where 〈k〉 be the averag degre of the 
graph. the local modular R have be use in a paper 
by hui et al. (hui et al., 2007), where method to find 
commun in network of mobil devic be designed. 

anoth method, where commun be defin base 
on a local criterion, be present by eckmann and 
mose (eckmann and moses, 2002). the idea be to use 
the cluster coeffici (watt and strogatz, 1998) of 
a vertex a a quantiti to distinguish tightli connect 
group of vertices. mani edg mean mani loop insid

to have a larg cluster coefficient. the latter can be 
relat to the averag distanc between pair of neigh- 
bour of the vertex. the possibl valu of the distanc 
be 1 (if neighbor be connected) or 2 (if they be not), 
so the averag distanc lie between 1 and 2. the more 
triangl there be in the subgraph, the shorter the av- 
erag distance. sinc each vertex alway have distanc 1 
from it neighbours, the fact that the averag distanc 
between it neighbour be differ from 1 remind what 
happen when one measur segment on a curv sur- 
face. endow with a metric, repres by the geodes 
distanc between vertices/points, and a curvature, the 
graph can be emb in a geometr space. communi- 
tie appear a portion of the graph with a larg curva- 
ture. the algorithm be appli to the graph represen- 
tation of the world wide web, where vertex be web 
page and edg be the hyperlink that take user from a 
page to the other. the author found that commun 
correspond to web page deal with the same topic. 

long et al. have devis an interest techniqu that 
be abl to detect variou type of vertex groups, not nec- 
essarili commun (long et al., 2007). the method 
be base on graph approximation, a it tri to match 
the origin graph topolog onto a coars type of graph, 
the commun prototyp graph, which have a clear group 
structur (block-diagon for clusters, block-off-diagon 
for class of multipartit graphs, etc.). the goal be to 
determin the commun prototyp graph that best ap- 



57 

proxim the graph at study, where the good of the 
approxim be express by the distanc between the 
correspond matrices. In thi way the origin prob- 
lem of find graph subset becom an optim 
problem. long et al. call thi procedur commun 
learn by graph approxim (clga). sometim 
the minim of the matrix distanc can be turn 
into the maxim of the trace of a matrix. measur 
like cut size or ratio cut can be also formul a the 
trace of matrix (see for instanc eq. 18). In fact, clga 
includ tradit graph partit a a special case 
(section iv.a). long et al. design three algorithm 
for clga: two of them seek for divis of the graph 
into overlap or non-overlap groups, respectively; 
in the third one an addit constraint be introduc 
to produc group of compar size. the complex 
of these algorithm be o(tn2k), where t be the number 
of iter until the optim converg and k the 
number of groups. the latter have to be give a an input, 
which be a seriou limit of clga. 

A fast algorithm by Wu and huberman identifi com- 
muniti base on the properti of resistor network (wu 
and huberman, 2004). It be essenti a method for par- 
tition graph in two parts, similar to spectral bisec- 
tion, although partit in an arbitrari number of com- 
muniti can be obtain by iter applications. the 
graph be transform into a resistor network where each 
edg have unit resistance. A unit potenti differ be 
set between two randomli chosen vertices. the idea be 
that, if there be a clear divis in two commun of 
the graph, there will be a visibl gap between voltag 
valu for vertex at the border between the clusters. 
the voltag be calcul by solv kirchoff’ equa- 
tions: an exact solut would be too time consuming, 
but it be possibl to find a reason good approxim 
in a linear time for a spars graph with a clear commu- 
niti structure, so the more time consum part of the 
algorithm be the sort of the voltag values, which take 
time o(n log n). ani possibl vertex pair can be chosen 
to set the initi potenti difference, so the procedur 
should be repeat for all possibl vertex pairs. the au- 
thor show that thi be not necessary, and that a limit 
number of sampl pair be suffici to get good results, 
so the algorithm scale a o(n log n) and be veri fast. An 
interest featur of the method be that it can quickli 
find the natur commun of ani vertex, without de- 
termin the complet partit of the graph. for that, 
one us the vertex a sourc voltag and place the sink 
at an arbitrari vertex. the same featur be present in an 
old algorithm by flake et al. (flake et al., 2002), where 
one us max-flow instead of current flow (section iv.a). 
An algorithm by orponen and schaeffer (orponen and 
schaeffer, 2005) be base on the same principle, but it 
do not need the specif of target sourc a it be 
base on diffus in an unbound medium. the limit 
of such method be the fact that one have to give a in- 
put the number of clusters, which be usual not know 
beforehand. 

ohkubo and tanaka (ohkubo and tanaka, 2006) 
point out that, sinc commun be rather compact 
structures, they should have a small volume, where the 
volum of a commun be defin a the ratio of the 
number of vertex by the intern edg densiti of the 
community. ohkubo and tanaka assum that the sum 
vtotal of the volum of the commun of a partit be 
a reliabl index of the good of the partition. so, the 
most relev partit be the one minim vtotal. the 
optim be carri out with simul annealing. 

zarei and samani (zarei and samani, 2009) remark 
that there be a symmetri between commun structur 
and anti-commun (multipartite) structure, when one 
consid a graph and it complement, whose edg be 
the miss edg of the origin graph. In fact, if a graph 
have a well identifi communities, the same group of 
vertex would be strong anti-commun in the com- 
plement graph, i. e. they should have a few intra- 
cluster edg and mani inter-clust edges. base on 
thi remark, the commun of a graph can be iden- 
tifi by look for anticommun in the comple- 
ment graph, which can sometim be easier. zarei and 
samani devis a spectral method use matrix of the 
complement graph. the result of thi techniqu ap- 
pear good a compar to other spectral method on 
artifici graph gener with the plant `-partit 
model (condon and karp, 2001), a well a on zachary’ 
karat club (zachary, 1977), lusseau’ dolphins’ net- 
work (lusseau, 2003) and a network of protein-protein 
interactions. however, the author have use veri small 
graph for testing. commun make sens on spars 
graphs, but the complement of larg spars graph would 
not be sparse, but veri dense, and their commun (mul- 
tipartite) structur basic invisible. 

gudkov and montealegr detect commun by 
mean of dynam simplex evolut (gudkov et al., 
2008). graph vertex be repres a point in an 
(n − 1)-dimension space. each point initi sit on 
the n vertex of a simplex, and then move in space 
due to forc exert by the other points. If vertex 
be neighbors, the mutual forc act on their repre- 
sent point be attractive, otherwis it be repulsive. 
If the graph have a clear commun structure, the cor- 
respond spatial cluster repel each other becaus of 
the few connect between them (repuls domin 
over attraction). If commun be more mix with 
each other, cluster be not well separ and they could 
be mistakenli aggreg in larg structures. To avoid 
that, gudkov and montealegr defin cluster a group 
of point such that the distanc between each pair of 
point do not exceed a give threshold, which can be 
arbitrarili tuned, to reveal structur at differ resolu- 
tion (section xii.a). the algorithm consist in solv 
first-ord differenti equations, describ the dynam- 
ic of mass point move in a viscou medium. the 
complex of the procedur be o(n2). differenti equa- 
tion be also at the basi of a recent method design by 
krawczyk and Ku lakowski (krawczyk, 2008; krawczyk 



58 

and kulakowski, 2007). here the equat describ a 
dynam process, in which the origin graph topolog 
evolv to a disconnect graph, whose compon be 
the cluster of the origin graph. 

despit the signific improv in comput 
complexity, it be still problemat to appli cluster al- 
gorithm to mani larg network avail today. there- 
fore narasimhamurthi et al. (narasimhamurthi et al., 
2008) propos a two-step procedure: first, the graph 
at studi be decompos in small piec by a fast 
graph partit technique; then, a cluster method 
be appli to each of the small subgraph obtain 
[narasimhamurthi et al. use the cliqu percol 
method (section xi.a)]. the initi decomposit of the 
graph be carri out through the multilevel method by 
dhillon et al. (dhillon et al., 2007). It be crucial to verifi 
that the initi partit do not split the commu- 
niti of the graph among the variou subgraph of the 
decomposition. thi can be do by comparing, on arti- 
ficial graphs, the final cluster obtain with the two-step 
method with those detect by appli the chosen clus- 
tere techniqu to the entir graph. 

xi. method TO find overlap 
commun 

most of the method discuss in the previou sec- 
tion aim at detect standard partitions, i. e. partit 
in which each vertex be assign to a singl community. 
however, in real graph vertex be often share between 
commun (section ii), and the issu of detect over- 
lap commun have becom quit popular in the last 
few years. We devot thi section to the main techniqu 
to detect overlap communities. 

A. cliqu percol 

the most popular techniqu be the cliqu percol 
method (cpm) by palla et al. (palla et al., 2005). It be 
base on the concept that the intern edg of a com- 
muniti be like to form cliqu due to their high den- 
sity. On the other hand, it be unlik that intercom- 
muniti edg form cliques: thi idea be alreadi use 
in the divis method of radicchi et al. (section v.b). 
palla et al. use the term k-cliqu to indic a com- 
plete graph with k vertices18. notic that a k-cliqu be 
differ from the n-cliqu (see section iii.b.2) use in 
social science. If it be possibl for a cliqu to move 
on a graph, in some way, it would probabl get trap 
insid it origin community, a it could not cross the 
bottleneck form by the intercommun edges. palla et 
al. introduc a number of concept to implement thi 

18 In graph theori the k-cliqu by palla et al. be simpli call 
clique, or complet graph, with k vertex (section a.1). 

fig. 23 cliqu percol method. the exampl show 
commun span by adjac 4-cliques. overlap ver- 
tice be show by the big dots. reprint figur with per- 
mission from ref. (palla et al., 2005). c©2005 by the natur 
publish group. 

idea. two k-cliqu be adjac if they share k − 1 ver- 
tices. the union of adjac k-cliqu be call k-cliqu 
chain. two k-cliqu be connect if they be part of 
a k-cliqu chain. finally, a k-cliqu commun be the 
larg connect subgraph obtain by the union of a 
k-cliqu and of all k-cliqu which be connect to it. 
exampl of k-cliqu commun be show in fig. 23. 
one could say that a k-cliqu commun be identifi by 
make a k-cliqu “roll” over adjac k-cliques, where 
roll mean rotat a k-cliqu about the k−1 vertex 
it share with ani adjac k-clique. By construction, 
k-cliqu commun can share vertices, so they can be 
overlapping. there may be vertex belong to non- 
adjac k-cliques, which could be reach by differ 
path and end up in differ clusters. unfortunately, 
there be also vertex that cannot be reach by ani k- 
clique, like, e. g. vertex with degre one (“leaves”). 
In order to find k-cliqu communities, one search first 
for maxim cliques. then a clique-cliqu overlap ma- 
trix O be built (everett and borgatti, 1998), which be an 
nc × nc matrix, nc be the number of cliques; oij be 
the number of vertex share by cliqu i and j. To 
find k-cliques, one need simpli to keep the entri of O 
which be larg than or equal to k − 1, set the other 
to zero and find the connect compon of the re- 
sult matrix. detect maxim cliqu be know to 
requir a run time that grow exponenti with the 
size of the graph. however, the author found that, for 
the real network they analyzed, the procedur be quit 
fast, due to the fairli limit number of cliques, and that 
(sparse) graph with up to 105 vertex can be analyz 



59 

in a reason short time. the actual scalabl of the 
algorithm depend on mani factors, and cannot be ex- 
press in close form. An interest aspect of k-cliqu 
commun be that they allow to make a clear distinc- 
tion between random graph and graph with commun 
structure. thi be a rather delic issue: we have see in 
section vi.c that newman-girvan modular can attain 
larg valu on random graphs. derényi et al. (derényi 
et al., 2005) have studi the percol properti of 
k-cliqu on random graphs, when the edg probabl 
p varies. they found that the threshold pc(k) for the 
emerg of a giant k-cliqu community, i. e. a com- 
muniti occupi a macroscop portion of the graph, be 
pc(k) = [(k−1)n]−1/(k−1), n be the number of vertex 
of the graph, a usual. for k = 2, for which the k-cliqu 
reduc to edges, one recov the know express for 
the emerg of a giant connect compon in erdös- 
rényi graph (section a.3). thi percol transit 
be quit sharp: if the edg probabl p < pc(k), k-cliqu 
commun be rather small; if p > pc(k) there be a gi- 
ant compon and mani small communities. To ass 
the signific of the cluster found with the cpm, one 
can compar the detect cover19 with the cover found 
on a null model graph, which be random but preserv 
the expect degre sequenc of the origin graph. the 
modular of newman and girvan be base on the same 
null model (section iii.c.2). the null model of real 
graph seem to display the same two scenario found 
for erdös-rényi graphs, character by the presenc 
of veri small k-cliqu communities, with or without a 
giant cluster. therefore, cover with k-cliqu communi- 
tie of larg or appreci size can hardli be due to 
random fluctuations. palla and cowork (adamcsek 
et al., 2006) have design a softwar packag implement- 
ing the cpm, call cfinder, which be freeli avail 
(www.cfinder.org). 

the algorithm have be extend to the analysi of 
weighted, direct and bipartit graphs. for weight 
graphs, in principl one can follow the standard proce- 
dure of threshold the weights, and appli the method 
on the result graphs, treat them a unweighted. 
farka et al. (farka et al., 2007) propos instead to 
threshold the weight of cliques, defin a the geomet- 
ric mean of the weight of all edg of the clique. the 
valu of the threshold be chosen slightli abov the criti- 
cal valu at which a giant k-cliqu commun emerges, 
in order to get the richest possibl varieti of clusters. On 
direct graphs, palla et al. defin direct k-cliqu a 
complet graph with k vertices, such that there be an 
order among the vertices, and each edg go from a 
vertex with high order to one with low order. the or- 
dere be determin from the restrict outdegre of the 
vertex, express the fraction of outgo edg point- 

19 We remind that cover be the equival of partit for overlap- 
ping communities. 

ing to the other vertex of the cliqu versu the total 
outdegree. the method have be extend to bipartit 
graph by lehmann et al. (lehmann et al., 2008). In thi 
case one us bipartit cliques, or bicliques: a subgraph 
ka,b be a bicliqu if each of a vertex of one class be 
connect with each of b vertex of the other class. two 
cliqu ka,b be adjac if they share a cliqu ka−1,b−1, 
and a ka,b cliqu commun be the union of all ka,b 
cliqu that can be reach from each other through a 
path of adjac ka,b cliques. find all Nc bicliqu 
of a graph be an np-complet problem (peeters, 2003), 
mostli becaus the number of bicliqu tend to grow 
exponenti with the size of the graph. the algorithm 
design by lehmann et al. to find bicliqu commun 
be similar to the origin cpm, and have a total complex- 
iti of o(n2c ). On spars graphs, Nc often grow linearli 
with the number of edg m, yield a time complex 
o(m2). bicliqu be also the main ingredi of bitec- 
tor, a recent algorithm to detect commun structur in 
bipartit graph (du et al., 2008). 

kumpula et al. have develop a fast implementa- 
tion of the cpm, call sequenti cliqu percol 
algorithm (scp) (kumpula et al., 2008). It consist in 
detect k-cliqu commun by sequenti insert 
the edg of the graph at study, one by one, start 
from an initi empti graph. whenev a new edg be 
added, one check whether new k-cliqu be formed, by 
search for (k− 2)-cliqu in the subset of neighbor 
vertex of the endpoint of the insert edge. the pro- 
cedur requir to build a graph γ∗, in which the vertex 
be (k−1)-cliqu and edg be set between vertex cor- 
respond to (k− 1)-cliqu which be subgraph of the 
same k-clique. At the end of the process, the connect 
compon of Γ∗ correspond to the search k-cliqu 
communities. the techniqu have a time complex which 
be linear in the number of k-cliqu of the graph, so it can 
vari a lot in practic applications. nevertheless, it turn 
out to be much faster than the origin implement 
of the cpm. the big advantag of the scp, however, 
consist of it implement for weight graphs. By 
insert edg in decreas order of weight, one recov- 
er in a singl run the commun structur of the graph 
for all possibl weight thresholds, by store everi cover 
detect after the addit of each edge. the standard 
cpm, instead, need to be appli onc for each thresh- 
old. if, instead of edg weight thresholding, one perform 
k-cliqu weight thresholding, a prescrib by farka et 
al. (farka et al., 2007), the scp remain much faster 
than the cpm, if one appli a simpl modif to 
it, consist in detect and store all k-cliqu on the 
full graph, sort them base on their weights, and find- 
ing the commun by sequenti add the k-cliqu 
in decreas order of weight. 

the cpm have the same limit a the algorithm of radic- 
chi et al. (radicchi et al., 2004) (section v.b): it assum 
that the graph have a larg number of cliques, so it may 
fail to give meaning cover for graph with just a few 
cliques, like technolog network and some social net- 



60 

works. On the other hand, if there be mani cliques, the 
method may deliv trivial commun structure, like a 
cover consist of the whole graph a a singl cluster. 
A more fundament issu be the fact that the method 
do not look for actual communities, consist with 
the share notion of dens subgraphs, but for subgraph 
“containing” mani cliques, which may be quit differ- 
ent object than commun (for instance, they could 
be “chains” of cliqu with low intern edg density). 
anoth big problem be that on real network there be a 
consider fraction of vertex that be left out of the 
communities, like leaves. one could think of some post- 
process procedur to includ them in the communities, 
but for that it be necessari to introduc a new criterion, 
outsid the framework that inspir the method. fur- 
thermor it be not clear a priori which valu of k one have 
to choos to identifi meaning structures. finally, the 
criterion to choos the threshold for weight graph and 
the definit of direct k-cliqu be rather arbitrary. 

B. other techniqu 

one of the first method to find overlap commu- 
niti be design by baum et al. (baum et al., 
2005b). A commun be defin a a subgraph which 
local optim a give function W , typic some mea- 
sure relat to the edg densiti of the cluster20. differ 
overlap subset may all be local optimal, so vertex 
can be share between communities. detect the clus- 
ter structur of a graph amount to find the set of 
all local optim clusters. two effici heurist be 
proposed, call iter scan (is) and rank remov 
(rare). IS perform a greedi optim of the func- 
tion W . one start from a random seed vertex/edg and 
adds/delet vertex one by one a long a W increases. 
then anoth seed be randomli pick and the procedur 
be repeated. the algorithm stop when, by pick ani 
seed, one recov a previous identifi cluster. rare 
consist in remov import vertex such to discon- 
nect the graph in small compon repres the 
core of the clusters. the import of vertex be deter- 
mine by their central score (e.g. degree, between 
central (freeman, 1977)), pagerank (brin and page, 
1998)). vertic be remov until one fragment the 
graph into compon of a give size. after that, the 
remov vertex be add again to the graph, and be 
associ to those cluster for which do so increas 
the valu of the function W . the complex of IS and 
rare be o(n2) on spars graphs. the best perform be 
achiev by use IS to refin result obtain from rare. 
In a success paper (baum et al., 2005a), baum et 
al. further improv such two-step procedure, in that the 

20 commun definit base on local optim be adopt 
in other algorithm a well, like that by lancichinetti et al. (lan- 
cichinetti et al., 2009) (section xii.a). 

remov vertex in rare be reinsert in decreas or- 
der of their central scores, and the optim of W 
in IS be onli extend to neighbor vertex of the run- 
ning cluster. the new recip maintain time complex 
o(n2), but on spars graph it requir a time low by 
an order of magnitud than the old one, while the qualiti 
of the detect cluster be comparable. 

A differ method, combin spectral mapping, fuzzi 
cluster and the optim of a qualiti function, have 
be present by zhang et al. (zhang et al., 2007). the 
membership of vertex i in cluster k be express by uik, 
which be a number between 0 and 1. the sum of the 
uik over all commun k of a cover be 1, for everi ver- 
tex. thi normal be suggest by the fact that 
the entri uik can be thought of a the probabl that 
i belong to commun k, so the sum of the uik rep- 
resent the probabl that the vertex belong to ani 
commun of the cover, which be necessarili 1. If there 
be no overlaps, uik = δkik, where ki repres the 
uniqu commun of vertex i. the algorithm consist of 
three phases: 1) emb vertex in euclidean space; 
2) group the correspond vertex point in a give 
number nc of clusters; 3) maxim a modular func- 
tion over the set of cover found in step 2), correspond 
to differ valu of nc. thi scheme have be use in 
other techniqu a well, like in the algorithm of donetti 
and muñoz (donetti and muñoz, 2004) (section vii). 
the first step build upon a spectral techniqu intro- 
duce by white and smyth (white and smyth, 2005), 
that we have discuss in section vi.a.4. graph vertex 
be emb in a d-dimension euclidean space by us- 
ing the top d eigenvector of the right stochast matrix 
W (section a.2), deriv from the adjac matrix A 
by divid each element by the sum of the element of 
the same row. the spatial coordin of vertex i be 
the i-th compon of the eigenvectors. In the second 
step, the vertex point be associ to nc cluster by us- 
ing fuzzi k-mean cluster (bezdek, 1981; dunn, 1974) 
(section iv.c). the number of cluster nc vari from 
2 to a maximum K, so one obtain K − 1 covers. the 
best cover be the one that yield the larg valu of the 
modular qzhov , defin a

the contribut of the edges’ weight to the sum in Wc 
and Sc by the (average) membership coeffici of the 
vertex of the edge. the determin of the eigenvec- 
tor be the most comput expens part of the 
method, so the time complex be the same a that of 
the algorithm by white and smyth (see section vi.a.4), 
i. e. o(k2n+km), which be essenti linear in n if the 
graph be spars and K � n. 

nepusz et al. propos a differ approach base 
on vertex similar (nepusz et al., 2008). one start 
from the membership matrix U, defin a in the pre- 
viou method by zhang et al. from U a matrix S be 
built, where sij = 

∑nc 
k=1 uikujk, express the similar- 

iti between vertex (nc be the number of clusters). If 
one assum to have inform about the actual vertex 
similarity, correspond to the matrix s̃, the best cover 
be obtain by choos U such that S approxim a 
close a possibl s̃. thi amount to minim the func- 
tion

wij(s̃ij − sij)2, (74) 

where the wij weigh the import of the approxim 
for each entri of the similar matrices. In the absenc 
of ani inform on the commun structur of the 
graph, one set wij = 1, ∀i, j (equal weights) and S̃ equal 
to the adjac matrix A, by implicitli assum that 
vertex be similar if they be neighbors, dissimilar oth- 
erwise. On weight graphs, one can set the wij equal to 
the edg weights. minim dg(u) be a nonlinear con- 
strain optim problem, that can be solv with 
a gradient-bas iter optim method, like sim- 
ulat annealing. the optim procedur adopt 
by nepusz et al., for a fix number of cluster nc, have 
a time complex o(n2nch), where h be the number of 
iter lead to convergence, so the method can onli 
be appli to fairli small graphs. If nc be unknown, a it 
usual happens, the best cover be the one correspond 
to the larg valu of the modular

eq. 75 be veri similar to the express of newman- 
girvan modular (eq. 13): the differ be that the 
kronecker’ δ be replac by the vertices’ similarity, to ac- 
count for overlap communities. onc the best cover 
be identified, one can use the entri of the partit ma- 
trix U to evalu the particip of each vertex in the 
nc cluster of the cover. nepusz et al. defin the brid- 
gene bi of a vertex i a

If i belong to a singl cluster, bi = 0. if, for a vertex

central vertices, one can identifi them by check 
for larg valu of the centrality-correct bridgeness, 
obtain by multipli the bridg of eq. 76 by 
the central of the vertex (express by, e.g., degree, 
between (freeman, 1977), etc.). A variant of the

In real network it be often easi to discrimin be- 
tween interclust and intraclust edg than recogniz- 
ing overlap vertices. for instance, in social networks, 
even though mani peopl may belong to more groups, 
their social tie within each group can be easili spotted. 
besides, it may happen that commun be join to 
each other through their overlap vertex (fig. 24), 
without interclust edges. for these reasons, it have be 
recent suggest that defin cluster a set of edges, 
rather than vertices, may be a promis strategi to an- 
alyz graph with overlap commun (ahn et al., 
2009; evan and lambiotte, 2009). one have to focu 
on the line graph (balakrishnan, 1997), i. e. the graph 
whose vertex be the edg of the origin graph; ver- 
tice of the line graph be link if the correspond 
edg in the origin graph be adjacent, i. e. if they 
share one of their endvertices. partit the line graph 
mean group the edg of the start graph21. evan 
and lambiott (evan and lambiotte, 2009) introduc 
a set of qualiti functions, similar to newman-girvan 
modular (eq. 13), express the stabil of parti- 
tion against random walk take place on the graph, 
follow the work of delvenn et al. (delvenn et al., 
2008) [section viii.b]. they consid a project of 
the tradit random walk on the line graph, along with 
two other diffus processes, where walker move be- 
tween adjac edg (rather than between neighbor 
vertices). evan and lambiott optim the three cor- 
respond modular function to look for partit in 
two real networks, zachary’ karat club (zachary, 1977) 
(section xv.a) and the network of word associ de- 
rive from the univers of south florida free associa- 
tion norm (nelson et al., 1998) (section ii). the opti- 
mizat be carri out with the hierarch techniqu 
by blondel et al. (blondel et al., 2008) and the multi-level 
algorithm by noack and rotta (noack and rotta, 2009). 
while the result for the word associ network be 
reasonable, the test on the karat club yield partit 
in more than two clusters. however, the modular 
use by evan et lambiott can be modifi to includ 
longer random walk (just like in ref. (delvenn et al., 

21 ideal one want to put togeth onli the edg lie within 
clusters, and exclud the others. therefor partit do not 
necessarili mean assign each vertex of the line graph to a 
group, a standard cluster techniqu would do.

2008)), and the length of the walk repres a resolu- 
tion paramet that can be tune to get good results. 
ahn et al. (ahn et al., 2009) propos to group edg 
with an agglom hierarch cluster technique, 
call hierarch link cluster (section iv.b). they 
use a similar measur for a pair of (adjacent) edg 
that express the size of the overlap between the neigh- 
borhood of the non-coincid endvertices, divid by 
the total number of (different) neighbor of such end- 
vertices. group of edg be merg pairwis in de- 
scend order of similarity, until all edg be togeth in 
the same cluster. the result dendrogram provid the 
most complet inform on the commun structur 
of the graph. however, a usual, most of thi informa- 
tion be redund and be an artefact of the procedur it- 
self. so, ahn et al. introduc a qualiti function to select 
the most meaning partition(s), call partit density, 
which be essenti the averag edg densiti within the 
clusters. the method be abl to find meaning cluster 
in biolog networks, like protein-protein and metabol 
networks, a well a in a social network of mobil phone 
communications. It can also be extend to multipartit 
and weight graphs. 

the idea of group edg be sure interesting. how- 
ever it be not a priori good than group vertices. 
In fact, the two situat be somewhat symmetric. 
edg connect vertex of differ cluster be “over- 
lapping”, but they will be assign just to one cluster (or 
els the cluster would be merged). 

the possibl of have overlap commun 
make most standard cluster method inadequate, and 
enforc the design of new ad hoc techniques, like the 
one we have describ so far. On the other hand, if 
it be possibl to identifi the overlap vertex and 
“separate” them among the cluster they belong to, the 

overlap would be remov and one could then appli 
ani of the tradit cluster method to the result- 
ing graph. thi idea be at the basi of a recent method 
propos by gregori (gregory, 2009). It be a three- 
stage procedure: first, one transform the graph into 
a larg graph without overlap vertices; second, a 
cluster techniqu be appli to the result graph; 
third, one map the partit obtain into a cover by 
replac the vertex with those of the origin graph. 
the transform step, call peacock, be perform 
by identifi the vertex with high split between 
(section v.a) and split them in multipl parts, con- 
nect by edges. thi be do a long a the split be- 
tween of the vertex be suffici high, which be 
determin by a paramet s. In thi way, most ver- 
tice of the result graph be exactli the same one have 
initially, the other be multipl copi of the overlap- 
ping vertex of the initi graph. the overlap of the 
final cover be obtain by check if copi of the same 
initi vertex end up in differ disjoint clusters. the 
complex be domin by the peacock algorithm, if 
one comput the exact valu of the split between 
for the vertices, which requir a time o(n3) on a spars 
graph22. gregori propos an approxim local compu- 
tation, which scale a o(n log n): in thi way the total 
complex of the method becom competitive, if one 
choos a fast algorithm for the identif of the clus- 
ters. the good of the result depend on the specif 
method one us to find the cluster after the graph trans- 
formation. the softwar of the version of the method 
use by gregori in hi applic can be found at 
http://www.cs.bris.ac.uk/∼steve/networks/peaco 
ckpaper/. the idea of gregori be interesting, a it al- 
low to exploit tradit method even in the presenc 
of overlap communities. the choic of the paramet 
s, which determin whether a vertex be overlap or 
not, do not seem to affect significantli the results, a 
long a s be take suffici small. 

xii. multiresolut method and cluster 
hierarchi 

the exist of a resolut limit for newman-girvan 
modular (section vi.c) impli that the straight opti- 
mizat of qualiti function yield a coars descript 
of the cluster structur of the graph, at a scale which 
have a priori noth to do with the actual scale of the 
clusters. In the absenc of inform on the cluster 
size of the graph, a method should be abl to explor 
all possibl scales, to make sure that it will eventu 
identifi the right communities. multiresolut method 

22 the split between need to be recalcul after each vertex 
split, just a one do for the edg between in the girvan- 
newman algorithm (girvan and newman, 2002). therefor both 
comput have the same complexity. 



63 

be base on thi principle. however, mani real graph 
display hierarch cluster structures, with cluster in- 
side other cluster (simon, 1962). In these cases, there 
be more level of organ of vertex in clusters, and 
more relev scales. In principle, cluster algorithm 
should be abl to identifi them. multiresolut meth- 
od can do the trick, in principle, a they scan continu- 
ousli the rang of possibl cluster scales. recent other 
method have be developed, where partit be by 
construct hierarch nest in each other. In thi 
section we discu both class of techniques. 

A. multiresolut method 

In general, multiresolut method have a freeli tun- 
abl parameter, that allow to set the characterist size 
of the cluster to be detected. the gener spin glass 
framework by reichardt and bornholdt ((reichardt and 
bornholdt, 2006a) and section vi.b) be a typic exam- 
ple, where γ be the resolut parameter. the extens 
of the method to weight graph have be recent dis- 
cuss (heimo et al., 2008). 

pon have propos a method (pons, 2006) consist of 
the optim of multiscal qualiti functions, includ- 
ing the multiscal modular 

qmα = 

nc∑ 
c=1 

[ 
α 
lc

− (1− α)

)2 ] 
, (77) 

and two other addit qualiti functions, deriv from 
the perform (eq. 12) and a measur base on the 
similar of vertex pairs. In eq. 77 0 ≤ α ≤ 1 be the 
resolut paramet and the notat be otherwis the 
same a in eq. 14. We see that, for α = 1/2, one recov- 
er standard modularity. however, sinc multipl 
factor in qmα do not chang the result of the optimiza- 
tion, we can divid qmα by α, recov the same qual- 
iti function a in eq. 46, with γ = (1 − α)/α, up to an 
irrelev multipl constant. To evalu the rele- 
vanc of the partitions, for ani give multiscal qualiti 
function, pon suggest that the length of the α-rang 
[αmin(c), αmax(c)], for which a commun C “lives” in 
the maximum modular partition, be a good indic 
of the stabil of the community. He then defin the 
relev function of a commun C at scale α a 

rα(c) = 
αmax(c)− αmin(c) 

2 

+ 
2(αmax(c)− α)(α− αmin(c)) 

αmax(c)− αmin(c) 
. (78) 

the relev r(α) of a partit P at scale α be the 
averag of the relev of the cluster of the partition, 
weight by the cluster sizes. peak in α of r(α) reveal 
the most meaning partitions. 

anoth interest techniqu have be devis by are- 
na et al. (arena et al., 2008b), and consist of a mod- 
ific of the origin express of modularity. the

of the resolut paramet r. the long plateau (i) indi- 
cate the most stabl partition, which exactli match the so- 
cial fission observ by zachary. the partit obtain with 
straight modular optim (r = 0) consist of four clus- 
ter and be much less stabl with respect to (i), a suggest 
by the much shorter length of it plateau. reprint figur 
with permiss from ref. (arena et al., 2008b). c©2008 by

idea be to make vertex contribut a well to the com- 
putat of the edg densiti of the clusters, by add 
a self-loop of strength r to each vertex. arena et al. 
remark that the paramet r do not affect the struc- 
tural properti of the graph in most cases, which be 
usual determin by an adjac matrix without di- 
agon elements. with the introduct of the vertex 
strength r, modular read

for the gener case of a weight graph. the notat 
be the same a in eq. 36, Nc be the number of vertex 
in cluster c. We see that now the rel import of 
the two term in each summand depend on r, which can 
take ani valu in ] − 2w/n,∞[. arena et al. make a 
sweep in the rang of r, and determin for each r the 
maximum modular with extrem optim (sec- 
tion vi.a.3) and tabu search23 (glover, 1986). mean- 
ing cluster structur correspond to plateau in the 

23 tabu search consist in move singl vertex from one com- 
muniti to another, chosen at random, or to new communities, 
start from some initi partition. after a sweep over all ver- 
tices, the best move, i. e. the one produc the larg increas 
of modularity, be accept and applied, yield a new partition. 
the procedur be repeat until modular do not increas 
further. To escap local optima, a list of recent accept move

plot of the number of cluster versu r (fig. 25). the 
length of a plateau give a measur of the stabil of the 
partit against the variat of r. the procedur be 
abl to disclos the commun structur of a number of 
real benchmark graphs. As expected, the most relev 
partit can be found in interv of r not includ 
the valu r = 0, which correspond to the case of stan- 
dard modular (fig. 25). A drawback of the method be 
that it be veri slow, a one have to comput the modular- 
iti maximum for mani valu of r in order to discrim- 
inat between relev and irrelev partitions. If the 
modular maximum be comput with precis method 
like simul anneal and/or extrem optimization, 
a in ref. (arena et al., 2008b), onli graph with a few 
hundr vertex can be analyz on a singl processor. 
On the other hand the algorithm can be trivial paral- 
leliz by run the optim for differ valu 
of r on differ processors. thi be a common featur 
of all multiresolut method discuss in thi section. 
In spite of the differ formal express of modularity, 
the method by arena et al. and reichardt and born- 
holdt be somewhat relat to each other and yield sim- 
ilar result (kumpula et al., 2007a) on zachary’ karat 
club (zachary, 1977) (section xv.a), synthet graph á 
la ravasz-barabási (ravasz and barabási, 2003) and on 
a model graph with the properti of real weight social 
networks24. In fact, their modular can be both re- 
cover from the continuous-tim version of the stabil 
of cluster under random walk, introduc by delvenn 
et al. (delvenn et al., 2008) (section viii.b). 

lancichinetti et al. have design a multiresolut 
method which be capabl of detect both the hier- 
archic structur of graph and overlap commu- 
niti (lancichinetti et al., 2009). It be base on the 
optim of a fit function, which estim the 
strength of a cluster and entail a resolut paramet 
α. the function could in principl be arbitrary, in their 
applic the author chose a simpl ansatz base on 
the tradeoff between the intern and the total degre of 
the cluster. the optim procedur start from a 
cluster with a singl vertex, arbitrarili selected. given a 
cluster core, one keep add and remov neighbor 
vertex of the cluster a long a it fit increases. the 
fit be recalcul after each addition/remov of a 
vertex. At some point one reach a local maximum and 
the cluster be “closed”. then, anoth vertex be chosen 
at random, among those not yet assign to a cluster, 
a new cluster be built, and so on, until all vertex have 

be kept and updated, so that those move be not accept in 
the next updat of the configur (tabu list). the cost of 
the procedur be about the same of other stochast optim 
techniqu like, e. g., simul annealing. 

24 relat do not mean equivalent, though. arena et al. have 
show that their method be good than that by reichardt and 
bornholdt when the graph at hand includ commun of dif- 
ferent size (arena et al., 2008b). 

be assign to clusters. dure the buildup of a clus- 
ter, vertex alreadi assign to other cluster may be 
included, i. e. commun may overlap. the computa- 
tional complex of the algorithm, estim on spars 
erdös-rényi random graphs, be o(nβ), with β ∼ 2 for 
small valu of the resolut paramet α, and β ∼ 1 if 
α be large. for a complet analysis, the worst-cas compu- 
tation complex be o(n2 log n), where the factor log n 
come from the minimum number of differ α-valu 
which be need to resolv the actual commun struc- 
ture of the graph. relev partit be reveal by 
pronounc spike in the histogram of the fit valu 
of cover obtain for differ α-values, where the fit 
of a cover be defin a the averag fit of it clusters. 

A techniqu base on the pott model, similar to that 
of reichardt and bornholdt (reichardt and bornholdt, 
2006a), have be suggest by ronhovd and nussi- 
nov (ronhovd and nussinov, 2008). the energi of their 
spin model be 

h({σ}) = −1 
2 

∑ 
i6=j 

[aij − γ(1−aij)]δ(σi, σj). (80) 

the big differ with eq. 46 be the absenc of a null 
model term. the model consid pair of vertex in the 
same community: edg between vertex be energeti- 
calli rewarded, wherea miss edg be penalized. the 
paramet γ fix the tradeoff between the two contribu- 
tions. the energi be minim by sequenti shift 
singl vertices/spin to the commun which yield the 
larg decreas of the system’ energy, until convergence. 
if, for each vertex, one just examin the commun of 
it neighbors, the energi be minim in a time o(mβ), 
where β turn out to be slightli abov 1 in most appli- 
cations, allow for the analysi of larg graphs. thi 
essenti elimin the problem of limit resolution, 
a the criterion to decid about the merger or the split 
of cluster onli depend on local parameters. still, for 
the detect of possibl hierarch level tune γ be 
mandatory. In a success paper (ronhovd and nussi- 
nov, 2009), the author have introduc a new stabil 
criterion for the partitions, consist of the computa- 
tion of the similar of partit obtain for the same 
γ and differ initi conditions. the idea be that, if 
a partit be robust in a give rang of γ-values, most 
replica deliv by the algorithm will be veri similar. 
On the other hand, if one explor a region of resolut 
in between two strong partitions, the algorithm will de- 
liver the one or the other partit and the individu 
replica will be, on average, not so similar to each other. 
so, by plot the similar a a function of the reso- 
lution paramet γ, stabl commun be reveal by 
peaks. ronhovd and nussinov adopt similar mea- 
sure borrow from inform theori (section xv.b). 
their criterion of stabil can be adopt to determin 
the relev of partit obtain with ani multireso- 
lution algorithm. 

A gener problem of multiresolut method be how 
to ass the stabil of partit for larg graphs. the 



65 

rapidli increas number of partitions, obtain by min- 
imal shift of vertex between clusters, introduc a larg 
amount of noise, that blur signatur of stabl partit 
like plateaus, spikes, etc. that one can observ in small 
systems. In thi respect, it seem far more reliabl focus- 
ing on correl between partit (like the averag 
similar use by ronhovd and nussinov (ronhovd 
and nussinov, 2008; ronhovd and nussinov, 2009)) than 
on properti of the individu partit (like the mea- 
sure of occurr use by arena et al. (arena et al., 
2008b) and by lancichinetti et al. (lancichinetti et al., 
2009)). 

B. hierarch method 

the natur procedur to detect the hierarch struc- 
ture of a graph be hierarch clustering, that we have 
discuss in section iv.b. there we have emphas 
the main weak of the procedure, which consist of 
the necess to introduc a criterion to identifi relev 
partit (hierarch levels) out of the full dendrogram 
produc by the give algorithm. furthermore, there be 
no guarante that the result inde reflect the actual hi- 
erarch structur of the graph, and that they be not 
mere artefact of the algorithm itself. scholar have just 
start to deal with these problems. 

sales-pardo et al. have propos a top-down ap- 
proach (sales-pardo et al., 2007). their method con- 
sist of two steps: 1) measur the similar between 
vertices; 2) deriv the hierarch structur of the 
graph from the similar matrix. the similar mea- 
sure, name node affinity, be base on newman-girvan 
modularity. basic the affin between two vertex 
be the frequenc with which they coexist in the same 
commun in partit correspond to local optimum 
of modularity. the latter be configur for which 
modular be stable, i. e. it cannot increas if one shift 
one vertex from one cluster to anoth or by merg or 
split clusters. the set of these partit be call 
pmax. befor proceed with the next step, one verifi 
whether the graph have a signific commun structur 
or not. thi be do by calcul the z-score (eq. 51) 
for the averag modular of the partit in pmax with 
respect to the averag modular of partit with lo- 
cal modular optimum of the equival ensembl of null 
model graphs, obtain a usual by randomli rewir 
the edg of the origin graph under the condit that 
the expect degre sequenc be the same a the degre 
sequenc of the graph. larg z-score indic meaning- 
ful cluster structure: sales-pardo et al. use a threshold 
correspond to the 1% signific level25. If the graph 

25 We remind that the signific of the z-score have to be com- 
put with respect to the actual distribut of the maximum 
modular for the null model graphs, a the latter be not gaus- 
sian (section vi.c). 

have a relev cluster structure, one proce with the 
second step, which consist in put the affin matrix 
in a form a close a possibl to block-diagonal, by min- 
imiz a cost function express the averag distanc 
of connect vertex from the diagonal. the block cor- 
respond to the commun and the recov partit 
repres the uppermost organ level. To deter- 
mine low levels, one iter the procedur for each 
subgraph identifi at the previou level, which be treat 
a an independ graph. the procedur stop when all 
block found do not have a relev cluster structure, i. e. 
their z-score be low than the threshold. the parti- 
tion deliv by the method be hierarch by con- 
struction, a commun at each level be nest within 
commun at high levels. however, the method may 
find no relev partit (no commun structure), a 
singl partit (commun structur but no hierarchy) 
or more (hierarchy) and in thi respect it be good than 
most exist methods. the algorithm be not fast, a both 
the search of local optimum for modular and the rear- 
rangement of the similar matrix be perform with 
simul annealing26, but deliv good result for com- 
puter gener networks, and meaning partit for 
some real networks, like the world airport network (bar- 
rat et al., 2004), an email exchang network of a catalan 
univers (guimerà et al., 2003), a network of electron 
circuit (itzkovitz et al., 2005) and metabol network 
of E. coli (guimerà et al., 2007). 

clauset et al. (clauset et al., 2007; clauset et al., 2008) 
describ the hierarch organ of a graph by in- 
troduc a class of hierarch random graphs. A hi- 
erarch random graph be defin by a dendrogram D, 
which be the natur represent of the hierarchy, and 
by a set of probabl {pr} associ to the n−1 inter- 
nal node of the dendrogram. An ancestor of a vertex i be 
ani intern node of the dendrogram that be encount 
by start from the “leaf” vertex i and go all the way 
up to the top of the dendrogram. the probabl that 
vertex i and j be link to each other be give by the 
probabl pr of the low common ancestor of i and 
j. clauset et al. search for the model (d, {pr}) that 
best fit the observ graph topology, by use bayesian 
infer (section ix.a). the probabl that the model 
fit the graph be proport to the likelihood 

l(d, {pr}) = 
∏ 
r∈d 

perr (1− pr)lrrr−er . (81) 

here, Er be the number of edg connect vertex whose 
low common ancestor be r, Lr and Rr be the number 
of graph vertex in the left and right subtre descend- 
ing from the dendrogram node r, and the product run 

26 the reorder of the matrix be by far the most time-consum 
part of the method. the situat improv if one adopt faster 
optim strategi than simul annealing, at the cost of 
less accur results.

over all intern dendrogram nodes. for a give dendro- 
gram D, the maximum likelihood l(d) correspond to 
the set of probabl {p̄r}, where p̄r equal the actual 
densiti of edg er/(lrrr) between the two subtre of 
r (fig. 26). one can defin the statist ensembl of 
hierarch random graph describ a give graph G, 
by assign to each model graph (d, {p̄r}) a probabl 
proport to the maximum likelihood l(d). the en- 
sembl can be sampl by a markov chain mont carlo 
method (newman and barkema, 1999). the procedur 
suggest by clauset et al. seem to converg to equilib- 
rium roughli in a time o(n2), although the actual com- 
plexiti may be much higher. still, the author be abl 
to investig graph with a few thousand vertices. from 
suffici larg set of model configur sampl at 
equilibrium, one can comput averag properti of the 
model, e. g. degre distributions, cluster coefficients. 
etc., and compar them with the correspond proper- 
tie of the origin graph. test on real graph reveal that 
the model be inde capabl to describ close the graph 
properties. furthermore, the model enabl one to pre- 
dict miss connect between vertex of the origin 
graph. thi be a veri import problem (liben-nowel 
and kleinberg, 2003): edg of real graph be the result 
of observations/experiments, that may fail to discov 
some relationship between the unit of the system. from 
the ensembl of the hierarch random graph one can 
deriv the averag link probabl between all pair 
of graph vertices. By rank the probabl corre- 
spond to vertex pair which be disconnect in the 
origin graph, one may expect that the pair with high-

be compat with a give graph topology. In the case 
of commun structure, it be not clear which informa- 
tion one can extract from averag over the ensembl of 
hierarch random graphs. moreover, sinc the hierar- 
chical structur be repres by a dendrogram, it be im- 
possibl to rank partit accord to their relevance. 
In fact, the work by clauset et al. question the con- 
cept of “relev partition”, and open a debat in the 
scientif commun about the mean itself of graph 
clustering. the softwar of the method can be found at

xiii. detect OF dynam commun 

the analysi of dynam commun be still in it in- 
fancy. studi in thi direct have be mostli hin- 
dere by the fact that the problem of graph cluster 
be alreadi controversi on singl graph realizations, so 
it be understand that most effort still concentr 
on the “static” version of the problem. anoth diffi- 
culti be repres by the dearth of timestamp data 
on real graphs. recently, sever data set have becom 
available, enabl to monitor the evolut in time of 
real system (kumar et al., 2003, 2006; leskovec et al., 
2008, 2005). So it have becom possibl to investig how 
commun form, evolv and die. the main phenomenon 
occur in the lifetim of a commun be (fig. 27): 
birth, growth, contraction, merger with other communi- 
ties, split, death. 

the first studi be carri out by hopcroft et 
al. (hopcroft et al., 2004), who analyz sever snap- 
shot of the citat graph induc by the nec cites 
databas (gile et al., 1998). the snapshot cover the 
period from 1990 to 2001. commun be detect 
by mean of (agglomerative) hierarch cluster (sec- 
tion iv.b), where the similar between vertex be the 



67 

cosin similar of the vector describ the correspond- 
ing papers, a well know measur use in inform 
retriev (baeza-y and ribeiro-neto, 1999). In each 
snapshot hopcroft et al. identifi the natur communi- 
ties, defin a those commun of the hierarch tree 
that be onli slightli affect by minor perturb of 
the graph, where the perturb consist in remov 
a small fraction of the vertex (and their edges). such 
natur commun be conceptu similar to the sta- 
ble commun we will see in section xiv. hopcroft et 
al. found the best match natur commun across 
differ snapshots, and in thi way they could follow the 
histori of communities. In particular they could see the 
emerg of new communities, correspond to new re- 
search topics. the main drawback of the method come 
from the use of hierarch clustering, which be unabl 
to sort out meaning commun out of the hierarchi- 
cal tree, which includ mani differ partit of the 
graph. 

more recently, palla et al. perform a systemat 
analysi of dynam commun (palla et al., 2007). 
they studi two social systems: 1) a graph of phone 
call between custom of a mobil phone compani in 
a year’ time; 2) a collabor network between scien- 
tists, describ the coauthorship of paper in condens 
matter physic from the electron e-print archiv (cond- 
mat) maintain by cornel univers library, span 
a period of 142 months. the first problem be identifi 
the imag of a commun c(t+1) at time t+1 among the 
commun of the graph at time t. A simpl criterion, 
use in other works, be to measur the rel overlap 
(eq. 97) of c(t + 1) with all commun at time t, and 
pick the commun which have the larg overlap with 
c(t+ 1). thi be intuitive, but in mani case it may miss 
the actual evolut of the community. for instance, if 
c(t) at time t + 1 grow consider and overlap with 
anoth commun b(t+ 1) (which at the previou time 
step be disjoint from c(t)), the rel overlap between 
c(t+ 1) and b(t) may be larg than the rel overlap 
between c(t + 1) and c(t). It be not clear whether there 
be a gener prescript to avoid thi problem. palla et 
al. solv it by exploit the featur of the cliqu per- 
colat method (cpm) (section xi.a), that they use 
to detect communities. the idea be to analyz the graph 
g(t, t + 1), obtain by merg the two snapshot g(t) 
and g(t+1) of the evolv graph, at time t and t+1 (i. 
e., by put togeth all their vertex and edges). ani 
cpm commun of g(t) and g(t + 1) do not get lost, 
a it be includ within one of the cpm commun of 
g(t, t + 1). for each cpm commun Vk of g(t, t + 1), 
one find the cpm commun {ctk} and {C 

t+1 
k } (of g(t) 

and g(t+1), respectively) which be contain in vk. the 
imag of ani commun in {ct+1k } at time t be the com- 
muniti of {ctk} that have the larg rel overlap with 
it. 

the age τ of a commun be the time sinc it birth. 
It turn out that the age of a commun be posit 
correl with it size s(τ), i. e. that old commun 

be also larg (on average). the time evolut of a 
commun C can be describ by mean of the rel 
overlap c(t) between state of the commun separ 
by a time t: 

c(t) = 
|c(t0) 

⋂ 
c(t0 + t)| 

|c(t0) 
⋃ 
c(t0 + t)| 

. (82) 

one find that, in both data sets, c(t) decay faster for 
larg communities, so the composit of larg commu- 
niti be rather variabl in time, whether small commu- 
niti be essenti static. anoth import question 
be whether it be possibl to predict the evolut of com- 
muniti from inform on their structur or on their 
vertices. In fig. 28a the probabl pl that a vertex will 
leav the commun in the next step of the evolut be 
plot a a function of the rel extern strength of 
the vertex, indic how much of the vertex strength 
lie on edg connect it to vertex outsid it com- 
munity. the plot indic that there be a clear posit 
correlation: vertex which be onli loos connect to 
vertex of their commun have a high chanc (on av- 
erage) to leav the commun than vertex which be 
more “committed” toward the other commun mem- 
bers. the same principl hold at the commun level 
too. fig. 28b show that the probabl pd that a com- 
muniti will disintegr in the next time step be posi- 
tive correl with the rel extern strength of 
the community. finally, palla et al. have found that the 
probabl for two commun to merg increas with 
the commun size much more than what one expect 
from the size distribution, which be consist with the 
faster dynam observ for larg communities. palla et 
al. analyz two differ real systems, a network of mo- 
bile phone commun and a coauthorship network, 
to be abl to infer gener properti of commun evo- 
lution. however, commun be onli found with the 
cpm, so their result need to be cross-check by em- 
ploy other cluster techniques. 

asur et al. (asur et al., 2007) explor the dynam 
relationship between vertex and communities. commu- 
niti be found with the mcl method by van don- 
gen (dongen, 2000a) (section viii.b), by analyz the 
graph at differ timestamps. asur et al. distinguish 
event involv commun and event involv the 
vertices. event involv commun be continu (the 
commun keep most of it vertex in consecut time 
steps), κ-merg (two cluster merg into another), κ-split 
(two cluster split in two parts), form (no pair of vertex 
of the cluster at time t + 1 be in the same cluster at 
time t) and dissolv (opposit of form). event involv- 
ing vertex be appear (if a vertex join the graph for the 
first time), disappear (if a vertex of the graph at time t 
be no longer there at time t + 1), join (if a vertex of a 
cluster at time t + 1 be not in that cluster at time t) 
and leav (if a vertex which be in a cluster at time t be 
not in that cluster at time t+ 1). base on such events, 
four measur be defin in order to catch the behav- 
ioral tendenc of vertex contribut to the evolut

of the graph: the stabil index (measur the tendenc 
of a vertex to interact with the same vertex over time), 
the sociabl index (measur the number of differ 
interact of a vertex, basic the number of join and 
leav events), the popular index (measur the num- 
ber of vertex attract by a cluster in a give time in- 
terval) and the influenc index (measur the influenc 
a vertex have on the others, which be comput from the 
number of vertex that leav or join a cluster togeth 
with the vertex). applic on a coauthorship network 
of comput scientist and on a network of subject for 
clinic trial show that the behavior measur abov 
enabl one to make reliabl predict about the time 
evolut of such graph (including, e. g., the infer 
of miss link (liben-nowel and kleinberg, 2003)). 

dynam commun can be a well detect with 
method of inform compression, such a some of 
those we have see in section ix.b. sun et al. (sun 

et al., 2007) appli the minimum descript length 
(mdl) principl (grünwald et al., 2005; rissanen, 1978) 
to find the minimum encod cost for the descript 
of a time sequenc of graph and their partit in 
communities. the method be quit similar to that suc- 
cessiv develop by rosval and bergstrom (rosval 
and bergstrom, 2007), which be howev defin onli for 
static graph (section ix.b). here one consid bipartit 
graph evolv in time. the time sequenc of graph can 
be separ in segments, each contain some number 
of consecut snapshot of the system. the graph of 
each segment be suppos to have the same modular 
structur (i. e. they repres the same phase in the 
histori of the system), so they be character by the 
same partit of the two vertex classes. for each graph 
segment it be possibl to defin an encod cost, which 
combin the encod cost of the partit of the graph 
of the segment with the entropi of compress of the seg- 
ment in the subgraph segment induc by the partition. 
the total encod cost C of the graph seri be give 
by the sum of the encod cost of it segments. mini- 
mize C enabl one to find not onli the most modular 
partit for each graph segment (high modularity27 cor- 
respond to low encod cost for a partition), but also 
the most compact subdivis of the snapshot into seg- 
ments, such that graph in the same segment be strongli 
correl with each other. the latter featur allow to 
identifi chang point in the time histori of the system, 
i. e. short period in which the dynam produc big 
chang in the graph structur (correspond to, e.g., 
extrem events). the minim of C be np-hard, 
so the author propos an approxim method call 
graphscope, which consist of two steps: first, one look 
for the best partit of each graph segment; second, one 
look for the best divis in segments. In both case 
the “best” result correspond to the minim encod 
cost. the best partit within a graph segment be found 
by local search. graphscop have the big advantag not 
to requir ani input, like the number and size of the 
clusters. It be also suitabl to oper in a stream en- 
vironment, in which new graph configur be add 
in time, follow the evolut of the system: the com- 
putat complex requir to process a snapshot (on 
average) be stabl over time. test on real evolv data 
set show that graphscop be abl to find meaning 
commun and chang points. 

sinc keep track of commun in differ time 
step be not a trivial problem, a we have see above, it 
be perhap easi to adopt a vertex-centr perspective, 
in which one monitor the commun of a give vertex 
at differ times. for ani method, give a vertex i and 
a time t, the commun to which i belong at time t be

have commun structure, not the modular of newman and 
girvan.

well defined. fenn et al. (fenn et al., 2009) use the mul- 
tiresolut method by reichardt et al. (reichardt and 
bornholdt, 2006a) (section vi.b) and investig a fulli 
connect graph with time-depend weights, represent- 
ing the correl of time seri of hourli exchang rate 
returns. the resolut paramet γ be fix to the valu 
that occur in most stabil plateau of the system at 
differ time steps. motiv by the work of guimerà 
and amar (guimerà and amaral, 2005) (section xvi), 
fenn et al. identifi the role of individu vertex in their 
commun through the pair (zin, zb), where zin be the 
z-score of the intern strength (weight degree, sec- 
tion a.1), defin in eq. 98, and zb the z-score of the 
site betweenness, defin by replac the intern degre 
with the site between of freeman (freeman, 1977) in 
eq. 98. We remind that the site between be a measur 
of the number of shortest path run through a ver- 
tex. the variabl zb express the import of a vertex 
in process of inform diffus with respect to the 
other member of it community. anoth import is- 
sue regard the persist of commun in time, i. e. 
how stabl they be dure the evolution. As a measur 
of persistence, fenn et al. introduc a vertex-centr 
version of the rel overlap of eq. 82 

ati(τ) = 
|ci(t) 

⋂ 
ci(t+ τ)| 

|ci(t) 
⋃ 
ci(t+ τ)| 

, (83) 

where i be the vertex and ci(t), ci(t+τ) the commun 
of i at time t, t + τ , respectively. the decay of ati(τ) 
depend on the type of vertex. In particular, if the ver- 
tex be strongli connect to it commun (zin large), 
ati(τ) decay quit slowly, mean that it tend to stay 
attach to a stabl core of vertices. 

the method describ abov be basic two-stag 
approaches, in which cluster be detect at each times- 
tamp of the graph evolution, independ of the result 
at differ times, and relationship between partit 
at differ time be infer successively. however, thi 
often produc signific variat between partit 
close in time, especi when, a it usual happens, the 
dataset be noisy. In thi case one would be forc to 
introduc ad hoc hypothesi on the graph evolut to 
justifi the variabl of the modular structure, wherea 
such variabl be mostli an artefact of the approach. 
It would be desir instead to have a unifi frame- 
work, in which cluster be deduc both from the cur- 
rent structur of the graph and from the knowledg of 
the cluster structur at previou times. thi be the prin- 
cipl of evolutionari clustering, a framework introduc 
by chakrabarti et al. (chakrabarti et al., 2006) and suc- 
cessiv adopt and refin by other authors. let Ct 
be the partit of the graph at time t. the snapshot 
qualiti of Ct measur the good of the partit with 
respect to the graph structur at time t. the histori 
cost be a measur of the distance/dissimilar of Ct with 
respect to the partit ct−1 at the previou time step. 
the overal qualiti of Ct be give by a combin of the 
snapshot qualiti and the histori cost at each time step. 

ideally, a good partit should have high snapshot qual- 
iti (i. e. it should cluster well the data at time t) and low 
histori cost (i. e. it should be similar to the partit 
at the previou time step). In order to find Ct from ct−1 
and the relat data at time t chakrabarti et al. sug- 
gest to minim the differ between the snapshot 
qualiti and the histori cost, with a rel weight cp 
that be a tunabl parameter. the input of the procedur 
consist in the sequenc of adjacency/similar matrix 
at differ time steps. In practice, one could use mod- 
ifi version of such matrices, obtain by perform 
(weighted) averag of the data over some time window, 
in order to make the relat data more robust against 
nois and the result of the cluster procedur more re- 
liable. one can adopt arbitrari measur to comput the 
snapshot qualiti and the histor cost. besides, sev- 
eral know cluster techniqu use for static graph 
can be reformul within thi evolutionari framework. 
chakrabarti et al. deriv evolutionari version of hi- 
erarch cluster (section iv.b) and k-mean clus- 
tere (section iv.c), wherea chi et al. (chi et al., 
2007) design two implement for spectral cluster- 
ing (section iv.d). base on evolutionari clustering, lin 
et al. (lin et al., 2008) introduc a framework, call 
facetnet, that allow vertex to belong to more commu- 
niti at the same time. here the snapshot cost28 be the 
kullback-leibl (kl) diverg (kullback and leibler, 
1951) between the adjacency/similar matrix at time 
t and the matrix describ the commun structur of 
the graph at time t; the histori cost be the KL diverg 
between the matrix describ the commun structur 
of the graph at time t − 1 and t. facetnet can be ex- 
tend to handl add and remov of vertex a well 
a variat of the number of cluster in consecut time 
steps. however, it be not abl to account for the creation 
and the disintegr of commun and not scalabl to 
larg system due to the high number of iter neces- 
sari for the matrix comput to reach convergence. 
these issu have be address in a recent approach 
by kim and han (kim and han, 2009). 

naturally, what one hope to achiev at the end of the 
day be to see how real group form and evolv in time. 
backstrom et al. (backstrom et al., 2006) have carri out 
an analysi of group dynam in the free onlin commu- 
niti of livejourn (http://www.livejournal.com/) 
and in a coauthorship network of comput scientists. 
here the group be identifi through the declar mem- 
bership of user (for livejournal) and confer at- 
tend by comput scientists, respectively. backstrom 
and cowork have found that the probabl that an 
individu join a commun grow with the number of 
friends/coauthor who be alreadi in the commun and 

28 lin et al. use the cost and not the qualiti to evalu the fit 
of the partit to the data. the two estim be obvious 
related: the low the cost, the high the quality. 



70 

(for livejournal) with their degre of interconnectedness. 
moreover, the probabl of growth of livejourn com- 
muniti be posit correl to a combin of fac- 
tor includ the commun size, the number of friend 
of commun member which be not in the commun 
and the ratio of these two numbers. A high densiti of 
triad within a commun appear instead to hinder it 
growth. 

xiv. signific OF cluster 

given a network, mani partit could repres 
meaning cluster in some sense, and it could be dif- 
ficult for some method to discrimin between them. 
qualiti function evalu the good of a partit 
(section iii.c.2), so one could say that high qualiti cor- 
respond to meaning partitions. but thi be not nec- 
essarili true. In section vi.c we have see that high 
valu of the modular of newman and girvan do not 
necessarili indic that a graph have a definit cluster 
structure. In particular we have see that partit of 
random graph may also achiev consider larg val- 
ue ofq, although we do not expect them to have commu- 
niti structure, due to the lack of correl between the 
link probabl of the vertices. the optim of 
qualiti functions, like modularity, deliv the best par- 
tition accord to the criterion underli the qualiti 
function. but be the optim cluster also significant, 
i. e. a relev featur of the graph, or be it just a byprod- 
uct of random and basic structur properti like, e. 
g., the degre sequence? littl effort have be devot 
to thi crucial issue, that we discu here. 

In some work the concept of signific have be 
relat to that of robust or stabil of a partit 
against random perturb of the graph structure. 
the basic idea be that, if a partit be significant, it will 
be recov even if the structur of the graph be mod- 
ified, a long a the modif be not too extensive. 
instead, if a partit be not significant, one expect that 
minim modif of the graph will suffic to disrupt 
the partition, so other cluster be recovered. A nice 
featur of thi approach be the fact that it can be appli 
for ani cluster technique. gfeller et al. (gfeller et al., 
2005) consid the gener case of weight graphs. A 
graph be modified, in that it edg weight be increas 
or decreas by a rel amount 0 < σ < 1. thi 
choic also allow to account for the possibl effect of 
uncertainti in the valu of the edg weights, result 
from measurements/experi carri out on a give 
system. after fix σ (usual to 0.5), multipl realiza- 
tion of the origin graph be generated. the best par- 
tition for each realiz be identifi and, for each pair 
of adjac vertex i and j, the in-clust probabl pij 
be computed, i. e. the fraction of realiz in which 
i and j be classifi in the same cluster. edg with 
in-clust probabl small than a threshold θ (usual 
0.8) be call extern edges. the stabil of a partit 

be estim through the cluster entropi 

S = − 1 
m 

∑ 
(i,j):aij=1 

[pij log2 pij − (1− pij) log2(1− pij)], 

(84) 
where m is, a usual, the number of graph edges, and 
the sum run over all edges. the most stabl partit 
have pij = 0 along inter-clust edg and pij = 1 along 
intra-clust edges, which yield S = 0; the most unstabl 
partit have pij = 1/2 on all edges, yield S = 1. the 
absolut valu of S be not meaningful, though, and need 
to be compar with the correspond valu for a null 
model graph, similar to the origin graph, but with sup- 
posedli no cluster structure. gfeller et al. adopt the 
same null model of newman-girvan modularity, i. e. the 
class of graph with expect degre sequenc coincid 
with that of the origin graph. sinc the null model be 
defin on unweight graphs, the signific of S can 
be assess onli in thi case, although it would not be 
hard to think of a gener to weight graphs. the 
approach enabl one a well to identifi unstabl vertices, 
i. e. vertex lie at the boundari between clusters. In 
order to do that, the extern edg be remov and 
the connect compon of the result disconnect 
graph be associ with the cluster detect in the 
origin graph, base on their rel overlap (comput 
through eq. 97). unstabl vertex end up in compon 
that be not associ to ani of the initi clusters. A 
weak of the method by gfeller et al. be repres by 
the two paramet σ and θ, whose valu be in principl 
arbitrary. 

more recently, karrer et al. (karrer et al., 2008) 
adopt a similar strategi to unweight graphs. here 
one perform a sweep over all edges: the perturb 
consist in remov each edg with a probabl α and 
replac it with anoth edg between a pair of vertex 
(i, j), chosen at random with probabl pij = kikj/2m, 
where ki and kj be the degre of i and j. We recog- 
nize the probabl of the null model of newman-girvan 
modularity. indeed, by vari the probabl α from 
0 to 1 one smoothli interpol between the origin 
graph (no perturbation) and the null model (maxim 
perturbation). the degre sequenc of the graph remain 
invari (on average) along the whole process, by con- 
struction. the idea be that the perturb affect sole 
the organ of the vertices, keep the basic struc- 
tural properties. for a give valu of α, mani realiza- 
tion of the perturb graph be generated, their cluster 
structur be identifi with some method (karrer et al. 
use modular optimization) and compar with the 
partit obtain from the origin unperturb graph. 
the partit be compar by comput the variat 
of inform V (section xv.b). from the plot of the 
averag 〈V 〉 versu α one can ass the stabil of the 
cluster structur of the graph. If 〈V (α)〉 chang rapidli 
for small valu of α the partit be like to be unsta- 
ble. As in the approach by gfeller et al. the behaviour of 
the function 〈V (α)〉 do not have an absolut meaning, 



71 

but need to be compar with the correspond curv 
obtain for a null model. for consistency, the natur 
choic be again the null model of modularity, which be al- 
readi use in the process of graph perturbation. the ap- 
proach by gfeller et al. and karrer et al., with suitabl 
modifications, can also be use to check for the stabil 
of the cluster structur in part of a graph, up to the level 
of individu communities. thi be potenti import 
a it may happen that some part of the graph display a 
strong commun structur and other part weak or no 
commun structur at all. 

rosval and bergstrom (rosval and bergstrom, 2008) 
defin the signific of cluster with the bootstrap 
method (efron and tibshirani, 1993), which be a stan- 
dard procedur to check for the accuraci of a measure- 
ment/estim base on resampl from the empir 
data. the graph at studi be suppos to be gener by 
a parametr model, which be use to creat mani sam- 
ples. thi be do by assign to each edg a weight 
take by a poisson distribut with mean equal to the 
origin edg weight. for the initi graph and each sam- 
ple one identifi the commun structur with some 
method, that can be arbitrary. for each cluster of the 
partit of the origin graph one determin the larg 
subset of vertex that be classifi in the same clus- 
ter in at least 95% of all bootstrap samples. identifi 
such cluster core enabl one to track the evolut in 
time of the commun structure, a we explain in sec- 
tion xiii. 

A differ approach have be propos by massen 
and doy (massen and doye, 2006). they analyz an 
equilibrium canon ensembl of partitions, with −Q 
play the role of the energy, Q be newman-girvan 
modularity. thi mean that the probabl of occur- 
renc of a partit at temperatur T be proport to 
exp(q/t ). the idea be that, if a graph have a signifi- 
cant cluster structure, at low temperatur one would 
recov essenti the same partition, correspond to 
the modular maximum, which be separ by an ap- 
preciabl gap from the modular valu of the other 
partitions. On the contrary, graph with no commu- 
niti structure, e. g. random graphs, have mani com- 
pet (local) maxima, and the correspond configura- 
tion will emerg alreadi at low temperatures, sinc their 
modular valu be close to the absolut maximum29. 
these distinct behavior can manifest themselv in var- 
iou ways. for instance, if one consid the variat of 
the specif heat C = −dq/dt with T , the gap in the 
modular landscap be associ to a sharp peak of 
C around some temperatur value, like it happen in a 

29 As we have see in section vi.c, good et al. (good et al., 2009) 
have actual show that the modular landscap have a huge 
degeneraci of state with high modular values, close to the 
global maximum, especi on graph with commun struc- 
ture. So the result of the method by massen and doy may be 
misleading. 

phase transition. If the gap be small and there be mani 
partit with similar modular values, the peak of C 
becom broad. anoth strategi to ass the signifi- 
canc of the maximum modular partit consist of 
the investig of the similar between partit re- 
cover at a give temperatur T . thi similar can 
be express by the frequenc matrix, whose element fij 
indic the rel number of time vertex i and j 
have be classifi in the same cluster. If the graph 
have a clear commun structure, at low temperatur 
the frequenc matrix can be put in block-diagon form, 
with the block correspond to the commun of the 
best partition; if there be no signific commun struc- 
ture, the frequenc matrix be rather homogeneous. the 
fiedler eigenvalu (fiedler, 1973) λ2, the second small 
eigenvalu of the laplacian matrix associ to the fre- 
quenci matrix, allow to estim how “block-diagonal” 
the matrix be (see section iv.a). At low temperatur 
λ2 ∼ 0 if there be one (a few) partit with maximum 
or near to maximum modularity; if there be mani (al- 
most) degener partitions, λ2 be appreci differ 
from zero even when T → 0. A sharp transit from 
low to high valu of λ2 by vari temperatur indic 
signific commun structure. anoth clear signatur 
of signific commun structur be the observ of 
a rapid drop of the averag commun size with T , a 
“strong” commun break up in mani small piec for 
a modest temperatur increase, while the disintegr 
of “weak” commun take place more slowly. In scale- 
free graph (section a.3) cluster be often not well sep- 
arated, due to the presenc of the hubs; in these case 
the above-ment transit of ensembl variabl be 
not so sharp and take place over a broader temperatur 
range. the canon ensembl of partit be gener 
through singl spin heatbath simul anneal (re- 
ichardt and bornholdt, 2006a), combin with parallel 
temper (earl and deem, 2005). the approach by 
massen and doy could be use to recogn graph 
without cluster structure, if the modular landscap be 
character by mani maximum with close valu (but see 
footnote). however, it can happen that gap between the 
absolut modular maximum and the rest of the modu- 
lariti valu be creat by fluctuations, and the method 
be unabl to identifi these situations. furthermore, the 
approach heavili reli on modular and on a costli 
techniqu like simul annealing: extens to other 
qualiti function and/or optim procedur do not 
appear straightforward. 

In a recent work by bianconi et al. (bianconi et al., 
2009) the notion of entropi of graph ensembl (bianconi, 
2008; bianconi et al., 2008) be employ to find out how 
like it be for a cluster structur to occur on a graph with 
a give degre sequence. the entropi be comput from 
the number of graph configur which be compat 
with a give classif of the vertex in q groups. 
the cluster be quantit describ by fix the 
number of edg a(q1, q2) run between cluster q1 
and q2, for all choic of q1 6= q2. bianconi et al. propos

the follow indic of cluster signific 

θ~k,~q = 
σ~k,~q − 〈σ~k,π(~q)〉π√ 
〈δς2~k,π(~q)〉π 

, (85) 

where σ~k,~q be the entropi of the graph configur with 

give degre sequenc ~k and cluster ~q (with fix num- 
ber of inter-clust edg a(q1, q2)), and 〈σ~k,π(~q)〉π be 
the averag entropi of the configur with the same 
degre sequenc and a random permut π(~q) of the 
cluster labels. the absolut valu of the entropi σ~k,~q be 

not meaningful, so the comparison of σ~k,~q and 〈σ~k,π(~q)〉π 
be crucial, a it tell how relev the actual cluster struc- 
ture be with respect to a random classif of the ver- 
tices. however, differ permut of the assign 
~q yield differ valu of the entropy, which can fluctuat 
considerably. therefor one have to comput the standard 
deviat 〈δς2~k,π(~q)〉π of the entropi correspond to all 
random permut π(~q), to estim how signific 
the differ between σ~k,~q and 〈σ~k,π(~q)〉π is. In thi 
way, if θ~k,~q ≤ 1, the entropi of the give cluster struc- 
ture be of the same order a the entropi of some random 
permut of the cluster labels, so it be not relevant. 
instead, if θ~k,~q � 1, the cluster structur be far more 
like than a random classif of the vertices, so the 
cluster be relevant. the indic θ~k,~q can be simpli 

gener to the case of direct and weight graphs. 
lancichinetti et al. (lancichinetti et al., 2009) a well 

address the issu by compar the cluster structur of 
the graph with that of a random graph with similar prop- 
erties. An import novelti of thi approach be the fact 
that it estim the signific of singl communities, 
not of partitions. In fact, not all commun be equal 
significant, in general, so it make a lot of sens to check 
them individually. In particular, it may happen that real 
network be not fulli modular, due to their particular 
histori or gener mechanisms, and that onli portion 
of them display commun structure. the main idea be 
to verifi how like it be that a commun C be a sub- 
graph of a random graph with the same degre sequenc 
of the origin graph. thi likelihood be call c-score, 
and be comput by examin the vertex w of C, with 
the low intern degre kinw in C (the “worst” vertex). 
the c-score be defin a the probabl that the intern 
degre of the bad vertex in the correspond commu- 
niti of the null model graph be larg than or equal to 
kinw . thi probabl be comput by use tool from ex- 
treme and order statist (beirlant et al., 2004; david 
and nagaraja, 2003). A low valu of the c-score (≤ 5%) 
be a strong indic that the group of vertex at studi 
be a commun and not the product of random fluctu- 
ations. In addition, the measur can be use to check 
whether a subgraph have an intern modular structure. 
for that, one remov the vertex of the subgraph one 
at a time, start from the bad and proceed in in- 
creas order of the intern degree, and observ how 

the c-score vari at each vertex removal: sharp drop in- 
dicat the presenc of dens subgraph (fig. 29). there- 
fore, one could think of use the c-score a ingredi of 
new cluster techniques. As we have seen, the c-score 
be base on the behavior of the vertex with low intern 
degre of the subgraph. real network be character 
by noise, which could strongli affect the structur rela- 
tionship between vertex and clusters. for thi reason, 
reli on the properti of a singl vertex to evalu 
the signific of a subgraph could be a problem for 
applic to real networks. lancichinetti et al. have 
show that the c-score can be easili extend to consid 
the t vertex with low intern degree, with t > 1 (b- 
score). the main limit of the c-score be the fact that it 
null model be the same a that of newman-girvan mod- 
ularity. accord to thi null model, each vertex can in 
principl be connect to ani other, no matter how larg 
the system is. thi be howev not realistic, especi for 
larg graphs, where it be much more reason to assum 
that each vertex have it own “horizon”, i.e. a subset of 
other vertex with which it can interact, which be usual 
much small than the whole system (see section vi.c). 
how to defin such “horizons” and, more in general, re- 
alist null model be still an open problem. however, the 
c-score could be easili reformul with ani null model, 
so one could readili deriv more reliabl definitions. 

We conclud with a gener issu which be relat to 
the signific of commun structure. the question is: 
give a cluster structur in a graph, can it be recov 
a priori by an algorithm? In a recent paper (reichardt 
and leone, 2008), reichardt and leon studi under 
which condit a special built-in cluster structur can 
be recovered. the cluster have equal size and a pair of 
vertex be connect with probabl p if they belong to 
the same cluster, with probabl r < p otherwise. In 
comput scienc thi be know a the plant partition- 
ing problem (condon and karp, 2001). the goal be to 
propos algorithm that recov the plant partit for 
ani choic of p and r. for dens graphs, i. e. graph 
whose averag degre grow with the number n of ver- 
tices, algorithm can be design that find the solut 
with a probabl which equal 1 minu a term that van- 
ish in the limit of infinit graph size, regardless of the 
differ p − r, which can then be chosen arbitrarili 
small. sinc mani real network be not dens graphs, 
a their averag degre 〈k〉 be usual much small than 
n and do not depend on it, reichardt and leon inves- 
tigat the problem in the case of fix 〈k〉 and infinit 
graph size. We indic with q the number of cluster and 
with pin the probabl that a randomli select edg of 
the graph lie within ani of the q clusters. In thi way, 
if pin = 1/q, the inter-clust edg densiti match the 
intra-clust edg densiti (i. e. p = r), and the plant 
partit would not correspond to a recover cluster- 
ing, wherea for pin = 1, there be no inter-clust edg 
and the partit can be trivial recovered. the valu 
of pin be in principl unknown, so one have to detect the 
cluster structur ignor thi information. reichardt

and leon propos to look for a minimum cut parti- 
tion, i. e. for the partit that minim the number of 
inter-clust edges, a it be usual do in the graph par- 
tition problem (discuss in section iv.a). clearly, 
for pin = 1 the minimum cut partit trivial coincid 
with the plant partition, wherea for 1/q < pin < 1 
there should be some overlap, which be expect to vanish 
in the limit case pin = 1/q. the minimum cut partit 
correspond to the minimum of the follow ferromag- 
netic pott model hamiltonian

over the set of all spin configur with zero magne- 
tization. here the spin σi indic the cluster vertex i 
belong to, and the coupl matrix jij be just the adja- 
cenci matrix of the graph. the constraint of zero magne- 
tizat ensur that the cluster have all the same size, 
a requir by the plant partit problem. the 
energi of a spin configuration, express by eq. 86, be 
the neg of the number of edg that lie within clus- 
ters: the minimum energi correspond to the maximum 
number of intra-clust edges, which be coupl to the 

minimum number of inter-clust edges. the minimum 
energi can be comput with the caviti method, or be- 
lief propagation, at zero temperatur (mézard and parisi, 
2003). the accuraci of the solut with respect to the 
plant partit be express by the fraction of vertex 
which be put in the same class in both partitions. the 
analysi yield a strike result: the plant cluster be 
accur recov for pin larg than a critic thresh- 
old pcin > 1/q. so, there be a rang of valu of pin, 
1/q < pin < p

it. the threshold pcin depend on the degre distribut

xv. test algorithm 

when a cluster algorithm be designed, it be neces- 
sari to test it performance, and compar it with that 
of other methods. In the previou section we have say 
veri littl about the perform of the algorithms, other 
than their comput complexity. indeed, the issu 
of test algorithm have receiv veri littl attent 
in the literatur on graph clustering. thi be a seriou 



74 

limit of the field. becaus of that, it be still imposs to 
state which method (or subset of methods) be the most 
reliabl in applications, and peopl reli blindli on some 
algorithm instead of other for reason that have noth- 
ing to do with the actual perform of the algorithms, 
like. e.g. popular (of the method or of it inventor). 
thi lack of control be also the main reason for the pro- 
lifer of graph cluster techniqu in the last few 
years. virtual in ani paper, where a new method be 
introduced, the part about test consist in appli 
the method to a small set of simpl benchmark graphs, 
whose cluster structur be fairli easi to recover. becaus 
of that, the freedom in the design of a cluster algo- 
rithm be basic infinite, wherea it be not clear what a 
new procedur be add to the field, if anything. 

In thi section we discu at length the issu of testing. 
first, we describ the fundament ingredi of ani 
test procedure, i. e. benchmark graph with built-in 
commun structure, that method have to identifi (sec- 
tion xv.a). We proceed by review measur to com- 
pare graph partit with each other (section xv.b). In 
section xv.c we present the compar evalu of 
differ method that have be perform in the liter- 
ature. 

A. benchmark 

test an algorithm essenti mean appli it to 
a specif problem whose solut be know and compar- 
ing such solut with that deliv by the algorithm. 
In the case of graph clustering, a problem with a well- 
defin solut be a graph with a clear commun struc- 
ture. thi concept be not trivial, however. mani cluster- 
ing algorithm be base on similar intuit notion of 
what a commun is, but differ implementations. So 
it be crucial that the scientif commun agre on a 
set of reliabl benchmark graphs. thi mostli appli 
to computer-gener graphs, where the built-in clus- 
ter structur can be arbitrarili designed. In the liter- 
atur real network be use a well, in those case in 
which commun be well defin becaus of informa- 
tion about the system. 

We start our survey from computer-gener bench- 
marks. A special class of graph have becom quit pop- 
ular in the last years. they be gener with the 
so-cal plant `-partit model (condon and karp, 
2001). the model partit a graph with n = g · ` ver- 
tice in ` group with g vertex each. vertic of the 
same group be link with a probabl pin, wherea 
vertex of differ group be link with a probabl 
pout. each subgraph correspond to a group be then 
a random graph á la erdös-rényi with connect prob- 
abil p = pin (section a.3). the averag degre of a 
vertex be 〈k〉 = pin(g−1) +poutg(`−1). If pin > pout the 
intra-clust edg densiti exce the inter-clust edg 
densiti and the graph have a commun structure. thi 
idea be quit intuit and we have encount it in sev- 

eral occas in the previou sections. girvan and new- 
man consid a special case of the plant `-partit 
model (girvan and newman, 2002). they set ` = 4, 
g = 32 (so the number of graph vertex be n = 128) and 
fix the averag total degre 〈k〉 to 16. thi impli 
that pin + 3pout ≈ 1/2, so the probabl pin and pout 
be not independ parameters. In calcul it be com- 
mon to use a paramet zin = pin(g − 1) = 31pin and 
zout = poutg(` − 1) = 96pout, indic the expect 
intern and extern degre of a vertex, respectively. 
these particular graph have by now gain the sta- 
tu of standard benchmark (girvan and newman, 2002) 
(fig. 30). In the first applic of the graph one as- 
sum that commun be well defin when zout < 8, 
correspond to the situat in which the intern de- 
gree exce the extern degree. however, the thresh- 
old zout = zin = 8 impli pin ≈ 1/4 and pout = 1/12, 
so it be not the actual threshold of the model, where 
pin = pout = 1/8, correspond to zout ≈ 12. so, one 
expects30 to be abl to detect the plant partit up 
until zout ≈ 12. 

test a method against the girvan-newman bench- 
mark consist in calcul the similar between the 
partit determin by the method and the natur 
partit of the graph in the four equal-s groups. sev- 
eral measur of partitions’ similar may be adopted; we 
describ them in section xv.b. one usual build mani 
graph realiz for a particular valu of zout and com- 
pute the averag similar between the solut of the 
method and the built-in solution. the procedur be then 
iter for differ valu of zout. the result be usu- 
alli repres in a plot, where the averag similar 
be drawn a a function of zout. most algorithm usu- 
alli do a good job for small zout and start to fail when 
zout approach 8. fan et al. (fan et al., 2007) have 
design a weight version of the benchmark of gir- 
van and newman, in that one give differ weight to 
edg insid and between communities. one could pick 
just two values, one for intra- and the other for inter- 
commun edges, or uniformli distribut valu in two 
differ ranges. for thi benchmark there be then two 
paramet that can be varied: zout and the rel im- 
portanc of the intern and the extern weights. typ- 
ical one fix the topolog structur and vari the 
weights. thi be particularli insight when zout = 4, 
which deliv graph without topolog cluster struc- 
ture: in thi case, the question whether there be cluster 
or not depend entir on the weights. 

As we have remark above, the plant `-partit 
model gener mutual interconnect random graph 

30 however, we stress that, even if commun be there, meth- 
od may be unabl to detect them. the reason be that, due to 
fluctuat in the distribut of link in the graphs, alreadi 
befor the limit impos by the plant partit model it may 
be imposs to detect the commun and the model graph 
may look similar to random graphs.

á la erdös-rényi. therefore, all vertex have approxi- 
mate the same degree. moreover, all commun have 
exactli the same size by construction. these two featur 
be at odd with what be observ in graph representa- 
tion of real systems. degre distribut be usual 
skewed, with mani vertex with low degre coexist 
with a few vertex with high degree. A similar hetero- 
geneiti be also observ in the distribut of cluster sizes, 
a we shall see in section xvi. so, the plant `-partit 
model be not a good descript of a real graph with com- 
muniti structure. however, the model can be modifi to 
account for the heterogen of degre and commun 
sizes. A modifi version of the model, call gaussian 
random partit generator, be design by brand et 
al. (brand et al., 2003). here the cluster size have a 
gaussian distribution, so they be not the same, although 
they do not differ much from each other. the hetero- 
geneiti of the cluster size introduc a heterogen in 
the degre distribut a well, a the expect degre of 
a vertex depend on the number of vertex of it clus- 
ter. still, the variabl of degre and cluster size be not 
appreciable. besides, vertex of the same cluster keep 
have approxim the same degree. A good job in 
thi direct have be recent do by lancichinetti et 
al. (lfr benchmark) (lancichinetti et al., 2008). they 
assum that the distribut of degre and commun 
size be power laws, with expon τ1 and τ2, respec- 
tively. each vertex share a fraction 1 − µ of it edg 
with the other vertex of it commun and a fraction µ 
with the vertex of the other communities; 0 ≤ µ ≤ 1 be 
the mix parameter. the graph be built a follows: 

1. A sequenc of commun size obey the pre- 
scribe power law distribut be extracted. thi be 
do by pick random number from a power law 
distribut with expon τ2. 

2. each vertex i of a commun receiv an intern 

degre (1−µ)ki, where ki be the degre of vertex i, 
which be take by a power law distribut with ex- 
ponent τ1. In thi way, each vertex i have a number 
of stub (1− µ)ki. 

3. all stub of vertex of the same commun be ran- 
domli attach to each other, until no more stub 
be “free”. In thi way the sequenc of intern de- 
gree of each vertex in it commun be maintained. 

4. each vertex i receiv now an addit number of 
stubs, equal to µki (so that the final degre of the 
vertex be ki), that be randomli attach to ver- 
tice of differ communities, until no more stub 
be “free”. 

numer test show that thi procedur have a com- 
plexiti o(m), where m be a usual the number of edg 
of the graph, so it can be use to creat graph of size 
span sever order of magnitude. fig. 31 show an 
exampl of a lfr benchmark graph. recent the lfr 
benchmark have be extend to direct and weight 
graph with overlap commun (lancichinetti 
and fortunato, 2009). the softwar to creat the 
lfr benchmark graph can be freeli download at 
http://santo.fortunato.googlepages.com/inthepr 
ss2. 

A class of benchmark graph with power law de- 
gree distribut have be previous introduc by 
bagrow (bagrow, 2008). the construct process start 
from a graph with a power-law degre distribution. 
bagrow use barabási-albert scale free graph (barabási 
and albert, 1999). then, vertex be randomli assign 
to one of four equally-s communities. finally, pair 
of edg between two commun be rewir so that 
either edg end up within the same community, with- 
out alter the degre sequenc (on average). thi be 
straightforward: suppos that the edg join the vertex

fig. 31 A realiz of the lfr benchmark graph (lancichinetti et al., 2008), with 500 vertices. the distribut of the 
vertex degre and of the commun size be both power laws. such benchmark be a more faith approxim of real-world 
network with commun structur than simpler benchmark like, e. g., that by girvan and newman (girvan and newman, 
2002). reprint figur with permiss from ref. (lancichinetti et al., 2008). c©2008 by the american physic society. 

pair a1, b1 and a2, b2, where a1, a2 belong to commu- 
niti A and b1, b2 to commun B. It the edg be 
replac by a1-a2 and b1-b2 (provid they do not ex- 
ist already), all vertex keep their degrees. with thi 
rewir procedur one can arbitrarili vari the edg den- 
siti within and, consequently, between clusters. In thi 
class of benchmarks, however, commun be all of the 
same size by construction, although one can in principl 
relax thi condition. 

A (seemingly) differ benchmark be repres by 
the class of relax caveman graphs, which be origi- 
nalli introduc to explain the cluster properti of 
social network (watts, 2003). the start point be a 
set of disconnect cliques. with some probabl edg 
be rewir to link differ cliques. such model graph 
be interest a they be smooth variat of the ideal 
graph with “perfect” communities, i. e. disconnect 
cliques. On the other hand the model be equival to 
the plant `-partit model, where pin = 1 − p and 
pout be proport to p, with coeffici depend on 
the size of the clusters. 

benchmark graph have also be introduc to deal 
with special type of graph and/or cluster structures. 
for instance, arena et al. (arena et al., 2006) have 
introduc a class of benchmark graph with emb 

hierarch structure, which extend the class of graph 
by girvan and newman. here there be 256 vertex and 
two hierarch levels, correspond to a partit in 16 
group (microcommunities) with 16 vertex and a par- 
tition in 4 larg group of 64 vertex (macrocommu- 
nities), compris each 4 of the small groups. the

cat by three paramet zin1 , zin2 and zout: zin1 be 
the expect intern degre of a vertex within it micro- 
community; zin2 be the expect number of edg that the 
vertex share with the vertex of the other microcommu- 
niti within it macrocommunity; zout be the expect 
number of edg connect the vertex with vertex of 
the other three macrocommunities. the averag degre

guimerà et al. (guimerà et al., 2007) have propos 
a model of bipartit graph with built-in communities. 
they consid a bipartit graph of actor and teams, 
here we describ how to build the benchmark for gen- 
eral bipartit graphs. one start from a bipartit graph 
whose vertex class A and B be partit into nc 
groups, cai and cbi (i = 1, 2, ..., nc). each cluster Ci 



77 

compris all vertex of the subgroup cai and cbi , re- 
spectively. with probabl p edg be place between 
vertex of subgroup cai and cbi (i = 1, 2, ..., nc), i. e. 
within clusters. with probabl 1− p, edg be place 
between vertex of subgroup cai and cbj , where i and j 
be chosen at random, so they can be equal or different. 
By construction, a non-zero valu of the probabl p 
indic a prefer by vertex to share link with ver- 
tice of the same cluster, i. e. for p > 0 the graph have a 
built-in commun structure. for p = 1 there would be 
edg onli within clusters, i. e. the graph have a perfect 
cluster structure. 

finally, sawardeck et al. introduc a gener 
model, that account for the possibl that cluster over- 
lap (sawardeck et al., 2009). the model be base on the 
reason assumpt that the probabl pij that two 
vertex be connect by an edg grow with the number 
n0 of commun both vertex belong to. for vertex 
in differ clusters, pij = p0, if they be in the same 
cluster (and onli in that one) pij = p1, if they belong 
to the same two cluster pij = p2, etc.. By hypothesis, 
p0 < p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3.... the plant `-partit model be 
recov when p1 = p2 = p3.... 

As we have seen, nearli all exist benchmark graph 
be inspir by the plant `-partit model, to some 
extent. however, the model need to be refin to pro- 
vide a good descript of real graph with commun 
structure. the hypothesi that the link probabl 
of each vertex with the vertex of it commun or of 
the other commun be constant be not realistic. It be 
more plausibl that each pair of vertex i and j have it 
own link probabl pij , and that such probabl 
be correl for vertex in the same cluster. 

test on real network usual focu on a veri limit 
number of examples, for which one have precis informa- 
tion about the vertex and their properties. 

In section II we have introduc two popular real net- 
work with know commun structure, i. e. the social 
network of zachary’ karat club and the social network 
of bottlenos dolphin live in doubt sound (new 
zealand), studi by lusseau. here, the question be 
whether the actual separ in two social group could 
be predict from the graph topology. zachary’ karat 
club be by far the most investig system. sever algo- 
rithm be actual abl to identifi the two classes, mod- 
ulo a few intermedi vertices, which may be misclassi- 
fied. other method be less successful: for instance, the 
maximum of newman-girvan modular correspond to 
a split of the network in four group (donetti and muñoz, 
2004; duch and arenas, 2005). anoth well know ex- 
ampl be the network of american colleg footbal teams, 
deriv by girvan and newman (girvan and newman, 
2002). there be 115 vertices, repres the teams, 
and two vertex be connect if their team play against 
each other. the team be divid into 12 conferences. 
game between team in the same confer be more 
frequent than game between team of differ confer- 
ences, so one have a natur partit where the commu- 

niti correspond to the conferences. 
when deal with real networks, it be use to re- 

solv their commun structur with differ cluster 
techniques, to cross-check the result and make sure that 
they be consist with each other, a in some case the 
answer may strongli depend on the specif algorithm 
adopted. however, one have to keep in mind that there 
be no guarante that “reasonable” communities, defin 
on the basi of non-structur information, must coincid 
with those detect by method base onli on the graph 
structure. 

B. compar partitions: measur 

check the perform of an algorithm involv 
defin a criterion to establish how “similar” the par- 
tition deliv by the algorithm be to the partit one 
wish to recover. sever measur for the similar of 
partit exist. In thi section we present and discu 
the most popular measures. A thorough introduct of 
similar measur for graph partit have be give 
by meilă (meilă, 2007) and we will follow it closely. 

let u consid two gener partit X = 
(x1, x2, ..., xnx ) and Y = (y1, y2, ..., yni ) of a graph 
G, with nX and nY clusters, respectively. We indic 
with n the number of graph vertices, with nxi and n 

Y 
j 

the number of vertex in cluster Xi and Yj and with 
nij the number of vertex share by cluster Xi and Yj : 
nij = |xi 

⋂ 
Yj |. 

In the first test use the benchmark graph by girvan 
and newman (section xv.a) scholar use a measur 
propos by girvan and newman themselves, the frac- 
tion of correctli classifi vertices. A vertex be correctli 
classifi if it be in the same cluster with at least half of 
it “natural” partners. If the partit found by the al- 
gorithm have cluster give by the merg of two or more 
natur groups, all vertex of the cluster be consid 
incorrectli classified. the number of correctli classifi 
vertex be then divid by the total size of the graph, 
to yield a number between 0 and 1. the recip to label 
vertex a correctli or incorrectli classifi be somewhat 
arbitrary, though. 

apart from the fraction of correctli classifi vertices, 
which be somewhat ad hoc and distinguish the role of 
the natur partit and of the algorithm’ partition, 
most similar measur can be divid in three cate- 
gories: measur base on pair counting, cluster match- 
ing and inform theory. 

measur base on pair count depend on the num- 
ber of pair of vertex which be classifi in the same 
(different) cluster in the two partitions. In particular 
a11 indic the number of pair of vertex which be 
in the same commun in both partitions, a01 (a10) the 
number of pair of element which be put in the same 
commun in X (y) and in differ commun in Y 
(X ) and a00 the number of pair of vertex that be in 
differ commun in both partitions. wallac (wal- 



78 

lace, 1983) propos the two index 

WI = 
a11∑ 

k n 
X 
k (n 

X 
k − 1)/2 

; wii = 
a11∑ 

k n 
Y 
k (n 

Y 
k − 1)/2 

. 

(87) 
WI and wii repres the probabl that vertex pair 
in the same cluster of X be also in the same cluster for 
Y, and viceversa. these index be asymmetrical, a the 
role of the two partit be not the same. fowlk and 
mallow (fowlk and mallows, 1983) suggest to use 
the geometr mean of WI and wii , which be symmetric. 

the rand index (rand, 1971) be the ratio of the number 
of vertex pair correctli classifi in both partit (i. e. 
either in the same or in differ clusters), by the total 
number of pair 

r(x ,y) = a11 + a00 
a11 + a01 + a10 + a00 

. (88) 

A measur equival to the rand index be the mirkin 
metric (mirkin, 1996) 

m(x ,y) = 2(a01 + a10) = n(n− 1)[1−r(x ,y)]. (89) 

the jaccard index be the ratio of the number of vertex 
pair classifi in the same cluster in both partitions, by 
the number of vertex pair which be classifi in the 
same cluster in at least one partition, i. e. 

j(x ,y) = a11 
a11 + a01 + a10 

. (90) 

adjust version of both the rand and the jaccard in- 
dex exist, in that a null model be introduced, correspond- 
ing to the hypothesi of independ of the two parti- 
tion (meilă, 2007). the null model expect valu 
of the measur be subtract from the unadjust ver- 
sion, and the result be normal by the rang of thi 
difference, yield 1 for ident partit and 0 a ex- 
pect valu for independ partit (neg valu 
be possibl a well). unadjust index have the draw- 
back that they be not local, i. e. the result depend 
on how the whole graph be partitioned, even when the 
partit differ onli in a small region of the graph. 

similar measur base on cluster match aim at 
find the larg overlap between pair of cluster of 
differ partitions. for instance, the classif error 
h(x ,y) be defin a (meilă and heckerman, 2001) 

h(x ,y) = 1− 1 
n 

max 
π 

nx∑ 
k=1 

nkπ(k), (91) 

where π be an inject map from the cluster index 
of partit Y to the cluster index of partit X . the 
maximum be take over all possibl inject {π}. In 
thi way one recov the maximum overlap between the 
cluster of the two partitions. An altern measur 
be the normal van dongen metric, defin a (van 
dongen, 2000b) 

d(x ,y) = 1− 1 
2n 

[ 
nx∑ 
k=1 

max 
k′ 

nkk′ + 

ny∑ 
k′=1 

max 
k 

nkk′ 

] 
. (92) 

A common problem of thi type of measur be that some 
cluster may not be take into account, if their overlap 
with cluster of the other partit be not larg enough. 
therefor if we comput the similar between two parti- 
tion X and X ′ and partit Y, with X and X ′ differ 
from each other by a differ subdivis of part of the 
graph that be not use to comput the measure, one 
would obtain the same score. 

the third class of similar measur be base on re- 
formul the problem of compar partit a a 
problem of messag decod within the framework of 
inform theori (mackay, 2003). the idea be that, if 
two partit be similar, one need veri littl informa- 
tion to infer one partit give the other. thi extra 
inform can be use a a measur of dissimilarity. 
To evalu the shannon inform content (mackay, 
2003) of a partition, one start by consid the com- 
muniti assign {xi} and {yi}, where xi and yi in- 
dicat the cluster label of vertex i in partit X and 
Y, respectively. one assum that the label x and y 
be valu of two random variabl X and Y , with joint 
distribut P (x, y) = P (X = x, Y = y) = nxy/n, 
which impli that P (x) = P (X = x) = nxx /n and 
P (y) = P (Y = y) = nyy /n. the mutual inform 
i(x,i ) of two random variabl have be previous 
defin [eq. (70)], and can be appli a well to par- 
tition X and Y, sinc they be describ by random 
variables. actual i(x,i ) = h(x) − h(x|i ), where 
h(x) = − 

∑ 
x P (x) logp (x) be the shannon entropi of 

X and h(x|i ) = − 
∑ 
x,i P (x, y) logp (x|y) be the con- 

dition entropi of X give Y . the mutual inform 
be not ideal a a similar measure: in fact, give a par- 
tition X , all partit deriv from X by further par- 
tition (some of) it cluster would all have the same 
mutual inform with X , even though they could be 
veri differ from each other. In thi case the mutual in- 
format would simpli equal the entropi h(x), becaus 
the condit entropi would be systemat zero. To 
avoid that, danon et al. adopt the normal mutual 
inform (danon et al., 2005) 

inorm(x ,y) = 
2i(x,i ) 

h(x) +h(i ) 
, (93) 

which be current veri often use in test of graph clus- 
tere algorithms. the normal mutual inform 
equal 1 if the partit be identical, wherea it have 
an expect valu of 0 if the partit be independent. 
the measure, defin for standard partitions, in which 
each vertex belong to onli one cluster, have be recent 
extend to the case of overlap cluster by lanci- 
chinetti et al. (lancichinetti et al., 2009). the extens 
be not straightforward a the commun assign of 
a partit be now specifi by a vectori random vari- 
able, sinc each vertex may belong to more cluster si- 
multaneously. In fact, the definit by lancichinetti et 
al. be not a proper extens of the normal mutual 
information, in the sens that it do not recov exactli 
the same valu of the origin measur for the compar- 



79 

ison of proper partit without overlap, even though 
the valu be close. 

meilă (meilă, 2007) introduc the variat of infor- 
mation 

V (X ,y) = h(x|i ) +h(i |x), (94) 

which have some desir properti with respect to the 
normal mutual inform and other measures. In 
particular, it defin a metric in the space of partit 
a it have the properti of distance. It be also a local 
measure, i. e. the similar of partit differ onli 
in a small portion of a graph depend on the differ of 
the cluster in that region, and not on the partit of the 
rest of the graph. the maximum valu of the variat 
of inform be log n, so similar valu for partit 
of graph with differ size cannot be compar with 
each other. for meaning comparison one could divid 
V (X ,y) by log n, a suggest by karrer et al. (karrer 
et al., 2008). 

A concept relat to similar be that of distance, 
which indic basic how mani oper need to 
be perform in order to transform a partit to an- 
other. gustafsson et al. defin two distanc measur 
for partit (gustafsson et al., 2006). they be both 
base on the concept of meet of two partitions, which be 
defin a 

M = 
na⋃ 
i=1 

nb⋃ 
j=1 

[ 
Xi 
⋂ 
Yj 

] 
. (95) 

the distanc measur be mmove and mdiv. In both 
case they be determin by sum the distanc of 
X and Y from the meet M. for mmove the distanc of 
X (y) from the meet be the minimum number of element 
that must be move between X and Y so that X (y) and 
M coincid (gusfield, 2002). for mdiv the distanc of X 
(y) from the meet be the minimum number of divis 
that must be do in X (y) so that X (y) and M coin- 
cide (stanley, 1997). such distanc measur can easili 
be transform in similar measures, like 

imov = 1−mmoved/n, idiv = 1−mdiv/n. (96) 

ident partit have zero mutual distanc and simi- 
lariti 1 base on eqs. 96. 

final an import problem be how to defin the sim- 
ilar between clusters. If two partit X and Y of a 
graph be similar, each cluster of X will be veri similar 
to one cluster of Y, and viceversa, and it be import 
to identifi the pair of correspond clusters. for in- 
stance, if one have inform about the time evolut 
of a graph, one could monitor the dynam of singl clus- 
ter a well, by keep track of each cluster at differ 
time step (palla et al., 2007). given cluster Xi and 
Yj , their similar can be defin through the rel 
overlap sij 

sij = 
|xi 

⋂ 
Yj | 

|xi 
⋃ 
Yj |

zout (6, 7 and 8), and repres the result for each algo- 
rithm a a group of three columns, indic the averag 
valu of the similar between the plant partit and 
the partit found by the method for each of the three 
zout-values. the similar be measur in term of the 
fraction of correctli classifi vertex (section xv.a). 
the comparison show that modular optim via 
simul anneal (section vi.a.2) yield the best re- 
sults, although it be a rather slow procedure, that cannot 
be appli to graph of size of the order of 105 vertex or 
larger. On the other hand, we have alreadi point out 
that the benchmark by girvan and newman be not a good 
represent of real graph with commun structure, 
which be character by heterogen distribut 

of degre and commun sizes. In thi respect, the class 
of graph design by lancichinetti et al. (lfr bench- 
mark) (lancichinetti et al., 2008) (section xv.a) pose 
a far more sever test to cluster techniques. for in- 
stance, mani method have problem to detect cluster 
of veri differ size (like most method list in ta- 
ble i). for thi reason, lancichinetti and fortunato have 
carri out a care compar analysi of commun 
detect method on the much more restrict lfr 
benchmark (lancichinetti and fortunato, 2009). the al- 
gorithm chosen be list in tabl ii. In fig. 33 the per- 
formanc of the algorithm on the lfr benchmark be 
compared. whenev possible, test on the version of 
the lfr benchmark with direct edges, weight edg 



81 

and/or overlap commun (lancichinetti and for- 
tunato, 2009) be carri out. lancichinetti and for- 
tunato also test the method on random graphs, to 
check whether they be abl to notic the absenc of com- 
muniti structure. from the result of all tests, the in- 
fomap method by rosval and bergstrom (rosval and 
bergstrom, 2008) appear to be the best, but also the 
algorithm by blondel et al. (blondel et al., 2008) and by 
ronhovd and nussinov (ronhovd and nussinov, 2009) 
have a good performance. these three method be also 
veri fast, with a complex which be essenti linear in 
the system size, so they can be appli to larg systems. 
On the other hand, modularity-bas method (with the 
except of the method by blondel et al.) have a rather 
poor performance, which worsen for larg system and 
small communities, due to the well know resolut 
limit of modular (fortunato and barthélemy, 2007). 
the perform of the remain method worsen con- 
sider if one increas the system size (dm and info- 
mod) or the commun size (cfinder, mcl and method 
by radicchi et al.). 

fan et al. have evalu the perform of some al- 
gorithm to detect commun on weight graph (fan 
et al., 2007). the algorithm are: modular maxi- 
mization, carri out with extrem optim (weo) 
(section vi.a.3); the girvan-newman algorithm (wgn) 
(section v.a); the pott model algorithm by reichardt 
and bornholdt (potts) (section viii.a). all these tech- 
niqu have be origin introduc for unweight 
graphs, but we have show that they can easili be ex- 
tend to weight graphs. the algorithm be test 
on the weight version of the benchmark of girvan 
and newman, that we discuss in section xv.a. edg 
weight have onli two values: winter for inter-clust 
edg and wintra for intra-clust edges. such valu be 
link by the relat wintra + winter = 2, so they be 
not independent. for test one us realiz of the 
benchmark with fix topolog (i. e. fix zout) and vari- 
abl weights. In fig. 34 the compar perform of 
the three algorithm be illustrated. the topolog of the 
benchmark graph correspond to zout = 8, i. e. to graph 
in which each vertex have approxim the same num- 
ber of neighbor insid and outsid it community. By 
vari winter from 0 to 2 one go smoothli from a sit- 
uation in which most of the weight be concentr insid 
the clusters, to a situat in which instead the weight be 
concentr between the clusters. from fig. 34 we see 
that weo and pott be more reliabl methods. 

sawardeck et al. have test method to detect 
overlap commun (sawardeck et al., 2009). 
they consid three algorithms: modular opti- 
mization, the cliqu percol method (cpm) (sec- 
tion xi.a) and the modular landscap survey 
method by sales-pardo et al. (sales-pardo et al., 2007) 
(section xii.b). for testing, sawardeck et al. defin 
a class of benchmark graph in which the link prob- 
abil between vertex be an increas function of the 
number of cluster the vertex belong to. We have de-

scribe thi benchmark in section xv.a. It turn out 
that the modular landscap survey method be abl 
to identifi overlap between communities, a long a the 
fraction of overlap vertex be small. curiously, the 
cpm, design to find overlap communities, have a 
poor performance, a the overlap vertex found by 
the algorithm be in gener differ from the overlap- 
ping vertex of the plant partit of the benchmark. 
the author also remark that, if the overlap between two 
cluster be not too small, it may be hard (for ani method) 
to recogn whether the cluster be overlap or hi- 
erarch organized, i. e. loos connect cluster 
within a larg cluster. 

We close the section with some gener remark con- 
cern testing. We have see that a test procedur 
requir two crucial ingredients: benchmark graph with 
built-in commun structur and cluster algorithm 
that tri to recov it. such two element be not inde- 
pendent, however, a they be both base on the concept 
of community. If the underli notion of commun 
for the benchmark and the algorithm be veri different, 
one can hardli expect that the algorithm will do a good 
job on the benchmark. furthermore, there be a third el- 
ement, i. e. the qualiti of a partition. all benchmark 
start from a situat in which commun be clearli 
identified, i. e. connect compon of the graph, and 
introduc some amount of noise, that eventu lead 
to a scenario where cluster be hardli or no longer de- 
tectable. It be then import to keep track of how the 
qualiti of the natur partit of the benchmark worsen 
a the amount of nois increases, in order to distinguish 
configur in which the graph have a cluster struc- 
ture, that an algorithm should then be abl to resolve, 
from configur in which the nois prevail and the 
natur cluster be not meaningful. moreover, qualiti 
function be import to evalu the perform of 
an algorithm on graph whose commun structur be 
unknown. qualiti function be strongli relat to the 
concept of commun a well, a they be suppos to 
evalu the good of the clusters, so they requir a 
clear quantit concept of what a cluster is. It be veri 
import for ani test framework to check for the mu- 
tual depend between the benchmark, the qualiti 
function use to evalu partitions, and the cluster 
algorithm to be tested. thi issu have so far receiv veri 
littl attent (dell et al., 2007). finally, empir 
test be also veri important, a one ultim wish to 
appli cluster techniqu to real graphs. therefore, it 
be crucial to collect more data set of graph whose com- 
muniti structur be know or deduc from inform 
on the vertex and their edges.

varieti of cluster method that one could employ, in 
mani case partit deriv from differ techniqu 
be rather similar to each other, so the gener properti 
of cluster do not depend much on the particular algo- 
rithm used. the analysi of cluster and their properti 
deliv a mesoscop descript of the graph, where the 
communities, and not the vertices, be the elementari 
unit of the topology. the term mesoscop be use be- 
caus the relev scale here lie between the scale of the 
vertex and that of the full graph. 

one of the first issu address be whether the com- 
muniti of a graph be usual about of the same size or 
whether the commun size have some special distribu- 
tion. most cluster techniqu consist find skew 
distribut of commun sizes, with a tail describ 
with good approxim by a power law (at least, a 
sizeabl portion of the curve) with expon in the rang 
between 1 and 3 (clauset et al., 2004; danon et al., 2007; 
newman, 2004a; palla et al., 2005; radicchi et al., 2004). 
so, there seem to be no characterist size for a commu- 
nity: small commun usual coexist with larg ones. 
As an example, fig. 35 show the cumul distribut 
of commun size for a recommend network of the 
onlin vendor amazon.com. vertic be product and 
there be a connect between item A and B if B be 
frequent purchas by buyer of A. recal that the 
cumul distribut be the integr of the probabl 
distribution: if the cumul distribut be a power law 
s−α, the probabl distribut be also a power law with 
expon −(α+ 1). 

leskovec et al. (leskovec et al., 2008) have go one 
step further. they carri out a systemat analysi of 
commun in larg real networks, includ tradit 
and on-lin social networks, technological, inform 

network and web graphs. the main goal be to ass 
the qualiti of commun at variou sizes. As a qual- 
iti function the conduct of the cluster be chosen. 
We remind that the conduct of a cluster be the ratio 
between the cut size of the cluster and the minimum be- 
tween the total degre of the cluster and that of the rest 
of the graph (section iv.a). so, if the cluster be much 
small than the whole graph, the conduct equal 
the ratio between the cut size and the total degre of 
the cluster. sinc a “good” cluster be character by 
a low cut size and a larg intern densiti of edges, low 
valu of the conduct indic good clusters. for 
each real network leskovec et al. deriv the network 
commun profil plot (ncpp), show the minimum 
conduct score among subgraph of a give size a a 
function of the size. interestingly, they found that the 
ncpp of all network they studi have a characteris- 
tic shape: they go downward up until subgraph with 
about 100 vertices, and then they rise monoton for 
larg subgraph (fig. 36). thi seem to suggest that 
commun be well defin onli when they be fairli 
small in size. such small cluster be weakli connect 
to the rest of the graph, often by a singl edg (in thi 
case they be call whiskers), and form the peripheri of 
the network. the other vertex form a big core, in which 
larg cluster be well connect to each other, and be 
therefor bare distinguish (fig. 36). leskovec et 
al. perform low-conduct cut with sever meth- 
ods, to ensur that the result be not a simpl artefact of 
a particular chosen technique. moreover, they have also 
verifi that, for larg real network with know com- 
muniti structur (such as, e.g., the social network of the 
on-lin blog site livejournal, with it user groups), 
the ncpp have the same qualit shape if one take the 
real commun instead of low-conduct subgraphs. 
the analysi by leskovec et al. may shed new light on our 
understand of commun structur and it detect 
in larg networks. the fact that the “best” commun 
appear to have a characterist size of about 100 vertex 
be consist with dunbar conjectur that 150 be the up- 
per size limit for a work human commun (dunbar, 
1998). On the other hand, if larg commun be veri 
mix with each other, a leskovec et al. claim, they 
could hardli be consid communities, and the alleg 
“commun structure” of larg network would be lim- 
ite to their peripher region. the result by leskovec 
et al. may be affect by the properti of conductance, 
and need to be valid with altern approaches. In 
ani case, whatev the valu of the qualiti score of a clus- 
ter may be (low or high), it be necessari to estim the 
signific of the cluster (section xiv), befor decid 
whether it be a meaning structur or not. 

If the commun structur of a graph be known, it 
be possibl to classifi vertex accord to their role 
within their community, which may allow to infer individ- 
ual properti of the vertices. A promis classif 
have be propos by guimerà and amar (guimerà 
and amaral, 2005; guimerà and amaral, 2005). the

ture, wherea the best communities, which be rather small, 
be weakli connect to the core. reprint figur with per-

where κi be the intern degre of i in it cluster si, κ̄si and 
σκsi the averag and standard deviat of the intern 
degre for all vertex of cluster si. the within-modul 
degre be then defin a the z-score of the intern degre 
κi. larg valu of z indic that the vertex have mani 
more neighbor within it commun than most other 
vertex of the community. vertic with z ≥ 2.5 be 
classifi a hubs, if z < 2.5 they be non-hubs. the

degre of i. valu of P close to 1 indic that the 
neighbor of the vertex be uniformli distribut among 
all clusters; if all neighbor be within the cluster of the 
vertex, instead, P = 0. base on the valu of the 
pair (z, P ), guimerà and amar distinguish seven 
role for the vertices. non-hub vertex can be ultra- 
peripher (P ≈ 0), peripher (P < 0.625), connector 
(0.625 < P < 0.8) and kinless vertex (P > 0.8). hub 
vertex be classifi in provinci hub (P <∼ 0.3), 
connector hub (0.3 < P < 0.75) and kinless hub 
(P > 0.75). the region of the z − P plane correspond- 
ing to the seven role be highlight in fig. 37. We 
stress that the actual boundari of the region can be 
chosen rather arbitrarily. On graph without commu- 
niti structure, like erdös-rényi (erdö and rényi, 1959) 



85 

random graph and barabási-albert (barabási and al- 
bert, 1999) graph (section a.3), non-hub be mostli 
kinless vertices. In addition, if there be hubs, like in 
barabási-albert graphs, they be kinless hubs. kinless 
hub (non-hubs) vertex have less than half (one third) of 
their neighbor insid ani cluster, so they be not clearli 
associ to a cluster. On real graphs, the topologi- 
cal role can be correl to function of vertices: in 
metabol networks, for instance, connector hubs, which 
share most edg with vertex of other cluster than their 
own, be often metabolit which be more conserv 
across speci than other metabolites, i. e. they have 
an evolutionari advantag (guimerà and amaral, 2005). 

If commun be overlapping, one can explor other 
statist properties, like the distribut of the over- 
lap and of the vertex memberships. the overlap be de- 
fin a the number of vertex share by each pair of 
overlap clusters; the membership of a vertex be the 
number of commun includ the vertex. both dis- 
tribut turn out to be skewed, so there seem to be no 
characterist valu for the overlap and the membership. 
moreover, one could deriv a network, where the commu- 
niti be the vertex and pair of vertex be connect 
if their correspond commun overlap (palla et al., 
2005). such network seem to have some special proper- 
ties. for instance, the degre distribut be a particular 
function, with an initi exponenti decay follow by 
a slow power law decay31. We stress that the abov 
result have be obtain with the cliqu percol 
method by palla et al. (section xi.a) and it be not clear 
whether other techniqu would confirm them or not. In 
a recent analysi it have be show that the degre dis- 
tribut of the network of commun can be repro- 
duce by assum that the graph grow accord to a 
simpl preferenti attach mechanism, where com- 
muniti with larg degre have an enhanc chanc to 
interact/overlap with new commun (pollner et al., 
2006). 

xvii. applic ON real-world network 

the ultim goal of cluster algorithm be try- 
ing to infer properti of and relationship between 
vertices, that be not avail from direct observa- 
tion/measurement. If the scientif commun agre on 
a set of reliabl techniques, one could then proceed with 
care investig of system in variou domains. So 
far, most work in the literatur on graph cluster fo- 
cuse on the develop of new algorithms, and appli- 
cation be limit to those few benchmark graph that 
one typic us for test (section xv.a). still, there 

31 thi hold for the network consid by palla et al. (palla et al., 
2005) like, e. g., the word associ network (section ii) and a 
coauthorship network of physicists. there be no a priori reason 
to believ that thi result be general. 

be also applic aim at understand real sys- 
tems. some result have be actual mention in the 
previou sections. thi section be suppos to give a fla- 
vor of what can be do by use cluster algorithms. 
therefore, the list of work present here be by no mean 
exhaustive. most studi focu on biolog and social 
networks. We mention a few applic to other type 
of network a well. 

A. biolog network 

the recent abund of genom data have allow u 
to explor the cell at an unpreced depth. A wealth 
of inform be avail on interact involv pro- 
tein and genes, metabol processes, etc. In order to 
studi cellular systems, the graph represent be regu- 
larli used. protein-protein interact network (pin), 
gene regulatori network (grn) and metabol network 
(mn) be meanwhil standard object of investig in 
biolog and bioinformat (junker and schreiber, 2008). 

biolog network be character by a remark 
modular organization, reflect function associ 
between their components. for instance, protein tend 
to be associ in two type of cellular modules: protein 
complex and function modules. A protein complex be 
a group of protein that mutual interact at the same 
time and space, form a sort of physic object. exam- 
ple be transcript factor complexes, protein transport 
and export complexes, etc. function modul instead 
be group of protein take place in the same cellu- 
lar process, even if the interact may happen at dif- 
ferent time and places. exampl be the cdk/cyclin 
module, respons for cell-cycl progression, the yeast 
pheromon respons pathway, etc.. identifi cellular 
modul be fundament to uncov the organ and 
dynam of cell functions. however, the inform on 
cell unit (e. g. proteins, genes) and their interact be 
often incomplete, or even incorrect, due to nois in the 
data produc by the experiments. therefore, infer 
modul from the topolog of cellular network enabl 
one to restrict the set of possibl scenario and can be a 
safe guid for futur experiments. 

rive and galitski (rive and galitski, 2003) stud- 
i the modular organ of a subset of the pin 
of the yeast (saccharomyc cerevisiae), consist of 
the (signaling) protein involv in the process lead- 
ing the microorgan to a filament form. the clus- 
ter be detect with a hierarch cluster tech- 
nique. protein mostli interact with member of their 
own cluster be often essenti proteins; edg between 
modul be import point of communication. spirin 
and mirni (spirin and mirny, 2003) identifi protein 
complex and function modul in yeast with differ 
techniques: cliqu detection, superparamagnet cluster- 
ing (blatt et al., 1996) and optim of cluster edg 
density. they estim the statist signific of the 
cluster by comput the p-valu of see those clus- 



86 

ter in random graph with the same expect degre 
sequenc a the origin network. from the know func- 
tional annot of yeast gene one can see that the 
modul usual group protein with the same or con- 
sistent biolog functions. indeed, in mani cases, the 
modul exactli coincid with know protein complexes. 
the result appear robust if nois be introduc in the 
system, to simul the nois present in the experiment 
data. function modul in yeast be also found by 
chen and yuan (chen and yuan, 2006), who appli the 
algorithm by girvan and newman with a modifi defi- 
nition of edg between (section v.a). the standard 
girvan-newman algorithm have prove to be reliabl to 
detect function modul in pin (dunn et al., 2005). 
the novelti of the work by chen and yuan be it focu 
on weight pins, where the weight come from infor- 
mation deriv through microarray express profiles. 
weight add inform about the system and should 
lead to a more reliabl modular structure. By knock 
out gene in the same structur cluster similar pheno- 
type appeared, suggest that the gene have similar 
biolog roles. moreover, the cluster often contain 
know protein complexes, either entir or to a larg 
extent. finally, chen and yuan be abl to make pre- 
diction of the unknown function of some genes, base on 
the structur modul they belong to: gene function pre- 
diction be the most promis outcom deriv from the 
applic of cluster techniqu to pins. farutin et 
al. (farutin et al., 2006) have adopt a local concept of 
community, and deriv a hierarch decomposit of 
pins, in that the modul identifi at some level becom 
the vertex of a network at the high level. communi- 
tie be overlapping, to account for the fact that protein 
(and whole modules) may have divers biolog func- 
tions. high level structur detect in a human pin cor- 
respond to gener biolog concept like signal trans- 
duction, regul of gene expression, intercellular com- 
munication. sen et al. (sen et al., 2006) identifi protein 
cluster for yeast from the eigenvector of the laplacian 
matrix (section a.2), comput via singular valu de- 
composition. In a recent analysis, lewi et al. (lewi 
et al., 2009) care explor the relationship between 
structur commun of pin and their biolog func- 
tion. commun be detect with the multiresolu- 
tion approach by reichardt and bornholt (reichardt and 
bornholdt, 2006a) (section vi.b). A commun be con- 
sider biolog homogen if the function simi- 
lariti between protein pair of the commun (extract 
through the gene ontolog databas (ashburn et al., 
2000)) be larg than the function similar between all 
protein pair of the network. lewi et al. also specifi 
the comparison to interact and non-interact pro- 
tein pairs. As a result, mani commun turn out to 
be biolog homogeneous, especi if they be not 
too small. moreover, some topolog attribut of com- 
munities, like the within-commun cluster coeffici 
(i.e. the averag valu of the cluster coeffici of 
the vertex of a community, comput by consid 

just the neighbor belong to the community) and link 
densiti (densiti of intern edges), be good indic 
of biolog homogeneity: the former be strongli corre- 
late with biolog homogeneity, independ of the 
commun size, wherea for the latter the correl be 
strong for larg communities. 

metabol network have also be extens investi- 
gated. We have alreadi discuss the “function cartog- 
raphy” design by guimerà and amar (guimerà and 
amaral, 2005; guimerà and amaral, 2005), which appli 
to gener type of networks, not necessarili metabolic. 
A hierarch decomposit of metabol network have 
be deriv by holm et al. (holm et al., 2003), by 
use a hierarch cluster techniqu inspir by the 
algorithm by girvan and newman (section v.a). here, 
vertex be remov base on their between val- 
ues, which be obtain by divid the standard site 
between score (freeman, 1977) by the indegre of 
the respect vertices. A pictur of metabol network 
emerges, in which there be core cluster center at 
hub-substances, surround by outer shell of less con- 
nect substances, and a few other cluster at interme- 
diat scales. In general, cluster at differ scale seem 
to be meaningful, so the whole hierarchi should be take 
into account. 

wilkinson and huberman (wilkinson and huber- 
man, 2004) analyz a network of gene co-occurr 
to find group of relat genes. the network be built 
by connect pair of gene that be mention to- 
gether in the abstract of articl of the medlin databas 
(http://medline.cos.com/). cluster be found with 
a modifi version of the algorithm by girvan and new- 
man, in which edg between be comput by consid- 
ere the shortest path of a small subset of all vertex 
pairs, to gain comput time (section v.a). As a result, 
gene belong to the same cluster turn out to be func- 
tional relat to each other. co-occurr of term be 
also use to extract associ between gene and dis-

B. social network 

network depict social interact between peopl 
have be studi for decad (scott, 2000; wasserman 
and faust, 1994). recent the modern inform and 
commun technolog (ict) have open new in- 
teract mode between individuals, like mobil phone 
commun and onlin interact enabl by the 
internet. such new social exchang can be accur 
monitor for veri larg systems, includ million of 
individuals, whose studi repres a huge opportun 
for social science. commun of social network can 
be friendship circles, group of peopl share common 
interest and/or activities, etc..

of 261 group with more than 100 vertices, which be 
clearli arrang in two main groups, linguist ho- 
mogeneous, reflect the linguist split of belgian pop- 
ulat (fig. 38). tyler et al. (tyler et al., 2003) studi 
a network of e-mail exchang between peopl work 
at HP labs. they appli the same modifi version of 
girvan-newman algorithm that two of the author have 
use to find commun of relat gene (wilkinson and

searchers. 

social network sites, like myspac 
(www.myspace.com), friendster (www.friendster.com), 
facebook (www.facebook.com), etc. have becom 
extrem popular in the last years. they be onlin 
platform that allow peopl to commun with friends, 
send e-mails, solicit opinion on specif issues, spread 
idea and/or fads, etc. traud et al. (traud et al., 2008) 
use anonym facebook data to creat network of 
friendship between student of differ american uni- 
versities, where vertices/stud be connect if they 
be friend on facebook. commun be detect by

of modular (section vi.a.4): the result be further 
refin through addit step á la kernighan-lin 
(section iv.a). one of the goal of the studi be to 
infer relationship between the onlin and offlin life 
of the students. By use demograph inform on 
the students’ populations, one find that commun 
be organ by class year or by hous (dormitory) 
affiliation, depend on the univers (fig. 39). yuta 
et al. (yuta et al., 2007) observ a gap in the commu- 
niti size distribut of a friendship network extract 
from mixi (mixi.jp), the larg social network site 
in japan (a of decemb 2006). commun be 
identifi with the fast greedi modular optim 
by clauset et al. (clauset et al., 2004). the gap occur 
in the intermedi rang of size between 20 and 400, 
where but a few commun be observed. yuta et al. 
introduc a model where peopl form new friendship 
both by “closing” tie with peopl who be friend of 
friends, and by set new link with individu have 
similar interests. In thi way most group turn out to be 
either small or large, and medium size group be rare. 

collabor networks, in which individu be link 
if they be (were) involv in a common activity, have 
be often studi becaus they emb an implicit ob- 
jectiv concept of acquaintance, that be not easi to cap- 
ture in direct social experiments/interviews. for in- 
stance, somebodi may consid anoth individu a 
friend, while the latter may disagree. A collabor 
instead be a proof of a social relationship between indi- 
viduals. the analysi of the structur of scientif collab- 
orat network (newman, 2001) have exert a big influ- 
enc on the develop of the modern network science. 
scientif collabor be associ to coauthorship: two 
scientist be link if they have coauthor at least one 
paper together. inform about coauthorship can 
be extract from differ databas of research papers. 
commun indic group of peopl with common re- 
search interests, i. e. topic or disciplinari groups. In 
the semin paper by girvan and newman (girvan and 
newman, 2002), the author appli their method on a 
collabor network of scientist work at the santa 
Fe institute, and be abl to discrimin between re- 
search divis (fig. 2b). the commun structur of 
scientif collabor network have be investig by 
mani author (danon et al., 2006; donetti and muñoz, 
2004; duch and arenas, 2005; farka et al., 2007; gre- 
gory, 2007; lehmann and hansen, 2007; nepusz et al., 
2008; newman, 2004b, 2006a; noack and rotta, 2009; 
palla et al., 2007, 2005; pujol et al., 2006; radicchi et al., 
2004; reichardt and bornholdt, 2006a; richardson et al., 
2009; s.-w. son et al., 2006; shen et al., 2009; vragović 
and louis, 2006; white and smyth, 2005; zhou, 2003b). 
other type of collabor network have be studi 
too. gleiser and danon (gleiser and danon, 2003) con- 
sider a collabor network of jazz musicians. ver- 
tice be either musicians, connect if they play in the 
same band, or bands, connect if they have a musician 
in common. By appli the algorithm of girvan and 

newman they found that commun reflect both racial 
segreg (with two main group compris onli black 
or white players) and geograph separation, due to the 
differ record locations. 

C. other network 

citat network (de solla price, 1965) have be reg- 
ularli use to understand the citat pattern of author 
and to disclos relationship between disciplines. rosval 
and bergstrom (rosval and bergstrom, 2008) use a ci- 
tation network of over 6000 scientif journal to deriv a 
map of science. they use a cluster techniqu base 
on compress the inform on random walk take 
place on the graph (section ix.b). A random walk fol- 
low the flow of citat from one field to another, and 
the field emerg natur from the cluster analysi 
(fig. 40). the structur of scienc resembl the letter U, 
with the social scienc and engin at the terminals, 
join through a chain includ medicine, molecular bi- 
ology, chemistri and physics. 

reichardt and bornholdt (reichardt and bornholdt, 
2007) perform a cluster analysi on a network built 
from bid data take from the german version of 
ebay (www.ebay.de), the most popular onlin auction 
site. the vertex be bidder and two vertex be con- 
nect if the correspond bidder have express in- 
terest for the same item. cluster be detect with 
the multiresolut modular optim develop 
by the author themselv (reichardt and bornholdt, 
2006a) (section vi.b). In spite of the varieti of item 
that it be possibl to purchas through ebay, about 85% of 
bidder be classifi into a few major clusters, reflect- 
ing bidders’ broad categori of interests. ebay data be 
also examin by jin et al. (jin et al., 2007), who consid- 
ere bid network where the vertex be the individ- 
ual auction and edg be place between auction hav- 
ing at least one common bidder. communities, detect 
with greedi modular optim (newman, 2004b) 
(section vi.a.1), allow to identifi substitut goods, i. e. 
product that have valu for the same bidder, so that 
they can be purchas togeth or alternatively. 

legisl network enabl one to deduc associ 
between politician through their parliamentari activity, 
which may be relat or not to parti affiliation. porter 
and cowork have carri out numer studi on the 
subject (porter et al., 2007, 2005; zhang et al., 2008), 
by use data on the congress of the unit states. In 
refs. (porter et al., 2007, 2005), they examin the com- 
muniti structur of network of committe in the US 
hous of representatives. committe share common 
member be connect by edges, which be weight by

ber one would expect to have if committe membership 
be randomli assigned. hierarch cluster (sec-

network of correl between time seri of stock

year (mantegna, 1999). In earli studies, scholar found 
cluster of correl stock by comput the maximum 
span tree of the network (bonanno et al., 2003, 2000; 
onnela et al., 2003, 2002) (section a.1), and realiz 

that such cluster match quit well the econom sector 
of the stocks. more recently, the commun structur of 
the network have be investig by mean of proper 
cluster algorithms. farka et al. (farka et al., 2007) 
have appli the weight version of the cliqu percola- 
tion method (section xi.a) and found that the presenc 
of two strong (i. e. carri high correlation) edg in tri- 
angl be usual accompani by the presenc of a strong 
third edge. heimo et al. (heimo et al., 2008) use the 
weight version of the multiresolut method by re- 
ichardt and bornholdt (reichardt and bornholdt, 2006a) 
(section vi.b). cluster correspond to relev busi

xviii. outlook 

despit the remot origin and the great popular of 
the last years, research on graph cluster have not yet 
give a satisfactori solut of the problem and leaf 
u with a number of import open issues. from our 
exposit it appear that the field have grown in a rather 
chaotic way, without a precis direct or guidelines. In 
some cases, interest new idea and tool have be pre- 
sented, in other exist method have be improved, 
becom more accur and/or faster. 

what the field lack the most be a theoret frame- 
work that defin precis what cluster algorithm 
be suppos to do. everybodi have his/her own idea of 
what a commun is, and most idea be consist with 
each other, but, a long a there be still disagreement, it 
remain imposs to decid which algorithm do the 
best job and there will be no control on the creation of 
new methods. therefore, we believ that the first and 
foremost task that the scientif commun work on 
graph cluster have to solv in the futur be defin a set 
of reliabl benchmark graphs, against which algorithm 
should be test (section xv.a). defin a benchmark 
go far beyond the issu of testing. It mean design 
practic exampl of graph with communities, and, in 
order to do that, one have to agre on the fundament 
concept of commun and partition. cluster algo- 
rithm have to be devis consist with such defini- 
tions, in order to give the best perform on the set of 
design benchmarks, which repres a sort of ground 
truth. the explos in the number of algorithm we have 
wit in recent time be due precis to the present 
lack of reliabl mechan of control of their qualiti 
and comparison of their performances. If the commu- 
niti agre on a benchmark, the futur develop of 
the field will be more coher and the progress brought 
by new method can be evalu in an unbias man- 
ner. the plant `-partit model (condon and karp, 
2001) be the easi recip one can think of when it come 
to defin clusters, and be the criterion underli well- 
know benchmarks, like that by girvan and newman. 
We believ that the new benchmark have to be defin 
along the same lines. the benchmark graph recent in- 
troduc by lancichinetti et al. (lancichinetti and fortu- 
nato, 2009; lancichinetti et al., 2008) and by sawardeck 
et al. (sawardeck et al., 2009) be an import step in 
thi direction. 

defin a benchmark impli specifi the “natural” 
partit of a graph, the one that ani algorithm should 
find. thi issu in turn involv the concept of qualiti 
of a partition, that have character larg part of the 
develop of the field, in particular after the intro- 
duction of newman-girvan modular (section iii.c.2). 

estim the qualiti of a partit allow to discrimi- 
nate among the larg number of partit of a graph. In 
some case thi be not difficult. for instance, in the bench- 
mark by girvan and newman there be a singl meaning 
partition, and it be hard to argu with that. but most 
graph of the real world have a hierarch structure, 
with commun includ small commun and so 
on. henc there be sever meaning partitions, cor- 
respond to differ hierarch levels, and discrimi- 
nate among them be hard, a they may be all relevant, 
in a sense. If we consid the human body, we cannot 
say that the organ in tissu of the cell be more 
import than the organ in organs. We have see 
that there be recent method deal with the problem of 
find meaning hierarch level (section xii). such 
method rank the hierarch partit base on some 
criterion and one can ass their relev through the 
ranking. one may wonder whether it make sens sort 
out levels, which mean introduc a kind of threshold 
on the qualiti index chosen to rank partit (to dis- 
tinguish “good” from “bad” partitions), or whether it 
be more appropri to keep the inform give by the 
whole set of hierarch partitions. the work by clauset 
et al. on hierarch random graph (clauset et al., 
2007; clauset et al., 2008), discuss in section xii.b, 
indirectli rais thi issue. there it be show that the 
ensembl of model graphs, repres by dendrograms, 
encod most of the inform on the structur of the 
graph at study, like it degre distribution, transit 
and distribut of shortest path lengths. At the same 
time, by construction, the model reveal the whole hier- 
archi of communities, without ani distinct between 
good and bad partitions. the inform give by a 
dendrogram may becom redund and confus when 
the graph be large, a then there be a big number of par- 
titions. thi be actual the reason whi qualiti function 
be origin introduced. however, in that case, one 
be deal with artifici hierarchies, produc by tech- 
niqu that systemat yield a dendrogram a a result 
of the analysi (like, e. g., hierarch clustering), re- 
gardless of whether the graph actual have a hierarch 
structur or not. here instead we speak of real hierarchy, 
which be a fundament element of real graph and, a 
such, it must be consid in ani seriou approach to 
graph clustering. ani good cluster method must be 
abl to tell whether a graph have commun structur or 
not, and, in the first case, whether the commun struc- 
ture be hierarch (i. e. with two or more levels) or flat 
(one level). We expect that the concept of hierarchi will 
becom a key ingredi of futur cluster techniques. 
In particular, assess the consist of the concept of 
partitions’ qualiti and hierarch structur be a major 
challenge. 

A precis definit of null models, i. e. of graph with- 
out commun structure, be also missing. thi aspect be 
extrem important, though, a defin commun 
also impli decid whether or not they exist in a spe- 
cific graph. At the moment, it be gener accept that 



91 

random graph have no communities. the null model 
of modular (section iii.c.2), by far the most popu- 
lar, compris all graph with the same expect degre 
sequenc of the origin graph and random rewir of 
edges. thi class of graph be characterized, by construc- 
tion, by the fact that ani vertex can be link to ani 
other, a long a the constraint on the degre sequenc 
be satisfied. but thi be by no mean the onli possibility. 
A commun can be gener defin a a subgraph 
whose vertex have a high probabl to be connect 
to the other vertex of the subgraph than to extern 
vertices. the plant `-partit model (condon and 
karp, 2001) be base on thi principle, a we have seen. 
however, thi do not mean that the link probabili- 
tie of a vertex with respect to the other vertex in it 
commun or in differ commun be constant (or 
simpli proport to their degrees, a in the configura- 
tion model ( luczak, 1992; molloy and reed, 1995)). In 
fact, in larg network it be reason to assum that the 
probabl that a vertex be link to most vertex be zero, 
a the vertex “ignores” their existence. thi do not ex- 
clude that the probabl that the vertex get connect 
to the “known” vertex be the same (or proport to 
their degrees), in which case the graph would still be ran- 
dom and have no communities. We believ that we be 
still far from a precis definit and a complet clas- 
sific of null models. thi repres an import 
research line for the futur of the field, for three main rea- 
sons: 1) to good disentangl “true” commun from 
byproduct of random fluctuations; 2) to pose a stringent 
test to exist and futur cluster algorithms, whose 
reliabl would be question if they found “fals pos- 
itives” in null model graphs; 3) to handl “hybrid” sce- 
narios, where a graph display commun structur on 
some portion of it, while the rest be essenti random 
and have no communities. 

In the previou chapter we have see a great number 
of cluster techniques. which one(s) shall we use? At 
the moment the scientif commun be unabl to tell. 
modular optim be probabl the most popular 
method, but the result of the analysi of larg graph 
be like to be unreli (section vi.c). nevertheless, 
peopl have becom accustom to use it, and there have 
be sever attempt to improv the measure. A new- 
comer, who wish to find cluster in a give network 
and be not familiar with cluster techniques, would not 
know, off-hand, which method to use, and he/sh would 
hardli find indic about good method in ani singl 
paper on graph clustering, except perhap on the method 
present in the paper. so, peopl keep use algorithm 
becaus they have heard of them, or becaus they know 
that other peopl be use them, or becaus of the rep- 
utat of the scientist who design them. wait 
for futur reliabl benchmarks, that may give an objec- 
tive assess of the qualiti of the algorithms, there 
be at the moment hardli solid reason to prefer an algo- 
rithm to another: the compar analysi by danon et 
al. (danon et al., 2005) and by lancichinetti and fortu- 

nato (lancichinetti and fortunato, 2009) (section xv.c) 
repres a first seriou assess of thi issue. however, 
we want to stress that there be no such thing a the perfect 
method, so it be pointless to look for it. among the other 
things, if one tri to look for a veri gener method, that 
should give good result on ani type of graphs, one be in- 
evit forc to make veri gener assumpt on the 
structur of the graph and on the properti of communi- 
ties. In thi way one neglect a lot of specif featur of 
the system, that may lead to a more accur detect 
of the clusters. inform a method with featur charac- 
teriz some type of graph make it far more reliabl 
to detect the commun structur of those graph than a 
gener method, even if it applic may be limited. 
therefor in the futur we envis the develop of 
domain-specif cluster techniques. the challeng here 
be to identifi the peculiar featur of class of graphs, 
which be bound to becom crucial ingredi in the de- 
sign of suitabl algorithms. some of the method avail- 
abl today be actual base on assumpt that hold 
onli for some specif categori of graphs. the cliqu 
percol method by palla et al. (palla et al., 2005), 
for instance, may work well for graph character by 
a larg number of cliques, like certain social networks, 
wherea it may give poor result otherwise. 

move one step further, one should learn how to use 
specif inform about a graph, whenev available, 
e. g. properti of vertex and/or partial inform 
about their classification. for instance, it may be that 
one have some inform on a subset of vertices, like 
demograph data on peopl of a social network, and such 
data may highlight relationship between peopl that be 
not obviou from the network of social interactions. In 
thi case, use onli the social network may be reduct 
and ideal one should exploit both the structur and 
the non-structur inform in the search of clusters, 
a the latter should be consist with both inputs. how 
to do thi be an open problem. the scientif commun 
have just begin to studi thi aspect (allahverdyan and 
galstyan, 2009). 

most algorithm in the literatur deal with the “clas- 
sical” case of a graph with undirect and unweight 
edges. thi be certainli the simplest case one could think 
of, and graph cluster be alreadi a complex task on such 
type of graphs. We know that real network may be 
directed, have weight connections, be bipartite. meth- 
od to deal with such system have be developed, a 
we have seen, especi in the most recent literature, 
but they be mostli preliminari attempt and there be 
room for improvement. anoth situat that may oc- 
cur in real system be the presenc of edg with posi- 
tive and neg weights, indic attract and re- 
pulsiv interactions, respectively. thi be the case, for 
instance, of correl data (mantegna, 1999). In thi 
case, ideal partit would have posit weight intr- 
aclust edg and neg weight interclust edges. 
We have discuss some studi in thi direct (gómez 
et al., 2009; kaplan and forrest, 2008; traag and brugge- 



92 

man, 2009), but we be just at the begin of thi en- 
deavour. instead, there be no algorithm yet which be 
capabl to deal with graph in which there be edg of 
sever types, indic differ kind of interact 
between the vertex (multigraphs). agent of social net- 
works, for instance, may be join by work relation- 
ships, friendship, famili ties, etc. At the moment there 
be essenti two way of proceed in these instances: 
1) keep edg of one type and forget the others, 
repeat the analysi for each type of edg and eventu- 
alli compar the result obtained; 2) analyz a singl 
(weighted) graph, obtain by “combining” the contribu- 
tion of the differ type of edg in some way. finally, 
sinc most real network be built through the result 
of experiments, which carri error in their estimates, it 
would be use to consid a well the case in which edg 
have not onli associ weights, but also error on their 
values. 

sinc the paper by palla et al. (palla et al., 2005), 
overlap commun have receiv a lot of attent 
(section xi). however, there be still no consensu about 
a quantit definit of the concept of overlap 
community, and most definit depend on the method 
adopted. intuitively, one would expect that cluster share 
vertex lie at their borders, and thi idea have inspir 
most algorithms. however, cluster detect with the 
cliqu percol method (section xi.a) often share 
central vertex of the clusters, which make sens in spe- 
cific instances, especi in social networks. so, it be still 
unclear how to character overlap vertices. more- 
over, the concept of overlap cluster seem at odd 
with that of hierarch structure. No dendrogram can 
be drawn if there be overlap vertices, at least in the 
standard way. due to the relev of both featur in 
real networks, it be necessari to adapt them to each other 
in a consist way. overlap vertex pose problem 
a well when it come to compar the result of differ 
method on the same graph. most similar measur 
be defin onli in the case of partitions, where each ver- 
tex be assign to a singl cluster (section xv.b). It be 
then necessari to extend such definit to the case of 
overlap communities, whenev possible. 

anoth issu that be get increasingli more popular 
be the studi of graph evolv in time. thi be now pos- 
sibl due to the avail of timestamp network data 
sets. track the evolut of commun structur in 
time be veri important, to uncov how commun be 
gener and how they interact with each other. schol- 
ar have just begin to studi thi problem (asur et al., 
2007; chakrabarti et al., 2006; chi et al., 2007; fenn 
et al., 2009; hopcroft et al., 2004; kim and han, 2009; 
lin et al., 2008; palla et al., 2007; sun et al., 2007) (sec- 
tion xiii). typic one analyz separ snapshot 
at differ time and check what happen at time t+1 
to the commun at time t. It would be probabl bet- 
ter to use simultan the whole dynam data set, 
and futur work shall aim at defin proper way to do 
that. In thi respect, the evolutionari cluster frame- 

work by chakrabarti et al. (chakrabarti et al., 2006) be 
a promis start point. 

the comput complex of graph cluster al- 
gorithm have improv by at least one power in the graph 
size (on average) in just a coupl of years. due to the 
larg size of mani system one wish to investigate, the 
ultim goal would be to design techniqu with lin- 
ear or even sublinear complexity. nowaday partit 
in graph with up to million of vertex can be found. 
however, the result be not yet veri reliable, a they be 
usual obtain by greedi optimizations, which yield 
rough approxim of the desir solution. In thi 
respect the situat could improv by focu on the 
develop of effici local methods, for two reasons: 
1) they enabl analysi of portion of the graph, indepen- 
dentli of the rest; 2) they be often suitabl for parallel 
implementations, which may speed up consider the 
computation. 

finally, if there have be a tremend effort in the de- 
sign of cluster algorithms, basic noth have be 
do to make sens of their results. what shall we do 
with communities? what can they tell u about a sys- 
tem? the hope be that they will enabl one to disclos 
“hidden” relationship between vertices, due to featur 
that be not known, becaus they be hard to measure, 
for instance. It be quit possibl that the scientif com- 
muniti will converg sooner or late to a definit a 
posteriori of community. alreadi now, most algorithm 
yield similar result in practic applications. but what 
be the relationship between the vertex classif give 
by the algorithm and real classifications? thi be the 
main question beneath the whole endeavor.

appendix A: element of graph theori 

1. basic definit 

A graph G be a pair of set (v,e), where V be a set 
of vertex or node and E be a subset of V 2, the set of 
unord pair of element of V . the element of E be 
call edg or links, the two vertex that identifi an edg 
be call endpoints. An edg be adjac to each of it 
endpoints. If each edg be an order pair of vertex one 
have a direct graph (or digraph). In thi case an order 
pair (v, w) be an edg direct from v to w, or an edg 
begin at v and end at w. A graph be visual a 
a set of point connect by lines, a show in fig. 41.

fig. 41 A sampl graph with seven vertex and seven edges. 

In mani real examples, graph be weighted, i. e. a real 
number be associ to each of the edges. graph do not 
includ loops, i. e. edg connect a vertex to itself, nor 
multipl edges, i. e. sever edg join the same pair of 
vertices. graph with loop and multipl edg be call 
multigraphs. gener of graph admit edg 
between ani number of vertex (not necessarili two) be 
call hypergraphs. 

A graph G′ = (V ′, e′) be a subgraph of G = (v,e) if 
V ′ ⊂ V and E′ ⊂ E. If G′ contain all edg of G that join 
vertex of V ′ one say that the subgraph G′ be induc 
or span by V ′. A partit of the vertex set V in two 
subset S and V − S be call a cut; the cut size be the 
number of edg of G join vertex of S with vertex 
of V − S. 

We indic the number of vertex and edg of a 
graph with n and m, respectively. the number of vertex 
be the order of the graph, the number of edg it size. 
the maximum size of a graph equal the total number of 
unord pair of vertices, n(n − 1)/2. If |V | = n and 
|e| = m = n(n− 1)/2, the graph be a cliqu (or complet 
graph), and be indic a kn. two vertex be neigh- 
bor (or adjacent) if they be connect by an edge. the 
set of neighbor of a vertex v be call neighborhood, and 
we shall denot it with γ(v). the degre kv of a vertex v 
be the number of it neighbors. the degre sequenc be the 
list of the degre of the graph vertices, kv1 , kv2 , ..., kvn . 
On direct graphs, one distinguish two type of degre 
for a vertex v: the indegree, i. e. the number of edg be- 
gin at v and the outdegree, i. e. the number of edg 
end at v. the analogu of degre on a weight graph 
be the strength, i. e. the sum of the weight of the edg 
adjac to the vertex. anoth use local properti of 
graph be transit or cluster (watt and strogatz, 
1998), which indic the level of cohes between the 
neighbor of a vertex 32. the cluster coeffici cv of 

32 the term cluster be commonli adopt to indic commu- 
niti detect in some disciplines, like comput science, and we 

vertex v be the ratio between the number of edg join 
pair of neighbor of v and the total number of possibl 
edges, give by kv(kv − 1)/2, kv be the degre of v. 
accord to thi definition, cv measur the probabil- 
iti that a pair of neighbor of v be connected. sinc 
all neighbor of v be connect to v by definition, edg 
connect pair of neighbor of v form triangl with 
v. thi be whi the definit be often give in term of 
number of triangles. 

A path be a graph P = (V (p), e(p)), with V (p) = 
{x0, x1, ..., xl} and e(p) = {x0x1, x1x2, ..., xl−1xl}. the 
vertex x0 and xl be the endvertic of P, wherea l 
be it length. given the notion of vertices, edg and 
paths, one can defin the concept of independence. A set 
of vertex (or edges) of a graph be independ if no two 
element of them be adjacent. similarly, two path be 
independ if they onli share the endvertices. A cycl 
be a close path whose vertex and edg be all distinct. 
cycl of length l be indic with cl. the small 
non-trivi cycl be the triangle, c3. 

path allow to defin the concept of connect and 
distanc in graphs. A graph be connect if, give ani 
pair of vertices, there be at least one path go from 
one vertex to the other. In general, there may be multi- 
ple path connect two vertices, with differ lengths. 
A shortest path, or geodesic, between two vertex of a 
graph, be a path of minim length. such minim length 
be the distanc between the two vertices. the diamet 
of a connect graph be the maxim distanc between 
two vertices. If there be no path between two vertices, 
the graph be divid in at least two connect subgraphs. 
each maxim connect subgraph of a graph be call 
connect component. 

A graph without cycl be a forest. A connect forest 
be a tree. tree be veri import in graph theori and 
deserv some attention. In a tree, there can be onli one 
path from a vertex to ani other. In fact, if there be 
at least two path between the same pair of vertex they 
would form a cycle, while the tree be an acycl graph by 
definition. further, the number of edg of a tree with 
n vertex be n − 1. If ani edg of a tree be removed, 
it would get disconnect in two parts; if a new edg be 
added, there would be at least one cycle. thi be whi a 
tree be a minim connected, maxim acycl graph 
of a give order. everi connect graph contain a span- 
ning tree, i. e. a tree share all vertex of the graph. 
On weight graphs, one can defin a minimum (maxi- 
mum) span tree, i. e. a span tree such that the 
sum of the weight on the edg be minim (maximal). 
minimum and maximum span tree be often use in 
graph optim problems, includ clustering. 

A graph G be bipartit if the vertex set V be separ in 

often use it in thi context throughout the manuscript. We 
paid attent to disambigu the occurr in which cluster- 
ing indic instead the local properti of a vertex neighborhood 
describ here.

two disjoint subset V1 and v2, or classes, and everi edg 
join a vertex of V1 with a vertex of v2. the definit 
can be extend to that of r-partition, where the vertex 
class be r and no edg join vertex within the same 
class. In thi case one speak of multipartit graphs. 

2. graph matric 

the whole inform about the topolog of a graph 
of order n be entail in the adjac matrix A, which 
be an n × n matrix whose element aij equal 1 if there 
be an edg join vertex i and j, otherwis it be zero. 
due to the absenc of loop the diagon element of the 
adjac matrix be all zero. for an undirect graph 
A be a symmetr matrix. the sum of the element of 
the i-th row or column yield the degre of node i. If 
the edg be weighted, one defin the weight matrix 
W, whose element wij express the weight of the edg 
between vertex i and j. 

the spectrum of a graph G be the set of eigenvalu 
of it adjac matrix A. spectral properti of graph 
matrix play an import role in the studi of graphs. 
for instance, the stochast matrix rule the process of 
diffus (random walk) on a graph. the right stochast 
matrix R be obtain from A by divid the element of 
each row i by the degre of vertex i. the left stochas- 
tic matrix T, or transfer matrix, be the transpos of R. 
the spectrum of stochast matrix allow to evaluate, for 
instance, the mix time of the random walk, i. e. the 
time it take to reach the stationari distribut of the 
process. the latter be obtain by comput the eigen- 
vector of the transfer matrix correspond to the larg 
eigenvalue. 

anoth import matrix be the laplacian L = d−a, 
where D be the diagon matrix whose element dii equal 
the degre of vertex i. the matrix L be usual refer 
to a unnorm laplacian. In the literatur one of- 
ten us normal laplacian (chung, 1997), of which 
there be two main forms: lsym = D 

−1/2ld−1/2 and 
lrw = D 

−1l = I −d−1a = I − T. the matrix lsym 
be symmetric; lrw be not symmetr and be close re- 
late to a random walk take place on the graph. all 
laplacian matrix have a straightforward extens to 
the case of weight graphs. the laplacian be one of the 
most studi matrix and find applic in mani dif- 
ferent contexts, like graph connect (bollobas, 1998), 
synchron (barahona and pecora, 2002; nishikawa 
et al., 2003), diffus (chung, 1997) and graph parti- 
tion (pothen, 1997). By construction, the sum of the 
element of each row of the laplacian (normal or un- 
normalized) be zero. thi impli that L alway have at 
least one zero eigenvalue, correspond to the eigenvec- 
tor with all equal components, such a (1, 1, ..., 1). eigen- 
vector correspond to differ eigenvalu be all or- 
thogon to each other. interestingly, L have a mani 
zero eigenvalu a there be connect compon in the 
graph. so, the laplacian of a connect graph have but 

one zero eigenvalue, all other be positive. eigenvec- 
tor of laplacian matrix be regularli use in spectral 
cluster (section iv.d). In particular, the eigenvector 
correspond to the second small eigenvalue, call 
fiedler vector (fiedler, 1973, 1975), be use for graph bi- 
partitioning, a describ in section iv.a. 

3. model graph 

In thi section we present the most popular model of 
graph introduc to describ real systems, at least to 
some extent. such graph be use null model in com- 
muniti detection, a they do not have commun struc- 
ture, so they can be use for neg test of cluster 
algorithms. 

the old model be that of random graph, propos 
by solomonoff and rapoport (solomonoff and rapoport, 
1951) and independ by erdö and rényi (erdö and 
rényi, 1959). there be two parameters: the number of 
vertex n and the connect probabl p. each pair 
of vertex be connect with equal probabl p indepen- 
dentli of the other pairs. the expect number of edg 
of the graph be pn(n−1)/2, and the expect mean degre 
〈k〉 = p(n − 1). the degre distribut of the vertex 
of a random graph be binomial, and in the limit n→∞, 
p → 0 for fix 〈k〉 it converg to a poissonian. there- 
fore, the vertex have all about the same degree, close 
to 〈k〉 (fig. 42, top). the most strike properti of thi 
class of graph be the phase transit observ by vary- 
ing 〈k〉 in the limit n → ∞. for 〈k〉 < 1, the graph be 
separ in connect components, each of them be 
microscopic, i. e. occupi but a vanish portion of 
the system size. for 〈k〉 > 1, instead, one of the com- 
ponent becom macroscop (giant component), i. e. it 
occupi a finit fraction of the graph vertices. 

the diamet of a random graph with n vertex be veri 
small, grow onli logarithm with n. thi prop- 
erti (small-world effect) be veri common in mani real 
graphs. the first evid that social network be char- 
acter by path of small length be provid by a se- 
rie of famou experi conduct by the phychologist 
stanley milgram (milgram, 1967; traver and milgram, 
1969). the expect cluster coeffici of a vertex of a 
random graph be p, a the probabl for two vertex to 
be connect be the same whether they be neighbor of 
the same vertex or not. real graphs, however, be char- 
acter by far high valu of the cluster coeffici 
a compar to random graph of the same size. watt 
and strogatz (watt and strogatz, 1998) show that the 
small world properti and high cluster coeffici can 
coexist in the same system. they design a class of 
graph which result from an interpol between a reg- 
ular lattice, which have high cluster coefficient, and a 
random graph, which have the small-world property. one 
start from a ring lattic in which each vertex have degre 
k, and with a probabl p each edg be rewir to a dif- 
ferent target vertex (fig. 42, center). It turn out that

low valu of p suffic to reduc consider the length 
of shortest path between vertices, becaus rewir edg 
act a shortcut between initi remot region of the 
graph. On the other hand, the cluster coeffici re- 
main high, sinc few rewir edg do not perturb ap- 
preciabl the local structur of the graph, which remain 
similar to the origin ring lattice. for p = 1 all edg be 
rewir and the result structur be a random graph á 
la erdö and rényi. 

the semin paper of watt and strogatz trigger a 
huge interest toward the graph represent of real 
systems. one of the most import discoveri be that 
the distribut of the vertex degre of real graph be veri 
heterogen (albert et al., 1999), with mani vertex 
have few neighbor coexist with some vertex with 
mani neighbors. In sever case the tail of thi distri- 
bution can be describ a a power law with good ap- 
proximation33, henc the express scale-fre networks. 
such degre heterogen be respons for a number of 
remark featur of real networks, such a resili to 
random failures/attack (albert et al., 2000), and the ab- 
senc of a threshold for percol (cohen et al., 2000) 
and epidem spread (pastor-satorra and vespignani, 
2001). the most popular model of a graph with a power 
law degre distribut be the model by barabási and al- 
bert (barabási and albert, 1999). A version of the model 
for direct graph have be propos much earli by de 
solla price (price, 1976), build up on previou idea 
develop by simon (simon, 1955). the graph be creat 
with a dynam procedure, where vertex be add one 
by one to an initi core. the probabl for a new vertex 
to set an edg with a preexist vertex be proport 
to the degre of the latter. In thi way, vertex with high 
degre have larg probabl of be select a neigh- 
bor by new vertices; if thi happens, their degre further 
increas so they will be even more like to be chosen in 
the future. In the asymptot limit of infinit number of 
vertices, thi rich-gets-rich strategi gener a graph 
with a degre distribut character by a power-law 
tail with expon 3. In fig. 42 (bottom) we show an 
exampl of barabási-albert (ba) graph. the cluster- 
ing coeffici of a BA graph decay with the size of the 
graph, and it be much low than in real networks. more- 
over, the power law decay of the degre distribut 
observ in real network be character by a rang 
of exponents’ valu (usual between 2 and 3), wherea 
the BA model yield a fix value. however, mani re- 
finement of the BA model a well a plenti of differ- 
ent model have be late introduc to account more 
close for the featur observ in real system (for de- 
tail see (albert and barabási, 2002; barrat et al., 2008; 

33 the power law be howev not necessari to explain the properti 
of complex networks. It be enough that the tail of the degre 
distribut be “fat”, i. e. span order of magnitud in 
degree. they may or may not be accur fit by a power 
law.
