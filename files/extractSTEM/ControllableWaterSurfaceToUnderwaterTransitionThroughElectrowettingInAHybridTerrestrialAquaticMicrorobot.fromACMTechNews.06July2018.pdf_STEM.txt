mani anim speci 
1–5 exhibit multimod locomot 

capabl in terrestri and aquat environ to 
evad predat or search for prey. A few arachnids3 

and insects4 can move on the surfac of water by exploit static 
surfac tension. the surfac tension forc significantli exce 
(over 10 times) their bodi weight, enabl rapid locomot and 
even jump without break the water surface6. remark 
some insects, such a dive flies4 and dive beetles7,8, can also 
gener enough forc to spontan break the water surfac to 
swim, feed, and lay egg underwater. the abil to move on the 
water surface, control transit into water, and swim 
underwat enabl these creatur to live in complex environ- 
ment (e.g., high salin environ such a the mono lake4) 
that most anim cannot survive. 

robot that can travers complex terrains, such a hybrid 
terrestrial-aquat environments, be suitabl for divers 
applic in environment monitor and the explor 
of confin spaces. take inspir from nature, mani 
robot prototypes9–12 have be develop for terrestrial-aquat 
locomotion. most of these amphibi robots, however, weigh 
over 100 g and cannot move on the water surfac due to their 
larg weight-to-s ratio9–12. microrobot (mass<20 g, 
length<15 cm) have a small weight-to-s ratio, and they can 
leverag surfac effects, such a electrostat or surfac tension, 
to perch on compliant surfaces13 or move on the surfac of 
water14–19. thi confer sever potenti advantages; for example, 
microrobot can avoid submerg obstacl by return to the 
water surface. furthermore, microrobot experi small drag 
on the water surfac due to reduc wet area, which lead to 
high locomot speed compar to swim underwater. 
these hybrid locomot capabl could potenti allow 
microrobot to explor divers environ that be inaccess 
to larg robots. 

previou work14–20 on water strider-inspir microrobot 
leverag insight from studi of biolog water striders21. 
these robot weigh 6–20 g, be 8–15 cm long, and use hydro- 
phobic wire for support on the water surface. these devic be 
use to investig the biomechan of water striders22,23, studi 
the associ fluid mechanics21, and enabl microrobot loco- 
motion on the water surface. actual water strider be ~1 cm long 
and weigh 4.5 mg, and they be over 10 time small and 
1000 time lighter than these microrobots. sinc the surfac 
tension forc scale linearli with the leg contact length and mass 
scale with length cubed, these robot need to use support leg 
that be substanti longer than their bodies. these support 
leg creat challeng for locomot in other environments, such 
a on land or underwater. 

In thi study, we develop a 1.6 g quadruped microrobot that 
be capabl of walk on land, move on the surfac of water, and 
transit between land, the water surface, and aquat 
environ (supplementari movi 1). We address two chal- 
leng that be unexamin in previou studies: gait design for 
multimod locomotion24 in terrestri and aquat environments, 
and strategi for transit between these environments. first, 
we develop gait for locomot on land and the water surfac 
util a quadruped robot with two independ control 
degrees-of-freedom (dofs) in each leg. second, we design “feet” 
that util both surfac tension and surfac tension induc 
buoyanc to gener the necessari support forc without 
inhibit terrestri locomotion. the “feet” util electrowet- 
ting25–27 to break the water surface. electrowet refer to the 
chang of the liquid to solid surfac contact angl in respons to 
an appli voltage, and it be commonli found in microfluid 
or electron paper display applications26. We further examin 
the influenc of surfac tension on the robot dure underwater- 
to-land transitions. design chang to the robot’ leg and 

transmiss (compar to a previou version28) allow it to 
overcom a forc that be twice it bodi weight and break the water 
surfac to transit back onto land. 

In summary, thi work develop multimod strategi for 
locomot in terrestri and aquat environments, describ 
novel mesoscal devic for water surfac to underwat transi- 
tions, and analyz the influenc of surfac tension on microrobot 
aquat to terrestri transitions. these studi culmin in the 
first terrestrial-aquat microrobot that adapt to complex 
environments, repres advanc in mesoscal fabric 
and microrobot locomot capabilities. 

result 
robot design and demonstration. We base our robot design 
on the harvard ambulatori microrobot (hamr), which be a 
1.43 g quadruped robot with eight independ actuat 
dofs29. two piezoelectr actuat control the swing (fore/aft) 
and lift (vertical) motion of each leg. the robot be fabric base 
on the pc-mem process28,30 and the robot transmiss be 
make of compliant 25 µm polyimid flexur (kapton, dupont). 
In previou studies28,29, a number of walk gait such a the 
trot, pronk, and jump be show to be capabl of high speed 
locomot on land. 

sever design modif be implement (fig. 1a) to 
enabl locomot on the water surface, control sinking, and 
transit from underwat to land. the leg be equip with 
passive, unidirect flap to facilit swim (fig. 1b), and 
with electrowet pad (ewp-fig. 1c) to gener surfac 
tension and buoyant forc to support the robot’ weight on 
the water surface. To break the water surfac and transit into 
water, the ewp util electrowet to modifi surfac 
wettability. In addition, design modif be make to the 
robot’ chassi and circuit board to reduc the volum of air 
trap dure sinking. To avoid short underwater, the 
circuitri be coat in ~10 µm of parylen C. finally, the robot 
transmiss be manual stiffen approxim two time to 
improv vehicl payload, which allow a submerg robot to 
break the water surfac and transit back to land. 

thi robot can walk on level ground, transit from ground 
onto the water surface, swim on the water surfac to evad 
underwat obstacles, sink into water by actuat it ewps, 
walk underwater, and transit back onto land by climb an 
inclin (fig. 2a, and supplementari movi 1). figur 2b show 
a correspond experiment demonstr of robot locomo- 
tion. the robot move at a speed of 7 cm s−1 use a 10 Hz trot 
gait on level ground. To walk from land onto the water surfac 
(fig. 2c, and supplementari movi 2), the robot walk down a 
7° inclin use a trot gait with a 1 Hz stride frequenc to avoid 
break the water surfac in thi process. onc the robot be 
afloat, it swim (fig. 2d, and supplementari movi 3) at a 
speed of 2.8 cm s−1 use a 5 Hz swim gait. To dive into 
water, the actuat be switch off and a 600 V signal be 
appli to the ewps. the local induc electr field modifi 
the surfac wettability, reduc the surfac tension force, and 
caus the robot to sink into water (supplementari movi 4). 
onc the robot sink to the bottom, it can walk underwat 
(fig. 2e, supplementari movi 5) use a trot gait at stride 
frequenc up to 4 hz. To transit back onto land, the robot 
climb an inclin of up to 6° and gradual move through the 
water-air interfac (fig. 2f, g, and supplementari movi 6). 
further, the robot can demonstr turn on land, on the 
water surface, and underwat to avoid obstacles. In the 
follow sections, we describ detail result on robot 
swim and transit between land, the water surface, and 
underwat environments.

float and control sink through electrowetting. one 
of the major challeng in develop a robot capabl of move 
on the water surfac be to support the robot’ weight. previous 
develop water strider-inspir robots5,16,18 be 10 time larg 
and 100–1000 time heavier than natur water striders, and they 
reli on multiple, non-mov leg to support themselv on the 
water surface. such a design limit these robots’ abil to move 
through clutter environ and to travers other type of 
terrains. here, we develop a novel design that substanti 
reduc leg length, enabl control sink through electro- 
wetting, and allow for multimod locomot on land, on the 
water surface, and underwater. 

An ewp (fig. 3a) be instal on each leg of hamr. the ewp 
be ~1 cm in diameter, and it be make of a fold 5 µm thick copper 
sheet coat by 15 µm parylen (see methods). thi hydrophobic, 
dielectr coat insul the copper from water. unlik 
previou water surfac support devic that onli util surfac 
tension, our devic reli on surfac tension and surfac tension 
induc buoyancy. the maximum net upward forc gener by 
our devic be give by: 

F ¼ �γl co θ þ ρwgahw ð1þ 

where γ be the water surfac tension coefficient, L be the net 
contact length, θ be the contact angl between parylen C and 
water, ρW be the water density, g be the gravity, A be the ewp’ flat 
area, and hw be the maximum deform of the water surfac 
befor breaking. the valu of hw relat to the contact 
angl between the ewp and the water surface, and consequ 
the buoyanc term be depend on the surfac tension. the 
depend of hw on contact angl will be specifi in equat 
(4), and the valu of the constant be give in supplementari 
tabl 1. for our ewp design, equat (1) estim that surfac 
tension contribut ~25% of the net upward force, and surfac 
tension induc buoyanc forc account for the rest. 
We note that the buoyanc contribut becom even more 
import than surfac tension in heavier (>1 g) water stride 
robot becaus contact area grow faster than contact length a 
robot size increases. our robot weigh 1.65 gram, and it can carri 
1.44 gram of addit payload on the water surface. thi 
addit payload allow the robot to paddl it leg (up to 10 

hz) without break the water surfac (supplementari movi 4), 
which be crucial for robot locomotion. 

thi devic further enabl control and repeat 
transit through the water surface. We defin transit 
control a the robot’ abil to dive into water at a desir 
locat and time. thi form of control be absent in a 
previou study24 that demonstr transit by coat a 
microrobot with a surfactant. furthermore, we be onli 
concern with sink in shallow (<15 cm) and undisturb 
water. under these condit and without control of the robot’ 
pose dure sinking, the robot alway land on it foot becaus 
it center of mass be low than it geometr center. the ewp 
initi sink with the electrowet process—th modif 
of a surface’ wet properti under an appli electr field. 
when a voltag be appli to a conduct surfac coat with a 
dielectr layer, there be a reduct of the contact angl between 
an electrolyt and the solid surface. thi reduct of contact 
angl lead to two effect that enabl sinking: surfac tension 
reduct and spontan wetting. 

first, the electrowet process reduc surfac tension by 
reduc the contact angl between the ewp’ vertic wall and 
the meniscu surfac (fig. 3b). when a 600 V signal be sent to the 
ewp, an electr field perpendicular to the meniscu surfac 
(parallel to the free water surface) be gener and it lead to a 
chang of the contact angl govern by: 

co θ ¼ co θN þ 
ϵ0ϵl 
2γdh 

v2: ð2þ 

here ϵ0 be the permitt of free space, ϵl be the rel 
permittivity, dH be the dielectr coat thickness, θN be the 
nomin contact angle, and V be the appli voltage. thi 
reduct of contact angl reduc the upward surfac tension 
forc govern by the first term of equat (1). accord to 
equat (2), a hydrophob coat (θn > 90°) can becom 
hydrophil (θ < 90°) under a larg voltag input, which chang 
the weight-bear surfac tension forc to a downward pull 
force. 

the ewp’ vertic wall be import for reduc surfac 
tension becaus they low the requir oper voltag and 
mitig the problem of dielectr breakdown. without the

vertic walls, the fring electr field gener by the ewp’ 
horizont surfac be much weaker. thi requir a high 
input voltag to achiev a similar reduct in contact angle, 
and can potenti caus dielectr breakdown of the insul 
parylen coating. compar to a flat foot pad, the ewp’ 
vertic wall strengthen the electr field between the devic 
and the water surfac meniscu (fig. 3b) under the same input 
voltage. the conflict relationship between contact angl 
reduct and dielectr breakdown be illustr in supple- 
mentari figur 1a. the quadrat curv show the requir 
voltag that achiev a 100° contact angl reduct a a 
function of coat thickness, and the straight line show the 
maximum ewp oper voltag befor dielectr breakdown. 
the intersect of these line predict the minimum requir 
coat thickness. To account for coat inhomogen of the 
fabric process and the contact angl satur effect, 

we choos a coat thick of 15 µm and an oper 
voltag of 600 V. 

the height of the ewp’ vertic sidewal can be determin 
by analyz the water meniscu profile31. the meniscu height 
(fig. 3b) near the vertic sidewal relat to the local contact 
angle: 

hv ¼

2ð1� sin θÞ 

p 
k�1; ð3þ 

where k�1 ¼ ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiγ=ρgp and it be defin a the characterist length. 
thi formula predict the meniscu height to be ~3 mm. To 
ensur the local electr field be approxim perpendicular to 
the water meniscus, we set the ewp’ sidewal to be 4 mm tall, 
which be slightli larg than the meniscu height. 

follow the reduct of surfac tension, the buoyanc forc 
also decreas due to chang of hw, which lead to spontan

wet on the ewp’ horizont surface. recal that hw be the 
maximum height differ between a static meniscu and a flat

(fig. 3c). the relationship between hw and the surfac contact 
angl be give by: 

hw ¼ 2k�1 sin 
θ 

2 
: ð4þ 

for the ewp design, hw reduc from 5mm to 2 mm when the 
input voltag increas from 0 V to 600 V, which impli that the 
surfac tension induc buoyanc forc be reduc (second term 
of equat 1). consequently, both surfac tension and buoyanc 
forc reduc and caus the robot to sink into water (fig. 3d). 
supplementari figur 1b and supplementari movi 4 illustr 
the spontan wet process on a flat copper sheet coat 
with 15 µm of parylene. In summary, charg the ewp’ 
sidewal reduc the surfac tension force, and charg the 
ewp’ horizont surfac lower the buoyanc force. 

We character the ewp perform by measur the 
maximum surfac tension forc at differ input voltag 

(see method for experiment setup). figur 3e compar the 
experiment measur with the predict valu from 
equat (1), (2), and (4). the model show good agreement 
with experi for input voltag small than 400 V. the 
model underestim the net upward forc for input voltag 
high than 400 V becaus it do not consid the contact angl 
satur phenomenon25, which be an experiment observ 
that no materi can becom complet hydrophil regardless of 
the input voltag amplitude. In futur studies, thi discrep 
between model and measur may be reduc by use 
altern dielectr coat that have small satur angles. 

our experi show that the maximum upward forc an 
ewp gener be 11.5 mn. thi forc reduc to 8.2 mN when a 
constant signal of 600 V be sent to the device. thi measur be 
an upper bound of the ewp’ perform a it be rigidli 
mount on a forc sensor. when instal on the mircorobot, 
the ewp’ horizont surfac may not be parallel to the water 
surfac due to fabric imperfection, caus a reduct in 
contact area and maximum surfac forces. As a result, we 
measur the maximum robot weight to be 3.09 g (65% of the 
maximum static measurement) befor sinking.

water surface, the robot be capabl of locomot includ 
swim forward and turning. exist designs14–20 base on 
water strider cannot be appli to our robot becaus stationary, 
long support leg inhibit walk on the ground. instead, we 
requir the robot to use the same set of actuat and leg to move 
on the water surface. thi requir impos two major 
challenges: symmetr walk gait for terrestri locomot 
cannot gener net propuls forc due to the time revers 
properti of low reynold number flow, and the amplitud of the 
robot legs’ swing motion, and thu the induc drag force, be 
substanti less than that of biolog exampl such a the 

dive beetl (dytiscu marginalis) and the dive fli

take inspir from the dive beetle’ physiolog 
and swim mechanics, we develop passiv swim 
flaps34 that gener asymmetr gait for water surfac locomo- 
tion. the robot leg and it flap constitut a two-seri link 
system: the leg motion be control and the flap rotat be 
passiv mediat through an elast joint. As show in fig. 1c, 
the flap be fulli submerg in water while the robot rest on the 
water surface. the flap be design to be passiv devic that 
retract in a singl direction. dure the fast downstrok (fig. 4b), 
the flap remain fulli open to gener forward thrust. dure the 
slow upstrok (fig. 4b), the flap collaps to reduc drag. the flap 
rotat be passiv mediat by forc from an elast flexure, 
drag from the surround fluid, and the flap inertia. conse- 
quently, develop an appropri drive motion for the robot 
leg be crucial for achiev desir flap kinematics35. 

To design the swim kinemat and determin the flap 
area, inertia, and flexur stiffness, we conduct at-scal flap 
experi and construct quasi-steady, dynam simul 
(see supplementari note 1–3 and supplementari figur 2). the 
kinemat paramet of stroke angl (ψ) and pitch angl (α) be 
defin in the supplementari note 1, and they be label in 
fig. 4d and supplementari figur 2c. dure swimming, the 
robot’ lift actuat be switch off and a piecewis sinusoid 
drive signal be sent to the swing actuat (fig. 4c). As show in 
fig. 4c, the fast downstrok occupi 10% of the flap period, 
the slow upstrok take 50% of the flap period, and the 
actuat remain stationari for the remain 40% of the time to 
allow the flap to return it nomin orientation. 

figur 4d show a singl leg flap experi use thi 
drive signal at 5 hz. the flap remain flatten dure the fast 
downstrok (t= 0 to T= 0.1). At stroke revers (t= 0.1), the 

flap begin to collaps while the leg slow down and rever 
direction. thi collaps behavior be mainli due to the flap 
inertia and the forc from the surround fluid. dure the slow 
upstrok (t= 0.1 to T= 0.6), the flap remain collaps to 
reduc drag. dure the recoveri phase (t= 0.6 to T= 1), the 
actuat be held stationari and the flap slowli rotat back to it 
nomin posit due to the restor torqu from the flexure. 

figur 4e show the track stroke angl (ψ) and the passiv 
flap angl (α), and superimpos the simul stroke and flap 
motion base on the input signal from fig. 4c. We observ 
qualit agreement between the quasi-steadi simul and 
the experiment measurement. the error of the maximum 
predict flap angl and phase offset be 4° and 6% period, 
respectively. As detail in the supplement material, thi error 
aris primarili from ignor the add mass effect and the 
collis between the flap and the central strut dure the 
downstroke. We further estim the drag forc profil use 
the quasi-steadi model. As show in fig. 4f, the thrust forc be 
mainli gener dure the downstroke, wherea the drag forc 
dure the upstrok and stroke recoveri be small. here the model 
estim the time averag forc to be 0.13 mN from a singl leg 
actuat at 5 hz. 

drive all four robot leg with the same signal from fig. 4c, we 
demonstr robot forward swim on the water surface. for 
the experi show in fig. 5a, the robot swim 32 cm in 
12 seconds, with an averag speed of 2.7 cm s−1 (0.7 bodi length 
(bl) per second). figur 5b show the instantan robot 
swim speed extract from a high-spe video of anoth

and mean swim speed be 8.1 (2.1 BL s−1) and 2.8 cm s−1

supplementari tabl 2 list the robot cost of transport for

18% high than that of walk on land. 

underwat to land transition. our microrobot be capabl of 
walk and avoid obstacl underwat (supplementari 
movi 5) and climb up an inclin to transit back onto land 
(supplementari movi 6). when it be fulli submerged, the robot 
us terrestri walk gait to demonstr turn and walking. 
We estim that buoyanc forc account for 40% of the robot 
weight, which enhanc locomot and improv payload 
capac underwater. In the aquatic-to-terrestri transit pro- 
cess, there be two major challenges: overcom the surfac 
tension and climb an incline. 

As the robot move through the air-wat interface, the water 
surfac exert an inhibiting, downward forc whose magnitud be 
approxim equal to the robot’ weight. although the robot 
can climb up an 11° inclin underwat on surfac cover by 
polydimethylsiloxan (pdms), it be unabl to break the water 
surfac of while climb up a 6° pdm surfac (fig. 6a, and 
supplementari movi 7). figur 6b show the track robot front 
and hind leg trajectories: when complet submerged, the robot’ 
front leg lift high than it hind leg (red color region in 
fig. 6b) due to the rearward locat of it center of mass. surfac 
tension forc push down on the front of the robot a it move 
out of water, induc a clockwis torqu with respect to the 
robot center of mass and caus the hind leg to lift high than 
the front leg (blue color region in fig. 6b). As the robot 
continu to climb upward, the bodi torqu induc by surfac 
tension becom counterclockwise, caus the front leg to lift 
high again (red color region in fig. 6b). In thi process, the 
downward surfac tension forc gradual increas and ulti- 
mate caus the robot hind leg to stick to the inclin surface, 
prevent forward locomotion. 

To quantifi the magnitud of water surfac tension forc 
dure the transit process, we measur the net forc on a robot 
a it be slowli pull out of water (supplementari fig. 3). As 
show in fig. 6c, the surfac tension forc on the robot’ circuit 
board and ewp be approxim 16 mN and 9.3 mn, 
respectively. although these forc be compar to the robot’ 
weight, previou work have demonstr that hamr can carri 
2.9 g of addit payload36 on flat surfaces. 

these forc measur be conduct while mount the 
robot parallel to the water surface, and consequ they do not 
account for the influenc of the torqu induc by the surfac 

tension forc dure the transit process. To quantifi the 
influenc of the surfac tension torque, we pull the robot through 
the water surfac on a 3° inclin and quantifi the deform 
of the robot legs’ transmission. As show in the top view of 
fig. 6d, the robot hind leg be splay out further than the robot 
front legs, indic that there be a larg forc push down on 
the back of the robot. In an unload configur (fig. 1a), the 
robot’ leg be approxim perpendicular with respect to the 
ground. In the configur pictur in fig. 6d, the robot hind 
leg splay outward 19° compar to the nomin leg orientation. 
thi caus the back of the robot bodi to sag down and it front 
to tilt up. the side view in fig. 6d show that the robot bodi 
pitch increas to 14° (θb) on a 3° (θi) incline. thi unfavor 
bodi pitch θB exacerb the advers effect of climb an 
incline, caus the robot’ front leg to lift high and prevent 
the robot’ rear leg from lift off the ramp surface. 

We make two major modif to mitig the advers 
effect caus by surfac tension dure underwater-to-ground 
transitions. first, the leg and swim flap be redesign and 
fabric monolith use a 150 µm carbon fiber laminate, 
substanti reduc the deform of the entir structur 
under load. In addition, we reduc the complianc of the legs’ lift 
dof by manual bias the leg downward dure the assembl 
process a detail in a previou study37. thi preload the 
flexur to creat a forc bia that oppos gravity, effect 
alter the transmiss ratio to increas stiff and reduc 
sagging. second, we attach pdms-coat foot pad to the robot’ 
front leg to increas friction. the experi illustr in 
fig. 6a, b show that the robot’ front and hind leg serv differ 
function dure the transit process. the surfac tension 
induc torqu inhibit hind leg liftoff and increas friction on 
the hind legs. In contrast, the front leg experi low normal 
and friction forc which result in slipping. attach pdm 
foot pad to the robot front leg increas friction on the front 
leg and reduc slipping. 

figur 6e show a composit imag of the robot climb out of 
water on an acrylic, 3° inclin at an averag speed of 0.75 cm s−1. 
compar to the side view in fig. 6d, thi imag show that the 
modifi robot do not pitch up notic dure the transit 
process. figur 6f further illustr the correspond front and 
hind leg trajectories. the lift motion of both front and back leg 
reduc a the robot foot emerg from the water surface. onc the 
robot front leg complet exit the water surface, the front legs’ 
lift amplitud recover. due to surfac tension forc and torque, 
the cost of transport for transit from underwat to land be 
approxim four time larg than walk on level ground 
(supplementari tabl 2). 

discuss 
our present of a hybrid terrestrial-aquat microrobot 
includ a novel mesoscal devic design that us electrowet 
to control surfac tension magnitud and achiev control and 
repeat water surfac to underwat transitions, a multimod 
strategi for locomot on terrestri domain and the water 
surface, and a detail analysi of the challeng impos 
by surfac tension dure a microrobot’ transit from under- 
water to land. our design satisfi the variou constraint 
impos by microrobot actuation, payload, and the differ 
environments. although mani of these constraint lead to con- 
flict design requirements, they can be reconcil by 
leverag physics, such a electrowet or surfac tension, 
uniqu to the millimet scale. for instance, we design foot pad 
that reli on surfac tension and surfac tension induc buoyanc 
to reduc foot size. furthermore, by leverag electrowet 
principles, we design four 25 mg ewp that can both static

support 1.9 time the robot weight and sink the robot when 
actuated. finally, wherea leg terrestri locomot involv 
discontinu contact dynam and friction, aquat flap 
locomot at the low reynold number regim be continu 
and requir asymmetr strokes. use a combin of passiv 
flap and asymmetr driving, we develop a swim strategi 
that have a similar cost of transport compar to robot terrestri 
locomotion. 

compar to hybrid terrestrial-aquat insects, microrobot 
have shortcom in actuat and power densiti but also 
poss advantag in use engin materi and electrostat 
devices. To dive into water, a dive fly4 can exert a downward 
forc larg than 18 time it weight to overcom surfac tension. 
piezoelectr actuat cannot deliv such high force; however, a 
microrobot can util electrowet to modifi wettabl 
−someth that be unobserv among insects. In the case of 
swimming, the shortcom in actuat can be compens by 
exploit fluid-structur interact in passiv mechanisms. 

wherea a dive beetle7 can paddl with asymmetr power 
stroke and recoveri stroke by independ control the 
motion of it tibia and tarsus8, a microrobot can gener similar 
asymmetr paddl motion by mere control it leg (ana- 
logou to tarsus) swing. the flap (analog to tibia) rotat be 
passiv control through the coupl between the fluid flow, 
the flap inertia, and the elast hing to achiev effici loco- 
motion on the surfac of water. 

further, thi be a demonstr of a microrobot capabl 
of perform task that be difficult for larg robots. To the 
best of our knowledge, no exist robot can walk on land, 
swim on the water surface, and transit between these envir- 
onments. By leverag surfac effect that domin at the mil- 
limet scale, thi work show a microrobot can outperform 
larg one in specif applications. In search and rescu 
missions, our robot have the potenti to move through clutter 
environ that be not access to larg terrestri or 
aquat robots.

futur studi can explor sever topic to further improv 
microrobot locomot capabl in complex environments. due 
to the lack of control dure the sink process, the current robot 
may flip over in presenc of disturb such a surfac wave 
and dynam flow underwater. further, the robot cannot return to 
land without a modest ramp. these limit can be address 
by enabl underwat swim and improv climb cap- 
abil in hybrid terrestrial-aquat microrobots. To demonstr 
swimming, futur research could involv design meso-scal 
devic for buoyanc control24, develop leg structur and 
associ gait to gener lift forc in addit to thrust, and 
conduct dynam analysi to investig underwat stability. 
To climb steeper inclin or to return to land without a ramp, 
futur research can incorpor electrostat adhesion13, gecko- 
inspir adhesives38, or impuls jump mechanisms24. 

method 
ewp fabrication. the robot foot pad be fabric from a 5 µm copper sheet. first, 
the copper sheet be cut into the desir pattern (fig. 3a) use diode-puls solid 
state (dpss) laser. next, vertic wall around the foot pad base be manual 
fold by 90° under a microscop (fig. 3a). then we solder the foot pad use 
51-gaug quadrupl insul wire and coat the devic use parylen C. the 
coatingprocess take ~12 h to deposit a uniform layer of 15 µm parylen C. finally, 
the foot pad be attach to a 70 µm thick, circular fiber glass (fr4) piec (fig. 3a). 
the fiber glass connect piec prevent the foot pad from short to the robot 
chassis. 

experiment setup for measur surfac tension on the ewp. An ewp be 
mount on a capacit forc sensor and slowli push into water at ~0.2 mm s−1 

(supplementari fig. 1c). the net instantan forc be measur by the forc 
sensor. the red arrow in supplementari figur 1d, e indic the differ

As show in supplementari figur 1d, e, the net upward forc reduc by 30% 
when a 600 V signal be sent to the ewp. 

experiment setup for robot locomot demonstration. We built a 45 cm × 
45 cm × 8 cm aquarium to conduct robot locomot experi in terrestri and 
aquat environ (supplementari fig. 4a). the aquarium be fill with deio- 
nize water at a depth of 4 cm. A 5 cm tall, 6° ramp be place in the aquarium 
for the robot to walk from land to the water surface. An ~3 cm tall underwat 
obstacl be place in the robot’ swim path. A 4 cm tall, 3° ramp be place 
in the aquarium for the robot to climb out of water. two camera be place 
abov and on the side of the aquarium to take top and side view videos. the 
water in the aquarium be connect to electr ground. the robot end-to-end 
locomot experi be conduct four time to demonstr robot 
robust and repeatability, and these trajectori be overlaid in supplementari
