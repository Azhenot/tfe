1. proof of lemma 1 

clearli μ0 = e[x0] = 1. for a location-scal random variabl X, we have X = θ1 + θ2z where Z be the 

standard random variabl correspond to X, when θ1 = 0 and θ2 = 1. denot e[zj ] = κj , we obtain 

claim (a) from 

e[xj ] = e[(θ1 + θ2z)

where the last equal follow from the binomi expans of the term (θ1 + θ2z)j . 

To obtain (b) we substitut X = θ1 + θ2z and μ1 = θ1 + θ2κ1 from (16) into e[(x −μ1)j ] to get 

e[(x −μ1) 
j ] = e[(θ1 + zθ2 − θ1 −κ1θ2) 

j ] = θj2e[(z −κ1) 
j ] (17) 

from the binomi expans of the last term, and use e[zj−i] = κj−i, we obtain θ

2. proof of theorem 1 

the lagrangian of the problem be 

L = wk 
tωwk − [Z 

twk − ak][λ] (18) 

where λ = [λ1, λ2] 
t be the vector of lagrang multipli for vector θt = (θ1, θ2) ∈ r×r++. then, the first 

order optim condit be give by the follow m +2 equations: 

∇wkl =2ωwk −zλ = 0, (19) 

∇λl =−z 
twk + ak = 0. (20) 

thi be a set of m + 2 linear equat with the same number of unknowns. It can also be see from the 

formul that thi system of equat have a full rank so a uniqu solut exists. We first reduc (19) by 

solv for λ; to thi end we pre-multipli (19) by ztω−1, and obtain 

2ztwk = Z 
tω−1zλ (21) 

the invers ω−1 exist becaus Ω be posit definite. now, substitut ztwk = ak from (20), we obtain 

from (21) 

λ = 2(ztω−1z)−1ak (22) 

the invers (ztω−1z)−1 exist becaus Z have a full rank and ω−1 be posit definite. substitut λ from 

(22) into (19) reduc (19) to a system of m equat with m unknowns, and we solv thi system a follow 

2ωwk −zλ = 0⇒ 2ωwk = 2z(z 
tω−1z)−1ak ⇒wk = Ω 

−1z(ztω−1z)−1ak (23)

3. proof of proposit 2 

We show abov that 

wktz = akt. (24) 

for the estim of mean μ1, we have a1 = [1, κ1], which then impli that 
∑ 

w∗1i = 1. similarly, for the 

estim of standard deviat μ2, a2 = 
[

, which impli that 

∑ 
w∗2i = 0. � 

4. proof of the varianc of μ̂k for section 5.1 

We be interest in the varianc of wktq̂. sinc wktq̂ = wkt(zθ + �) = wktzθ + wkt� and the term 

wktzθ be a constant, it follow that the varianc of wktq̂ be equal to the varianc of wkt� which be give by 

wktωwk for k = 1,2. replac the express for wk obtain in theorem 1 we obtain the varianc a

5. proof of proposit 3 

(a) for the mean, we note that varianc of the distribut of a sampl mean of size N1 be equal to μ22/n1 

where μ22 be the popul variation. equat thi varianc with the varianc [1, κ1](z

these compon when j=1,2,...,n expert provid quantil judgments. the matrix Zt = [z0 
t,z0 

t, ...,z0 
t] 

where Z0 
t appear n times, onc for each expert. the subscript 0 simpli suggest that thi be a constant 

matrix sinc all expert provid judgment for the same set of quantiles.. the matrix Ω be a mn×mn block 

diagon matrix with diagon block rjω0 where Ω0 be of size m×m. then, 

1. (Z

c 
k where the expert j ’s margin weight 

be equal to αj = (1/rj)/r. 

(b) consid the case when expert j be the onli expert avail with matrix Ω0 for elicit quantil z0. 

then R = (1/rj). substitut thi express in point 3 above, it follow that the weight for thi expert be 

equal to (1/rj)/r = 1, and the weight for hi quantil judgment be equal to hi independ weights. 

� 

7. proof for proposit 5: 1) the proof follow from the text abov the proposition. 

2) We will first obtain explicit express for the weight w∗k = Ω 
−1z(ztω−1z)−1ak with Ω = kω′ 

with Ω′ = I, and then show that these weight be ident to the weight obtain use the formul 

minμ1,μ2 

{ 
∑m 

i=1 

( 
φ−1(pi;μ1, μ2)− q̂i 

)2 
} 

. for rigor purposes, we provid the result for a more gener case 

when the diagon element of Ω′ be equal to 1, and the off-diagon element be equal to the correl 

valu ρ, and for breviti we will provid the proof for μ1. the analysi for μ2 be analogous. 

To obtain the explicit express of the weight we need three intermedi results. 

(a) ω−1 = 1 
(1−ρ)k2 

( 
I − ρm1 

1+(m−1)ρ 

) 
. To establish thi claim defin M1 a an (m×m) matrix of one and verifi 

that 

ωω−1 =

(1− ρ)i + ρm1

To establish thi claim we use (a) to obtain

(c) denot S1 ≡

therefore, the weight for the mean be obtain a w∗μ1 = [1, κ1](z

tion in the rest of the proof. take the first order derivatives, we obtain:

∂μ1

next, we can simplifi (31) use 
∑

μ2 =

∑ 
qizi − 

∑ 
qiκ1 + μ1(s1 −mκ1)) 

S2 − 2κ1s1 + nκ21

now, substitut (33) into (32), and simplification, we obtain 

μ1 = 

∑ 
qi 
( 
S2 − zis1 + nziκ1 −s1κ1 − 2κ1s1 +2mκ21 

) 

ms2 −s21

which impli the weight of 

wμi =

) 

ms2 −s21

these weight be ident to the weight obtain in the least squar formul in (29). the weight 

for μ2 can be show to be equal similarly. �
