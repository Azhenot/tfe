Inequality, Leverage, and Crises†

By Michael Kumhof, Romain Rancière, and Pablo Winant*

The paper studies how high household leverage and crises can 
be caused by changes in the income distribution. Empirically, the 
periods 1920–1929 and 1983–2008 both exhibited a large increase 
in the income share of high-income households, a large increase 
in debt leverage of low- and middle-income households, and an 
eventual financial and real crisis. The paper presents a theoretical 
model where higher leverage and crises are the endogenous result 
of a growing income share of high-income households. The model 
matches the profiles of the income distribution, the debt-to-income 
ratio and crisis risk for the three decades preceding the Great 
Recession. (JEL D14, D31, D33, E32, E44, G01, N22)

The United States experienced two major economic crises over the past century—
the Great Depression starting in 1929 and the Great Recession starting in 2008. A 
striking and often overlooked similarity between these two crises is that both were 
preceded, over a period of decades, by a sharp increase in income inequality, and 
by a similarly sharp increase in debt-to-income ratios among lower- and middle-in-
come households. When debt levels started to be perceived as unsustainable, they 
contributed to triggering exceptionally deep financial and real crises.

In this paper, we first document these facts, both for the period prior to the Great 
Depression and the period prior to the Great Recession, and we then present a 
dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model in which a crisis driven by greater 
income inequality arises endogenously. To our knowledge, our model is the first to 
provide an internally consistent mechanism linking the empirically observed rise in 
income inequality, the increase in debt-to-income ratios, and the risk of a  financial

crisis. In doing so it provides a useful theoretical framework, including a new meth-
odology for its calibration, that can be used to investigate the role of income inequal-
ity as an independent source of macroeconomic fluctuations.

The model is kept as simple as possible in order to allow for a clear understand-
ing of the mechanisms at work. The crisis is the ultimate result, after a period of 
decades, of permanent shocks to the income shares of two groups of households: 
top earners who represent the top 5 percent of the income distribution, and whose 
income share increases; and bottom earners who represent the bottom 95 percent of 
the income distribution.1 The key mechanism is that top earners, rather than using 
all of their increased income for higher consumption, use a large share of it to accu-
mulate financial wealth in the form of loans to bottom earners.2 They do so because, 
following Carroll (2000) and others, financial wealth enters their utility function 
directly, which implies a positive marginal propensity to save out of permanent 
income shocks. By accumulating financial wealth, top earners allow bottom earners 
to limit the drop in their consumption, but the resulting large increase of bottom 
earners’ debt-to-income ratio generates financial fragility that eventually makes a 
financial crisis much more likely.

The crisis is the result of an endogenous and rational default decision on the part 
of bottom earners, who trade off the benefits of relief from their growing debt load 
against output and utility costs associated with default. Lenders fully expect this 
behavior and price loans accordingly. The crisis is characterized by partial house-
hold debt defaults and an abrupt output contraction, a mechanism that is consistent 
with the results of Philippon and Midrigan (2011) and Gärtner (2013) for the Great 
Recession and the Great Depression, respectively. When a rational default occurs, it 
does provide relief to bottom earners. But because it is accompanied by a collapse in 
real activity that hits bottom earners especially hard, and because of higher post-cri-
sis interest rates, the effect on their debt-to-income ratios is small, and debt quickly 
starts to increase again if income inequality remains unchanged.

When the shock to income inequality is permanent, consistent with the time 
series properties of US top 5 percent income shares, the preferences for wealth of 
top earners (and thus their positive marginal propensity to save following a perma-
nent income shock) are key to our results on debt growth. We show in a baseline 
simulation that, when preferences for wealth of top earners are calibrated to match 
a marginal propensity to save of around 0.4, an empirical estimate that is based 
on independent microeconomic data, a series of permanent negative shocks to the 
income share of bottom earners, of exactly the magnitude observed in the data, 
generates an increase in the debt-to-income ratio of bottom earners very close to the 
magnitude observed in the 1983–2007 data. Because the evolution of the debt-to-
income ratio of bottom earners is not a target of our calibration, this constitutes an 
empirical success of our model. Furthermore, the increase in debt leads to a signifi-
cant increase in crisis risk, of approximately the magnitude found in the recent work 
of Schularick and Taylor (2012). In Section IF we discuss other explanations for the 
1983–2007 increase in debt levels and crisis risk that focus on domestic and global 

1 Note that our paper focuses only on the macroeconomic implications of increased income inequality, rather 
than taking a stand on the fundamental reasons for changes in the income distribution.

asset market imbalances in the decade prior to the Great Depression. We also show, 
in an alternative simulation, that when the shock to income inequality is modeled as 
transitory, the same model parameterized without preferences for wealth among top 
earners can generate an increase in debt and crisis risk purely based on a consump-
tion smoothing motive.

The central argument of the paper links two strands of the literature3 that have 
largely been evolving separately: the literature on income and wealth distribution,4 
and the literature on financial fragility and financial crises.5 In addition, our mod-
eling approach takes elements from the literature on preferences for wealth,6 to 
explain the rise of household debt leverage when the increase in income inequality 
is permanent, and from the literature on rational default, to endogenize financial 
crises.7

Rajan (2010) and Reich (2010) share with this paper an emphasis on income 
inequality as a long-run determinant of leverage and financial fragility. In contrast 
to these authors, we study this issue in the context of a general equilibrium model. 
This permits a quantification of the importance of this channel, and an identification 
of the respective roles of credit demand and credit supply in the rise of household 
leverage and crisis risk.8 Another literature has related increases in income inequal-
ity to increases in household debt (Krueger and Perri 2006, Iacoviello 2008). In 
these authors’ approach, an increase in the variance of idiosyncratic income shocks 
across all households generates a higher demand for insurance through credit mar-
kets, thereby increasing household debt. This approach emphasizes an increase in 
income inequality experienced within household groups with similar characteris-
tics, while our paper focuses on the empirically well-documented rise in income 
inequality between two specific household groups, the top 5 percent and the bottom 
95 percent of the income distribution.

In theory, if increasing income inequality was accompanied by an increase in 
intragenerational income mobility, the dispersion in lifetime earnings might be 
much smaller than the dispersion in annual earnings, as agents move up and down 
the income ladder throughout their lives. However, a recent study by Kopczuk, Saez, 
and Song  (2010) shows that short-term and long-term income mobility in the United 
States has been either stable or slightly falling since the 1950s. These authors also 
find that virtually all of the increase in the variance of earnings over recent decades 
has been due to an increase in the variance of permanent earnings rather than of 
transitory earnings.9 These results provide support for one of our simplifying mod-
eling choices, the assumption of two income groups with fixed memberships. They 
also provide additional support for our calibration, whereby shocks to the income 
distribution are permanent.

6 See Carroll (2000), Reiter (2004), Francis (2009), and the references therein. As discussed in the online 

Appendix, preferences for wealth have been used by this literature because models with standard preferences have 
difficulties accounting for the saving behavior of the richest households.

supply-side interpretations of debt accumulation patterns during the 2000s.

1220 THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW MARCH 2015

There is little guidance from the literature on how to calibrate the preference 
for wealth specification. But there is a small literature on the marginal propensity 
to save (MPS) of different income groups. The key paper is Dynan, Skinner, and 
Zeldes (2004), who find that MPS are steeply increasing in the level of permanent 
income, and reach values of 0.5 or even higher for the highest income groups. We 
show that these results can be mapped directly into a calibration of the preference 
for wealth parameters. This calibration methodology is another contribution of our 
paper.

The rest of the paper is organized as followed. Section I discusses key styl-
ized facts for the Great Depression and the Great Recession. Section II presents 
the model. Section III discusses model calibration and the computational solution 
method. Section IV shows model simulations that study the effects of increasing 
income inequality on debt levels and crises. Section V concludes.

I. Stylized Facts

This section documents five key stylized facts that characterize, for the US 
economy, the periods prior to the Great Recession and, where available, the Great 
Depression. These facts are relevant to the nexus between inequality, leverage, and 
crises. Some will inform the specification and calibration of our model, and others 
will be used to evaluate the empirical support for the model. We conclude this sec-
tion with a discussion of the empirical evidence associated with the two main alter-
native explanations for high and growing household debt that have been advanced 
in the literature.

A. Income Inequality and Aggregate Household Debt

In the periods prior to both major crises, rapidly growing income inequality was 
accompanied by a sharp increase in aggregate household debt.

Pre-Great-Recession.—Panel A of Figure 1 plots the evolution of US income 
inequality and household debt-to-GDP ratios between 1983 and 2008. Income 
inequality experienced a sharp increase, as the share of total income commanded by 
the top 5 percent of the income distribution increased from 21.8 percent in 1983 to 
33.8 percent in 2007. During the same period the ratio of household debt to gross 
domestic product (GDP) doubled, from 49.1 percent to 98.0 percent.

Pre-Great-Depression.—Panel B of Figure 1 plots the evolution of US income 
inequality and household debt-to-GDP ratios between 1920 and 1929. Between 
1920 and 1928, the top 5 percent income share increased from 27.5 percent to 34.8 
percent. During the same period, the ratio of household debt to GDP more than dou-
bled, from 16.9 percent to 37.1 percent.

B. Debt by Income Group

The periods prior to both major crises were characterized by increasing heteroge-
neity in debt-to-income ratios between high-income households and all remaining

households. For the period prior to the Great Depression data availability is very 
limited, but some evidence exists, and is consistent with the period prior to the Great 
Recession.

Pre-Great-Recession.—Panel A of Figure 2 plots the evolution of debt-to-income 
ratios for the top 5 percent and bottom 95 percent of households, ranked by income, 
between 1983 and 2007.10 In 1983, the top income group was more indebted than 
the bottom income group, with a gap of around 20 percentage points. In 2007, the 
situation was reversed. The debt-to-income ratio of the bottom group, at 147.3 per-
cent compared to an initial value of 62.3 percent, was now more than twice as high 
as that of the top group, which remained fluctuating around 60 percent. As a con-
sequence almost all of the increase in the aggregate debt-to-income ratio shown 
in Figure 1 is due to the bottom group of the income distribution. A similar pat-
tern to the  debt-to-income ratios in Figure 2 is also observed in debt-to-net-worth 
ratios (panel A of Figure 3), and in unsecured debt-to-income ratios (panel B of 
Figure 3).11

Pre-Great-Depression.—According to Olney (1991) and Olney (1999), the ratio 
of non-mortgage consumer debt to income increased from 4.6 percent in 1919 to 
9.3 percent in 1929. Around two-thirds of this was installment debt, especially for 

10 Debt-to-income ratios are constructed using data from the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF), which starts 
in 1983, and became triennial starting in 1989, making 2007 the last pre-crisis observation. 

11 It is sometimes argued that the more recent increases in household debt (2000–2007), which consisted to a 
large extent of mortgage loans, represented borrowing against houses whose fundamental value had risen. However 
several recent empirical papers (Mian and Sufi 2009; Favara and Imbs 2010; Adelino, Schoar, and Severino 2012) 
show that causation ran from credit to house prices, specifically that credit supply shocks caused house prices to 
increase above fundamental values.

informative, for two reasons. First, the top 5 percent income share in 1936 was still 
high (32.5 percent), implying that income inequality had only very partially been 
reversed since 1929. And second, by 1936 the number of new cars sold and the per-
centage of households buying cars on installment, after having collapsed between 
1929 and 1934, had recovered to reach very comparable levels to 1927 (Olney 1991).

We use the income thresholds provided by Piketty and Saez (2003) to classify 
the respondents of both surveys into either the top 5 percent or the bottom 95 per-
cent of the income distribution. To make the results of the two surveys comparable, 
we confine the analysis to installment credit. The surveys do not report stocks of 
debt but rather flows of new debt associated with installment purchases in the last 
12 months. Panel B of Figure 2 presents the results. In the 1917/1918 survey, the 
new installment debt to income ratios are both low and similar for both groups, at 
3.0 percent and 3.8 percent for the top and bottom income groups. In the 1935/1936 
survey, the ratios are much higher and, more importantly, much more dissimilar 
across income groups, at 6.8 percent and 10.9 percent for the top and bottom income 
groups. In 1935/1936, the ratio of average incomes between borrowers in the top 
and bottom groups was 3.25, while the ratio of average amounts borrowed was only 
1.6. To the extent that these data are representative of other years during this period, 
it indicates a significantly higher growth in debt-to-income ratios among the bottom 
income group.12

C. Wealth by Income Group

In the periods prior to both major crises, the rise in income inequality was asso-
ciated not only with divergent debt levels across income groups, but also with diver-
gent shares of overall wealth.

Pre-Great-Recession.—Panel A of Figure 4, which is based on SCF data, plots 
the share of wealth held by the top 5 percent of the income distribution between 
1983 and 2007. Except for a brief period between 1989 and 1992, this wealth share 
increased continuously, from 42.6 percent in 1983 to 48.6 percent in 2007.

Pre-Great-Depression.—Panel B of Figure 4, which is based on the dataset of 
Saez and Zucman (2014), plots the share of wealth held by the top 1 percent of 
the wealth distribution between 1920 and 1928. Except for 1923, this wealth share 
increased continuously, from 34.9 percent in 1920 to 47.5 percent in 1928.

D. Leverage and Crisis Probability

To quantify the link between household leverage and crisis probabilities, we use 
the dataset of Schularick and Taylor (2012), which contains information on aggre-
gate credit and crises for 14 countries between 1870 and 2008. We follow these 
authors’ methodology by running, on the full dataset, a logit specification in which 

12 Alternative sources for the period immediately prior to 1929 exist and are broadly consistent with the 
1935/1936 survey, but they are much more limited in quality or scope. See Plummer (1927) and Bureau of Labor 
Statistics (1929). 



1224 THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW MARCH 2015

the binary variable is a crisis dummy, and the latent explanatory variables include 
five lags of the aggregate loans-to-GDP ratio. The estimated logit model is used 
to predict crisis probabilities over the full cross section and time series sample. 
Figure 5 reports the estimated probabilities for the United States. We observe that, 
in the periods prior to both major crises, there was a sizable increase in crisis prob-
abilities, even though a crisis remained a low probability event.

Pre-Great-Recession.—Panel A of Figure 5 shows that the estimated crisis prob-
ability started at 2.0 percent in 1983 and increased to 5.2 percent by 2008. Between 
2001 and 2008, the crisis probability increased by two percentage points.

Pre-Great-Depression.—Panel B of Figure 5 shows that the estimated crisis prob-
ability almost doubled between 1925 and 1928, from 1.6 percent to 3.0 percent, 
before reaching 4.0 percent in the year of the crisis.

E. Household Defaults during Crises

Both major crises were characterized by high rates of default on household loans. 
Their magnitudes matter because the share of loans defaulted on in a crisis is an 
important parameter of our model.

Great Recession.—We compute delinquency rates as ratios of the balance of 
delinquent loans (defined as being past due by 90 days or more) to the total loan 
balance.13 Between 2006 and 2010, mortgage delinquency rates increased dramat-
ically, from 0.9 percent to 8.9 percent, and so did unsecured consumer loan delin-
quency rates, from 8.8 percent to 13.7 percent for credit card loans, from 2.3 percent 
to 5.3 percent for auto loans, and from 6.4 percent to 9.1 percent for student loans  
(the delinquency rate for student loans reached 11.7 percent in 2013). The figures

mentioned above apply to all households. Default rates among bottom earners can 
be shown to have been higher.

Great Depression.—The crisis of 1929 was followed by a wave of defaults on auto-
mobile installment debt contracts (Olney 1999). The percentage of cars repossessed 
increased from 4.1 percent in 1928 to 10.4 percent in 1932. Furthermore, reposses-
sion rates were significantly higher for used cars than for new cars (13.2 percent ver-
sus 5.7 percent in 1932). Combined with the fact that wealthy households were much 
more likely to buy new cars than middle- and lower-class households (Calder 1999), 
this suggests that default rates on installment debt were higher among the bottom 
income group. Mortgage default rates were also high during the Great Depression. 
According to a study of 22 cities by the Department of Commerce, by January 1934, 
43.8 percent of homes with a first mortgage were in default (Wheelock 2008).

F. Alternative Explanations for the Increase in Household Debt

The literature has advanced a number of alternative explanations for the rapid 
increase in household debt prior to the Great Recession. In this subsection we briefly 
look at the empirical evidence for the two most important alternative explanations, 
financial innovation and the global saving glut.

Financial Sector Growth and Financial Innovation.—The stylized facts pertain-
ing to the evolution of the US financial industry over the last 125 years have recently 
been documented by Philippon (2013). For the purpose of our paper, the key facts 
are: (i) The finance industry’s share of GDP increased by roughly 50 percent in the 
two periods of interest, from 2.8 percent to 4.6 percent between 1920 and 1928, and 
from 5.5 percent to 7.9 percent between 1983 and 2007. (ii) Most of these variations 
can be explained by corresponding changes in the quantity of intermediated assets. 
(iii) Intermediation is produced under constant returns to scale with an annual aver-
age cost of around 2 percent of outstanding assets. (iv) The unit cost of interme-
diation has not decreased over the past 30 years. This implies that the substantial 
increase in the GDP share of the financial sector can be explained by the simple

growth of balance sheets, without a necessary role for financial innovation.14 In our 
model, that growth of balance sheets is due to an increase in household credit to bot-
tom earners, following an increased supply of savings by top earners after they expe-
rience a permanent increase in income. According to Philippon (2013), household 
credit represented only around one-quarter of the stock of outstanding intermedi-
ated assets between 1983 and 2007. Financial activities that relate to non-household 
credit remain outside our model. Nevertheless, the rough doubling of household 
credit over the 1983–2007 period contributed substantially to the overall increase in 
the GDP share of the financial sector.

The facts stated above do not however rule out that financial innovation could have 
been an additional source of financial fragility. According to Levitin and Wachter 
(2012), several financial product innovations that spread during the last phase of the 
mortgage credit boom (2004–2007) led to significant underpricing of credit risk due 
to the complexity and opacity of these products.15 Interestingly, the seemingly safe 
senior tranches of these securities attracted many foreign investors, contributing to 
the global saving glut to which we turn next.

Global Saving Glut.—The global saving glut, which links the large current 
account surpluses of Asian countries and the large current account deficit of the 
United States, emerged in 1998, in the aftermath of the Asian crisis. An empirical 
challenge is that we cannot directly, from the data, measure the contribution of for-
eign inflows to the build-up of household credit. We can however approximate this 
contribution, by considering the broad category of private credit market instruments 
in the US Flow of Funds, and by drawing on the model-based estimation results of 
Justiniano, Primiceri, and Tambalotti (2014).

In Flow of Funds data, the ratio of private domestic credit to GDP increased 
from 130.4 percent to 292.3 percent between 1983 and 2007. Meanwhile the ratio 
of foreign private credit assets to GDP increased from 2.8 percent to 34 percent. 
The contribution of foreign asset accumulation to private domestic debt accumula-
tion differs widely between the pre-saving glut period (1983–1998) and the saving 
glut period (1998–2007). In the earlier period, private credit grew by 71 percentage 
points, with foreign asset accumulation only accounting for around 5 percent of 
this. In the later period, private credit grew by 90.6 percentage points, with for-
eign asset accumulation accounting for around 25 percent. Justiniano, Primiceri, 
and Tambalotti (2014) perform a quantitative model-based exercise that assesses the 
role of foreign capital flows in explaining the accumulation of US household credit 
over the period 1998–2006. They find that between one-quarter and one-third of the 
increase in US household debt can be explained by the dynamics of capital flows. 
In Section IVD we will show that these findings are consistent with the empirical 
performance of our model over the period 1998–2007.

14 As stated by Philippon (2013, p. 7): “Since the unit cost appears to be roughly constant, the question becomes: 
how do we explain the large historical variations in the ratio of intermediated assets over GDP?” 

15 This aspect cannot be captured in our model, in which investors correctly price default risk.

II. The Model

The model economy consists of two groups of infinitely lived households, 
referred to respectively as top earners, with population share  χ  , and bottom earners, 
with population share  1 − χ . Total aggregate output   y t    is given by an autoregressive 
stochastic process

(1)   y t   =  (1 −  ρ  y  )    y ̅   +  ρ  y    y t−1   +  ϵ  y, t   ,  

where a bar above a variable denotes its steady-state value. The share of output 
received by top earners   z t    is also an autoregressive stochastic process, and is given by

(2)   z t   =  (1 −  ρ  z   )    z ̅   +  ρ  z    z t−1   +  ϵ  z, t   . 

The standard deviations of   ϵ  y, t    and   ϵ  z, t    are denoted by   σ  y    and   σ  z   .

tradable financial wealth, which takes the form of loans to bottom earners,   β  τ    is 
the discount factor,  σ  and  η  parameterize the curvature of the utility function with 
respect to consumption and wealth, and  φ  is the weight of wealth in utility. These 
preferences nest the standard case of constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) con-
sumption preferences for  φ = 0 .

When top earners lend to bottom earners, they offer   p t    units of consumption 
today in exchange for  1  unit of consumption tomorrow in case bottom earners do 
not default. In case bottom earners do default, top earners receive   (1 − h)   units 
of consumption tomorrow, where  h ∈  [0, 1]   is the haircut parameter, the propor-
tion of loans defaulted on in a crisis. Bottom earners default only rarely, because 
doing so entails large output and utility losses, as explained in Sections IIB and IIC. 
Consumption of each top earner is given by

where   b t    is the amount of debt per bottom earner issued in period  t  at price   p t    , to be 
repaid in period  t + 1  , while   l  t    is the amount of debt per bottom earner repaid in 
period  t . The decision to default is given by   δ  t   ∈  {0, 1}   , where   δ  t   = 0  corresponds 
to no default and   δ  t   = 1  corresponds to default. Then we have

(5)   l  t   =  b t−1   (1 − h δ  t  ) .

This condition equates the costs and benefits of acquiring an additional unit of finan-
cial wealth. The cost equals the current utility loss from foregone consumption. The 
benefit equals not only next period’s utility gain from additional consumption, but 
also the current utility gain from holding an additional unit of financial wealth.

B. Bottom Earners

Bottom earners’ utility from consumption   c  t  b   has the same functional form, and 
the parameter  σ  takes the same value, as for top earners. They do not derive utility 
from wealth.16 Their lifetime utility is given by

(7)   V  t   =  E  t    ∑

Bottom earners’ budget constraint is

where   u t    is the fraction of bottom earners’ endowment that is absorbed by a penalty 
for current or past defaults. The output penalty   y t   (1 −  z t  )   u t    represents an output loss 
to the economy. The fraction   u t    is given by

(9)   u t   =  ρ u    u t−1   +  γ  u   δ  t   ,  

where the impact effect of a default is given by   γ  u    , while the decay rate, in the 
absence of further defaults, is   ρ u   .

Bottom earners maximize (7) subject to (8) and (9). Their optimality condition 
for consumption is given by

(10)   p t   =  β  b    E  t   [  (  
 c  t+1  b   ___ 
 c  t  b 

  )    
−  1 __ σ  

  (1 − h δ  t+1  ) ]  .  

16 Heterogeneity in preferences between lenders and borrowers is a common assumption in the literature, but 
has so far mostly taken the form of assuming different rates of time preference combined with borrowing constraints 
(e.g., Iacoviello 2005). In Bakshi and Chen (1996), the preference for wealth is specific to a social-wealth index, 
which captures the social group of reference, and is assumed to be increasing with the income of the group. 



1229 Kumhof et al.: InequalIty, leverage, and CrIsesvol. 105 no. 3

C. Endogenous Default

At the beginning of period  t , bottom earners choose whether to default on their 
past debt   b t−1   . This, together with the haircut parameter  h  , defines the amount   l  t    
that bottom earners repay during period  t  , according to equation (5). Their lifetime 
consumption utility   V  t    is a function of the state of the economy   s t   =  ( l  t  ,  y t  ,  z t  ,  u t  )   , 
and is recursively defined by

  V( s t  ) =   
  ( c  t  b )    

1−  1 __ σ   
 ______ 

1 −   1 __ σ  
   +  E  t   [V( s t+1  )]  . 

The decision to default   δ  t    is a rational choice made at the beginning of the 
period, given a pre-default state    s ̂   t   =  ( b t−1  ,  y t  ,  z t  ,  u t−1  )   , by comparing the lifetime 
 consumption utility values of defaulting   V  t  D  = V(  s ̂   t  ,  δ  t   = 1)  and not defaulting   
V  t  N  = V (  s ̂   t  ,  δ  t   = 0)  . Bottom earners default when   V  t  D  −  V  t  N   is higher than an i.i.d. 
additive utility cost of default   ξ  t    , as in Pouzo and Presno (2012). We can therefore 
write the decision to default as:

(11)   δ  t   =  arg max  
 δ  t  ∈{0, 1}

  
 
    { V  t  D  −  ξ  t  ,  V  t  N }  ,  

where   V  t  D  = V ( b t−1   (1 − h) ,  y t  ,  z t  ,  ρ u    u t−1   +  γ  u  )   and   V  t  N  = V ( b t−1  ,  y t  ,  z t  ,  ρ u   u t−1  )  . 
The distribution of   δ  t    depends upon the distribution of   ξ  t   . We have the simple formula

(12)  prob ( δ  t   = 1|  s ̂   t  )  = Ξ ( V  t  D  −  V  t  N )  ,  

where  Ξ  is the cumulative distribution function of   ξ  t   . We assume that  Ξ  takes the 
modified logistic form

(13)  Ξ ( x )  =  
{

  
  ψ _________  
1 + e (− θx )      if x <  ∞  ,    
1                      if x =  ∞  .

 
}

  ,  

where  ψ < 1 . This implies that, over the economically relevant range, default 
occurs with positive probability but never with certainty.17 The parameters  ψ  ,  θ  ,   γ  u    , 
and   ρ u    are calibrated to match the empirical evidence for the probability of crises, 
but with   γ  u    and   ρ u    in addition constrained by the need to at least approximately 
match the evidence on the depth and duration of such crises. The parameter  ψ  helps 
to determine the mean level of crisis probability over the sample, while  θ  determines 
the curvature of crisis probability with respect to the difference   V  t  D  −  V  t  N  .

17 The cost takes an infinite value with probability  1 − ψ  , and finite values distributed according to the c.d.f. 
  1 /( 1 + e(−θx))  with probability  ψ .

D. Equilibrium

In equilibrium, top earners and bottom earners maximize their respective lifetime 
utilities, the market for borrowing and lending clears, and the market clearing con-
dition for goods holds:

(14)   y t   (1 −  (1 −  z t  )   u t  )  = χ c  t  τ  +  (1 − χ)   c  t  b  . 

E. Analytical Results

A small number of key parameters of our model affect the speed at which bottom 
earners’ debt accumulates following a drop in their income share. Before discussing 
the calibration, it is therefore useful to analytically derive some relationships that 
clarify the role of these parameters.

Debt Supply and Debt Demand.—One implication of preferences for wealth is 
that a unique, stable deterministic steady state for financial wealth   b t    exists. In this 
steady state, the Euler equations (6) and (10) can be interpreted as the hypothetical 
prices at which top earners and bottom earners would be willing to buy and sell 
debt while keeping their consumption constant. These equations therefore represent 
steady-state supply and demand functions for debt. Bottom earners’ demand price 
as a function of debt,  p(b)  , is flat at18

(15)  p(b) =  β  b   ,  

while top earners’ supply price as a function of debt is implicitly given by

(16)  p(b) =  β  τ   +   
φ  ( y  ̅     z ̅    1 __ χ   + b(1 − p(b))  

1 − χ ____ χ  )    
  1 __ σ  
 
   _______________________   

  (1 + b   
1 − χ ____ χ  )    

  1 __ η  
 

   . 

By combining (15) and (16), one obtains the steady-state relationship

(17)     β  b   −  β  τ   ______ φ   =   
  (  y ̅     z ̅    1 __ χ   +   b ̅   (1 −  β  b  )    

 (1 − χ) 
 _____ χ  )    

  1 __ σ  

 
   ______________________   

  (1 +   b ̅     
 (1 − χ) 
 _____ χ  )    

  1 __ η  

 

   . 

The numerator on the right-hand side, which equals    (   c ̅     τ )    1/σ   , is always positive 
because consumption utility satisfies the Inada conditions. Equation (17) therefore 
shows that for any model with preferences for wealth ( φ > 0 ), a steady state with 

18 The simplification of abstracting from default, for the purpose of this exercise, is justified by the fact that 
default has a negligible effect on the Euler equations in the neighborhood of the original steady state. 



1231 Kumhof et al.: InequalIty, leverage, and CrIsesvol. 105 no. 3

positive debt of bottom earners (   b ̅   > 0 ) requires the condition   β  b   >  β  τ     , which is 
therefore always satisfied in our calibration. However, this does not mean that top 
earners are more impatient than bottom earners. The reason is that their effective 
impatience is given by  p(b)  rather than simply by   β  τ   . Effective impatience is there-
fore endogenous to the level of debt, and the effective steady state impatience of top 
earners is equal to the impatience of bottom earners.

Changes in Steady-State Income and Preferences for Wealth.—Differentiating 
(17), we can derive the effect of an increase in top earners’ output share    z ̅    on the 
steady-state debt level    b ̅    ,

   ,  

which can be shown to be positive for any plausible calibration, implying that an 
increase in income inequality raises the steady-state equilibrium level of debt.

The left and middle subplots of Figure 6 show initial credit demand (15) as the 
horizontal dash-dotted line at a price of debt of approximately 0.96. Initial credit 
supply (16) is shown as thick lines, and increased credit supply after a 10 percent-
age point increase in the top 5 percent income share as thin lines. The solid lines 
represent the baseline, and the dashed and dotted lines show the effects of varying, 
relative to the baseline, the parameters  φ  or  η  , while adjusting   β  τ    to remain consis-
tent with an unchanging initial level of steady-state debt. The left subplot shows 
that, while the size of the increase in steady-state debt following the increase in 
credit supply is independent of  φ  , a higher  φ  increases the slope of the credit sup-
ply schedule. Therefore, with debt starting out at its initial low-debt steady state, 
a higher  φ  implies that top earners are willing to more aggressively lower interest 
rates on debt (raise the price of debt) to move toward the new high-debt steady state 
at a higher speed. The middle subplot shows that a higher  η  , meaning a lower cur-
vature of the utility function with respect to wealth, leads to more financial wealth 
accumulation. The reason is that a higher  η  reduces the rate at which marginal utility 
falls in response to increases in wealth, so that top earners limit the increase in their 
consumption more strongly in order to accumulate more wealth.

The Marginal Propensity to Save.—At shorter horizons of 20–40 years, 
the effects of higher  φ  and higher  η  are hard to distinguish, because both tend 
to increase the rate at which debt increases following a permanent increase 
in income inequality. The marginal propensity to save (MPS) of top earn-
ers following a permanent income shock is a function of both  φ  and  η . 
The model-based formula for the MPS is derived in the online Appendix of this 
paper. The right subplot of Figure 6 shows how different combinations of  φ  and  η  
translate into different MPS in that formula.

III. Calibration and Solution Method

A. Calibration

We calibrate the model at the annual frequency. Top earners and bottom earners 
correspond to the top 5 percent and the bottom 95 percent of the income distribution, 
respectively,  χ = 0.05 . The model combines two key mechanisms, the accumula-
tion of debt by bottom earners following a permanent increase in income inequality, 
and a rational default decision, with default probabilities increasing in the level of 
debt. An increase in the default probability interacts with the speed of debt accu-
mulation through an increase in default risk premia. However, default is partial, 
and default probabilities are low, ranging from 2.2 percent in 1983 to 5.1 percent 
in 2008, when calibrated based on the empirical evidence of Schularick and Taylor 
(2012). This implies that the effects of default risk on debt accumulation are very 
limited during the 1983–2008 period. The calibration exercise is therefore made 
more transparent by separating parameters related to debt accumulation and to the 
default mechanism.

Debt Accumulation.—
Preferences: Following many papers in the business cycle literature, the curva-

ture of the utility function with respect to consumption is fixed at  σ = 0.5  for both 
top and bottom earners. The detailed calibration procedure for the preference for 
wealth parameters  φ  and  η  is described in the online Appendix. We first use our 
theoretical model to derive an approximate formula for top earners’ MPS out of per-
manent income shocks. We then use the empirical methodology of Dynan, Skinner, 
and Zeldes (2004) to estimate the empirical counterpart of this formula, using SCF 
and PSID data. Finally, the model’s preference for wealth parameters  φ  and  η  are 
calibrated by equating the model-based MPS to the data-based MPS. We find that 
saving rates are a steeply increasing function of income, and obtain a baseline MPS 
of top earners of 0.397, with a lower bound of 0.248 and an upper bound of 0.505.19 
The resulting baseline parameter values are  φ = 0.05  and  η = 1.09 .20 Because 
we are matching one MPS using two parameters, these values are not unique, but as 
shown in Section IVD, changing the combination of  φ  and  η  at a given MPS has a 
very small effect on our results.

Initial Steady State: Steady-state output is normalized to 1,    y ̅   = 1 . The steady-
state net real interest rate is fixed at 4 percent per annum, similar to values typically 
used in the real business cycle literature, by fixing bottom earners’ discount factor 
at   β  b   = 1. 04   −1  . We calibrate the initial steady state of the debt-to-income ratio   λ t    
and of the top 5 percent income share   τ  t    to be equal to their 1983 counterparts. In 
the model,   λ t    is given by21

(19)   λ t   =   
 (1 − χ)   l  t    __________________   

 y t−1   (1 −  z t−1  )   (1 −  u t−1  ) 
   . 

We choose   β  τ    to replicate    λ ̅    in 1983, which equals 62.3 percent. To calibrate the 
1983 value of   τ  t    we use the data computed by Piketty and Saez (2003, updated), 
which include interest income but exclude interest payments in the computation of 
annual gross incomes. The model counterpart is given by

(20)   τ  t   =   
 y t   z t   +  (1 − χ)   l  t   (1 /  p t−1   − 1)     _______________________________    

 y t   (1 −  u t   (1 −  z t  ) )  +  (1 − χ)   l  t   (1 /  p t−1   − 1) 
   . 

We choose    z ̅    to replicate    τ ̅    in 1983, which equals 21.8 percent.

Exogenous Shock Processes: We estimate the exogenous stochastic process for 
output   y t    using the detrended series of US real GDP from 1983 to 2010 obtained from 

19 By considering a wide range of different MPS estimates, we have taken into account the inevitable uncer-
tainty associated with alternative methods of estimating this magnitude. 

20 We note that the relationship  η > σ  is consistent with the preference for wealth specification of Carroll  
(2000). 

21 This ratio is defined to be consistent with SCF data, where debt liabilities are measured during the first 
semester of the Survey—at the time of the interview—while income refers to income in the year prior to the survey. 



1234 THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW MARCH 2015

the BEA. Our estimates are   ρ  y   = 0.669  and   σ  y   = 0.012 . For the years 1983–2008 
of the baseline simulation we calibrate the shocks   ϵ  y, t    to exactly match the detrended 
data, while all subsequent shocks are set to zero.

The exogenous stochastic process for the top 5 percent output share   z t    is param-
eterized by specifying   ρ  z    and   σ  z    such that the behavior of   τ  t    matches that of the 
updated Piketty and Saez (2003) data series from 1983 to 2010. Using standard 
tests, the hypothesis that this data series has a unit root cannot be rejected. In the 
baseline model, we therefore calibrate   ρ  z   = 1  , and then estimate   σ  z   = 0.008  from 
the data. For the years 1983–2008 of the baseline simulation we calibrate the shocks   
ϵ  z, t    such that   τ  t    exactly matches the data, with all subsequent shocks set to zero.

Targeted and Non-targeted Facts: Table 1 summarizes the calibration of the 
model, with the exception of the default parameters. This part of the model has ten 
exactly identified parameters and two  (φ  and  η)  that are matched using empirical 
estimates of the MPS of top earners. Importantly, the use of empirical estimates to 
independently calibrate the preference for wealth parameters of top earners implies 
that matching the post-1983 evolution of the debt-to-income ratio of bottom earners 
is not a target of the calibration. A comparison of its simulated evolution with the 
data will therefore serve to evaluate the empirical success of our model.22

Default Mechanism.—The haircut, or percentage of loans defaulted upon during 
the crisis, is set to  h = 0.1  , which is approximately consistent with the empirical 
evidence in Section IE. The size of default   γ  u   = 0.04  and the depth of the crisis   
ρ u   = 0.65  are calibrated to give rise to default events that are reasonably close 
to what has been observed during the Great Depression, while triggering default 
decisions that are consistent with the estimated probabilities of crises. Our cali-
bration implies a slightly less than 3 percent loss in aggregate output on impact, 
and a cumulative output loss of around 8 percent of annual output, less than what 
was observed during the Great Recession. However, what matters for the default 
decision is the expected depth of the contraction. Few observers had anticipated the 
Great Recession, and once it had started, most observers initially underestimated its 
full severity (Dominguez and Shapiro 2013).

The random utility cost parameters  ψ = 0.15  and  θ = 18  are chosen so 
that, combined with the output cost parameters   γ  u    and   ρ u   , they closely match the 
Schularick and Taylor (2012) probability of crises in 1983 and 2008,23 thereby also 
approximating the trend in its evolution between these two dates. Our calibration 
implies that the maximum theoretically possible default probability, at extremely 
high debt levels, is 15 percent, with actual default probabilities generally well below 
that.24 It can be shown that, at debt and income levels where default occurs with 
a probability of 5 percent, roughly the magnitude reached just prior to the Great 

22 The ability of our simple endowment model to match the behavior of the interest rate, which is also non-tar-
geted, if of course very limited. 

23 The crisis probabilities in our calibrated model are 2.19 percent in 1983 and 5.08 percent in 2008, while the 
probabilities estimated according to Schularick and Taylor (2012) are 2.04 percent in 1983 and 5.16 percent in 
2008. 

24 Between 1900 and 2008, the maximum probability of a US crisis, estimated according to Schularick and 
Taylor (2012), is 5.7 percent.

Recession, the random utility cost of default needed to trigger the financial crisis 
is a negative utility cost equivalent to an approximately 3.3 percent change in the 
consumption of bottom earners.

B. Solution Method

Our model has two features that advise against the application of conventional 
perturbation methods. The first is the presence of default, which implies large 
 discrete jumps in state variables. The second is the fact that the stochastic process 
for income shares   z t    is random walk, which in our simulations implies that bottom 
earners’ debt-to-income ratio permanently drifts far away from its original steady 
state. We therefore use a global solution technique that adapts the time-iterative pol-
icy function algorithm described by Coleman (1991). The computational procedure 
is detailed in the online Appendix.25

A. Default Regions

In our model, due to random utility costs, the state space is divided into regions 
with a continuum of probabilities of default. Figure 7 contains a visual represen-
tation that divides the state space into regions whose boundaries represent default 
probabilities that increase in equal increments of two percentage points. Each sub-
plot shows the debt-to-income ratio26 on the horizontal axis and output on the ver-
tical axis. The effect of variations in the third state variable, the top output share, is 
illustrated by showing two separate subplots, corresponding to the 1983 and 2008 
top output shares.

We observe that higher debt levels imply a higher crisis probability, by increas-
ing the benefits of defaulting without affecting the costs. Over the historically 
observed range of debt levels, the implied crisis probabilities range from 2.2 percent 
to 5.1 percent. As is standard in this class of models, default is more likely to occur 
when output is low, because at such times the insurance benefits of default are high 
while the output costs of default are low. Small drops in income start to have a sig-
nificantly larger effect on default probabilities as we move from regions of low debt 
to regions of very high debt. For the same reasons as for lower output, higher top 
output shares also lead to higher crisis probabilities. But their direct effect, beyond 
the effect that operates through higher debt accumulation, is very modest.

B. Impulse Responses

Figure 8 shows a one standard deviation positive shock to aggregate output   y t   . This 
shock allows both top earners and bottom earners to increase their  consumption, so 

26 We show the debt-to-income ratio rather than the state variable debt because the former is a key variable in 
our model. Its units are therefore more intuitive and easier to interpret.

that the equilibrium loan interest rate drops by around 85 basis points on impact, with 
a subsequent increase back to its long-run value that mirrors the gradual decrease 
in output. The drop in the interest rate represents an additional income gain for bot-
tom earners relative to top earners, so that the top 5 percent income share falls by 
around 0.35 percentage points. Bottom earners smooth their income gain over time 
by decreasing their debt-to-income ratio by around 0.8 percentage points on impact, 
while still increasing their consumption by more than twice as much as top earners.

Figure 9 shows a one standard deviation permanent shock to the output share   z t   . 
The top 5 percent income share   τ  t    immediately increases by 0.8 percentage points, 
accompanied by a downward jump of 0.5 percent in bottom earners’ consump-
tion and an upward jump of 1.9 percent in top earners’ consumption. The long-
run increase in top earners’ consumption is even larger, because they initially limit 
their additional consumption in order to accumulate additional financial wealth. 
The process of debt accumulation takes several decades, with bottom earners’ 
debt-to-income ratio increasing by around 7 percentage points in the very long run, 
accompanied by an increase in crisis probability of 0.13 percentage points. The real 
interest rate falls on impact by 9 basis points, due to the increase in credit supply 
from top earners that initially limits the drop in consumption of bottom earners. The 
top 5 percent income share   τ  t    , because it includes not only the output share   z t    but 
also the interest earnings on increasing financial wealth, increases in the long run 
by approximately another 0.1 percentage points, and top (bottom) earners’ long-run 
increase (decrease) in consumption is correspondingly larger. We note that the one 
standard deviation income distribution shock in Figure 9 is small compared to what 
occurred over the period 1983–2008.

Figure 10 shows the impulse response for a crisis shock. Bottom earners default 
on 10 percent of their loans, but they also experience a 4 percent loss in income due 
to the output costs of default, which are suffered exclusively by this group of agents. 
As a result their debt-to-income ratio only drops by around 3.9 percentage points.

The impact effect on the real economy is a 3.2 percent loss in GDP, followed by a 
V-shaped recovery. The real interest rate mirrors developments in output, with an 
initial increase of 2.4 percentage points followed by a return to the original interest 
rate level after about a decade. Consumption of top earners and bottom earners 
follows an almost identical profile after the crisis. Top earners suffer a loss on their 
financial wealth, but this is more than compensated by the temporary increase in 
the real interest rate, so that the top 5 percent income share increases by around 
1.2 percentage points on impact. Top earners lend after the crisis, in order to return 
their financial wealth to the desired level. The counterpart of this is reborrowing by

to its original level after about one decade.

C. Baseline Scenario

Figure 11 shows the central simulation of the paper. The variables shown are the 
same, and are shown in the same units, as in the impulse responses in Figures 8–10. 
The horizontal axis represents time, with the simulation starting in 1983 and ending 
in 2030. The circular markers represent US data, while the lines represent model 
simulations. The data for GDP and for the top 5 percent income share are used as 
forcing processes that pin down the realizations of the shocks   ϵ  y, t    and   ϵ  z, t    between 
1983 and 2008. Post-2008 data for GDP and the top 5 percent income share are 
shown but are not used as forcing processes. Because this is an endowment econ-
omy, interest rate fluctuations mirror output fluctuations. We assume that a crisis 
shock hits in 2009. The crisis event in 2009 is, as discussed above, characterized by 
output losses that are somewhat lower than observed during the Great Recession. 
Starting in 2009, the model is simulated assuming a random sequence of utility 
cost shocks, but no further nonzero realizations of output or output share shocks. 
Because the preceding shocks imply further increases in debt after 2009, this  

27 A model with borrowing constraints would limit reborrowing. However, data from the crisis period show that, 
while the crisis stopped mortgage debt from increasing further, unsecured debt kept increasing.

means that future endogenous crises remain a possibility, and in fact become increas-
ingly likely.

The key forcing variable is the increase in the top 5 percent income share from 
21.8 percent in 1983 to 33.8 percent in 2008. In the baseline calibration, the mar-
ginal propensity to save of top earners is equal to 0.397. Therefore, top earners save 
a sizable share of their additional income in order to acquire additional financial 
wealth, in other words to lend to bottom earners. Bottom earners’  debt-to-income 
ratio therefore increases from 62.3 percent in 1983 to 131.9 percent in 2007 and 
138.8 percent in 2008, accompanied by an increase in crisis probability from 
2.2 percent in 1983 to 5.1 percent in 2008. In the data, the debt-to-income ratio 
increases from 62.3 percent in 1983 to 147.3 percent in 2007. Potential explanations 
for the 15.4 percentage point 2007 difference between model and data are discussed 
in Section IVD.

While the initial debt-to-income ratio in the model and in the data were matched 
through the calibration of the initial steady state, its post-1983 evolution was not 
targeted in our calibration. The fact that we nevertheless closely match it, after cal-
ibrating the preference for wealth specification on the basis of independent micro-
economic evidence, is therefore a measure of the empirical success for our model. 
By matching the increase in debt we also match the increase in crisis probability, 
but this is not an additional independent success of the model, since the default 
mechanism was calibrated so as to replicate the empirical link between leverage and 
crisis probabilities.

In the baseline scenario, top earners increase their consumption by a cumula-
tive 50 percent until just prior to the Great Recession, while bottom earners reduce 
their consumption by 10 percent. The simulated top 5 percent consumption share, 
which is shown in the same subplot as the top 5 percent income share, also increases 
between 1983 and 2008, but by less than the income share. This is a necessary 
consequence of the fact that top earners are lending, and are therefore maintaining 
lower consumption levels than what their income alone would permit. There is an 
ongoing debate in the empirical literature about the relative evolution of consump-
tion inequality and income inequality.28 The results of this literature are however not 
directly comparable to our results, because it has so far not produced an empirical 
estimate of the top 5 percent consumption share that would correspond to our model 
simulations.

For the future, the model predicts a further increase of the income share of top 
earners, not because of further increases in their output share   z t    but rather because of 
further increases in debt and associated interest charges. Bottom earners’ simulated 
debt-to-income ratio increases from around 140 percent to around 180 percent over 
the post-crisis decade, accompanied by an increase in crisis probability from around 
5 percent to around 8 percent. Under the random sequence of utility cost shocks 
used in our simulation, the model generates one subsequent crisis in 2028.

28 Krueger and Perri (2006) argue that consumption inequality increased by much less than income inequality 
between 1983 and 2003. These results have recently been challenged by Aguiar and Bils (2011), who estimate that 
the increases in consumption and income inequality mirror each other much more closely. Attanasio, Hurst, and 
Pistaferri (2012) confirm the results of Aguiar and Bils (2011). By contrast, Meyer and Sullivan (2013) find that the 
rise in income inequality has been more pronounced than the rise in consumption inequality.

MPS = 0.248 (φ = 0.05,  η = 0.78)
MPS = 0.397 (φ = 0.05,  η = 1.08)

MPS = 0.397 (φ = 0.031,  η = 1.23)
MPS = 0.397 (φ = 0.050,  η = 1.08)
MPS = 0.397 (φ = 0.080,  η = 0.96)

The effect of the crisis on bottom earners’ debt-to-income ratio in the model is 
modest, it drops by around four percentage points on impact but then immediately 
resumes its upward trajectory. The reason is the continuing upward trend in top 
earners’ financial wealth accumulation, as a result of previous favorable shocks to 
their income share.

D. Empirical Performance of the Model

The crucial implication of the MPS-based calibration is that the 1983–2007 evo-
lution of the debt-to-income ratio of bottom earners can be used to evaluate the 
quantitative performance of the model.29 The left subplot of Figure 12 illustrates 
that this performance depends on the calibrated value of the MPS. For this figure, 
we calibrate the model based on the baseline MPS of 0.397, the upper bound MPS 
of 0.505, and the lower bound MPS of 0.248. Our baseline simulation is reproduced 
as the solid line, the data as circular markers, and lower and upper bound MPS as 
dash-dotted and dotted lines. Differences in MPS are calibrated by holding  φ  at its 
baseline value of 0.05 and varying  η  , with a higher  η  (higher MPS) implying that top 
earners allocate a larger share of their additional income to financial wealth accumu-
lation. The interest rate adjusts to ensure that this higher credit supply is taken up by 
bottom earners, who end up with a higher debt-to-income ratio.

The baseline model tracks the overall trend in the data well. By 2007, the model 
predicts a debt-to-income ratio of 131.9 percent, versus 147.1 percent in the data. The 
upper-bound model slightly over-predicts over the period 1992–1998 but is closer 
to the data toward the end of the period. The lower-bound model  under-predicts 
throughout. However, even this calibration predicts a 1983–2007 increase in bottom 
earners’ debt-to-income ratio of around 47 percentage points, which equals well over 
one-half of the increase observed in the data. Overall, the baseline model explains 
close to 100 percent of the increase in the debt-to-income ratio of bottom earners over 
the first 15 years of the period of interest (1983–1998), and  approximately 70 percent 
over the last 9 years (1998–2007). This suggests a possible role for complementary 
explanations over the latter period. As discussed in Section IF, the global saving glut 

29 We focus on this period because the model is simulated over 1983–2008 for a series of inequality and output 
shocks that exactly reproduce the data. 2007 is the last pre-crisis data point in SCF. 

Figure 12. Sensitivity Analysis



1242 THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW MARCH 2015

can explain around one-quarter of the increase in US household debt over this period. 
This is roughly the share of household debt that is left unexplained by our model.

The right subplot of Figure 12 shows that, once a MPS has been chosen (in this 
case the baseline MPS of 0.397), differences in the combinations of  φ  and  η  that 
give rise to that MPS have only a very small effect on the model’s predictions. We 
note that the combinations of  φ  and  η  shown in Figure 12 differ by a very substan-
tial margin, with the upper bound  φ  60 percent larger than the baseline (0.08), and 
the lower bound  φ  60 percent smaller than the baseline (0.031). Yet the implied 
differences in the behavior of the debt-to-income ratio are very small. What matters 
is therefore primarily the MPS itself, for which we have produced solid empirical 
evidence in the online Appendix.

E. Pure Consumption Smoothing and Shock Persistence

In our baseline scenario, the increase in bottom earners’ debt is due to increased 
credit supply from top earners. The reason is that shocks to the income distribution 
are permanent, so that neither bottom earners nor top earners have an incentive to 
smooth consumption, while top earners have a strong incentive to accumulate wealth.

The permanence of shocks to the income distribution is consistent with the evolu-
tion of income inequality between 1983 and 2008, and with the evidence of Kopczuk, 
Saez, and Song (2010) and DeBacker et al. (2013). It is nevertheless interesting to 
ask what quantitative role pure consumption smoothing, in the complete absence of 
a wealth accumulation motive, could play if shocks to the income distribution were 
perceived to be more temporary. In that case top earners would have no motive to 
accumulate wealth for its own sake, while both bottom and top earners would have a 
stronger incentive to borrow and lend to smooth consumption. In other words, in such 
a world there would be an increased role for credit demand relative to credit supply.

For this exercise we perform another variation of our baseline simulation in 
which wealth does not enter the utility function of top earners ( φ = 0 ), both 
income groups have the same discount factor (  β  b   =  β  τ   = 1. 04   −1  ), and shocks to 
the inequality process are highly persistent but not permanent. The initial values of 
all endogenous variables are identical to the baseline case. The results are shown in 
Figure 13, under the assumption   ρ  z   = 0.98 .

We observe that for this particular persistence parameter the effects of consump-
tion smoothing are similar to those of preferences for wealth in the baseline, with 
both debt and crisis probability increasing by similar magnitudes prior to the crisis. 
But this would change dramatically for a less persistent   z t   . In that case the consump-
tion smoothing motive would become very much stronger, because it would imply 
that bottom earners continually expect their income to revert to a much higher level 
over a fairly short period. The cumulative effect of this perception, which would 
represent large and one-sided forecast errors over the 1983–2008 period, would be 
a much larger build-up of debt.

V. Conclusions

This paper has presented stylized facts, a theoretical framework, and an empiri-
cal methodology for calibrating it, that explore the nexus between increases in the 



1243 Kumhof et al.: InequalIty, leverage, and CrIsesvol. 105 no. 3

income share of high-income households, higher debt leverage among poor and 
 middle-income households, and vulnerability to financial crises. We provide evidence 
which suggests that this nexus was prominent prior to both the Great Depression 
and the Great Recession. In our baseline, theoretical model higher debt leverage 
arises as a result of permanent positive shocks to the income share of high-income 
households who, due to preferences for wealth, lend part of their additional income 
back to poor and middle-income households. This increase in credit supply allows 
poor and middle-income households to sustain higher consumption levels. But the 
result is that loans keep growing, and therefore so does the probability of a crisis 
that, when it happens, is accompanied by a contraction in the real economy. This 
contraction, together with a desire of high-income households to accumulate further 
wealth while their income share remains high, implies that the effect of a crisis on 
debt leverage and therefore on the probability of further crises is quite limited.

It is possible to use our framework to simulate alternative scenarios for the future 
of the US economy. One alternative, studied in Kumhof, Rancière, and Winant 
(2013), looks at the consequences of a reversal of the post-1983 increase in income 
inequality over a period of ten years. We find that this would lead to a sustained 
reduction in leverage that would significantly reduce the probability of further crises.
