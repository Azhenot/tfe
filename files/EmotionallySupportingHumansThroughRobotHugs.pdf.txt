ABSTRACT
Hugs are one of the first forms of contact and affection humans ex-
perience. Due to their prevalence and health benefits, we want to en-
able robots to safely hug humans. This research strives to create and
study a high fidelity robotic system that provides emotional support
to people through hugs. This paper outlines our previous work eval-
uating human responses to a prototype’s physical and behavioral
characteristics, and then it lays out our ongoing and future work.

1 INTRODUCTION
Hugging gives an individual social support, relieves stress, lowers
blood pressure, and increases oxytocin levels [2]. Because of hug-
ging’s health benefits, roboticists have tried to artificially create this
gesture. DiSalvo et al.’s The Hug is a plush comfort object, whose
shape mimics a child’s; it works in pairs to provide users “tele-hugs”
[3]. While its stomach glows, vibrates, and plays a melody when
receiving a hug, it lacks the ability to wrap its arms tighter around
the human, and it requires an additional human partner. Stiehl et
al.’s teddy bear robot, the Huggable, uses sensors under a layer of
silicone and fur to detect where and how it is being touched [9]. It
provides companionship to and monitors children in the hospital.
While it can move its head and arms, because of its small size, it
can be hugged but cannot actively hug back.

Shiomi et al. ran two experiments with a large teddy bear robot,
finding that users who hugged the robot interacted with it longer,
provided more self-disclosure, and afterwards were more inclined
toward prosocial behavior [8] [7]. Miyashita and Ishiguro used an
autonomous wheeled inverted pendulum humanoid robot to hug in
a three-step process, while maintaining its balance [5]. Determining
the hug duration was not described. It appears the robot uses the
human to balance itself, which is a potentially uncomfortable tactile
experience for humans, as it is made of metal.

Physical properties affect how contact interactions are perceived.

and comfort: when infant monkeys were given the choice of which
surrogate mother they preferred, a wire mother who fed them or
a cloth one who did not, the majority chose the cloth mother [4].
Williams and Bargh showed that humans associate positive/warm
personality traits with warm physical contact, and vice versa; here
subjects briefly held a cup of warm or iced coffee and were then
asked to judge a target person’s personality [10]. This result was
replicated when Park and Lee altered the skin temperature of a
dinosaur robot [6]. They found user perceptions of the sociability
of the robot increased with warmth.

2 COMPLETEDWORK
My initial work on this topic addressed the research question, “How
should robots hug?” We hypothesized that a soft, warm, touch-
sensitive humanoid robot would provide satisfying hugs to humans
by matching their hugging pressure and duration. I conducted a
30-participant study where users experienced 12 hugs from Willow
Garage’s Personal Robot 2 (PR2): the first group of 3 hugs varied the
physical conditions, and the second group of 9 hugs varied the be-
havioral conditions. The presentation order of the hugs was varied
within each group, and the user completed a survey after each hug.

Three different physical conditions were tested, as shown in
Fig. 1: a hard-cold, a soft-cold, and a soft-warm robot. A hard-warm
robot was not tested because the heating elements somewhat soften
the robot and divulge the thermal experimental variable to users.
Hard-cold: The robot has no additional padding layers. Soft-cold:
The robot wears a layer of foam, a layer of cotton, then a layer of
purple fluffy polyester. Soft-warm: The robot wears the same as
the soft-cold condition with added heating elements: the wires from
an electric blanket cover the robot’s chest and back. A heating pad
is placed on the chest. Chemical warming packs are placed on the
robot’s upper arms and forearms. The robot outfit was designed to
be gender neutral to be more universally accepted and to limit the
number of experimental variables.

Nine different behavioral conditions were tested, varying the
pressure and the duration of the hug. We customized three distinct
pressure levels for the robot to hug each user: “too loose,” “just right,”
and “too tight”. Using flexible sensors [1] to detect user contact on
the robot’s back, we programmed the robot to terminate the hug
“too soon” (not using user input, releasing 1 second after the arms
close), “just right” (immediately upon human release), and “too late”
(releasing 5 seconds after the human released).

Figure 3: A comparison of the responses to the survey questions
after the first three hugs, changing physical conditions. The grey
represents the hard-cold condition (HC), the purple color represents
the soft-cold condition (SC), and the pink color represents the soft-
warm condition (SW). Black lines with stars at the top of the graph
indicate where there was a statistically significant difference found.

Subjects completed a 15-question opening survey based on their
initial impressions of the robot, and they answered the same ques-
tions at the end of the experiment. These subjective measures were
used for evaluation because we were interested in user preference,
attitude, and opinion. We plan to include objective measures such as
heart rate and facial expression in future experiments. These results
were analyzed using a paired t-test comparison, and we found that
users felt understood by, trusted, and liked the presence of the robot
significantlymore after the experiment (p < 0.05). As shown in Fig. 2,
people also found robots to be nicer to hug, easier to use, and more
of a social agent than they initially anticipated, after the experiment.

All post-trial survey responses were analyzed in MATLAB 2017a
using a repeated measures analysis of variance with a Tukey’s
posthoc multiple comparison test to determine which conditions
differed significantly. As can be seen in Fig. 3, the perceived safety
of the robot increased in both soft conditions, while only the soft-
warm condition improved the users’ comfort.

While significant differences were not noticed in the surveys
between the three tightness factors, written and verbal comments
made to the experimenter indicated user preferences for “very tight
hugs”. As can be seen in Fig. 4, users thought the robot was more
social, more caring, and made them feel happier and more com-
forted when it released them immediately or held on to them too
long. Written and verbal comments indicated a preference for an
immediate release from the hug, though a significant different was
not noticed between these two levels in the surveys.

torate. First, we will create a new robotic platform, customized for

social-physical interactions with humans. After an extensive search,
we have chosen to use two Kinova JACO arms because of their slen-
der design, quietness, fluid movement, and their built-in safety fea-
tures. We will cover the arms and chest in a layer of foam, thermally
conductive fabric, and electrically conductive fur for softness, heat-
ing, and touch sensing, respectively. This new robot will match the
hugging pressure of the human user, and it will use torque and/or
tactile sensors to determine when the subject wants to be released.

Next, we aim to enable people to send customized hugs to each
other through this new platform, to discover the extent to which
personal connections can be reinforced at a distance. We plan to cre-
ate an online forum for people to customize the hug they would like
to send, including setting a duration, uploading a voice recording,
and adding a rub or pat on the receiver’s back.

A final area we are interested in investigating is equipping this
robot with emotional intelligence. Using machine learning, we will
enable the robot to sense a person’s mood based on facial expres-
sionsmeasured using a camera-based emotion tracking tool, and the
way a person hugs the robot, which is a form of haptic intelligence
only people currently possess.

Applications for this research range from helping alleviate stu-
dent stress on college campuses to bringing happiness to residents
of nursing homes. As research progresses, it could also be adapted
for use by people undergoing rehabilitation or childrenwith autism.
