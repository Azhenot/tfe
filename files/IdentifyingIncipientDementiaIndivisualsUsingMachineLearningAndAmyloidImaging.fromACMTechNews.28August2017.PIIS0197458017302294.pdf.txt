Identifying individuals destined to develop Alzheimer’s dementia within time frames acceptable for
clinical trials constitutes an important challenge to design studies to test emerging disease-modifying
therapies. Although amyloid-b protein is the core pathologic feature of Alzheimer’s disease, bio-
markers of neuronal degeneration are the only ones believed to provide satisfactory predictions of
clinical progression within short time frames. Here, we propose a machine learningebased probabilistic
method designed to assess the progression to dementia within 24 months, based on the regional in-
formation from a single amyloid positron emission tomography scan. Importantly, the proposed method
was designed to overcome the inherent adverse imbalance proportions between stable and progressive
mild cognitive impairment individuals within a short observation period. The novel algorithm obtained
an accuracy of 84% and an under-receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.91, outperforming the
existing algorithms using the same biomarker measures and previous studies using multiple biomarker
modalities. With its high accuracy, this algorithm has immediate applications for population enrichment
in clinical trials designed to test disease-modifying therapies aiming to mitigate the progression to
Alzheimer’s disease dementia.

1. Introduction

Alzheimer’s disease is the most common form of dementia, ac-
counting for approximately 60%e80% of the cases with alarming
economic and social costs (Pouryamout et al., 2012). It is well un-
derstood that Alzheimer’s disease pathophysiology follows a

gradual course with pathologies developing over decades before
symptom onset (Braak and Braak, 1991; Mosconi et al., 2007). Thus,
there is an increased interest to advance the disease-modifying
clinical trials to the predementia stages of Alzheimer’s disease
given the better chances of obtaining tangible disease-modifying
effects. This has been encouraged by the identification of bio-
markers to detect the pathologic signatures at the early stages of the
disease (Buerger et al., 2006; Fagan et al., 2006;McEvoy and Brewer,
2010; Morris et al., 2009). However, given the high prevalence of
cognitively normal elderly individuals carrying the Alzheimer’s
disease pathophysiology, accurately identifying individuals who are
in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease has been a significant
challenge. Thus, the development of effective clinical trials has been
severely hampered by not being able to recruit individuals who
have a higher likelihood of developing Alzheimer’s disease (Holland
et al., 2012) within a time period acceptable to conduct a study.

Identification of effective biomarker signatures to determine the
progression of dementia has been a significant challenge to accu-
rately predict the short-term clinical progression. It is believed that
the biomarkers of neurodegeneration such as glucose metabolism
and brain atrophy would be the most effective, as the other path-
ologic markers such as brain amyloid-b (Ab) deposition and for-
mation of hyperphosphorylated tau tangles occur years or decades
before the symptom onset (Jack et al., 2010a,b, 2013). However,
numerous studies based on neurodegenerative biomarkers have
indicated a decrease in the ability to predict the clinical progression
when the observation time is more than 18 months. Given that the
accumulation of Ab in the brain is a hallmark characteristic of
Alzheimer’s disease, amyloid-based biomarkers can be assumed to
provide a better sensitivity to Alzheimer’s disease pathology over a
longer observation period (Trzepacz et al., 2014).

Studies conducted to evaluate the utility of amyloid biomarkers
have used the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Ab measurements due to
the relatively higher availability compared with amyloid positron
emission tomography (PET) biomarkers. These studies have often
combined other CSF measurements such as tau and p-tau concen-
trations and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) biomarkers
(Apostolova et al., 2014; Davatzikos et al., 2011; Hall et al., 2015;
Yang et al., 2012; Young et al., 2012) to accommodate for the
limited dimensionality offered by the CSF measurements. However,
the possibility to regionally assess Alzheimer’s disease pathophys-
iology and the increased availability of amyloid PET images in large-
scale aging studies have enabled the evaluation of this imaging
biomarker as a diagnostic tool.

As the earliest detectable clinical stage of the trajectory toward
dementia, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) provides an attractive
point of entry to disease-modifying interventions (Markesbery,
2010). However, not all MCI individuals carry Alzheimer’s disease
pathophysiology and progress to Alzheimer’s disease in an optimal
time frame for clinical trial. Thus, identification of biomarker sig-
natures of MCI individuals on the verge of progression to dementia
and predicting the likelihood of conversion has immediate appli-
cation in disease-modifying clinical trials by including those in-
dividuals with high likelihood to progress. This will increase the
statistical power of the clinical trial by reducing false positives and
would directly impact the associated costs. Furthermore, these in-
formationwould also provide important prognostic information for
the patients and their families to plan and manage treatment and
care (Gelosa and Brooks, 2012).

The prediction of the clinical progression to dementia from MCI
phase constitutes a challenge due to the considerably lower number
of progressive MCI (pMCI) individuals compared with the stable MCI
(sMCI) individuals, invariably creating imbalanced classes (pMCI and
sMCI). In a classification study, if the number of samples from a class
(sMCI) greatly outnumbers the other classes (pMCI), the classifier
tends to favor the over-representedmajority class (sMCI) by ignoring
the incorrect prediction in theminority class (pMCI). This constitutes
a challenge known as the “class imbalance problem” and leads to
decreased sensitivity of the prediction, which has been currently
overlooked in Alzheimer’s disease research. While there are a num-
ber of techniques developed to address this challenge, such as class
weight adjusting, oversampling the minority class, and under-
sampling themajority class (Japkowicz and Stephen, 2002), the latter
is identified to perform the best (Seiffert et al., 2008, 2010). Random
under sampling (RUS) is a method of under sampling, which will
train each of its base learners with the full minority class and a
randomly under sampled majority class. By doing this, each base
learner is trainedwith a balanced set of samples from both pMCI and
sMCI classes, removing the bias toward any particular class.

Amyloid PET images used in the study are [18F]Florbetapir PET
scans acquired from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging
Initiative (ADNI). The study cohort presented a pMCI rate of 15.75%,
similar to the rates presented by other cohort studies and com-
munity studies (Mitchell and Shiri-Feshki, 2009). This presents the
aforementioned class-imbalanced challenge. Current study utilizes
RUS to overcome this challenge. The novel prediction algorithm is
presented as RUS random forest (RUSRF) and is used to evaluate the
utility of amyloid PET as a diagnostic tool.

The present study aims to evaluate the utility of amyloid PET
imaging as an early detection tool for individuals in the Alzheimer’s
disease pathway. Specifically, we aim to predict if an MCI individual
will progress to Alzheimer’s disease or remain MCI within a time
period of 24 months based on the amyloid PET measurements at
baseline. We further believe that the proposed technique can be
used to complement the multibiomarker enrichment strategies for
clinical trials (Wolz et al., 2016).

This novel technique capitalizes on an optimized feature
extraction method for amyloid PET, and a method for addressing
the class imbalance problem in the context of a random forest
machine learning classifier (Breiman, 2001). We further compare
the performance of RUSRF with other widely-used prediction al-
gorithms such as the Support Vector Machine (SVM), L1 and L2
regularized logistic regression, and random forest. We believe that
the novel RUSRF algorithm will outperform these widely-used
prediction algorithms and that the amyloid PET biomarker might
serve as an important early diagnostic tool in both research and
clinical environments.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Subjects and data acquisition

Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from
the ADNI database. ADNI was launched in 2003 as a public-private
partnership, led by Principal Investigator Michael W. Weiner, MD.
The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial MRI,
positron emission tomography (PET), other biological markers, and
clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to
measure the progression of MCI and early Alzheimer’s disease.

We selected 273 ADNI-GO/2 participants meeting the criteria for
single-domain or multidomain amnestic MCI and acquired their [18F]
Florbetapir PET, demographic, APOE4 genotype information and the
clinical diagnosiswith the correspondingdiagnosis information for the
subsequent 24-month follow-up visit (mean follow-up time:
24.37 months, standard deviation: 1.51 months). For PET image pro-
cessing purposes, the matching T1-weighted MRI images were also
obtained. The eligibility criteria of MCI were participants with mini-
mental state examination (MMSE) scores equal to or greater than 24,
a clinical dementia rating of 0.5, subjective and objectivememory loss,
normal activities of daily living, and the absence of other neuropsy-
chiatric disorders including Alzheimer’s disease (Petersen, 2003).

The subjects were categorized into 2 groups, sMCI and pMCI,
based on the diagnosis on their follow-up visit. If a subject was
diagnosed to be Alzheimer’s disease in the follow-up visit, that
subject was categorized as pMCI, and if the subject remainedMCI at
the 24-month follow-up visit, he or she was categorized as sMCI. Of
the 273 individuals used in the study, only 43 (15.75%) individuals
were diagnosed as probable Alzheimer’s disease in their follow-up
visit and were categorized as pMCI. Demographical information of
the sample of individuals used in the study is presented in Table 1.

2.2. Image processing

The acquired T1-weightedMRI images were processed using the
CIVET image processing pipeline (Ad-Dab’bagh et al., 2006;
Zijdenbos et al., 2002), where the images underwent non-

uniformity correction (Sled et al., 1998), brain masking (Smith,
2002), linear and nonlinear registrations to the ICBM 152 Tem-
plate (Fonov et al., 2009; Mazziotta et al., 1995) using the ANIMAL
(Collins and Evans, 1997; Collins et al., 1995; Robbins et al., 2004)
image registration algorithm. Downloaded [18F]Florbetapir PET
images were already preprocessed to perform motion correction
and to acquire uniform spatial resolution according to the steps
outlined in (online: http://adni.loni.usc.edu/methods/pet-analysis/
pre-processing/, Accessed: 28-03-2016). The PET images were then
registered to the subjects’ own T1-weighted MRI images and were
spatially normalized to the ICBM 152 template. They were then
normalized for the regional intensities from the cerebellum gray
matter and the global white matter to generate [18F]Florbetapir PET
standard uptake value ratio (SUVR) images.

2.3. Subject classification

Two sets of subjects were generated from the total set of in-
dividuals as training set (STrain) and testing set (STest; Table 1). The
training set was used in the feature selection step and training the
machine learning algorithm, while the testing set was used solely to
evaluate the performance of the trained machine learning algo-
rithm. Since the testing set is not used in the feature selection step
or in training, we void any bias or adverse effect from “double
dipping” in the prediction of progression to Alzheimer’s disease.
The ratio between the sMCI and pMCI individuals was preserved in
both the training set and the testing set.

2.4. Feature selection

To identify the brain regions from where the PET SUVR values
are read as features for the predictors, we employed a voxel-wise
logistic regression analysis using the VoxelStats (Mathotaarachchi
et al., 2016) toolbox. For each brain voxel, the following logistic
function was solved:

In
� p
1� p

�
¼ b0 þ b1*½18F�Florbetapir þ b2*Ageþ b3*Gender

þ b4*APOE4
where p ¼ probability of progressing to Alzheimer’s disease in
24 months. Then, for each voxel, the scaled increase in odds (scaled
odds ratio) for one standard deviation (s) increase in [18F]Florbe-
tapir PET SUVR was calculated as follows:

Odds RatioScaledðORScaledÞ ¼ eb1*s

Anatomically significant brain regions with ORscaled > 1:5 were
selectedbasedonexpertopinion, andPETSUVR intensities fromthese
regionswere extracted as themeanof a 3�3�3 clusterof voxels. The
above regional PET SUVR intensities along with age, gender, and
APOE4 genotype status were fed into the predictors as features.
2.5. Prediction

Prediction was performed using the novel algorithm RUSRF
based on the random forest classifier (Breiman, 2001). The novel
algorithm uses sampling techniques to trainmultiple random forest
predictors to calculate the final prediction. The primary goal of the
present application is to predict progression to Alzheimer’s disease;
however, the population contains only 15.71% pMCI individuals.
This constitutes a class imbalance problem with a majority sMCI
class. In this case, the predictors tend to be biased to predict the
majority class (sMCI) and to ignore the misclassification in the
minority class (pMCI) (Yen and Lee, 2009). To overcome this, the
novel algorithm utilizes a data sampling technique named “random
undersampling,” where the majority class is randomly sampled to
create a pseudo training set with equal proportions in all the clas-
ses. This technique is closely related to the RUSBoost technique
(Seiffert et al., 2008); however, the base classifier used in the pre-
sent study is random forest and the iterative boostingmethod is not
employed as the random forest classifier uses feature bagging to
achieve independence and randomness.

In summary, RUSRF algorithm will train K number of random
forest predictors with individual pseudo training sets with equal
class distributions. The number of minority class samples ðNaÞ in a
pseudo training set is equal to the total number of minority class
samples in the original training set. Thus, all K random forest pre-
dictors are trained for all the minority class instances. The number
of majority class samples is calculated to be a fraction ðf Þ higher
than the number of samples in the minority class. The final prob-
ability prediction is calculated as the mean probability across all the
K random forests, and the final prediction is calculated as the final
probability prediction greater than 0.5.

The implementation of the RUSRF algorithmwas done in Python
programming language using the random forest implementation in
the scikit-learn library (Online: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/,
Accessed: 28-04-2016).
2.6. Performance evaluation and comparison

The RUSRF algorithm has 2 primary parameters to be optimized
based on the application, which are the number of random forest
predictors and the number of decision trees in each of the random
forest predictor. To estimate the best combination of these 2 pa-
rameters, we employed a nested cross-validation technique
(Huttunen et al., 2012; Moradi et al., 2015). The outer cross-
validation step divided the training set ðSTrainÞ in to 10 subsets
ðSiTrain; i ¼ 1.10Þ preserving the class ratios of the original popu-
lation (stratified cross validation). In each training step i, SiTrain was
subdivided (using stratified cross validation) into 10 subsets
ðSijTrain; j ¼ 1.10Þ and was passed to RUSRF algorithm with a tuple
of parameters (number of random forest predictors, number of
trees in each predictor) selected from a grid of parameter combi-
nations for training. The best set of parameters was selected based
on the AUC from the internal 10-fold cross validation. The perfor-
mance of the predictor was then evaluated based on the AUC, ac-
curacy (number of correct classifications divided by the total
number of samples [in STest]), F1 score (harmonic mean of precision
and recall), sensitivity (number of correctly classified pMCI subjects
divided by the total pMCI subjects), and specificity (number of
correctly classified sMCI subjects divided by the total sMCI subjects)
for the original test set ðSTestÞ. These values were calculated based
on the predictions of each outer cross-validation step i, on the
testing set ðSTestÞ. By evaluating the performance based on the
original test set ðSTestÞ, we recorded the true generalization ability of
the RUSRF predictor.

To examine the performance gain from the RUSRF predictor, we
trained 4 other widely-used classifiers such as SVM, logistic
regression with L1 regularization, logistic regression with L2 reg-
ularization, and random forest (Breiman, 2001) using the same set
of features and compared with the performance of RUSRF. Evalu-
ating the optimum parameters and the performance for these
widely-used classifiers were also done using a nested cross-
validation as described above. McNemar’s c2 test was performed
to compare each of the classifiers against random predictors. The
random predictors were developed by training each of the classi-
fication algorithms with a randomly permuted training set to
disrupt the relationships between the class labels and input fea-
tures. Furthermore, a paired t-test was performed to compare AUC
and F1 scores of the RUSRF predictor against the other 4 predictors,
while McNemar’s c2 test was used to compare the sensitivity and
specificity. However, the overall accuracy of each predictor was not
used as a measure of comparison because it can misinterpret the
performance when the sample has imbalanced class probabilities.
The resulting p values were Bonferroni adjusted to correct for
multiple comparisons. The classification analysis was carried out in
Python programming language using the scikit-learn library and
the statistical analysis was carried out using the R programming
language.

In a binary classification, the random forest algorithm performs
implicit feature selection based on the parameter called “Gini
importance” (Breiman, 2001), which is calculated as the accumu-
lated decrease in “Gini impurity iðtÞ”. This is defined as;
iðtÞ ¼ 1� p20 � p21. Here pk ¼ nkn , which is the fraction of the nk
samples from class k ¼ f0; 1g out of the total n samples at a node t
in a binary decision tree in random forest. The decrease in Gini
impurity results from splitting the node by a threshold sa on
variable a, and sending the samples to 2 subnodes, tl and tr , and is
calculated as D iðtÞ ¼ iðtÞ � pliðtlÞ � priðtrÞ, where pl ¼ nln and
pr ¼ nrn , the relative sample fractions at nodes tl and tr . The opti-
mum split is then determined, which results in the maximum
decrease in Gini impurity at node t. The accumulation of these
decreases in Gini impurity for all nodes t in all trees T in the Forest,
is known as the Gini importance ðIGÞ for variable a.

3. Results

Demographic information of the individuals included in this
study is summarized in Table 1. Of the 273 individuals, 43 (15.75%)
were diagnosed with probable Alzheimer’s disease after the 24-
month follow-up and were categorized as pMCI.

Voxel-wise logistic regression analysis resulted in a scaled odds
ratio map with the highest values in the orbitofrontal cortex, mid
frontal cortex, mid temporal cortex, temporal occipital junction,
posterior cingulate cortex, angular gyrus, precuneus, putamen, and

the nucleus accumbens (Fig. 2). The SUVR values from bilateral
brain regions were extracted as described above and subsequently
averaged to be used as regional SUVRs. These regional SUVR values
were then used as features on the predictors together with age,
gender, and APOE4 gene status.

Predictive performances from the 5 predictors are shown in
Table 2. The RUSRF predictor has the highest predictive perfor-
mance for both sMCI and pMCI individuals based on the average
area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) (0.906
[�0.009]) and F1 score (0.583 [�0.044]). The RUSRF AUC score is
significantly different from both the SVM and L2 logistic regression
at p < 0.0025 and from random forest at p < 0.0125. Furthermore,
the RUSRF F1 score is significantly different from SVM at p< 0.0025
and from L2 logistic regression at p < 0.0125. The sensitivity of the
RUSRF predictor only differed from the SVM predictor at p < 0.025.
The RUSRF specificity was different from L2 logistic regression at p
< 0.0125 and from SVM, L1 logistic regression, and random forest at
p < 0.025. The p value thresholds used here for statistical signifi-
cance were Bonferroni adjusted for multiple comparisons.

According to McNemar’s c2 test (Table 2), only the RUSRF pre-
dictor showed a statistically significant difference with the random
predictor at p < 0.01. Both regularized logistic regression predictors
were significantly different at p < 0.1. However, the random forest
predictor and the SVM predictor were not significantly different
from the random predictor. The c2 statistic for the SVM predictor
cannot be calculated as the output from the predictions from both
SVM and the random predictor were identical. The SVM prediction
for each test case, which was calculated as the mean of the pre-
diction from all 10 iterations was 0. This resulted in an exaggerated
accuracy of 84.15% (all true 0 cases correctly predictedespecificity
of 100%).

Fig. 3A shows the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves
for the 4 predictors with their respective AUC values. The ROC curve
for the novel RUSRF predictor dominated the other curves with an
area of 0.91, followed by the L1 logistic predictor, random forest
predictor, and the L2 logistic predictor. The AUC <0.5 for the SVM
predictor (Table 2) indicated that the SVM predictor is a predictor
for the sMCI class but not for the pMCI class.

The relative feature importance from the novel RUSRF predictor
is shown in Fig. 3B. The most important features indicated the brain
regions with the highest contribution to predict the pMCI class. Ab
accumulations measured by [18F]Florbetapir PET SUVR in the tem-
poral occipital junction, mid temporal cortex, mid frontal cortex,
and precuneus were the most important features followed by the
accumulation in other brain regions and age, gender, and APOE4
gene status. The feature importance from the random forest clas-
sifier indicated the same 4 regions to be the most important fea-
tures (Supplementary Table 1).

4. Discussion

We have presented a novel algorithm for predicting the pro-
gression from MCI to Alzheimer’s disease dementia using baseline
amyloid PET measurements. The novel RUSRF algorithm uses the
random forest classifier as its base classifier along with advanced
data sampling techniques to overcome inherent problems of the
data sample to improve the prediction accuracy. This algorithmwas
shown to provide advantages as demonstrated by higher AUC and
F1 score when compared with the other widely-used prediction
algorithms such as SVM, regularized logistic regression, and
random forest. Furthermore, our preliminary data suggested, that
this algorithm could perform comparably to themethods employed
using MRI, FDG PET, CSF biomarkers, and their combinations
(Table 3). It is important to emphasize that the evaluation of the
prediction algorithms, employed a completely independent testing
sample which was never used in training or feature selection steps.
This method of evaluation resembles the expected outcomes in an
application (clinical and research) environment, which can be
considered encouraging to be used for the early diagnosis of Alz-
heimer’s disease.

Using the RUSRF algorithm, we obtained AUC and F1 scores of
0.906 (0.009) and 0.583 (0.044), respectively, for the independent
testing set. Generally, the progression to Alzheimer’s disease de-
mentia of an MCI population within 24 months lies around 16.2%
(Mitchell and Shiri-Feshki, 2009). Thus, in a prediction study, the
pMCI class (the subset of individuals progressing to Alzheimer’s
disease) is expected to lie close to the same proportion, creating
imbalanced classes. If the methods to overcome this challenge is
not involved, the prediction algorithm will ignore the errors in the
minority class (Japkowicz and Stephen, 2002). This can result in
exaggerated accuracies, as the predictor can be biased toward the
majority class, but it can also result in lower sensitivity for the

minority class. In the present study, pMCI individuals were only
15.75% of the sample. Therefore, comparing the prediction accuracy
based on the overall accuracy will lead to incorrect conclusions due
to the adverse bias toward themajority class (sMCI). In other words,
a classifier predicting sMCI, regardless of the input features, will
result in 84.25% overall accuracy as there will only be 15.75%
incorrect predictions (pMCI individuals predicted as sMCI; 0% ac-
curacy in pMCI class). To this regard, we have excluded the overall
accuracy as a measure to compare predictors used in this study;
however, we usedMcNemar’s c2 test to compare the sensitivity and
the specificity. It is important to mention that most of the studies
conducted to predict the progression of Alzheimer’s disease de-
mentia from MCI have not considered whether their samples
represent the imbalanced proportions of the population (see
Table 3). This can lead to inconsistent results when the studies are
used in a clinical setting as the models have been trained and tested
on a heightened representation of the pMCI population. Given that
the population used in the present study is a closer representation
of the MCI population, the results of the study can be considered
transferable to the clinical use in early diagnosis.

McNemar’s c2 test was used to evaluate the statistical significant
difference between each predictor used in the study (RUSRF, SVM,
regularized logistic regression, and random forest) against a
random predictor. The random predictor was created by training
each of the algorithms (RUSRF, SVM, regularized logistic regression,
and random forest) with a randomly permuted set of features
derived from the original training set. By doing this, the relationship
between the features and the classes are completely disrupted and
the predictor is trained to learn a random pattern. A statistically
significant difference from a random predictor was only observed in
the RUSRF predictor at p < 0.01, indicating that the novel algorithm
was able to learn the classification patterns with a significant dif-
ference to a randomly trained classifier. Both regularized logistic
regression algorithms showed differences at p < 0.1, indicating a
trend. This may be due to the limited number of samples used in the
testing set and the skewed proportions of sMCI and pMCI in-
dividuals. However, neither the random forest predictor nor the
SVM predictor showed a significant difference from a random
predictor, indicating their failure to learn the prediction relation-
ships from the training set.

McNemar’s c2 test and paired t-test were used to compare the
performance of the RUSRF algorithm with other prediction algo-
rithms. The AUC score can be considered a single metric for classifier
performance when dealing with highly unequal sample sizes
(Eskildsen et al., 2013). The RUSRF algorithm achieved the highest
AUC score and was significantly different to both SVM and L2 logistic
regression at p < 0.0025 and to random forest at p < 0.0125.
Although the AUC of RUSRFwas nominally higher than the AUC of L1
logistic regression, it was not significantly different. However, the
standard deviation of the AUC in L1 logistic regression was consid-
erably greater than that of RUSRF. This indicates that the perfor-
mance of the L1 logistic regression is more sensitive to the noise
presented in the input features (Frome et al., 2007; Fu et al., 2006),
which can lead to inconsistent results in a clinical setting when used
in early diagnosis. We also used the F1 score to compare the pre-
dictor performance as it considers both the precision and recall to
construct the metric. The RUSRF predictor achieved the highest F1
score and was significantly different from SVM at p < 0.0025 and
from L2 logistic regression at p < 0.0125. The F1 score of RUSRF was
nominally higher compared with both L1 logistic regression and
random forest but was not significant. However, in the case of
random forest, this can be due to the high precision resulting from a
high specificity evenwith a lower sensitivity value. It is important to
mention that the F1 score can be influenced by skewed class pro-
portions (Jeni et al., 2013) and needs to be consideredwhen used as a
performancemeasure. Both AUC and F1 scores were compared using
paired t-tests with Bonferroni adjusted thresholds for inference.

Comparing the sensitivity and specificity between RUSRF and
the other predictors was performed using the McNemar’s c2 test.
The sensitivity of the RUSRF predictor was significantly higher only
when compared to the SVM predictor. This can be greatly due to the
low number of pMCI individuals (n ¼ 13) in the test set, as the
statistic is calculated considering only the pMCI individuals.
Furthermore, both L1 and L2 logistic regression predictors were
nominally higher than the sensitivity of RUSRF. However, given the
number of pMCI individuals, misclassification of even a single in-
dividual can cause the sensitivity metric to fluctuate substantially.
Although the specificity of both the SVM and the random forest
predictors were higher than RUSRF, their sensitivities were not
acceptable for any clinical or research use. Among the RUSRF and
logistic regression predictors, RUSRF achieved the highest speci-
ficity and was significantly different from L2 logistic regression at p
< 0.0125 and from L1 logistic regression at p < 0.025. Although the
SVM classifier is used widely in many applications, our analysis
indicated that, at its current configurationwith a radial basis kernel,
it produced a very low sensitivity and is not suitable in identifying
pMCI individuals. However, the SVM classifier can be trained with a
number of kernel functions such as the polynomial kernel func-
tions, sigmoid kernel functions, and linear kernel functions, and this
would lead to increased sensitivity and overall classification
performance.

Direct comparisons with other similar studies conducted to
assess the predictive capability of amyloid imagingebased bio-
markers cannot be performed due to a number of reasons (see
summarized comparison in Table 3). Most studies (Brück et al.,
2013; Hatashita and Yamasaki, 2013; Jack et al., 2010a,b; Wolk
et al., 2009) have used [11C]PiB PET as the imaging biomarker, as
it was commonly used before the introduction of [18F]-based radio
ligands (except the authors of (Waragai et al., 2009), have used [11C]
BF-227 PET). Both Teipel et al. (2015) and Schreiber et al. (2015)
have used [18F]Florbetapir PET; however, Teipel et al. (2015) have
used both [18F]FDG PET and MRI biomarkers in combination with
amyloid PET as the input features for the predictor. Furthermore,
studies with similar observation periods (Brück et al., 2013; Ewers
et al., 2012; Jack et al., 2010a,b; Waragai et al., 2009) have re-
ported much higher progression rates. These increased rates may

be due to the lownumber of subjects included (Waragai et al., 2009)
by specialized memory clinics (Brück et al., 2013) and the lower
baseline Mini-Mental State Examination scores reported
(Brück et al., 2013; Ewers et al., 2012; Jack et al., 2010a,b; Waragai
et al., 2009).

Nevertheless, these studies except for Teipel et al. (2015) have
not used any model evaluation technique, such as cross validation,
to assess how their models will generalize to an independent data
set, which is of paramount importance to be successfully used as an
early diagnosis tool in a clinical environment. We obtained a higher
overall accuracy, AUC, and sensitivity compared with the accuracy
reported by Teipel et al. (2015). The low sensitivity values reported
in Teipel et al. (2015) may be due the lower proportion of pMCI
individuals included in the study, leading to a bias toward the
majority sMCI group. The novel algorithm introduced in this study
compensates for this “imbalanced class problem” by using data
sampling techniques as mentioned earlier.

Compared with several previous studies using not only Ab
PETebased biomarkers, the algorithm introduced here seems
promising with a recorded average AUC of 0.906 for an independent
test set (accuracy: 0.84; sensitivity: 0.708; and specificity: 0.865).
Often, studies use performance measures (AUC, accuracy, sensi-
tivity, and specificity) based only on cross validation; however, this
makes the prediction model biased toward the data set used as all
the samples are used for training at some point in the analysis. The
present study uses a completely independent testing set to evaluate
the true generalization capability of the model presented. The in-
dependent testing set is not used in the feature extraction step or
the model training steps. By evaluating the performance of the
prediction model based on a completely independent testing set,
we can retrieve the true expected performance of the model when
used in a clinical environment as an early diagnostic tool. The
generalization capability can be further improved by training the
model on data acquired from multiple cohorts, as using a test set
from the same cohort can add bias to the prediction model.

The most important characteristic of the present study is its
ability to overcome the inherent imbalance of proportion between
pMCI and sMCI individuals and performing comparably or even
better than the previous studies. Studies conducted by Cho et al.
(2012), Davatzikos et al. (2011), Misra et al. (2009) and Teipel
et al. (2015) used cohorts with imbalanced proportions similar to
the present study to train their predictionmodels, which resulted in
lower sensitivity scores and lower AUC values.

Another important outcome from the present study is the
relative predictive capability of the investigated brain regions
(Fig. 3B) based on Ab retention. Our study indicated that the 4 brain
regions, the temporal occipital junction, mid temporal cortex, mid
frontal cortex and precuneus to have the highest predictive ability.
Other studies conducted with Ab PETebased biomarkers also
identified similar regions to have the highest difference between
individuals progressing to Alzheimer’s disease and sMCI individuals
(Brück et al., 2013; Koivunen et al., 2011; Teipel et al., 2015). These
regions are known to show Ab deposition in relatively later stages
of the course of Alzheimer’s disease. This agrees with the idea that
the regions with early deposition of Ab such as the posterior
cingulate cortex, already reaches a plateau in the MCI stage, adding
little information to discriminate individuals progressing to Alz-
heimer’s disease, whereas regions with later build-up are more
relevant in discriminating stable and progressing MCI individuals.
Interestingly, the feature selection technique identified subcortical
structures such as the putamen and the nucleus accumbens to be
used as features for classification. It is worth to emphasize that
patients with AD have shown increased deposition of Ab in these
subcortical brain regions occurring later in the disease spectrum
(Ishibashi et al., 2014). Furthermore, these regions receive pro-
jections from different prefrontal sub-regions, mainly from the
medial prefrontal cortex (Ferry et al., 2000; Ongür and Price, 2000),
and their associations with behavioral characteristics and cognitive
performance are well known (de Jong et al., 2012; Diekhof et al.,
2012). When evaluating the brain Ab deposition, the consensus of
the field of Alzheimer’s disease is to use the average deposition
from the brain regions characteristic of Alzheimer’s disease. How-
ever, this method averages the Ab deposition in brain regions which
accumulate in different stages of Alzheimer’s disease, and will
result in a suboptimal discriminating capability compared with the
method introduced in the article (see Supplementary Material for
results of RUSRF performance with average brain Ab deposition).
Identifying the relative importance of Ab deposition in various
brain regions provides many benefits to research studies of anti-
amyloid agents to evaluate the treatment’s effect in preventing or
slowing the progression to Alzheimer’s disease.

It is important to mention several limitations of the present
study. Any Alzheimer’s disease study involving in vivo data suffers
from the inherent uncertainty of the diagnosis (Eskildsen et al.,
2013). This is because the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease can
only be confirmed with autopsy data. Therefore, any clinical diag-
nosis will always be “probable Alzheimer’s disease.” It is estimated
that around 10% of this “probable Alzheimer’s disease” diagnosis
can be mislabeled “Lewy Body disease” or “Frontotemporal de-
mentia” (Ranginwala et al., 2008). Thus, the patterns learnt by the
predictor might not be specific to Alzheimer’s disease; however,
this has been partially addressed by using an Alzheimer’s dis-
easeespecific biomarker such as Ab PET compared with a general
neurodegenerative biomarker such as MRI or glucose metabolism.

It is important to emphasize that the population included in this
analysis represents a select group of amnestic MCI individuals
motivated to participate in a dementia study, as such, for reasons
related to the study inclusion criteria these individuals may not
represent the general MCI population. Therefore, it would be highly
desirable to replicate our findings in a population-based cohort.



S. Mathotaarachchi et al. / Neurobiology of Aging xxx (2017) 1e1110
Furthermore, the predictor presented here is biased to the [18F]
Florbetapir PET acquisition protocol followed by ADNI, as the
training and testing was done using only the data acquired from the
ADNI database. Hence, clinical implementations of the present
study will still require additional reliability assessments by training
the predictor using multiple acquisition protocols to increase the
robustness of the prediction. Similarly, the feature extraction step
included identifying brain regions with a scaled odds ratio above
1.5, based on the expert opinion. The rationale behind this step was
to select the anatomically significant brain regions with an increase
of odds for developing Alzheimer’s disease of 50% for each 1 stan-
dard deviation increase of SUVR. However, this step can add bias
toward the subjective opinion of the expert and can be avoided by
selecting brain regions based on the opinion of multiple experts or
by using an automated clusterebased technique. Furthermore, due
to the computational cost of performing multiple voxel-wise lo-
gistic regression analyses, the feature selection technique employed
a single voxel-wise logistic regression analysis including all the
subjects (excluding the ones used as the final test dataset). How-
ever, the stability of the identified regions can be further increased
by employing an undersampling technique in identifying the
features.

In conclusion, we present a novel algorithm to predict the pro-
gression to Alzheimer’s disease dementia within MCI individuals
based on their Ab PET measurements. The predictor presented here
achieved a high rate of accuracy with an AUC of 0.906 for an in-
dependent test set. The novel algorithm overcomes the inherent
imbalance of proportions between stable and pMCI seen in a pop-
ulation of MCI individuals, making it ideally suited for a clinical
environment as an early diagnostic tool. Demonstration of such a
tool using the data presented in the current article can be found at
