EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
 
 “We should measure the health of our society not at its apex, but at its base.” Andrew Jackson  
 
Widening income inequality is the defining challenge of our time. In advanced economies, the gap 
between the rich and poor is at its highest level in decades. Inequality trends have been more mixed 
in emerging markets and developing countries (EMDCs), with some countries experiencing declining 
inequality, but pervasive inequities in access to education, health care, and finance remain. Not 
surprisingly then, the extent of inequality, its drivers, and what to do about it have become some of 
the most hotly debated issues by policymakers and researchers alike. Against this background, the 
objective of this paper is two-fold. 

First, we show why policymakers need to focus on the poor and the middle class. Earlier IMF work 
has shown that income inequality matters for growth and its sustainability. Our analysis suggests 
that the income distribution itself matters for growth as well. Specifically, if the income share of the 
top 20 percent (the rich) increases, then GDP growth actually declines over the medium term, 
suggesting that the benefits do not trickle down. In contrast, an increase in the income share of the 
bottom 20 percent (the poor) is associated with higher GDP growth. The poor and the middle class 
matter the most for growth via a number of interrelated economic, social, and political channels.  

Second, we investigate what explains the divergent trends in inequality developments across 
advanced economies and EMDCs, with a particular focus on the poor and the middle class. While 
most existing studies have focused on advanced countries and looked at the drivers of the Gini 
coefficient and the income of the rich, this study explores a more diverse group of countries and 
pays particular attention to the income shares of the poor and the middle class—the main engines 
of growth. Our analysis suggests that  

 Technological progress and the resulting rise in the skill premium (positives for growth and 
productivity) and the decline of some labor market institutions have contributed to inequality in 
both advanced economies and EMDCs. Globalization has played a smaller but reinforcing role. 
Interestingly, we find that rising skill premium is associated with widening income disparities in 
advanced countries, while financial deepening is associated with rising inequality in EMDCs, 
suggesting scope for policies that promote financial inclusion. 

 Policies that focus on the poor and the middle class can mitigate inequality. Irrespective of the 
level of economic development, better access to education and health care and well-targeted 
social policies, while ensuring that labor market institutions do not excessively penalize the poor, 
can help raise the income share for the poor and the middle class.  

 There is no one-size-fits-all approach to tackling inequality. The nature of appropriate policies 
depends on the underlying drivers and country-specific policy and institutional settings. In 
advanced economies, policies should focus on reforms to increase human capital and skills, 
coupled with making tax systems more progressive. In EMDCs, ensuring financial deepening is 
accompanied with greater financial inclusion and creating incentives for lowering informality 
would be important. More generally, complementarities between growth and income equality 
objectives suggest that policies aimed at raising average living standards can also influence the 
distribution of income and ensure a more inclusive prosperity. 



INEQUALITY: CAUSES AND CONSEQUENCES 

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 5 

I. CONTEXT 
1. Rising inequality is a widespread concern. Inequality within most advanced and emerging 
markets and developing countries (EMDCs) has increased, a phenomenon that has received 
considerable attention—President Obama called widening income inequality the “defining challenge 
of our time.” A recent Pew Research Center (PRC 2014) survey found that the gap between the rich 
and the poor is considered a major challenge by more than 60 percent of respondents worldwide, 
and Pope Francis has spoken out against the “economy of exclusion.” Indeed, the PRC survey found 
that while education and working hard were seen as important for getting ahead, knowing the right 
persons and belonging to a wealthy family were also critical, suggesting potential major hurdles to 
social mobility. Not surprisingly then, the extent of inequality, its drivers, and what to do about it 
have become some of the most hotly debated issues by policymakers and researchers alike. 

2. Why it matters. Equality, like fairness, is an important value in most societies. Irrespective of 
ideology, culture, and religion, people care about inequality. Inequality can be a signal of lack of 
income mobility and opportunity―a reflection of persistent disadvantage for particular segments of 
the society. Widening inequality also has significant implications for growth and macroeconomic 
stability, it can concentrate political and decision making power in the hands of a few, lead to a 
suboptimal use of human resources, cause investment-reducing political and economic instability, 
and raise crisis risk. The economic and social fallout from the global financial crisis and the resultant 
headwinds to global growth and employment have heightened the attention to rising income 
inequality. 

3. This note. The objective of the note is two-fold. First, it shows why policymakers need to 
focus on the poor and the middle class. Building on earlier IMF work which has shown that income 
inequality matters for growth, we show that the income distribution itself matters for growth as well. 
In particular, our findings suggest that raising the income share of the poor and ensuring that there 
is no hollowing-out of the middle class is good for growth through a number of interrelated 
economic, social, and political channels. Second, we investigate what explains the divergent trends in 
inequality developments across advanced economies and EMDCs, with a particular focus on the 
poor and the middle class. In that context, we are filling a gap in the literature since existing studies 
typically focus only on advanced economies or a smaller sample of EMDCs. This approach allows us 
to suggest policy implications depending on the underlying drivers, and country-specific policy and 
institutional settings.  

4. Roadmap. Section II provides an overview of the macroeconomic implications of high 
inequality of outcomes and opportunities and shows why policymakers’ focus on the income shares 
of poor and the middle class can prove growth-enhancing. Section III provides a rich documentation 
of recent trends in both monetary and nonmonetary indicators of inequality across advanced 
economies and EMDCs, while Section IV investigates the drivers of the rise in inequality, including 
from an empirical perspective. Section V concludes and discusses policy implications.

II. MACROECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES: WHY WE CARE 
5. Outcomes and opportunities. The discourse on inequality often makes a distinction 
between inequality of outcomes (as measured by income, wealth, or expenditure) and inequality of 
opportunities―attributed to differences in circumstances beyond the individual’s control, such as 
gender, ethnicity, location of birth, or family background. Inequality of outcomes arises from a 
combination of differences in opportunities and individual’s efforts and talent. At the same time, it is 
not easy to separate effort from opportunity, especially in an intergenerational context. For instance, 
parental income, resulting from their own effort, determines the opportunity of their children to 
obtain an education. It is in this spirit that Rawls (1971) argued that the distribution of opportunities 
and of outcomes are equally important and informative to understand the nature and extent of 
inequality around the world. 

6. Is inequality a necessary evil? Some degree of inequality may not be a problem insofar as 
it provides the incentives for people to excel, compete, save, and invest to move ahead in life. For 
example, returns to education and differentiation in labor earnings can spur human capital 
accumulation and economic growth, despite being associated with higher income inequality. 
Inequality can also influence growth positively by providing incentives for innovation and 
entrepreneurship (Lazear and Rosen 1981), and, perhaps especially relevant for developing 
countries, by allowing at least a few individuals to accumulate the minimum needed to start 
businesses and get a good education (Barro 2000).  

7. Why is rising inequality a concern? High and sustained levels of inequality, especially 
inequality of opportunity can entail large social costs. Entrenched inequality of outcomes can 
significantly undermine individuals’ educational and occupational choices. Further, inequality of 
outcomes does not generate the “right” incentives if it rests on rents (Stiglitz 2012). In that event, 
individuals have an incentive to divert their efforts toward securing favored treatment and 
protection, resulting in resource misallocation, corruption, and nepotism, with attendant adverse 
social and economic consequences. In particular, citizens can lose confidence in institutions, eroding 
social cohesion and confidence in the future. 

8. Income distribution matters for growth. Previous IMF studies have found that income 
inequality (as measured by the Gini coefficient, which is 0 when everybody has the same income and 
1 when one person has all the income) negatively affects growth and its sustainability (Ostry, Berg, 
and Tsangarides 2014; Berg and Ostry 2011). We build on this analysis by examining how 
individuals’ income shares at various points in the distribution matter for growth drawing on a large 
sample of advanced economies and EMDCs (Table 1).2 A higher net Gini coefficient (a measure of 

                                                 
2 This analysis is based on a sample of 159 advanced, emerging, and developing economies for the period 1980–
2012 using a simple growth model (with time and country fixed effects) in which growth depends on initial income 
(convergence hypothesis), lagged GDP growth, and inequality (as measured by net Gini or the income shares 
accruing to various quintiles) estimated using system GMM. Augmenting this model with standard growth 
determinants, such as human and physical capital, does not affect our main findings. See Annex for data sources.

inequality that nets out taxes and transfers) is associated with lower output growth over the medium 
term, consistent with previous findings. More importantly, we find an inverse relationship between 
the income share accruing to the rich (top 20 percent) and economic growth. If the income share of 
the top 20 percent increases by 1 percentage point, GDP growth is actually 0.08 percentage point 
lower in the following five years, suggesting that the benefits do not trickle down. Instead, a similar 
increase in the income share of the bottom 20 percent (the poor) is associated with 0.38 percentage 
point higher growth. This positive relationship between disposable income shares and higher growth 
continues to hold for the second and third quintiles (the middle class). This result survives a variety 
of robustness checks, and is in line with recent findings for a smaller sample of advanced economies 
(OECD 2014). In the remainder of this section, we discuss potential channels for why higher income 
shares for the poor and the middle class are growth-enhancing.

9.  Inequality affects growth drivers. 
Why would widening income disparities matter 
for growth? Higher inequality lowers growth by 
depriving the ability of lower-income 
households to stay healthy and accumulate 
physical and human capital (Galor and Moav 
2004; Aghion, Caroli, and Garcia-Penalosa 
1999). For instance, it can lead to under-
investment in education as poor children end 
up in lower-quality schools and are less able to 
go on to college.3 As a result, labor productivity 
could be lower than it would have been in a 
more equitable world (Stiglitz 2012). In the 
same vein, Corak (2013) finds that countries 
with higher levels of income inequality tend to 
have lower levels of mobility between 
generations, with parent’s earnings being a more important determinant of children’s earnings 
(Figure 1). Increasing concentration of incomes could also reduce aggregate demand and 
undermine growth, because the wealthy spend a lower fraction of their incomes than middle- and 
lower-income groups.4  
 
10. Inequality dampens investment, and hence growth, by fueling economic, financial, and 
political instability. 

 Financial crises. A growing body of evidence suggests that rising influence of the rich and 
stagnant incomes of the poor and middle class have a causal effect on crises, and thus directly 
hurt short- and long-term growth.5 In particular, studies have argued that a prolonged period of 
higher inequality in advanced economies was associated with the global financial crisis by 
intensifying leverage, overextension of credit, and a relaxation in mortgage-underwriting 
standards (Rajan 2010), and allowing lobbyists to push for financial deregulation (Acemoglu 
2011).  

 Global imbalances. Higher top income shares coupled with financial liberalization, which itself 
could be a policy response to rising income inequality, are associated with substantially larger 

                                                 
3 Widening income disparities can depress skills development among individuals with poorer parental education 
background, both in terms of the quantity of education attained (for example, years of schooling) and its quality (that 
is, skill proficiency). Educational outcomes of individuals from richer backgrounds, however, are not affected by 
inequality (Cingano 2014). 
4 See Carvalho and Rezai (2014) for a discussion of the empirical and theoretical underpinnings of this assertion. 
5 In a theoretical setting, Kumhof and Ranciere (2010) and Kumhof and others (2012) show that rising inequality 
enables investors to increase their holding of financial assets backed by loans to workers, resulting in rising debt-to-
income ratios and thus financial fragility. The latter can eventually lead to a financial crisis.

external deficits (Kumholf and others 2012). Such large global imbalances can be challenging for 
macroeconomic and/or financial stability, and thus growth (Bernanke 2011). 

 Conflicts. Extreme inequality may damage trust and social cohesion and thus is also associated 
with conflicts, which discourage investment. Conflicts are particularly prevalent in the 
management of common resources where, for example, inequality makes resolving disputes 
more difficult; see, for example, Bardhan (2005). More broadly, inequality affects the economics 
of conflict, as it may intensify the grievances felt by certain groups or can reduce the 
opportunity costs of initiating and joining a violent conflict (Lichbach 1989).  

11. Inequality can lead to policies that hurt growth. In addition to affecting growth drivers, 
inequality could result in poor public policy choices. For example, it can lead to a backlash against 
growth-enhancing economic liberalization and fuel protectionist pressures against globalization and 
market-oriented reforms (Claessens and Perotti 2007). At the same time, enhanced power by the 
elite could result in a more limited provision of public goods that boost productivity and growth, 
and which disproportionately benefit the poor (Putnam 2000; Bourguignon and Dessus 2009). 

12. Inequality hampers poverty reduction. Income inequality affects the pace at which growth 
enables poverty reduction (Ravallion 2004). Growth is less efficient in lowering poverty in countries 
with high initial levels of inequality or in which the distributional pattern of growth favors the non-
poor. Moreover, to the extent that economies are periodically subject to shocks of various kinds that 
undermine growth, higher inequality makes a greater proportion of the population vulnerable to 
poverty. 

III. STYLIZED FACTS: WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT 
INEQUALITY OF OUTCOMES AND OPPORTUNITIES? 
13. Measuring inequality. Income inequality—the most widely cited measure of inequality of 
outcomes—is typically measured by the market (gross) and net (after tax and transfers from social 
insurance programs) Gini, and by tracking changes in the income shares of the population (for 
example, by decile/quintile). Information on the assets held by the wealthiest offers a 
complementary perspective on monetary inequality. Inequality of opportunities is often measured 
by tracking health, education and human development outcomes by income group, or by examining 
access to basic services and opportunities. In this section, we document recent trends in both 
monetary and nonmonetary indicators of inequality across a large sample of advanced and EMDCs. 

Inequality of outcomes: Income  

14. Global inequality remains high. Global inequality ranges from 0.55 to 0.70 depending on 
the measure used (Figure 2). The high level of global inequality reflects sizeable per capita income 
disparities across countries, which account for around three quarters of global inequality (Milanovic 
2013). Some measures of global inequality exhibit a declining trend in the last few decades in 
response to rising incomes for those living in China and India, where hundreds of millions of people 
have been lifted out of poverty. However, other measures of global income inequality—adjusted for

top incomes which tend to be underreported in most household surveys—appear to be broadly 
stable since the early 1990s.  

Figure 2. Global Inequality and the Distribution of Income 

Sources: Lakner and Milanovic (2013); Milanovic (2013); and IMF staff calculations.  
Note: Unweighted inter-country inequality (blue line) is calculated across GDPs obtained from household surveys of all 
countries in the world, without population-weighting. The population-weighted inter-country inequality (red line) takes into 
account population weights. Finally, the global inequality concept (green dotted line) focuses on individuals, instead of 
countries. The calculation is based on household surveys with data on individual incomes or consumption. 

 
15. Globally, the middle class and the top 1 percent have experienced the largest gains. 
Examining changes in real incomes between 1998 and 2008 at various percentiles of the global 
income distribution, Lakner and Milanovic (2013) show that the largest gains acrued for the global 
median income (50th percentile) earners and for the top 1 percent. This coincides with the rapid 
growth of the middle class in many emerging market economies, and the concentration of top 
earners in advanced economies, respectively. Moreover, income gains rapidly decrease after the 
50th percentile and become stagnant around the 80th–90th global percentiles before shooting up 
for the global top 1 percent (Krugman 2014). In what follows, we focus on recent trends in within-
country inequality which drives these global developments. 

16. Widening income inequality within countries. Measures of inequality based on Gini 
coefficients of gross and net incomes have increased substantially since 1990 in most of the 
developed world (Figure 3). Inequality, on average, has remained stable in EMDCs, albeit at a much 
higher level than observed in advanced economies. However, there are large disparities across 
EMDCs, with Asia and Eastern Europe experiencing marked increases in inequality, and countries in 
Latin America exhibiting notable declines (although the region remains the most unequal in the 
world).6 Redistribution, gauged by the difference between market and net inequality, played an 
important, albeit partial, role in cushioning market income inequality in advanced economies. During

and Middle East and North Africa regions, respectively.

1990–2012, market inome inequality in advanced economies increased by an average of 5¼ Gini 
points compared to a 3 Gini point increase in the net Gini coefficient.

year were used. 

 
17. Income deciles under the microscope. Changes in income inequality across advanced 
economies and EMDCs have been driven by different developments in income shares by deciles. 
Figure 4 shows that rising income inequality (positive numbers on the vertical axes) in most 
advanced and many emerging market economies has been driven primarily by the growing income 
share of the top 10 percent (see also Piketty and Saez (2003) for the United States). Indeed, the top 
10 percent now has an income close to nine times that of the bottom 10 percent. These effects have 
been magnified by the crisis (OECD 2014). The story is somewhat different in EMDCs. Rising 
inequality for this group of countries is primarily explained by a shift in incomes of the “upper 
middle class to the upper class” (for example, in China and South Africa). Figure 4 shows that in 
EMDCs with falling inequality (negative numbers on the vertical axis), the main beneficiaries (that is, 
with the largest increase in their income shares, shown on the horizontal axis) were those at both 
the bottom and the middle of the income distribution (for example, Peru and Brazil). 

18. Top 1 percent on the rise. The top 1 percent now account for around 10 percent of total 
income in advanced economies. (Figure 5; Piketty and Saez 2011; Alvadero and others, 2013). While 
data on top income shares is scant for most EMDCs, available evidence suggests that the share of 
top incomes has risen in China and India. The growing share of the top 1 percent in advanced 
economies reflects both higher inequality in labor incomes as well as capital gains—returns from 
investments (Atkinson, Piketty, and Saez 2011). Indeed, about half of the income of the top 1 
percent constitutes non-labor income compared with 30 percent for the top 10 percent as a whole. 
For instance, corporate profits have been translated into strikingly high executive salaries and

19. Middle class squeeze. A shift in the allocation of labor income towards the higher and 
lower ends of the distribution has resulted in a 
shrinkage of the income share accruing to the 
middle 20 percent in many advanced 
economies (Australia, Canada, and Sweden are 
important exceptions), and some large 
emerging market economies (Autor, Katz, and 
Kearney 2006; Figure 7). Indeed, pretax incomes 
of middle-class households in the United States, 
the United Kingdom, and Japan have 
experienced declining or stagnant growth rates 
in recent years. Additional pressures on the 
middle class reflect a declining share of labor 
income—the predominant source of income for 
the majority of households. Indeed, average 
wages have risen at a slower pace than 
productivity growth amid large economic rents 
(for example, high profitability and large increase in executive compensation) accruing to the top 
end of the income distribution (Figure 8).

20. Sources behind the middle class squeeze vary. In advanced economies, the largest driver 
has been the declining share of middle-skilled occupations relative to low- and high-skilled 
occupations (Autor, Kerr, and Kugler 2007; Goos, Manning, and Salomons 2009). In EMDCs, the 
middle class squeeze in some countries reflects income polarization (Duclos, Esteban, and Ray 2004; 
Zhang and Kanbur, 2011). In China, for example, more than one-third of all wealth is concentrated in 
the top 1 percent, while the majority of the population remains poor despite strong economic 
growth (Hairong 2014). Widespread informality and persistently large geographical differences in 
economic performance have also played a particularly important role in shaping income inequality 
in EMDCs. 

21. Poverty has declined in many countries, but is on the rise in advanced economies. In 
many EMDCs, poverty—measured in terms of the share of population living below a pre-defined 
poverty line—has declined, despite rising income inequality in some (Figure 9). In contrast, recent 
data suggest that poverty rose in advanced countries since the 1990s (OECD 2011). The ratio of the

earnings of the 90th percentile to the earnings of the 10th percentile—another method of 
measuring inequality among the bottom 90 percent—grew in most advanced economies over the 
period between 1980 and 2011 (Autor 2014), particularly in the United States and the United 
Kingdom.

Inequality of outcomes: Wealth 

22. Rising concentration of global wealth. Estimates suggest that almost half of the world’s 
wealth is now owned by just 1 percent of the population, amounting to $110 trillion—65 times the 
total wealth of the bottom half of the world’s population (Fuentes Nieva and Galasso 2014).7 For 
instance, a third of the total wealth in the United States is held by 1 percent of the population 
(Figure 10, left panel). In most countries with available data, the share held by the 1 percent 
wealthiest population is rising at the expense of the bottom 90 percent population (Figure 10, right 
panel).

households, less their debts.

23. Inequality is more extreme in wealth 
than income. In both advanced economies and 
EMDCs, income Ginis, on average, are half the 
size of wealth Ginis (Figure 11). Possible 
explanations for the higher wealth Ginis include 
stagnant wage growth, which makes it difficult 
for middle- and lower-income workers to set 
aside money for saving, and a lower propensity 
to consume by the rich.8 While many studies 
suggest that growing wealth inequality in 
advanced economies is largely driven by rising 
wealth concentration at the top (Piketty 2014; 
Saez 2014), various explanations have been 
posited for the rise in EMDCs, ranging from 
wealth polarization between urban and rural 
areas in China to inequality among class and 
caste in India (Zhong and others 2010; Credit 
Suisse 2013). 

Inequality of Opportunity: Health Services 

24. Inequality in health outcomes is widespread in developing economies. While health 
outcomes are broadly similar across income groups in advanced countries, large disparities exist in 
EMDCs (Figure 12, left panel). For example, the infant mortality rate is twice as high in the poor than 
in the rich households (in terms of wealth) in emerging market economies. Similarly, female 
mortality rates tend to be disproportionately higher for lower-income groups. 

25. Inequality in health care access and use is more pervasive in developing countries. 
Commonly used indicators to gauge access and use of health care are generally favorable in 
advanced countries, irrespective of the income level of the population. For EMDCs, however, data on 
access to skilled health personnel for births suggest that there are large disparities in health access 
across income levels within developing countries, and to a lesser extent in emerging market 
countries (Figure 12, right panel). However, even in advanced economies, income inequality is 
increasingly being reflected in lower life expectancy. This is particularly striking in the United States, 
where income today is a stronger predictor of life expectancy than it was a generation ago (Murray, 
Lopez, and Alvarado 2013). 

  

                                                 
8 Based on national balance sheets in nine advanced economies, Piketty and Zucman (2014) find that wealth-income 
ratios have doubled over the past 40 years.

Inequality of opportunity: Education 

26. Declining education inequality in EMDCs. The education Gini—a measure of the variation 
of average years of education for different income levels—has declined significantly in EMDCs, over 
the last 60 years (Figure 13, left panel). This is largely driven by improvements in access at the lower-
end of the income distribution (Castello-Climent and Domenech 2014). Despite this improvement, 
education outcomes remain much worse for disadvantaged groups, partly because of pro-rich 
biases in the incidence of public spending (Dabla-Norris and Gradstein 2004). Indeed, almost 60 
percent of the poorest youth population (aged 20–24 years) in sub-Sahara Africa has fewer than 4 
years of schooling compared to 15 percent in the richest quintile (Figure 13, right panel). In contrast, 
education inequality, on average, is unchanged in most advanced economies over the last decade, 
although rising university costs have contributed to lower access to education by the poor in some 
countries. In the United States, for instance, college costs grew must faster than most households’ 
income since 2001 (Federal Reserve 2014).

Inequality of opportunities: Financial services 

27. Disparities in financial services access. There are large disparities in the use of financial 
services between advanced economies and EMDCs and across income levels within a country (Figure 
14). More than 80 percent of adults in advanced economies have an account at a formal financial 
institution—twice more than in EMDCs. Within EMDCs, the share of adults with an account or a loan 
at a formal financial institution is largely skewed toward the top income earners. The rest rely on 
their own limited savings to invest in education or become entrepreneurs, suggesting that financial 
inequality and income inequality go hand in hand. In many EMDCs, low-income households and 
small-scale firms often face challenges in accessing financial services due to lack of financial 
knowledge, complicated processes, onerous paperwork, and other market failures. Moreover, 
available financial products tend to be more limited and relatively costly.

IV. INEQUALITY DRIVERS 

A.   Factors Driving Higher Income Inequality 

28. Global trends: the good side of the story. Over the past four decades, technology has 
reduced the costs of transportation, improved automation, and communication dramatically. New 
markets have opened, bringing growth opportunities in countries rich and poor alike, and hundreds 
of millions of people have been lifted out of poverty. However, inequality has also risen, possibly 
reflecting the fact that growth has been accompanied by skill-biased technological change, or 
because other aspects of the growth process have generated higher inequality. In this section, we 
discuss potential global and country-specific drivers of income inequality across countries. 

29. Technological change. New information technology has led to improvements in 
productivity and well-being by leaps and bounds, but has also played a central role in driving up the

skill premium, resulting in increased labor income inequality (Figure 15). This is because 
technological changes can disproportionately raise the demand for capital and skilled labor over 
low-skilled and unskilled labor by eliminating many jobs through automation or upgrading the skill 
level required to attain or keep those jobs (Card and Dinardo 2002; Acemoglu 1998). Indeed, 
technological advances have been found to have contributed the most to rising income inequality in 
OECD countries, accounting for nearly a third of the widening gap between the 90th and the 10th 
percentile earners over the last 25 years (OECD 2011). Evidence from larger emerging market 
economies also shows a similar trend of a growing earnings gap between high- and low-skilled 
workers despite a large rise in the supply of highly educated labor (which should reduce the gap). 

 
30. Trade globalization: two sides of a coin. Trade has been an engine for growth in many 
countries by promoting competitiveness and enhancing efficiency. Nonetheless, high trade and 
financial flows between countries, partly enabled by technological advances, are commonly cited as 
driving income inequality (Figure 16). In advanced economies, the ability of firms to adopt labor-
saving technologies and offshoring has been cited as an important driver of the decline in 
manufacturing and rising skill premium (Feenstra and Hanson 1996, 1999, 2003). Trade openness 
could potentially have mixed effects on the wages of unskilled labor in advanced countries. It raises 
the skill premium, but could also increase real wages by lowering (import) prices (Munch and 
Skaksen 2009). At the same time, increased trade flows could lower income inequality in EMDCs by 
increasing demand and wages for abundant lower-skilled workers. Thus, disentangling the impact of 
trade on inequality is challenging as it depends on relative factor abundance and productivity 
differences across countries, and the extent to which individuals obtain income from wages or 
capital.

31. Financial globalization. Financial globalization can facilitate efficient international 
allocation of capital and promote international risk sharing. At the same time, increased financial 
flows, particularly foreign direct investment (FDI) and portfolio flows have been shown to increase 
income inequality in both advanced and emerging market economies (Freeman 2010). One potential 
explanation is the concentration of foreign assets and liabilities in relatively higher skill- and 
technology-intensive sectors, which pushes up the demand for and wages of higher skilled workers. 
In addition, FDI could induce skill-specific technological change, be associated with skill-specific 
wage bargaining, and result in more training for skilled than unskilled workers (Willem te Velde 
2003). Moreover, low-skill, outward FDI from advanced economies may in effect be relatively high-
skilled, inward FDI in developing economies (Figini and Görg 2011), thus exacerbating the demand 
for high-skilled workers in recipient countries. Financial deregulation and globalization have also 
been cited as factors underlying the increase in financial wealth, relative skill intensity, and wages in 
the finance industry, one of the fastest growing sectors in advanced economies (Phillipon and 
Reshef 2012; Furceri and Loungani 2013). 

32. Financial deepening. Financial deepening can provide households and firms with greater 
access to resources to meet their financial needs, such as saving for retirement, investing in 
education, capitalizing on business opportunities, and confronting shocks. Financial deepening 
accompanied by more inclusive financial systems can thus lower income inequality, while improving 
the allocation of resources (Dabla-Norris and others 2015). Theory, however, suggests that financial 
development could benefit the rich in the early stages of development, but the benefits become 
more broadly shared as economies develop (Greenwood and Jovanovic 1990). Indeed, some studies 
have found that financial development, measured as the relative share of the banking and stock 
market sectors in the economy, boosts top incomes the most in the early stages of development 
(Roine, Vlachos, and Waldenström 2009). Moreover, inequality can increase as those with higher 
incomes and assets have a disproportionately larger share of access to finance, serving to further 
increase the skill premium, and potentially the return to capital (Claessens and Perotti 2007).

33. Changes in labor market institutions. 
More flexible labor market institutions can foster 
economic dynamism by reallocating resources to 
more productive firms and enabling firm 
restructuring. However, greater flexibility can 
pose challenges for workers, especially those 
with low skills, and hence play an important role 
in explaining inequality developments (Alvadero 
and others 2013). A decline in trade union 
membership (union rate) could reduce the 
relative bargaining power of labor, exacerbating 
wage inequality (Frederiksen and Poulsen 2010; 
Wilkinson and Pickett 2010; Figure 17).9 Jaumotte 
and Osorio-Buitron (2015) and forthcoming IMF 
work finds that a reduction in the minimum wage 
relative to the median wage is associated with higher inequality in advanced economies, while a 
decline in unionization rate is strongly associated with the rise of top income shares. Moreover, 
some studies have pointed to the role of wage dispersion and a higher share of part-time and 
temporary employment in driving inequality in labor earnings in some advanced economies (OECD 
2012). For many labor market policies, such as reforms to employment protection legislation, the 
impact on inequality is less clear cut as they affect both the dispersion of earnings and the level of 
employment in sometimes conflicting ways.10 In many EMDCs, the combination of rigid hiring and 
firing and employment protection regulations and weak income protection systems often 
encourages informality, fueling wage inequality. However, evidence from a large sample of countries 
suggests that de facto labor market regulations (such as minimum wages, unionization, and social 
security contributions), on average, tend to improve the income distribution (Calderón and Chong 
2009; OECD 2011). 

34. Redistributive policies. Governments in advanced economies have historically mitigated 
inequality through public policy—primarily progressive taxes and social transfers such as public 
retirement benefits (CBO 2011). However, many advanced countries have now seen an increase in 
net income inequality, indicating gaps in existing tax-and-transfer systems to counteract rising 
market inequality. The progressivity of tax systems has declined in some advanced economies over 
the past few decades, with the result being that high-income households and corporations now face 

                                                 
9 There is a difference between coverage rate of collective bargaining agreement and union density because in many 
advanced economies multi-employer bargaining and public policies extending the negotiated contract to 
nonorganized firms guarantee coverage rates in excess of density rates. 
10 Stronger labor market institutions could increase unemployment rates, reduce the wage differential between high-
skill and low-skill workers, and affect the labor share of income. The overall impact on income inequality, however, 
can be ambiguous: they increase unemployment, which tends to raise inequality, they can reduce wage dispersion, 
which tends to lower it, and they increase the wage share, which can have an ambiguous effect on inequality.

lower effective tax rates (Hungerford 2013).11 
Indeed, Figure 18 indicates that rising pre-tax 
income concentration at the top of the 
distribution in many advanced economies has 
also coincided with declining top marginal tax 
rates (from 59 percent in 1980 to 30 percent 
in 2009). Conditional cash transfers have 
become an important policy tool for directing 
resources towards the lower end of the 
distribution in EMDCs (IMF 2014a), but their 
redistributive impact varies widely across 
countries, reflecting both differences in the 
size and progressivity of these transfers.  

35. Education. Education can play an 
important role in reducing income inequality, 
as it determines occupational choice, access 
to jobs, and the level of pay, and plays a 
pivotal role as a signal of ability and productivity in the job market. From a theoretical perspective, 
the human capital model of income distribution (Mincer, 1958; Becker and Chiswick, 1966) suggests 
that while there is an unambiguously positive association between educational and income 
inequality, the effect of increased educational attainment on income inequality could be either 
positive or negative depending on the evolution of rates of return to education (that is, the skill 
premium). Moreover, there can be opposing forces at play stemming from “composition” (that is, 
increasing the share of high-wage earners) and “wage compression” (that is, decline in the returns to 
higher education relative to lower levels) effects. Overall, the evidence suggests that the inequality 
impact of education depends on various factors, such as the size of education investments by 
individuals and governments and the rate of return on these investments. It is in this spirit that Rajan 
(2015) notes that “prosperity seems increasingly unreachable for many, because a good education, 
which seems to be today’s passport to riches, is unaffordable for many in the middle class.” 

B.   Empirical Analysis 

36. This section investigates the drivers of income inequality.12 The discussion above 
suggests that a variety of inter-related factors can impact inequality and have potentially differential 
effects across countries and income groups. In this section, using a simple panel econometric 

                                                 
11 Tax regimes can influence the mix of compensation, tilting it towards lower taxed forms of compensation, and 
thereby boost disposable income, particularly at the top. For example, capital gains are often taxed at a lower rate 
than other income and, in a few countries, they are not taxed at all. Stock options also benefit from preferential tax 
treatment in many advanced economies. 
12 We are unable to also investigate the drivers of wealth inequality due to data unavailability for a broad sample of 
advanced economies and EMDCs.

approach with year and country fixed effects, we investigate the drivers of within country changes in 
income inequality for a sample of almost 100 advanced economies and EMDCs over the period 
1980–2012 (see Box 1 for empirical specification). In contrast to other studies, we focus on a large 
group of countries to assess whether the determinants of inequality vary across advanced, emerging 
markets and developing economies, and across different measures of inequality. In addition to the 
Gini coefficients of both market and net inequality, we build on our earlier result that the income 
distribution itself matters for growth by examining the determinants of the disposable income 
shares (after tax) of the poor (bottom 10 percent), the middle-class (fifth decile), and the rich (top 10 
percent). This allows us to focus on the factors driving income concentration in recent years, 
especially changes in the income shares of the poor and the middle class.  

37. Drivers of gross and net inequality. Table 2 (Columns 1 and 2) presents the results of the 
regression analysis for gross and net inequality. Our results on the role of globalization and 
technological progress in driving inequality are broadly in line with the findings in the literature. In 
particular, trade openness is associated with lower inequality (albeit not in a statistically significant 
way), while greater financial openness and technological progress are associated with rising income 
inequality, likely reflecting the fact these disproportionately benefit high-tech and labor-skilled 
sectors. Indeed, we find that financial globalization and technological progress are associated with an 
increase in the top 10 percent disposable income share across all countries (Column 3). 

38. Differential impacts of financial deepening across country groups. The impact of 
financial deepening, as proxied by the ratio of private credit to GDP, on both market and net 
inequality varies across advanced economies and EMDCs, in line with Roine, Vlachos, and 
Waldenström 2009. In particular, our results 
suggest that financial deepening is associated 
with higher income inequality in EMDCs. This 
likely reflects the fact that while financial 
deepening has accelerated over the past two 
decades, the record on financial inclusion 
may not have kept apace in these countries. 
Indeed, Figure 19 indicates that financial 
deepening was associated with higher market 
and net income inequality in countries with 
low levels of financial inclusion (typically 
EMDCs), possibly reflecting that large 
amounts of credit are often concentrated 
among the largest firms and wealthier 
households. By contrast, financial deepening 
is associated with less of an increase in 
market inequality (and lower net inequality) 
in advanced economies, reflecting easier 
access to credit for households and firms.

Box 1. Assessing the Drivers of Income Inequality Around the World 

Our empirical approach is based on a simple model of within-country variation in inequality, controlling 
for differences in levels across countries using five-year panels over the period 1980–2012. Specifically, 
the analysis builds on Jaumotte, Lall, and Papageorgiou (2013) and is based on the following 
specification: 

in which  refers to the relevant inequality measure used for country i at time t, trade proxies 
for trade globalization, measured as the sum of exports and imports as a share of a country’s GDP, 
financial captures financial globalization, measured as the sum of foreign assets and liabilities relative to 
GDP, and technology measures the share of information and communication technology (ICT) capital in 
the total capital stock. Credit captures domestic financial market development, and is proxied by the ratio 
of private credit to GDP. Since the effect of financial development could vary across advanced economies 
and EMDCs, we also include an interaction term between the credit variable and a dummy variable which 
takes the value of 1 for advanced economies, and zero otherwise. Given data limitations, and in line with 
Mincer’s (1958) wage specification, we use the average years of education in the population aged 15 and 
older as a proxy for the skill premium. As noted in the literature, the effect of skill-biased technological 
change could vary across advanced economies and EMDCs. To capture this, we also include an 
interaction term between the skill premium variable and a dummy variable that takes the value of 1 for 
advanced economies, and zero otherwise. We also include a measure of labor market flexibility from the 
World Economic Forum that measures the extent by which regulations govern firing and hiring, collective 
bargaining, and minimum wages.  

Additional control variables attempt to capture aspects of inequality of opportunities, including the 
beginning of period education Gini (a proxy for access to education); the quality and availability of health 
system is measured by the beginning of period female mortality (aged 15–60) rate. Given data limitations, 
as a proxy for redistributive policies, we include the beginning of period Fraser Institute index that 
measures total government spending as a share of GDP (see also Perotti [1992]).,The terms  and  
represent a full set of time and country dummies, respectively, and εit captures all the omitted factors. 
Country fixed effects allow us to focus on within-country changes instead of cross-country level 
differences. In addition, time dummies are included to capture the impact of common global shocks such 
as business cycles or growth spurts. All specifications include lagged GDP growth and share of 
employment in agriculture and industry as additional controls. Lagged GDP growth is included in the 
specifications as there could be a two way causality between output growth and inequality.  

While causality is difficult to establish with full confidence, the results survive a variety of robustness 
checks for omitted variables, endogeneity problems, and estimation methods and are broadly in line with 
findings from the literature that focus on smaller country samples. For example, we checked the 
robustness of our results by including dummies for financial crises, GDP per capita, and alternative 
measures of the skill premium, trade, and financial openness. For some Organisation for Economic Co-
operation and Development (OECD) countries with available tax and benefits data, we also considered 
alternative measures for redistributive policies as well as top marginal personal income-tax rates. The 
results, not reported here but available upon request, suggest that lower marginal tax rates are 
associated with higher market and net inequality and a higher income share of the top 10 percent.

39. Higher skill premium is associated with widening inequality in advanced economies. In 
advanced economies, increases in the skill premium exacerbate market income inequality, reflecting 
the fact that education gains accrue disproportionately at the higher end of the income 
distribution.13 The statistically insignificant effect of the skill premium in driving net income 
inequality, however, could reflect the fact that the net Gini is underestimating increases in inequality 
at the top of the distribution (Kakwani 1980). Indeed, an increase in the skill premium is associated 

                                                 
13 Our specification uses the average years of education in the population as a proxy for skills; see also Card and 
DiNardo (2000), essentially implying that the skill premium is determined solely by the supply of skills. Similar results 
were obtained using alternative measures, such the ratio of earnings from employment after completing tertiary 
education compared to the earnings after completing upper- and post-secondary education for a smaller sample of 
OECD countries (available upon request).

with a significantly higher disposable income share of the top 10 percent. This effect is found to be 
statistically insignificant in EMDCs, and is in line with studies that find an absence of a correlation 
between income differentials and the quantity of skills in these countries, likely reflecting large 
differences in factor endowments and capacity to absorb new technologies across EMDCs (Behar 
2013).  

40. Easing of labor market regulations is associated with higher market inequality and 
income share of the top 10 percent. In particular, a decline in organized labor institutions and the 
resultant easing of labor markets measured by an increase in labor market flexibilities index by 8½ 
percent—from the median to 60th percentile—is associated with rising market inequality by 1.1 
percent. The relationship between the top 10th percentile income share and easing of labor market 
regulations is also positive and statistically significant (Column 3) for our sample of countries, likely 
reflecting the fact that labor market flexibility benefits the rich and reduces the bargaining power of 
lower-income workers. This result confirms Jaumotte and Osorio-Buitron (2015) and forthcoming 
IMF work which find that weakening of unions is associated with a higher top 10 percent income 
share for a smaller sample of advanced economies.14 Indeed, empirical estimations using more 
detailed data for OECD countries (not reported here, but available upon request) suggest that, in 
line with Jaumotte and Osorio-Buitron (2015) and forthcoming IMF work, more lax hiring and firing 
regulations, lower minimum wages relative to the median wage, and less prevalent collective 
bargaining and trade unions are associated with higher market inequality. The impact of labor 
market institutions on inequality, however, is somewhat blunted by government actions as shown by 
the statistically insignificant coefficient in the net Gini regression (Table 2, Column 2). 

41. Government actions can contribute to greater equality. In particular, we find that an 
increase in our proxy for government redistributive spending relative to total spending by 7.1 
percent (that is, a shift from the median value to the 60th percentile) is associated with a 0.6 percent 
decrease in income inequality. While total government spending can be a poor proxy for the 
progressivity of tax-transfer systems, this result continues to hold for other measures of 
redistribution for a smaller sample of OECD countries (not reported here, but available upon 
request), suggesting that the composition of government spending is important for reducing 
inequality.15 Moreover, healthier societies, as proxied by a lower female mortality rate, tend to have 
lower income inequality. While causality is difficult to establish, the latter finding suggests that 
greater and more equal access to quality health services allows people to be more productive, thus 
lowering income disparities.  

42. Overall contributors to changes in inequality. Based on the estimated models, the 
contributions of the various factors to the change in the market Gini coefficient can be calculated.16 

                                                 
14 This finding is also in line with recent research that finds that wage inequality falls during periods when union 
density is increasing and rises when union membership is in decline (World Bank 2013). 
15 Joumard, Pisu, and Bloch (2012) look at the role of taxes and transfers while OECD (2012b) looks at how education 
policies, progressive taxes and transfers can tackle inequality.  
16 These estimates are calculated as the average annual change in the respective variable multiplied by the 
corresponding coefficient estimate in Table 2, Column 1. 



INEQUALITY: CAUSES AND CONSEQUENCES 

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 27 

We find that less-regulated labor markets, financial deepening, and technological progress largely 
explain the rise in market income inequality in our full sample over the last 30 years (Figure 20). 
Globalization (that is, financial openness) has played a smaller but reinforcing role, while 
improvements in health outcomes mitigated around ½ percent of the almost 3 percentage points 
average increase in the Gini coefficient. The relative importance of the skill premium, globalization, 
technological progress, and financial deepening in driving inequality, however, varies across 
advanced economies and EMDCs.  

 
43. What has been driving income shares of the poor and the middle class? Given the 
importance of the poor (bottom 10 percent) and the middle class for boosting growth, we 
investigate what explains changes in the income shares for these income groups across different 
countries. On average, the income shares of the poor and the middle class have risen much more 
slowly than that of the top 10 percent, which explains the rising income inequality observed in many 
countries. Looking more closely into the determinants (Table 2, Columns 4 and 5, and Figure 21), we 
find: 

 Better access to education (as captured by declining educational inequality), improved health 
outcomes, and redistributive social polices help raise the income share of the poor and the 
middle class irrespective of the level of economic development of a country.17 By contrast, 
easing of labor market regulations and technological progress dampen the income share of the 
poor and the middle class, consistent with other studies. This result is not surprising, since the 
poor are often disproportionally employed in lower-paying and less secure jobs (often in the 
informal sector) and tend to benefit more from labor market regulations such as minimum 
wages and firing restrictions. This points to the policy role of making education more accessible 
(Bruckner, Dabla-Norris, and Gradstein 2015), while ensuring that changes in labor market 
institutions do not excessively penalize lower-income individuals. Moreover, to the extent that 

                                                 
17 In a recent speech, Rajan (2015) refers to economic inclusion—easing access to quality education, nutrition, health 
care, finance, and markets to all our citizens, as a “necessity for sustainable growth,” in addition to “obviously, a 
moral imperative.”

redistributive policies can play a role in reducing inequality, they can be supported by making 
the tax systems more efficient and progressive and improving targeted spending.  

 There are important differences in inequality drivers between advanced economies and EMDCs, 
suggesting the need to tailor policies to country-specific conditions. In particular, we find that 
financial deepening has played a role in raising the income shares of the poor and the middle 
class in advanced economies, but not in EMDCs, likely reflecting differences in credit allocation 
and the extent of financial inclusion. In contrast, reducing gaps in access to education has been 
one of the most important drivers of higher income shares for the bottom 10 percent and the 
middle class in EMDCs. A complementary way to look at the income share of the poor is to 
examine the drivers of the interplay between inequality and the poverty rate—defined as the 
population living below $2 a day (Box 2). Our findings suggest that greater equality in access to 
education lifts the poverty elasticity of economic growth. 

 Financial globalization and a higher skill premium have accounted for a more significant share of 
the widening income gap between the top 10 percent and the poor and the middle class in 
advanced economies than in developing countries. Policies to raise skills and reforms to increase 
human capital are thus important for improving living standards and reducing labor income 
inequality in advanced economies. In contrast to conventional wisdom, our results suggest that 
globalization has played a less significant role in driving down income shares of the bottom 10 
percent and the middle class in EMDCs (see also Box 2), suggesting that the benefits of 
globalization discussed earlier potentially outweigh the costs in some of these countries.

Box 2. Drivers of Poverty 

Another way to look at the income shares of the poor is to examine the drivers of poverty rate—defined as the 
population living below $2 a day (PPP-adjusted)—and look at the interplay between poverty and inequality. 
The literature points to various sources for poverty reduction, including higher economic growth (Kraay 2006) 
and a rise in the income share of the poor (Ravallion 2004). A large strand of the literature also explores how 
inequality affects poverty reduction via its growth impact; see for example, Bourguignon (2003) and Fosu 
(2010). 

Using a sample of almost 100 EMDCs for the period 1985–2010, we investigate what is behind the declining 
share of people living below the $2 a day poverty line over the last 30 years. Following Bourguignon (2003), we 
first investigate the importance of inequality and growth on poverty reduction. Our results suggest that while 
the impact of the change in inequality, as measured by the Gini, does not appear to be significant per se, 
higher initial inequality lowers the growth elasticity of poverty reduction (Table 3, Column 1). Moreover, a 
higher initial level of education inequality dampens the growth elasticity of poverty, while a higher 
employment growth in manufacturing, as seen in emerging market economies in Asia for instance, is 
associated with a lower share of the population living below the poverty line (Column 2). We also find that 
greater trade openness can amplify the growth elasticity of poverty, albeit not in a statistically significant way, 
while financial openness amplifies it in a significant way  (Column 3).

44. Caveats. We should of course be cautious about drawing definitive policy implications from 
cross-country regression analysis, as different policies are likely to have varying effects across 
countries and at different points in time. Measurement limitations in comparing inequality across 
time and countries also need to be considered. In addition, it is hard to go from the sorts of 
correlations presented in the note to firm statements about causality as there can be a two-way 
causality running from growth-to-income inequality. Indeed, in-depth country-specific analyses 
suggest that a number of inter-related factors drive growth, the income level, and income inequality. 
Despite these limitations, our analysis points to a policy role for tackling inequality.  

V. POLICY DISCUSSION AND FINAL REMARKS  
45. No one-size-fits-all. Policymakers around the world need to consider policies to tackle 
inequality. Raising the income share of the poor, and ensuring that there is no hollowing-out of the 
middle class is actually good for growth. Our empirical analysis also suggests that the drivers of 
inequality and their impact differ across countries for different income groups. As such, the nature of 
appropriate policies would necessarily vary across countries, and would also need to take into 
account country-specific policy and institutional settings, and capacity/implementation constraints. 
Recent work by the World Bank (2015) also highlights the importance of adopting a psychological 
and social perspective on policymaking that takes into account what policy is implemented and 
how.  

46. Squaring equity and efficiency concerns. Lowering income inequality does not need to 
come at the cost of lower efficiency. Previous IMF work has shown that there does not need to be a 
stark efficiency-equity tradeoff (Ostry, Berg, and Tsangarides 2014). Redistribution through the tax 
and transfer system is found to be positively related to growth for most countries, and is negatively 
related to growth only for the most strongly redistributive countries. This suggests that the effect of 
redistribution on enhanced opportunities for lower-income households and on social and political 
stability could potentially outweigh any negative effects on growth through a damping of incentives.  

47. Fiscal policy can be an important tool for reducing inequality. Fiscal policy plays a 
critical role in ensuring macrofinancial stability and can thus help avert/minimize crises that 
disproportionately hurt the disadvantaged population. At the same time, fiscal redistribution, carried 
out in a manner that is consistent with other macroeconomic objectives, can help raise the income 
share of the poor and middle class, and thus support growth. Fiscal policy already plays a significant 
role in addressing income inequality in many advanced economies, but the redistributive role of 
fiscal policy could be reinforced by greater reliance on wealth and property taxes, more progressive 
income taxation, removing opportunities for tax avoidance and evasion, better targeting of social 
benefits while also minimizing efficiency costs, in terms of incentives to work and save (IMF 2014a). 
In addition, reducing tax expenditures that benefit high-income groups most and removing tax 
relief—such as reduced taxation of capital gains, stock options, and carried interest—would increase 
equity and allow a growth-enhancing cut in marginal labor income tax rates in some countries. In 
EMDCs, better access to education and health services, well-targeted conditional cash transfers and 
more efficient safety nets can have a positive impact on disposable incomes of the poor (Bastagli, 
Coady and Gupta 2012). In many cases, this increasing public spending would need to be

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 31 

undertaken in tandem with rising revenue mobilization, reduced tax loopholes, and tax evasion, and 
lower less- well-targeted spending (such as oil subsidies).  

48. Education policies are key. In a world in which technological change is increasing 
productivity and simultaneously mechanizing jobs, raising skill levels is critical for reducing the 
dispersion of earnings. Improving education quality, eliminating financial barriers to higher 
education, and providing support for apprenticeship programs are all key to boosting skill levels in 
both tradable and nontradable sectors. These policies can also help improve the income prospects 
of future generations as educated individuals are better able to cope with technological and other 
changes that directly influence productivity levels. In advanced economies, with an already high 
share of secondary or tertiary graduates among the working-age population, policies that improve 
the quality of upper secondary or tertiary education would be important. In developing countries 
with currently low levels of education attainment, policies that promote more equal access to basic 
education (for example, cash transfers aimed at encouraging better attendance at primary schools, 
or spending on public education that benefits the poor) could help reduce inequality by facilitating 
the accumulation of human capital, and making educational opportunities less dependent on socio-
economic circumstances.  

49. Fostering financial inclusion safely. Financial deepening in EMDCs needs to be 
accompanied by greater inclusion to make a dent in inequality. Governments have a central role to 
play in alleviating impediments to financial inclusion by creating the associated legal and regulatory 
framework (for example, protecting creditor rights, regulating business conduct, and overseeing 
recourse mechanisms to protect consumers), supporting the information environment (for example, 
setting standards for disclosure and transparency and promoting credit information-sharing systems 
and collateral registries), and educating and protecting consumers. Country experiences also 
suggest that policies such as granting exemptions from onerous documentation requirements, 
requiring banks to offer basic accounts, and allowing correspondent banking are useful in fostering 
inclusion. The promotion of credit without sufficient regard for financial stability, however, can result 
in crises, as evidenced by the subprime mortgage crisis in the United States, with disproportionately 
adverse effects on the poor and the middle class. Moreover, it illustrates the broader point that deep 
social issues cannot be resolved purely with an infusion of credit. Policies thus need to strike a 
balance between fostering prudence stability, and inclusion, while encouraging innovation and 
creativity. 

50. Well-designed labor market policies and institutions can reduce inequality, and, at the 
same time, not be a drag on efficiency. Policies that reduce labor market imperfections and 
institutional failures that affect job creation can help support poor and middle-income workers. For 
instance, appropriately set minimum wages, spending on well-designed active labor market policies 
aimed at supporting job search and skill matching can be important. Better use of in-work benefits 
for social benefit recipients also help reduce income disparities. Moreover, policies that reduce labor 
market dualism, such as gaps in employment protection between permanent and temporary 
workers—especially young workers and immigrants—can help to reduce inequality, while fostering 
greater market flexibility. More generally, labor market policies should attempt to avoid either 
excessive regulations or extreme disregard for labor conditions. Labor market rules that are very 



CAUSES AND CONSEQUENCE OF INEQUALITY 

32 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 

weak or programs that are nonexistent can leave problems of poor information, unequal power, and 
inadequate risk management untreated, penalizing the poor and the middle class (World Bank 
2012). In contrast, excessively stringent regulations can compound market imperfections with 
institutional failures, and weigh on job creation and efficiency. 

51. In EMDCs, making labor markets more inclusive and creating incentives for lowering 
informality is a key challenge. Workers in these countries often lack equal access to productive job 
opportunities and do not benefit evenly from economic growth. Many individuals with low skills, in 
particular, remain trapped in precarious jobs, often in the informal and unregulated economy. In 
such jobs, even full-time employment tends to be insufficient to lift households out of poverty. Thus, 
creating accessible, productive, and rewarding jobs is key to escaping poverty and reducing 
inequality. Informal workers need to have the necessary legal, financial, and educational means to 
access formal sector employment. Higher formal sector employment also requires better incentives 
for firms to become formal. Policies to reduce tax, financial, and regulatory constraints can expand 
formal sectoral employment by reducing the incentives for firms to operate informally, both by 
increasing the benefits of participating in the formal sector and by reducing the costs of doing so 
(Dabla-Norris and Inchauste 2008).  

52. Complementarities between growth and income equality objectives. Reforms aimed at 
raising average living standards can also influence the distribution of income. Indeed, tackling 
inequality goes beyond the remit of labor, social welfare, financial inclusion, and tax policies. The key 
to minimizing the downside of both globalization and technological change in advanced economies 
is a policy agenda of a race to the top, instead of a race to the bottom—an agenda that includes 
policies to encourage innovation, reduce burdensome product market regulations that stifle 
competition and technology diffusion, move goods produced upwards in the value chain, and 
ensure that this rise benefits everyone. In developing countries, raising agricultural productivity, 
rapid accumulation of capital, and technology diffusion in labor-intensive sectors can substantially 
lift growth and ensure that the fruits of prosperity are more broadly shared (Dabla-Norris and others 
2013). Sustaining growth in emerging market economies will require more intensive patterns of 
growth, greater flexibility to shift resources within and across sectors, and the capacity to apply 
more knowledge and skill-intensive production techniques. Policies to improve skills for all, to 
ensure that a nation’s infrastructure meets its needs, and to encourage innovation and technology 
adoption are thus all essential to driving growth and ensuring a more inclusive prosperity.
