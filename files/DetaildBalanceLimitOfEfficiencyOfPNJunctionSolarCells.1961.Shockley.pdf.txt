. I~. order t? find an upper theoretical limit for the efficiency of p-n junction solar energy converters, a 
limiting effiCiency, called the detailed balance limit of efficiency, has been calculated for an ideal case in which 
the cmly recombin.ation ~echanism of hole-electron pairs is radiative as required by the principle of detailed 
b.alance. The effiCiency IS ~lso calculated for the case in which radiative recombination is only a fixed frac-
tion f. of the total recombmation, the rest being nonradiative. Efficiencies at the matched loads have been 
calculated with band gap and f. as parameters, the sun and cell being assumed to be blackbodies with tem-
peratures of 6OO0 oK and 30(tK, ~espectively. The maxim~m efficiency is found to be 30% for an energy gap 
of 1.1. ev and fc= 1: Actual JunctIOns do not obey the predicted current-voltage relationship, and reasons for 
the difference and Its relevance to efficiency are discussed. 

1. INTRODUCTION 

M ANY papers have been written about the effi-ciency of solar cells employing p-n junctions in 
semiconductors, the great potential of the silicon solar 
cell having been emphasized by Chapin, Fuller and 
Pearson! in 1954. Also in 1954, Pfann and van Roos-
broeck2 gave a more detailed treatment including ana-
lytic expressions optimizing or matching the load. A 
further treatment was given by Prince3 in 1955 in 
which the efficiency was calculated as a function of'the 
energy gap. Loferski4 has attempted to predict the de-
pendence of efficiency upon energy gap in more detail. 
Review papers have recently appeared in two journals 
in this country.5,6 

The treatments of efficiency presented in these papers 
are based on empirical values for the constants de-
~cribing the. char~eteristies of the solar eelU They are 
In general In fairly good agreement with observed 
e~ciencies, and predict certain limits. These predic-
tIOns have become generally accepted as theoretical 
limits (see, for example, the review articles by Rappa-
portS and Wolf6). 

It is the view of the present authors that the ac-
ceptan~e of this previously predicted limiting curve 
.::J.f effi~l~ncy vs energy gap is not theoretically justified 
SInce It IS based on certain empirical values of lifetime 
etc. We shall refer to it as the semiempiricallimit. '

and compared with the semi empirical limit in Fig. 1. 
Actually the two limits are not extremely different, the 
detailed balance limit being at most higher by about 
50% in the range of energy gaps of chief interest. Thus, 
to some degree, this article is concerned with a matter 
of principle rather than practical values. The difference 
is much more signIficant, however, insofar as estimating 
potential for improvement is concerned. In fact, the 
detailed balance limit may lie more than twice as far 
above the achieved values as does the semiempirical 
limit, thus suggesting much greater possible improve-
ment (see Fig. 1). 

The situation at present may be understood by 
analogy with a steam power plant. If the second law of 
thermodynamics were unknown, there might still exist 
quite good calculations of the efficiency of any given 
configuration based on heats of combustion, etc. How-
ever, a serious gap would still exist since it would be 
~mpossible to say how much the efficiency might be 
Improved by reduction of bearing friction, improving 
heat exchangers, etc. The second law of thermody-
namics provides an upper limit in terms of more funda-
mental quantities such as the temperature of the ex-
othermic reaction and the temperature of the heat sink. 
The merit of a given power plant can then be appraised 
in terms of the limit set by the second law. 

A similar situation exists for the solar cell, the missing 
theoretical efficiency being, of course, in no way com-
parable in importance to the second law of thermo-
dynamics. Factors such as series resistance and reflec-
tion losses correspond to friction in a power plant. There 
are even two temperatures, that of the sun T. and that 
of the solar cell Te. The efficiency of a solar converter 
can in principle be brought to the thermodynamic 
limit (T.-Tc)jTc by using reflectors, etc. 8 However, a 
planar solar cell, without concentrators of radiation 
cannot approach this limit. The limit it can approach 
depends on its energy gap and certain geometrical 
factors such as the angle sub tended by the sun and the 

8 H. A. Miiser, Z. Physik 148, 380 (1957), and A. L. Rose (see 
footnote 7) have used the second law of thermodynamics in their 
treatments of photovoltage.

angle of incidence of the radiation, and certain other 
less basic degrading factors, which in principle may 
approach unity, such as the absorption coefficient for 
solar energy striking the surface. 

Among the factors which may approach unity, at 
least so far as the basic laws of physics are .concerned, 
is the fraction of the recombination between holes and 
electrons which results in radiation. Radiative recom-
bination sets an upper limit to minority carrier life-
time. The lifetimes due to this effect have been calcu-
lated using the principle of detailed balance.9 It is this 
radiative recombination that determines the detailed 
balance limit for efficiency.lO If radiative recombina-
tion is only a fraction fe of all the recombination, then 
the efficiency is substantially reduced below the de-
tailed balance limit. 

How closely any existing material can approach the 
desirable limit of unity for fe is not known. Existing 
silicon solar cells fail to fit the current-voltage charac-
teristics predicted on the basis of any of the existing 
recombination models.u The extent of this discrepancy 
and one suggested explanation are discussed in Sec. 6. 

In determining the detailed balance limit of effici-
ency, the efficiency '1/ calculated below is defined in the 
usual way as the ratio of power delivered to a matched 
load to the incident solar power impinging on the cell. 
The following sections present a step-by-step calcula-
tion of this efficiency as a function of the essential 
variables, including several which may reduce the effi-
ciency below the detailed balance limit. Three of these 
variables have the dimensions of energy and can be 
expressed as temperatures, voltages or frequencies. 
These variables are: the temperature of the sun T., 

kT.=gV.; 

the temperature of the solar cell T e, 

kT.=qVc ; 
and the energy gap Eg , 

Eg=hvg=qVg, 

(1.1)

where k is Boltzmann's constant, q= I q I is the elec-
tronic charge, and h is Planck's constant. The effici-
ency is found to involve only the two ratios 

(1.4) 

(1.5) 

The efficiency also depends strongly upon t., which is

large as three.

defined as 

t.=the probability that a photon with hv>Eg 
incident on the surface will produce a hole-
electron pair. (1.6) 

For the detailed balance efficiency limit to be reached, 
t. must be unity. 

Other parameters involving transmission of radiative 
recombination out of the cell and the solid angle sub-
tended by the sun enter as factors in a quantity f 
discussed in Eq. (3.20). The value of f for the highest 
efficiency, corresponding to the detailed balance limit, 
is determined by the solid angle sub tended by the sun, 
the other factors related to material properties being 
given their maximum values, which are unity. 

To a very good approximation the efficiency is a 
function 'f/(xg , Xc, ta, f) of four variables just discussed. 
It can be expressed in terms of analytic functions based 
on the Planck distribution and other known functions. 
The development of this relationship is carried out in 
Sees. 2-5. Section 6 compares calculations of the de-
tailed balance limit with the semiempiricallimit. 

2. ULTIMATE EFFICIENCY: u(xo) 

There is an ultimate efficiency for any device em-
ploying a photoelectric process which has a single cut-
off frequency v g. 

We shall consider a cell in which photons with energy 
greater than hVg produce precisely the same effect as 
photons of energy hvg, while photons of lower energy 
will produce no effect. We shall calculate the maximum 
efficiency which can be obtained from such a cell sub-
jected to blackbody radiation. 

Figure 2 (a) illustrates an idealized solar cell model 
which we shall consider in this connection. It repre-
sents a p-n junction at temperature T c= 0, surrounded 
by a blackbody at temperature T •. In a later discussion

we shall allow a finite Tc and replace the surrounding 
body at temperature Ts by radiation coming from the 
sun at a small solid angle Ws as represented in Fig. 2 (b). 
We shall assume that some means not indicated in the 
figure are present for maintaining the solar cell at 
temperature Tc=O so that only steady state conditions 
need be considered. According to the ultimate effici-
ency hypothesisl2 : 

Each photon with energy greater than 
hV g produces one electronic charge q at 
a voltage of Vg=hvu/q. (2.1) 

The number of photons incident from the solar 
radiation in Fig. 2 is readily calculated in accordance 
with the formulas of the Planck distribution. We de-
note by Qs the number of quanta of frequency greater 
than Vo incident per unit area per unit time for black-
body radiation of temperature Ta. For later purposes 
we shall also introduce the symbol Q(vg,Ts) in order to 
be able to represent situations for different values of 
the limiting frequency. In accordance with this nota-
tion and well-known formulas, we have 

Qs=Q(vg,Ts)=(27rjc2) 1"" [exp(hv/kTs)-1]-lv2dv

= [27r(kT.)3/h3c2] f"" x2dx/ (e x -1), (2.2)

12 Once a photon exceeds about three times the energy gap Eg , 
the probability of producing two or more hole-electron pairs 
becomes appreciable: V. S. Vavilov, J. Phys. Chern. Solids 8, 
223 (1959), and J. Tauc, J. Phys. Chern. Solids 8, 219 (1959). 
These authors interpret this result in terms of a threshold of 
about 2Eg for an electron to produce a pair. However, the data 
can be well fitted up to quantum yields greater than two by 
assuming a threshold of only slightly more than Ii. and assuming 
the energy divides equally between the photohole and the pho-
toelectron. This effect would slightly increase the possible quan-
tum efficiency; however, we shall not consider it further in this 
article. See also W. Shockley, Solid State Electronics 2,35 (1961). 

in which the symbol Xg is that of Eq. (1.4), 

xukTs=hvu=qVg. (2.3) 

Q. is seen to be a function of the form T83 times a 
function of XU' 

If the surface subject to the radiation in Fig. 2 has 
an area A, then in accordance with the ultimate effi-
ciency hypothesis, the output power will be given by: 

output power=hvuAQs. (2.4) 

The incident power, due to the radiation at Ts falling 
upon the device of Fig. 2, will evidently be: 

incident power=APs. (2.5) 

P s is the total energy density falling upon unit area in 
unit time for blackbody radiation at temperature Ts. 
In accordance with well-known formulas for the Planck 
distribution, Pa is given by

It is instructive to compare P B with the total number 
of incident photons per unit time Q(O,Ts) so as to ob-
tain the average energy per photon: 

Ps={[i"" X3dx/(e x -l)]1 £"" X2dx/(e<-l)}

= [(37r4/90)/ (7r3/2s. 794· .. )][kTsQ(O,Ts)] 

= 2.701· .. kTsQ(O,Ts). (2.7) 

The integrals in Eqs. (2.6) and (2.7), one of which is 
the limiting form for x=o in Eq. (2.2), may be ex-
pressed by products of the gamma function and the 
Riemann zeta function. The mathematical relations in-
volved and numerical values are found in standard 
references. 13 

In accordance with the above definitions, the ulti-
mate efficiency is a function only of Xu and is

It is evident that u(xu) has a maximum value, since 
the numerator in Eq. (2.8) is finite and vanishes both 
as Xu approaches zero and as it approaches infinity.14 
Figure 3 shows the dependence of u(xo) as a function 
of X g •15 It is seen that the maximum efficiency is ap-
proximately 44% and comes for an Xg value of 2.2 in 
terms of a temperature of 6000 0 K for the sun. This 
corresponds to an energy gap value given by Eq. (2.3) 
of 1.1 ev. 

3. CURRENT-VOLTAGE RELATIONSHIP 
FOR A SOLAR CELL 

In this section we shall consider a solar cell sub-
jected to radiation from the sun, which is considered 
to subtend a small solid angle as represented in Fig. 
2 (b). The treatment will be based upon determining 
the steady state current-voltage condition which pre-
vails on the basis of requiring that hole-electron pairs 
are eliminated as rapidly as they are produced. In 
order to carry out the calculation, five processes must 
be considered: (1) generation of hole-electron pairs by 
the incident solar radiation, the rate for the entire 
device being Fs; (2) the radiative recombination of 
hole-electron pairs with resultant emission of photons, 
the rate being Fe; (3) other nonradiative processes 
which result in generation and (4) recombination of 
hole-electron pairs; and (5) removal of holes from the 
p-type region and electrons from the n-type region in 
the form of a current I which withdraws hole-electron 
pairs at a rate II q. The steady state current-voltage 
relationship is obtained by setting the sum of these 
five processes equal to zero. 

Consider first the net rate of generation of hole-
electron pairs for the solar battery of Fig. 2 (a) under 
the condition in which it is surrounded by a blackbody 
at its own temperature, Tc¥-O. Under these conditions 
photons with frequencies higher than Vo will be incident 
per unit area per unit time on the surface at a rate 
Qe, where Qe=Q(vy,Tc) as given by Eq. (2.2). Evidently 
Qc is a function of the form Te3 times a function of 
xol xc. The number of these photons which enter the 
cell and produce hole-electron pairs is represented by 

14 For the calculations, numerical tables of the integrals in-
volved were used as given by K. H. Bohm and B. Schlender, Z. 
Astrophysik 43, 95 (1957). We are indebted to A. Unsold who 
directed our attention to this publication. A convenient aid to 
such calculations is a slide rule, manufactured by A. G. Thornton, 
Ltd., Manchester, England. It is described by W. Makowski, 
Rev. Sci. Instr. 20, 884 (1949). 

15 Similar conclusions have been reached by H. A. Muser, Z. 
Physik, 148, 385 (1957), who estimates approximately 47% for the 
maximum of u(xa), but does not show a curve. Results similar 
to those described above have also been derived by W. Teutsch, 
in an internal report of General Atomic Division of General 
Dynamics, and by H. Ehrenreich and E. O. Kane, in an internal 
report of the General Electric Research Laboratories. A curve 
which is quantitatively nearly the same has also been published, 
since the submission of this article, by M. Wolf (see footnote 6) 
who defines the ordinate as "portion of sun's energy which is 
utilized in pair production," a definition having the same quan-
titative significance but a different interpretation from our 
quantity u(Xy). 

Feo, where 

(3.1) 

In this expression, te represents the probability that an 
incident photon of energy greater than Eg will enter 
the body and produce a hole-electron pair. A is the 
area of the body. 

The total rate of generation of hole-electron pairs 
due to the solar radiation falling upon the body is 
given by 

(3.2) 

in which the factor fw is a geometrical factor, taking 
into account the limited angle from which the solar 
energy falls upon the body. t8 is the probability that 
incident photons will produce a hole-electron pair and 
may differ from te because of the difference in the 
spectral distribution of the blackbody radiation at 
temperature Tc and T s , and the dispersion of the re-
flection coefficient or transmission coefficients for the 
surface of the battery. 

The geometrical factor fw is dependent upon the 
solid angle subtended by the sun and the angle of 
incidence upon the solar battery. The solid angle sub-
tended by the sun is denoted by W s , where 

ws=7r(DI L)2j4 = 7r(1.39/149)2j4 
(3.3) = 6.85 X 10-5 sr, 

and D, L are, respectively, the diameter and distance 
of the sun, taken as 1.39 and 149 million km. 

If the solar cell is isotropic (i.e., is itself a sphere) 
then it is evident that fw should be simply the fraction 
of the solid angle about the sphere subtended by the 
sun, so that 

(3.4) 

If the cell is a flat plate with projected area A p, then it 
is more natural to deal with incident energy on the 
basis of the projected area A p rather than the total

area of both sides, which is 2A p. In terms of A p the 
total power falling on the cell is: 

incident power=ApP.w. cosOlrr, (3.5) 

where 8 is the angle between the normal to the cell and 
the direction of the sun. This expression integrates as 
it should to A pP 8 when w. is integrated over a hemi-
sphere (2rr steradians) since cosO has an average value 
of t. For normal incidence, the incident power is thus: 

incident power=ApPsfw, 
where 

jw=ws/rr= 2.18X 10-6• 

(3.6) 

(3.7) 

It is evident that the rate of generation of hole-electron 
pairs by solar photons involves the same factor so that 
this value of f", should be used in Eq. (3.2). The black-
body radiation from the cell comes from an area of 
2Ap so that 

(3.8) 

The rate of recombination, with resultant radiation, 
of hole-electron pairs depends upon the disturbance 
from equilibrium. For the case in which the battery is 
in equilibrium, and is surrounded by a blackbody at 
temperature T e, the rate of emission of photons due to 
recombination must be exactly equal to the rate of 
absorption of photons which produce recombination. 
As discussed above, this is given by Feo in Eq. (3.1). 
To begin with, we shall consider that the only radiative 
recombination of importance is direct recombination 
between free holes and electrons and is accordingly 
proportional to the product of the hole ~nd electro.n 
density, i.e., to the product np. When th1S product 1S 
equal to the thermal equilibrium value n?, the rate .of 
recombination will be F co. Accordingly we may wnte 
for Fe, the rate of radiative recombination throughout 
the cell, 

F e(V)=F cOnp/ni2=F cO exp(V lYe), (3.9) 

in which V represents the difference in imrefs or quasi-
Fermi levels for holes and electrons, and the product 
np is proportional to the Boltzmann factor for this 
difference expressed as a voltage.I6 V is evidently the 
voltage between the terminals connected to the p- and 
n-regions of the solar cellI7 ; I' e stands for kTcI q. 

The net rate of increase of hole-electron pairs in-
volves, in addition to generation, correspondi~g ~o f!., 
and recombination, corresponding to Fe, nonradlatlVe 
processes and removal of hole-electron pairs by current 
to the external circuit. The nonradiative recombination 
and generation processes are represented by R(V) and 
R(O) respectively. They will be equal for V =0, the 
thermal equilibrium condition. The algebraic sum of 
the rates of increase of hole-electron pairs must vanish 

16 For example: W. Shockley, ]{lecirons and Holes in Semicon-
ductors (D. Van Nostrand Company, Inc., Princeton, New Jersey, 
1950) p. 308; the product of Eqs. (18) and (19).

for the steady state condition. This leads to 

O=F.-Fe(V)+R(O)-R(V)-I/q (310) 
= Fs- F co+[F eO- Fe(V)+ R(O) - R(V) J- II q. . 

In Eq. (3.10) the quantity in square brackets repre-
sents the net rate of generation of hole-electron pairs 
when the cell is surrounded by a blackbody at tempera-
ture Te. If the cell is so surrounded, it is evident that 
the term F.-Feo vanishes. The steady state condition, 
under these circumstances, gives the current-voltage 
characteristic of the cell in the absence of a disturbance 
in the radiation field. On the other hand, if the cell is 
surrounded by cold space, it will generate a small 
open-circuit reverse voltage due to the -Feo term. 

In order to describe the current-voltage character-
istics of the cell we introduce the quantity fe, which 
represents the fraction of the recombination-generation 
current which is radiative. This leads to 

For the particularly simple case, which occurs in ger-
manium p-n junctions, that the nonradiative recom-
bination fits the ideal rectifier equation, we can write 

R(V)=R(O) exp(V IVe). (3.12) 

For this condition fe is a constant independent of 
voltage, and is given by 

(3.13) 

Under these conditions the current-voltage character-
istic for the cell in the absence of radiative disturbance 
is given by 

where 
I =Io[1-exp(VIVe)], 

Io=q[Feo+R(O)] 

is the reverse saturation current. 

(3.14) 

(3.15) 

It is noted that this equation differs in sign from the 
usual rectifier equation, the convention chosen in this 
paper being that current flowing into the cell in what 
is normally the reverse direction is regarded as positive, 
and voltage across the cell in the normally forward 
direction is also regarded as positive. These are the 
polarities existing when the illuminated cell is furnish-
ing power to an external load, so that positive values 
of I and V correspond to the cell acting as a power 
source. 

For an energy gap of 1.09 ev and a temperature of 
.')OOoK, Q c is 1.7 X loa cm-2 secl • Thus per cm2 of sur-
face the recombination current is 2.7XIo-I6 amp. For 
a planar cell with tc= 1 radiating from both sides this 
leads to a contribution to 10 of S.4X1O-16 amp/cm2 of 
junction area, according to Eq. (3.8). As discussed in 
Sec. 6, actual cells have currents larger by about 10 
orders of magnitude, so that je"'" 10-1°. 

In the event that R(V) does not obey Eq. (3.12), 
then the quantity fe must be regarded as a function of 



EFFICIENCY OF p-n JCNCTION SOLAR CELLS 515 

the voltage, so that [0 must be regarded as voltage 
dependent. 

The current-voltage relationship for the cell when 
subjected to radiant energy may be obtained by solv-
ing Eq. (3.10) for I. This leads tol8 : 

1= q(Fs- Feo)+ (qFeo/ fe)[l-exp(V /Ve)J 
= I sh+Io[l-exp(V/Ve)], 

(3.16) 

in which the symbol I8h represents the short circuit 
current corresponding to V = 0, and for the case of a 
planar cell of projected area A p is given by 

Ish=-q(Fs- F co) = qA p(jwt,Qs- 2tcQc) 
=qFs=-qA p(fwl,Q.). (3.17) 

The last form in Eq. (3.17) corresponds to the approxi-
mation that in most conditions of interest the solar 
energy falling upon the body produces hole-electron 
pairs at a rate that is so much larger than would black-
body radiation at the cell's temperature that the latter 
term can be neglected in comparison with the former. 

The open-circuit voltage Vop which the cell would 
exhibit is obtained by solving Eq. (3.16) for the case 
of 1=0. This leads to 

Vop= Ve In[(Ish/Io)+lJ 
= Ve In[(feFs/Feo)-fe+1]. 

(3.18) 

This particular solution is valid for the case in which 
R depends upon voltage as given in Eq. (3.12). Other-
wise, Eq. (3.18) will contain the open-circuit voltage 
in the term 10 on the right side of the equation. 

As discussed in connection with Eq. (3.17), for most 
cases of interest the solar energy falling on the cell will 
be very large compared to blackbody radiation at the 
temperature of the cell, and accordingly the terms 
which do not involve Fs in Eq. (3.18) can be neglected 
in comparison, as long as fe is not too small. This leads 
to the approximate result 

in which it is seen that the geometrical and transmission 
factors together with the effect of excess recombination 
over radiative recombination may be lumped together 
in the single expression f, where 

(3.20) 

The factor 2 comes from the fact that sunlight falls on 
only one of the two sides of the planar cell. [See 
Eq. (3.8).J 

It is thus evident that as far as open-circuit voltage 
is concerned, similar results are produced by any of the 
four following variations: (1) reducing the efficiency of 
transmission of solar photons into the cell; (2) reducing 

18 Equations like (3.16) occur in published treatments of solar-
cell efficiency. The difference is that the term in Ish due to Fco, 
which is small but required by the principle of detailed balance, 
is included, and the coefficient of 10 is related to the fundamental 
minimum reverse saturation current rather than to a semi-
empirical value. 

the solid angle sub tended by the sun, or (3) its angle of 
incidence upon the solar cell; or (4) introducing addi-
tional nonradiative recombination processes, thus mak-
ing smaller the fraction of the recombination which is 
radiative. 

The maximum open-circuit voltage which may be 
obtained from the cell, in accordance with the theory 
presented, is the energy gap Vg. This occurs as the 
temperature of the cell is reduced towards zero. Under 
these circumstances the quantity Qe tends towards 
zero and the logarithm in Eq. (3.19) to large values. 
The limiting behavior can be understood by noting 
that in accordance with Eq. (2.2) we have 

-lnQe=hvg/kTc+order of InTe 
= Vu/Ve+order of InTe. 

(3.21) 

The terms which are of the order Ve InTe vanish as 
To and Ve approach zero in Eq. (3.19), so that 

(3.22) 

At higher temperatures the voltage is only a fraction 
of Vg' This fractionl9 denoted by v may be expressed as 
a function of three of the four variables discussed in 
the introduction for the important case in which the 
last two terms in the In term of Eq. (3.18) can be neg-
lected. The necessary manipulations to establish this 
relationship are as follows: 

= (xci Xg) function of (xg,xe and f) (3.23) 

(3.24) 

where the integrands are each that of Eq. (2.2). [For 
cases of very low illumination in which the approxi-
mation of Eq. (3.19) would not hold, v also depends 
explicitly on fe.J 

In the following two sections we shall consider expres-
sions for the output power in terms of the open-circuit 
voltage and short circuit currents just discussed. 

4. NOMINAL EFFICIENCY 

For the geometrical configuration represented in 
Fig. 2 (b), the incident power falling from the sun 
upon the solar cell may evidently be written in the 
form 

Pine= fwAPs=AfwhvgQ8/U(Xg), (4.1) 

in which Eq. (2.8) has been used to introduce the 
ultimate efficiency function u(Xg) for purposes of sim-
plifying subsequent manipulations. ~ 

A nominal efficiency can be defined in terms of the 

19 As for Eq. (3.16), factors like v have been introduced by 
various authors, most recently by M. Wolf (see footnote 6). 
However, the forms are dependent upon additional semiempirical 
quantities so that they cannot be used for the purposes given in 
the introduction.

incident power and the product of the open-circuit 
voltage Vop and the short circuit current I. it • The actual 
efficiency will be somewhat lower since the current-
voltage characteristic is not perfectly rectangular. We 
shall consider the problem of matching the impedance 
in the following section. 

The nominal efficiency in terms of open-circuit volt-
age and short circuit current is evidently given by 

Voplsh/ Pinc = VopAqj",tsQ./[Aj",hllIlQ,,/U(Xy)] 
= (V op/V g)u(Xy)t, (4.2) 
= v (Xg,xc,j)u (xg)t" 

in which the symbol v is the ratio of Eq. (3.23) of the 
open-circuit voltage Vop to the ultimate voltage V g 
that could be obtained if the battery were at zero 
temperature. 

5. DETAILED BALANCE LIMIT OF 
EFFICIENCY AND 'r1(X.,xc,t.,f) 

The maximum power output from the solar battery 
is obtained by choosing the voltage V so that the 
product IV is a maximum. In accordance with the 
current-voltage relationship, Eq. (3.16), and Eq. (3.18) 
for the open-circuit voltage, the current-voltage rela-
tionship may be rewritten in the form 

1=1811+10-10 exp(V/VJ 
= Io[exp(Vop/V c) -exp(V /V c)]. 

(5.1) 

The maximum power occurs when20: 

d(IV)/dV=O 

This equation may be conveniently rewritten by intro-
ducing the symbols 

Zop= Vop/Vc=vxv/xc, Zm= V(max)/V c, (5.3) 

In which V (max) is the voltage which satisfies Eq. 

20 Similar maximization of the output power has been carried 
out in terms of the maximum area rectangle on the J- V plot by 
various authors, in particular W. G. Pfann and W. van Roos-
broeck (See footnote 2). The results do not, however, appear to 
have been published in analytic form in which the matching 
factor m is shown to be a function solely of the variable zop 
= Vop!Vc=v(xo,xc,f)(xo!xc). 

(5.2). Substituting the symbols introduced in Eq. (5.3) 
into Eq. (5.2) leads readily to the relationship 

(5.4) 

This gIves the functional relation between the C?pen-
circuit voltage and the voltage at which maximum 
power is obtained. In effect it establishes a functional 
relationship between Zm and Zop, and thus between Zm 
and the variables f, Xc and XII' 

It is seen that the open-circuit voltage is always 
larger than the voltage for maximum output, and when 
both voltages are small compared to thermal voltage 
V" then Eq. (5.4) leads to a maximum power voltage 
equal to one-half the open-circuit voltage, the situation 
corresponding to a battery with an ohmic internal 
resistance. On the other hand, when either Zop or Zm 
is large compared to unity, then the ratio between the 
two approaches unity.20 

The maximum power is smaller than the nominal 
power IshVop by the impedance matching factor m, 
where m is given by 

m= I[V(max) JV(max)/ Ish Vop 
=zm2/ (1 +zm-e-zm)[zm+ln(l +Zm)] 
=m(vxy/xe) =m(xy,xc,j). (5.5) 

Figure 4 shows the dependence of m upon Zop obtained 
by computing pairs of values of m(zm) and Zop(Zm) for 
various values of Zm. The limits of mare 0.25 and 1.0 
for small and large values of Zop. 

In terms of m the efficiency 1) can now be expressed as 
a function of the four variables Xy, Xc, t s , and j intro-
duced in Sec. 1. The detailed balance limit corresponds 
to setting 18=1 and f= fw/2. The efficiency 1) may be 
written as

sents the "best experimental efficiency obtained to date" for Si

spond to 90% absorption ofradiation (i.e., t,= Ic=0.9) and 100-mw 
incident solar energy. The values for the / quantities discussed in 
Sec. 6 are: (f) /=1.09XlO-5 (fw=2.18XlO-5, /c=1) t,=lc=1;

(fw= 1.36 X 10-5, /c= 10-6) 1,=t,=0.9. 

To summarize, the efficiency is defined as the electrical 
power out of the cell into a matched load, divided by 
the incident solar energy falling on the cell. The factors 
in Eq. (5.6) are as follows: ts is the probability, averaged 
over incident solar photons having sufficient energy to 
produce electron-hole pairs,lthat a photon will produce 
an electron-hole pair; u(Xy) is the ultimate efficiency in 
accordance with Eq. (2.1); V(Xg,Xe,j) is the ratio of the 
open-circuit voltage to the energy gap of the cell; and 
m(vxg/Xe) is the impedance matching factor, which is a 
function of the ratio of the open-circuit voltage to 
thermal voltage for the cell. 

In the following section results of calculation of '1J are 
presented and compared with the semiempirical limit 
of efficiency. 

6. CONCLUSIONS 

Efficiencies computed on the basis of Eq. (5.6) are 
shown in Figs. 5 and 6 as a function of Vo, based upon 
the following values for the parameters: 

xe=Tc/Ts=0.05 (Ts=6000oK, Te=3000K) 
(6.1) 

xg=qVg/kTs = 1.94Vg. 
Curves are given for different values of the parameter 
j. Figure 5 shows the decrease of the efficiency with 
f lowered from its maximum value 1 by factors of 10-a• 
For Fig. 6, f was calculated according to its definition 
(3.20). Curve (f) corresponds to a perfectly absorbing 
cell (tc=ts= 1) with normal incidence (jw=ws/rr) and 
no nonradiative recombination (je= 1). Curves (g), 
(h) and (i) are calculated on the assumption of 90% 
absorption with a value of 1.36X 10-6 for fw, which 

gives 100 mw/cm2 incident power, and different values 
of fe. 

Also on Fig. 6 is shown the generally accepted curve 
for the "limit conversion efficiency." This curve is in 
agreement with Prince3 and Loferski4 as reported by 
Wolf.6 Also shown is the value of 14% for silicon solar 
cells, which Wolf6 reports as the best achieved to date. 

On the basis of the semiempirical limit it would 
appear that silicon solar cells might be improved by 
from 14 to 21.7%, an improvement of a factor of 1.55. 
On the basis of the detailed balance limit, the improve-
ment might be 14 to 26% [curve (g)], or a factor of 
1.9. The true physical limit for silicon must lie some-
where between these two limits. 

Figure 7 shows the current voltage characteristics 
for several silicon solar cells. These are discussed 
further in the Appendix. The figure also shows the 
minimum forward current characteristic for a planar 
cell with tc= 1 as discussed in Sec. 3. 

Somewhere between the empirical curves and the 
limit set by detailed balance is a true limit determined 
basically by the fact that silicon is element 14 in the 
Periodic Table and has a certain rate of "unavoidable"21 
nonradiative transitions. 

On the basis of the preceding paragraphs two ques-
tions are obvious: (1) Where is the true physical limit 
and what processes determine it? (2) What determines 
the location of the present experimental curves? 

It is evident that question (1) will be difficult if not 
impossible to answer before question (2) is answered. 
We shall first discuss question (2).

efficiency that the empirical data are not in agreement 
with the diffusion theory of p-n junctionsP This theory 
predicts that forward currents vary as exp (qV/AkT) 
with A = 1. The experimental data conform typically 
to A values of about two to three at room temperature 
(see Appendix). There is a theory which predicts an A 
value of two over a range of voltages23 and this theory 
has recently been confirmed for heavily gold-doped 
silicon.24 Nevertheless, the calculations of efficiency 
which give the semiempirical curve of Fig. 6 are based 
upon the diffusion theory. 

The origin of A values as high as three is at present 
largely a mystery. As discussed in the Appendix, two 
explanations involving series resistance and surface 
currents can be rejected. 

Wolf25 proposes that the explanation may be internal 
field emission of the form reported by Chynoweth and 
McKay.26 Such a current will clearly be of the non-
radiative type and will reduce fe. Thus, if it occurs, it 
is clear that solar cells can be improved by widening 
the transition region slightly since tunneling decreases 
exponentially with the width. If Wolf's proposed ex-
planation were correct, therefore, it seems improbable 
that it would not have been eliminated in the large 
amount of development directed towards improving 
existing solar cells. 

It is the conjecture of the present authors that the 
large values of A and large reverse currents both arise 
from recombination centers. 

One recent observation which appears to support this 
view is the finding by Wolf and Prince27 that "optimiza-
tion of power conversion from light into electrical power 
resulted in devices with extremely soft reverse charac-
teristics." Since soft reverse characteristics are clearly 
evidence of unnecessary current paths in p-n junctions, 
it is clear that they cannot of themselves contribute to 
the efficiency. An attractive explanation of this seem-
ingly contradictory observation is that the softness 
results from the precipitation of impurities. Evidence 
that such precipitates cause soft reverse characteristics 
with current proportional to Vn, with n ranging from 
about four to seven, have been reported by Goetzberger 
and Shockley,28 as well as means of removing certain

model, but his data is apparently not available in the literature.

metal impurities by "gettering."29 This explanation 
cannot be checked from the publication of Wolf and 
Prince, who give no data on reverse characteristics and 
who state, "Since the solar cell is operated exclusively 
in the forward direction, no attention need be paid to 
the reverse characteristic of the device." This is not in 
agreement with the views of the present authors that 
an attempt should be made to understand as fully as 
possible the physics of the p-n junctions involved. 

A theory based on recombination centers by which 
A values as high as three may be explained might 
possibly be developed along the following lines: In a 
forward biased junction the recombination occurs pre-
dominantly in a very narrow region in which the elec-
trostatic potential varies by about 2kT / q.23 As the po-
tential is varied, this region should move in position. 
If it moves into a region of lower recombination center 
density, values of A greater than two will arise. If the 
recombination centers are highly charged, they may 
be distributed in a very nonuniform manner through 
the junction.30 ,3! Further investigations, which are cur-
rently being undertaken, are required to appraise this 
theory. If the theory does prove to be correct, important 
improvements in solar cells can probably be made by 
reducing contamination by chemical impurities. 

An example of a new area in which a detailed balance 
treatment is needed is the proposal that a solar cell 
may be improved by adding traps to it to absorb the 
longer wavelength radiation.32 It appears to the present 
authors that this may well be equivalent to shunting 
one cell with a threshold vo=Eo/h with another cell 
with a threshold much lower. Such a combination of 
cells would appear more likely to lower than to raise 
efficiency. A detailed balance argument, involving only 
radiative transitions for the traps, would set an upper 
limit for such a model like that of the curve for fe= 1 
on Fig. 5. The present authors anticipate that traps 
will probably lower this limit; traps in general con-
tribute strongly to recombination because they facilitate 
delivering energy to phonons. This implies that traps 
inherently have low fe values, so that it is improbable 
that they would improve efficiency. 

Returning briefly to question (1), we may note that 
one inherent process which may reduce fe is the Auger 
effect, in which the energy of recombination is carried 
off by a hole or an electron.33 Another mechanism that 
may have to be considered is the formation of donor 
and acceptor complexes at the high doping levels em-
ployed. These may also act as recombination centers. 
In any junction formed at higher temperatures, there 
will be certain densities of vacancies and even disloca-
tion loops. These imperfections do not appear to be

inherently necessary, and their densities may be 
governed by rate effects involved in fabrication. 

Graded energy gap structures for solar cells to aid in 
collection efficiency are discussed by W Olf6 following 
previous proposals for increasing emitter efficiency.34 
Such structures will in general also involve a gradation 
of lattice constant, and for minimum free energy sub-
ject to a fixed concentration gradient, there will be an 
equilibrium density of dislocations which reduce the 
stored elastic energy. These dislocations will, of course, 
have a deleterious effect on lifetime, diffusion length, 
and collection efficiency. The probable necessity of 
their presence does not appear to have been noted in 
the cited pUblications. 

Note added in prooj. The presence of slip bands due 
to stress in thin, heavily doped, diffused layers in silicon 
has recently been observed.3s The associated disloca-
tions may be important in reducing solar-cell efficiency. 

APPENDIX 

Empirical Current Voltage Relationships 

The data shown in Fig. 7 were obtained for three 
commercial solar cells (curves 1-3). The same curves 
were obtained by plotting Vop vs Ish for varying levels 
of illumination up to about 10 mal cm2 as by plotting 
V vs I; this agreement shows that series resistance 
plays no important role in determining the shape of the 
V-I lines up to 10 rna. 

The distribution of forward current over the area of 
the cells was also studied by using a potential probing 
technique.28 This study showed that the current was 
uniformly distributed over the area and not concen-
trated at the edges where the junctions were exposed.

j*= j",j/t./2tc with j",= 1.36X 10-5 in order to give 
100 mw/cm2 on the exposed surface; j/=qQcAp/I* 
where qQc= 1.6XlO-19 X 1.7 X 103=2.7X 10--16 amp/cm2 ; 
and 1*/ A p is taken from Fig. 7. 

The fact that the calculated values of 7]* are about 
twice as large as the measured values is evidence, as 
has been pointed out in the references cited, of losses 
due to collection efficiency, series resistance, etc. If 
these losses could be avoided, the cells would have an 
efficiency of about 14%, which is the highest value 
obtained to date. 6 

This value is about half the limiting efficiency of Fig. 
6. Thus a significant potential for improvement of cells 
appears to exist by improving junction characteristics. 
The first step toward this improvement appears to be 
an understanding of the physics behind the high V / 
values.
