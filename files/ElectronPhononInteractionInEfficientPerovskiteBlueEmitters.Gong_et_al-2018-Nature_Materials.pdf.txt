The promise of energy-saving solid-state lighting and full-colour displays has motivated rapid advancements in lumi-nescent materials that exhibit bright emission and high colour 
purity1. Red, green and blue sources that span the full colour gamut 
are required to generate white light2. Blue has proven to be the most 
challenging3,4: in epitaxial inorganic technology, for example, it took 
20 additional years to create the first blue light-emitting diodes 
(LEDs) after red and green LEDs were successfully created in the 
1950s and 1960s5.

A principal challenge for blue emission remains the design of 
materials that simultaneously exhibit high luminescence efficiency 
and narrow emission linewidth. Table 1 summarizes the key photo-
physical properties of currently available blue emitters (Fig. 1e,f). 
Among inorganic semiconductor single crystals, wide-bandgap 
analogues of GaAs, GaP, SiC, ZnSe and GaN have been explored6,7; 
however, even the highest-purity and most defect-free epitaxially 
grown GaN films exhibit a maximum photoluminescence quantum 
yield (PLQY) of less than 1% at low injection density8–10. The loss 
of luminescence efficiency comes from rapid non-radiative recom-
bination through surface and bulk defects11, combined with a low 
radiative recombination rate associated with a small exciton binding 
energy (Eb =  20 meV)12.

Though inorganic phosphors have demonstrated high bright-
ness with PLQYs over 90%, their relatively insulating nature and 
long radiative lifetimes result in high turn-on voltages, and this lim-
its their application in LEDs13,14. In addition, their spectrally broad 
luminescence (full width at half maximum, FWHM >  100 nm) 
diminishes the usable PL yield when a narrow emission bandwidth 
is required15. Similarly, recently synthesized blue organic emit-
ters with 70~85% PLQY in solid-state thin films16 also suffer from 
spectrally broad emission (FWHM ~ 75 nm). Organic materials, in 
contrast to inorganic materials, exhibit binding energies of several 

hundred millielectronvolts17. Their strongly bound excitons there-
fore luminesce radiatively with high rates18, and the desired radia-
tive process dominates recombination (Fig. 1b).

Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites have emerged as prom-
ising candidates for light-emission applications19. Chloride-based 
three-dimensional (3D) perovskites emit in the deep-blue region 
with sharp emissions (FWHM ~ 25 nm)20. However, owing to their 
small exciton binding energy (~50 meV) and their appreciable trap-
ping losses (Fig. 1c), these materials have so far shown low PLQYs 
(< 1%)20,21. Colloidal perovskite quantum dots recently achieved 
high PLQYs in the blue region through strong quantum confine-
ment22,23; however, the high PLQY of colloidal dots has so far been 
lost once solid-state perovskite CQD films are made24.

In this work, we focus on reduced-dimensional—also known 
as 2D layered—perovskites. When we add longer organic ligands 
to an otherwise 3D perovskite crystal, the new ligands segregate at 
the surface, and this leads to localization within the newly formed 
layered materials. Two-dimensional (2D) layered perovskites offer 
fast radiative recombination rates (krad)25 due to excitonic localiza-
tion and therefore are promising candidates to address the above-
mentioned need for high PLQY combined with narrow emission 
width. Photogenerated excitons inside 2D perovskites are strongly 
confined inside each layer (Fig. 1d). This is exemplified by exciton 
binding energies that can reach up to 300 meV, values comparable to 
those of organic materials26.

Intensive studies have been carried out that have linked struc-
ture and performance in low-dimensional (2D, 0D) perovskites27,28. 
The important goal of high luminescence efficiency (PLQY >  80%) 
with broadband emission (FWHM >  100 nm) has been achieved 
in the yellow and red regions29,30. Nevertheless, blue-emitting 
perovskites have yet to deliver the desired performance: the 
PLQY of polycrystalline thin films has been reported to be

Low-dimensional perovskites have—in view of their high radiative recombination rates—shown great promise in achieving 
high luminescence brightness and colour saturation. Here we investigate the effect of electron–phonon interactions on the 
luminescence of single crystals of two-dimensional perovskites, showing that reducing these interactions can lead to bright 
blue emission in two-dimensional perovskites. Resonance Raman spectra and deformation potential analysis show that strong 
electron–phonon interactions result in fast non-radiative decay, and that this lowers the photoluminescence quantum yield 
(PLQY). Neutron scattering, solid-state NMR measurements of spin–lattice relaxation, density functional theory simulations 
and experimental atomic displacement measurements reveal that molecular motion is slowest, and rigidity greatest, in the 
brightest emitter. By varying the molecular configuration of the ligands, we show that a PLQY up to 79% and linewidth of 20 nm 
can be reached by controlling crystal rigidity and electron–phonon interactions. Designing crystal structures with electron–pho-
non interactions in mind offers a previously underexplored avenue to improve optoelectronic materials' performance.

about 10%, and recently 26% was obtained from atomically thin 
2D perovskite single crystals fabricated using a solvent anneal-
ing strategy31–33. This contrasts with colloidal materials that can 
achieve high PLQY (54% for 2D perovskites and 84% for 3D 
perovskite quantum dots23,34). The application of 2D perovskites 
in blue LEDs—which rely on solid-state materials—remains lim-
ited by low solid-state PLQYs. We argue herein that the origins of 
previous low emission efficiencies and large emission linewidths 
needed further study in order to inform progress towards bright 
narrowband emitters.

We sought therefore to explore further the potential of 2D 
perovskite blue emitters using high-quality single crystals, and 
investigate the determinants of high brightness and thus offer an 
improved set of guidelines in materials design. Specifically, we focus 
on the origins of non-radiative rates and on devising strategies to 
achieve a substantial reduction of these parasitic processes.

In our initial experiments, we sought to produce large (macro-
scopic, ~mm3 and above) single crystals of 2D perovskite. Single 
crystals have the potential to achieve high PLQYs due to their low 
defect densities when compared with polycrystals and amorphous 
materials; they also provide a platform for studying the determi-
nants of the PLQY of a material, as they are substantially free from 
the effects of film morphology and grain boundaries. Recent stud-
ies have also elucidated the promise of perovskite single crystals 
directly utilized in electronic device applications35.

Building these macroscopic, atomically layered sheet structures 
required us to develop a new synthesis strategy as high-brightness 
macroscale 2D perovskite single crystals have not previously been 
reported. We had initially attempted the previously reported vapour 
diffusion method36, but the crystals obtained thereby were small in 
size (< 1 mm) and poor in luminescence quality.

Towards the goal of achieving high-quality crystals, we pur-
sued the use of a ternary solvent system to control crystalliza-
tion kinetics (Fig. S1). Our crystallization strategy was based 
on a co-solvent N,N-dimethylformamide–dimethylsulfoxide 
(DMF–DMSO) mixture. When we relied on a mixture of DMF–
diethyl ether (DEE) alone, undesirably fast crystallization led to 
small crystal sizes and low PLQYs. We found that—compared 
with the case of pure DMF, widely utilized in perovskite prepa-
ration—introducing DMSO dramatically enhanced both crystal 
size and the optical quality of the single crystals. We attribute the 
improved crystal quality and the high PLQY to the formation 
of the DMSO–PbBr2 complex37, which slows the crystallization 
process, ultimately leading to higher-quality perovskite crystals  
(Fig. S1 and Table S1). Single crystals grow as DEE slowly diffuses 
into the perovskite solution38.

We then explored two classes of organic ammonium cations 
based either on aliphatic chain group (R =  alkyl chain) or phenyl 
group (Ph =  C6H5) motifs. The macroscopic shape of the single crys-
tals reveals a strong cation dependence: C4, C12 (R =  CH3(CH2)3,

R =  CH3(CH2)11) and PhC, PhC2 (Ph–R =  Ph–CH2, Ph–R =  Ph–
(CH2)2) grow into thin flakes, while with Ph and PhC3 (Ph–R =  Ph–
(CH2)3) the crystallization results in needle-like crystals (Fig. S2).  
The products also show dramatically different luminescence 
properties (Table S2): layer-shaped crystals show narrowband 
(FWHM ~ 20 nm) deep-blue emission, while needle-shaped crystals 
result in non-2D crystal structures (Fig. S3) with broadband white-
light emissions (Fig. 2g–i, FWHM >  70 nm).

To measure the absolute PLQY, we exfoliated thin samples 
mechanically from single crystals (Supplementary Materials, 
Exfoliated sample preparation). Exfoliation reduces the sample 
thickness and hence the reabsorption of PL (Fig. S4). Crystals that 
form 2D solids (C4 and PhC2) are easily exfoliated into thin flakes, 
in contrast with the needle-shaped crystals.

For the deep-blue region, the best sample of PhC2 crystals has 
a PLQY of 79%, a notable improvement compared with previ-
ously reported 2D perovskites33,34 (Table 1). This high PLQY is also 
accompanied by a sharp emission spectrum (FWHM ~ 20 nm) and 
is independent of photoexcitation power (Fig. S5). We account for 
this by noting the strong excitonic qualities of the 2D perovskites 
and that no multi-exciton recombination occurs under low injec-
tion intensity (1010 cm−3)39. This PLQY is up to two orders of mag-
nitude higher than that of inorganic materials. It is comparable to 
that of the brightest organic blue emitter (Table 1)16; yet, it exhibits 

a fully three times narrower emission linewidth (FWHM of 20 nm 
compared with 75 nm for organic emitters).

We then turned to studying the structure of each crystal with the 
goal of elucidating the physical origins of the efficient blue emis-
sions. We carried out single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) on 
samples with high PLQY (PhC2), low PLQY (C4) and broadband 
emission spectra (Ph). In Ph single crystals, the precursors prefer-
entially form a network of truncated PbBr6 octahedra (PbBr3), while 
plate-shaped crystals (C4 and PhC2) form layered structures, with 
corner-sharing inorganic PbBr6 octahedra sandwiched between 
organic layers (Fig. 2d–f). In the PhC2 structure, benzene rings 
stack between the adjacent PbBr6 layers via CH–π  interactions.

To gain further insight into the crystal quality and high PLQY, 
we carried out density functional theory (DFT) calculations on C4, 
Ph and PhC2 structures. We first calculated the formation energies 
of these compounds by relaxing the SCXRD-determined struc-
tures. The calculated formation energies of C4, Ph and PhC2 are 
determined to be 160, 595 and 200 meV/f.u. respectively relative to 
solid precursors. The higher formation energies suggest more stable 
structures with a lower chance of defect formation. However, cal-
culations predict Ph to have an indirect bandgap, in contrast with 
direct bandgaps calculated for C4 and PhC2 (Fig. S6).

We thus focused on the two best 2D perovskites within the ali-
phatic and phenyl groups (C4 and PhC2 respectively). We carried

out transient absorption spectroscopy to probe the defect densities 
in C4 and PhC2 and found comparable densities in these materi-
als, in agreement with DFT calculations (Methods, Fig. S7, S8). The 
comparable defect densities, contrasted with the dramatic differ-
ences in PLQY, led us to probe further the origins of the high bright-
ness for the case of PhC2.

The quantum efficiency is determined by the ratio of the radia-
tive recombination rate (krad) to the sum of radiative and non-radi-
ative (knon) recombination rates (ktot):

To identify and compare krad and knon, we used equation (1) with  
the directly measured ktot (from transient PL) and the mea-
sured PLQY (Supplementary Materials, Photoluminescence 
Measurements, Fig. S9).

Figure 3a shows that radiative recombination is dominant over 
the entire temperature range for PhC2 crystals, consistent with the 
fact that their high PLQY is preserved even at room temperature. 
The fast radiative recombination rate is related to a smaller Bohr 
radius (Table S3). In the case of C4 crystals, the non-radiative rate 
surpasses the radiative rate when the temperature increases beyond 
250 K (Fig. 3b). The dramatically increased knon results in the pro-
nounced drop of PLQY in C4 to 17% at room temperature. It should 
be noted that no phase transition was observed over the tempera-
ture range discussed here (Fig. S10).

We then investigated the causes of the undesirably rapid knon.  
From the preceding discussion, we noted that the intrinsic trap den-
sities in C4 and PhC2 are similar, while the knon of C4 is four times 

higher than that of PhC2. Clearly the transition from bandedge to 
trap states must be increased in C4 compared with PhC2. We there-
fore investigated the role of electron–phonon interactions in facili-
tating these transitions.

One way to quantify the intensity of electron–phonon interac-
tion is by using the deformation potential (D)—the shift in energy 
band per unit strain. We extracted D for both PhC2 and C4 by 
studying the temperature-dependent behaviour of their PL line-
widths40,41 (Table S5). We first observed that the FWHM increases 
fivefold from 10 K to 290 K in C4, but by less than twofold in PhC2: 
thermal broadening is dramatically more intense in C4. The quan-
titative indicator of electron–phonon coupling strength—D—is also 
twice as high in C4 as in PhC2, reflecting the faster bandedge-to-
trap process in the case of C4.

These initial results led us to investigate further the impact 
of electron–phonon coupling on the electronic transition 
rate. We selected resonance Raman (RR) spectroscopy since it  
directly reveals phonon coupling to the electronic transition 
between the excited and ground states. We employed a photoex-
citation energy (457 nm) near the energy of the relevant band-
to-band transition. Figure 3d shows the RR spectra of C4 and 
PhC2 after normalization for sample concentration and transi-
tion dipole strength. The C4 RR spectrum is several times more 
intense than that of PhC2, indicating that the vibrational modes 
of C4 are substantially more strongly coupled to the electronic  
excitation than those of PhC2 (Fig. S11, Table S4). C4 is there-
fore expected to undergo faster non-radiative decay due to the 
improved vibrational overlap between the ground- and excited-
state vibrational wavefunctions. This result corroborates the 
observed faster knon and lower PLQY for C4 relative to PhC2 
(details in Methods).

To investigate the connection between material structure and 
electron–phonon coupling, we characterized the role of crystal 
rigidity. We sought to compare atomic displacement (from both 
simulation and experiment), spin–lattice relaxation and the time-
variation in the electronic bandstructure.

Atomic displacements—at their essence, optical phonons—are 
important indicators of crystal rigidity. Figure 4a presents calcula-
tion results (bottom panel) alongside experimentally determined 
atomic displacements for atoms of interest, the latter quantified 
using the equivalent isotropic displacement parameter (Ueq) from 
single-crystal XRD measurements (Fig. 4a top panel). We find that, 
in C4, tail carbon atoms have a larger root mean squared displace-
ment compared with respective atoms in PhC2. The larger root 
mean squared displacement indicates that more phonon modes are 
activated in C4. In particular, the root mean squared displacements 
of Br and Pb (which determine the valence band maxima and con-
duction band minima in perovskites) are higher in the case of C4. 
Overall, PhC2 shows a more rigid structure.

The crystal rigidity was further investigated using solid-state 
NMR spin–lattice relaxation time (T1) measurements (Fig. S12).  
In the C4 crystal, relaxation rates (R1) of 0.5 s−1 were observed for 
terminal methyl carbon (Cd), while PhC2 showed an order of mag-
nitude slower R1 of 0.02 s−1 at the terminal aromatic ring carbons 

(Fig. 4b). This agrees with the observation from SCXRD that the 
rigid structure of sp2 phenyl rings results in smaller thermal dis-
placement ellipsoids of atoms and less vibrational motion in PhC2 
compared with the case of aliphatic C4. This also agrees with our 
observation of the sharpened PL emission peak. We propose that 
denser molecular packing inside the organic layers in the PhC2 
structure contributes to higher crystal rigidity.

As noted earlier, the deformation of a crystal results in a change 
in its crystal geometry and therefore a shift in its electronic energy 
bandstructure. We can therefore characterize the structural fluctua-
tions by probing the bandstructure. Figure 4c and Fig. S13 present 
the time variation of the valence band maximum and conduction 
band minimum in C4, PhC2 and PhC (Fig. S14) from DFT calcula-
tions. We plot the histograms of instantaneous bandgaps for each 
material class. We again see the larger variation in the bandgap in 
C4 compared with PhC2, consistent with its lower crystal rigidity.

Figure 4d shows the neutron scattering spectra of PhC2 and C4 
powders measured at different temperatures. When the temperature 
is increased from 2 K to room temperature, the low-temperature 
inelastic features submerge into the broad quasi-elastic scattering 
peaks, while a pair of damped harmonic oscillator peaks arises.  
A striking difference can be seen between these peaks for PhC2  
and C4; the peaks are considerably narrower in PhC2 than in

C4. This indicates that the ligands of C4 crystals undergo greater 
librational motions (including the rocking, wagging and twisting 
modes), while the movement of the lattice in PhC2 is more confined 
spatially. We ascribe therefore the higher crystal rigidity of PhC2 to 
the lower conformational freedom of the crystal structure associ-
ated with closer packing among the organic molecules.

To further complement these measurements, we measured the 
mean squared displacement, u2 , for the crystals. To achieve this, 
we used elastic neutron scattering as a function of temperature  
(Fig. 4e). These measurements (which are most sensitive to the 
motion of hydrogen) give information related to the rigidity pos-
sessed by the ligands. The slope of the mean squared displacement 
with temperature provides a mean force constant that describes the 
motion of the ligands relative to their equilibrium positions42. At 
low temperatures we see PhC2 and C4 behave similarly, but above 
about 150 °C the motion of C4 increases, causing it to diverge from 
PhC2. This behaviour for C4 correlates with the transition to faster 
knon at higher temperature, as shown in Fig. 3b.

This work reports a deep-blue emitter with a high PLQY based 
on high-quality 2D perovskite single crystals. The crystal structure 
and rigidity contribute to achieving the observed brightness and 
sharp PL spectra. This study elucidates the performance and pros-
pects of high-brightness perovskite emitters towards their potential 
application in blue light sources.

Methods
DFT simulation. Calculations were carried out using a Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof 
generalized gradient exchange correlational functional using the projected 
augmented wave pseudopotentials as implemented in the computational package 
VASP. All calculations were carried out with planewave basis using a planewave 
kinetic energy cutoff of 400 eV. The electronic wavevector grids were obtained 
individually for each material by converging total energies to 0.005 eV/f.u. 
This corresponds to converged gamma-centred Monkhorst pack electronic 
wavevector grids of 3 ×  3 ×  1, 4 ×  4 ×  1 and 4 ×  4 ×  3 with 156-, 124- and 188-atom 
computational cells for C4, Ph and PhC2 respectively. Van der Waals interactions 
were included in all of our calculations using the DFT-D2 method of Grimme.

Total energy is converged to within 1 ×  10−5 eV for each electronic self-
consistent loop. We started with experimentally determined crystal structures 
and carried out structural relaxation until changes in total energy were less than 
1 ×  10−4 eV.

The formation energies, Ef, were calculated as

∑ ∑= −E E Ef prod reac
where Eprod and Ereac are DFT calculated total energies of products and precursors.

Molecular dynamics simulations are carried out within the NVT ensemble 
using the Nose thermostat as implemented in the VASP package. 624- and  
752-atom computational cells are used for C4 and PhC2 respectively with a time 
step of 1 fs. All atoms were initially allowed to equilibrate for 5000 time steps at a 
temperature of 300 K before the collection of final data.

We obtained the Bohr exciton radius as

ϵ ∕a m*0

where ε, a0 and m* are the dielectric constant, Bohr radius and exciton effective 
mass. The dielectric constant used is the macroscopic dielectric constant (including 
local field effects) as reported by VASP. The Bohr radius is 0.529 Å and m* is 
obtained as memh/(me +  mh). me and mh are the electron and hole effective masses 
obtained by fitting parabolas to bandstructures in the vicinities of the conduction 
band minimum and valence band maximum respectively.

The simulated atomic displacements are obtained from molecular dynamics 
simulations at a temperature of 300 K. In particular, molecular dynamics 
simulations are carried out with a time step of 1 fs. From these molecular 
dynamics trajectories, average atomic positions are obtained and these average 
atomic positions are used in the calculations as reference states of instantaneous 
displacement from the time-dependent trajectories.

Materials and characterization. Growth of high-quality single crystals. PbBr2 and 
ANH3Br (1 to 2 by molar ratio, 1 M), with A =  organic cation, were dissolved in a 
mixed solvent of DMF and DMSO (Fig. S1). In this study, we found that adding 
30–60% DMSO is favourable for high-quality crystal growth, resulting in larger 
crystal size and PLQY, and this has been utilized as the crystallization condition 
for all samples. 0.2 ml of perovskite precursor solution was put into a 20 ml vial 
with no cap, which was put in a larger and sealed container with 40 ml antisolvent 
(for example, diethyl ether or chloroform). Crystallization proceeds at room 
temperature and the final products were taken out after few days, rinsed using 
antisolvent three times and dried under vacuum. All steps were carried out under 
ambient conditions.

Exfoliated sample preparation. Samples for all PL measurements were prepared by 
mechanical exfoliation from single crystals. Perovskite single crystals were put on a 
clear, transparent and non-emissive one-sided tape, on top of which another clean 
area of tape was folded. Part of the crystal was detached from the crystal for further 
exfoliation, exposing fresh cleaved layers, and the rest of the crystal remained on the 
tape. For the PLQY measurements, we chose one piece of crystal and transferred 
it onto the tape. The lateral dimensions of the chosen crystals are in the macro 
range of mm ×  mm, therefore the effect from the grain boundaries is negligible 
and does not need to be taken into consideration. Samples with reduced thickness 
and freshly peeled 2D layers were prepared by repeating this process several times. 
The coverage of crystals on the tape will be multiplied with increasing numbers 
of exfoliations. The lamp that is utilized as the excitation source for the PLQY 
measurement has a round spot with a diameter of 2 mm. The tape with various 
flakes of 2D perovskite crystals was attached to the glass substrate.

Single-crystal X-ray diffraction measurements. Single crystals were mounted on a 
nylon loop with oil. SCXRD data were collected on a P4 Bruker diffractometer 
upgraded with a Bruker SMART 1 K CCD (charge-coupled device) detector and a 
rotating anode utilizing Mo KR radiation (λ = 0.710 73 Å). All measurements were 
made at room temperature. Fitting and refinement of single-crystal structures were 
done using OLEX2.

The equivalent isotropic displacement parameters (Ueq in Fig. 4a, top panel) are 
defined and quantified as one-third of sum of the eigenvalues of the orthogonalized 
displacement tensor (Uij). The results come directly from the refinement of the 
structure from the SCXRD measurement.

Photoluminescence measurements. Absolute PLQY measurements of exfoliated 
crystals were carried out in a Quanta-Phi integrating sphere. For each 
measurement, a large perovskite single crystal was ground into small crystals, and 
crystals with an area of 0.5 mm ×  0.5 mm and thickness of tens of nanometres were 
selected for mechanical exfoliation. The exfoliation was continued until the crystals 
could fully cover the tape and become appropriately thin (around 50 nm). Then the 
tape was transferred to a clean glass substrate. For each sample, the absorption of 
the incident pump (350 nm) was controlled between 10% and 15%, so that the film 
thickness was close enough to make a fair comparison.

The values of PLQY were measured and calculated based on a previously 
reported method43. A continuous-wave xenon excitation lamp was used as the 
excitation source with an excitation wavelength of 350 nm, with a power density  
of 0.25–3.5 mW cm−2, and the carrier density was measured around 1010 ×  cm−3 
(using the following equation n ≅  × ×incidence power relaxation lifetime absorption coefficientenergy of each phonon   
with the absorption coefficient approximately 1 ×  104 cm−1, and about 10−9 s).  
The bandpass values were 5 and 5 nm for the excitation and emission slits, 
respectively. The incident and PL spectra were collected with the exfoliated sample 
(tape/exfoliated crystals/glass substrate) directly in the excitation beam path offset 
from the beam path and removed from the sphere, in accordance with the standard 
method. The tapes used for exfoliation should not have photoluminescence in 
the visible range. If the tape absorbs incident light, the effect of the tape should 
be excluded. For example, 3M Scotch tape absorbs 15% incident light (350 nm 
excitation) before it reaches the exfoliated crystals, the effect of which was 
calibrated by multiplying the measured PLQY by 1/(1 −  0.15) =  1.17. The detector 
and integrating sphere were calibrated for spectral variance with a Newport  
white-light source.

Temperature-dependent steady-state PL spectra were collected using an Ocean 
Optics USB 2000 spectrometer. The sample was in an ARS closed-cycle cryocooler. 
Time-resolved PL was measured using Horiba TCSPC (time-correlated single-
photon counting) components.

I.   Temperature-dependent PL (Fig. S8) was plotted by taking the peak  
intensity of the PL spectra and then normalized to the highest brightness  
over the temperature range from 10 K to 290 K. At low temperature, T =  10 K  
in this study, the radiative recombination rate is dominant, which leads to 
PLQYs close to 100% and non-radiative recombination near zero33. Therefore, 
the PLQY at other temperatures can be estimated by the ratio between  
the PL intensity at high temperature and the low-temperature PL. This method 
is cross-validated by the current work: the room-temperature PLQYs of PhC2 
and C4 are 70% and 17% using this extrapolation approach, which is in good 
agreement with the independently and directly measured values. In the sample 
of exfoliated PhC2 single crystals, the PL intensity of PhC2 slightly increased 
from 10 K to 150 K, which might originate from gradual thermal activation  
of the bright excitonic state. This is common for nanoscale emitters,  
where due to the exchange interaction the lowest-energy exciton is always  
dark (spin forbidden).

II.  Temperature-dependent PL dynamics (Fig. 3a,b): we choose the 
monoexponential decay to obtain the total recombination rate, as exciton 
decay is a first-order recombination process, and therefore the kinetics 
follow a monoexponential model. We also observed deviations from 
monoexponential behaviour mainly after 10 ns (Fig. S8), which we attribute 
to trap recombination. Therefore, the fitting of the lifetime was mainly done 
within 10 ns, when PL is the dominant depopulation process of excitons.

III.  Power-dependent PLQY measurement (Fig. SX): we vary the incident power 
density by changing the slit width on the Fluorolog monochromator. The 
excitation power density was calculated as the measured power divided by 
the beam area. The power was measured using an Ophir Laser Dual Channel 
Power Meter, and the beam area was calculated using the given dispersion 
relations for the monochromator. The PLQY at different powers was measured 
with the same method as described above.

Resonance Raman spectroscopy. RR spectra of C4 and PhC2 diluted in a KBr  
pellet were collected with a 457 nm pre-RR pump, from a continuous-wave  
diode laser (Cobolt). This wavelength was chosen so that the Raman spectra 
were not contaminated by sample photoluminescence, but it is close enough 
to electronic resonance that the Raman intensity will be dominated by 
resonance terms. Scattered light was collected by an aspheric collection lens in a 
backscattering geometry. The Rayleigh line was attenuated by a 458 nm long-pass 
edge filter (Semrock, RazorEdge). A single monochromator with a 1200 gr mm−1 
(600 gr mm−1 for the > 2700 cm−1 region) diffraction grating (Princeton 
Instruments, TriVista) dispersed the backscattered light onto a CCD camera 
(Princeton Instruments, Pixis 400). The entrance slit width was kept at 100 μ m. 
Spectra were collected using a 15 s exposure time for 10 accumulations. KBr pellets 
were prepared to a molar ratio of 0.0051 for C4 (0.5 mmol KBr +  4.4 μ mol  
C4 +  0.36 mmol NaClO4*H2O) and 0.0056 for PhC2 (0.5 mmol KBr +  4.4 umol 
C4 +  4.9 μ mol PhC2 +  0.36 mmol NaClO4*H2O), each with NaClO4*H2O as an 
internal intensity standard. Raman shift axes were calibrated to phenyl phosphonic 
acid in a KBr pellet, using frequencies from the Spectral Database of Organic 
Compounds (SDBS)44.

The raw spectra were first normalized to the internal intensity standard at 

953 cm−1 and then scaled for concentration differences. Next, to separate the 
contributions to the Raman scattering cross-section due to the vibrational Franck–
Condon displacements from the strength of the transition dipole, the transition 
dipole scaling of the signal was taken into account. The spectra were scaled for 
their relative transition dipole lengths using the experimental rate of radiative 
decay, since μ∝krad tr

2 and σ μ∝Raman tr
4. The radiative decay rates were taken from 

photoluminescence spectra at 10 K where the quantum efficiency is assumed to be 
100%. Since the radiative rate of PhC2 is (3.6 ns)−1 and that of C4 is (9.5 ns)−1, and 
they emit at the same wavelength,

In other words, a vibrational mode with the same displacement in PhC2 and 
C4 will have a Raman cross-section that is seven times higher in PhC2 than in C4. 
In order to isolate a rough measure of the relative displacements between the two 
perovskites, the C4 Raman spectrum was multiplied by 7.0.

The spectra in Fig. 3d demonstrate that the vibrational modes of C4 are 
substantially more displaced in the excited state than those of PhC2. This suggests 
that C4 will have a faster non-radiative decay rate due to the improved vibrational 
overlap between the ground- and excited-state vibrational wavefunctions. This 
result corroborates the observed photoluminescence efficiency for C4 relative to 
PhC2 and suggests that nuclear rigidity upon electronic excitation is an essential 
feature of efficiently emitting materials. Table S2 contains the Raman shifts and 
intensities for representative Raman modes of the samples. Fig. S10 represents 
the control experiments of 457 nm Raman of the ligands in the absence of 
the perovskite material. From Fig. S10 it is clear that the perovskite structure 
resonantly enhances the ligand vibrational modes, thus validating the scaling by 
the relative radiative rates.

Solid-state NMR. A solid-state NMR experiment was carried out on powder 
samples of C4 and PhC2 on an Agilent DD2 700 MHz NMR spectrometer. Spectra 
were obtained using a cross-polarization magic angle spinning experiment at 25 °C 
and 70 °C. The relaxation rates R1 =  1/T1 were obtained by fitting the intensity of 
individual 13C resonances as a function of the inversion recovery time τ (details 
in Supplemental Information). A higher R1 value indicates higher mobility and 
faster molecular motion. For the PhC2 sample three peaks were observed, at 128 
(phenyl), 43.5 (Ca) and 34.8 (Cb) ppm, with R1 relaxation rates of 0.0162 s−1 (Ph), 
0,1226 s−1 (Ca) and 0.1135 s−1 (Cb) at 25 °C and 0.58 s−1 (Ca) and 0.19 s−1 (Cb) at 
70 °C. For the C4 sample four peaks were observed: 41.38 ppm (Ca), 31.25 ppm 
(Cb), 20.47 ppm (Cc) and 16.25 ppm (Cd) with R1 relaxation rates of 0.098 s−1 (Ca), 
0.1387 s−1 (Cb), 0.1828 s−1 (Cc) and 0.4978 s−1 (Cd) at 25 °C and 0.7699 s−1 (Ca), 
0.36 s−1 (Cb), 0.44 s−1 (Cc) and 0.4982 s−1 (Cd) at 70 °C.

In C4 crystals, we observed a relaxation rate of 0.5 s−1 for the terminal methyl 
group (Cd) compared with 0.1 s−1 for the carbon atom proximal to the ammonium 
group (Ca) (Fig. S11), indicating that the terminal methyl group exhibits faster 
molecular motion. This observation is in good agreement with the increasing 
thermal ellipsoid size from Ca to Cd from SCXRD data. In comparison, PhC2 
shows an R1 of 0.02 s−1 at the aromatic ring end, which is an order of magnitude 
slower than for the aliphatic carbons (Cc, 0.2 s−1; Cd, 0.5 s−1).

Transient absorption. Femtosecond pulses were generated using a regeneratively 
amplified Yb:KGW laser at a 1 kHz repetition rate (Light Conversion, Pharos). 
A portion of the 1030 nm fundamental was sent through an optical parametric 
amplifier (Light Conversion, Orpheus), and the second harmonic of the signal 
pulse was chosen for a 360 nm or 460 nm pump. Both the pump and residual 
fundamental were sent into an optical bench (Ultrafast, Helios), and the time delay 
was adjusted by optically delaying the probe pulse, with time steps increasing 
exponentially. The repetition rate of the pump was halved using an optical chopper. 
The fundamental was focused into a calcium fluoride crystal to generate a white-
light continuum probe, and both the probe and pump were focused onto the 
sample. The probe was then directed onto a CCD after dispersion by a grating 
spectrograph (Ultrafast, Helios).

Transient absorption was used to compare the relative number of traps between 
C4 and PhC2. Exfoliated single-crystal samples were first excited with 360 nm light, 
with increasing powers ranging from 25 μ W to 1000 μ W (Fig. S6a,b). For both 
samples, the magnitude of the bleach signal increases with increasing power, and a 
negative signal is present at wavelengths longer than 450 nm. Bleaching below the 
bandgap has been assigned previously to absorption involving trap states within 
the bandgap45.

We then photoexcited the same spot on the samples with 460 nm light  
(Fig. S6c,d), which is only absorbed by trap states (a 450 nm shortpass filter was 
used to lower the pump scattering). Since this results in electrons in the conduction 
band, a bleach of the bandgap is still expected. In this way, the observed signal 
should be proportional to the number of trap states, although we have to ensure that 
the signal is not influenced by other factors. We measured the transient signal at 
500 μ W, 1000 μ W and 2000 μ W pump power, and the observed signal shows a linear 
dependence on power, ruling out two-photon pumping. In order to exclude effects 

from crystal thickness (that is, pathlength) and absorption cross sections,  
we compared the magnitude of signal obtained from pumping the samples with 
1000 μ W of 360 nm light (Fig. S7a). C4 has a bleach of about 17 Δ mOD, whereas 
PhC2 has a signal of about 6 Δ mOD. Essentially, if the two crystals had a similar 
trap density, we would expect a similar bleach ratio when pumping with 460 nm 
(Fig. S7b). For clarity, we have included a comparison for 460 nm pumped samples 
(Fig. S7c), where we have adjusted the spectra to take into account the ratio from 
the 360 nm pumped experiment (by dividing by a constant equal to the bleach 
magnitude mentioned above). The resulting spectra (Fig. S7c) show similar bleach 
magnitudes for C4 and PhC2, with PhC2 even exhibiting a slightly (around 22%) 
larger signal (that is, number of traps). This indicates that the number of trap states 
is very unlikely to be the cause behind the difference in PLQY (that is, PLQY of 
PhC2 is higher than C4).

Deformation potential calculation. The origin of the thermal broadening of 
exciton emission linewidth stems from the fluctuation of the bandgap, which is 
caused by the displacement of the atoms in the crystal. Therefore, the temperature 
dependence of the FWHM is governed by the strength of electron–phonon 
coupling. One of the quantitative expressions of electron–phonon coupling is the 
deformation potential (D), defined as the change in the bandgap energy per unit 
strain due to phonon scattering.

Deformation potential has been used since 1950 to describe the electron–
phonon interaction40. It is defined as the derivative of the electronic energy levels 
with respect to strain. One way to estimate deformation potential is by modelling 
the FWHM of photoluminescence linewidth, the broadening of which is due to 
phonon scattering when crystal lattice vibrates. We applied the following model to 
fit the temperature-dependent FWHM of PhC2 and C4 in our study, based on the 
report from previous literature41:

and Γ0 is the inhomogeneous linewidth due to structure disorder, M is the

The effective mass of the electron and hole were calculated using DFT with 
the results in Table S2; the ωhomo homopolar phonon mode for the Pb–Br–Pb 
stretch was measured from RR results (for PhC2 the corresponding wavenumber 
is 133 cm−1, and for C4 it is 131 cm−1). Densities (ρ) of for both perovskites are 
calculated using the unit-cell volume measured from SCXRD (2.8 g cm−3 for both 
materials). The width of the quantum well (L) was quantified using the thickness of 
the Pb–Br–Pb inorganic layer (0.6 nm).

The fitting results are listed in Table S5.
It also should be noted that the inhomogeneous linewidth (Γ0) is  

larger in PhC2 than in C4, indicating that the structural distortion (even  
at very low temperature) is higher. This structural distortion comes from  
within the Pb–Br6 octahedra: the Br–Pb–Br bond angle inside the octahedron 
of PhC2 is 172–174°, instead of the 180° in the C4 crystals. However, structural 
distortion does not vary with temperature: the Br–Pb–Br bond angle was 
measured as 168–172° (PhC2) and 180° (C4) at 100 K. The DFT calculations  
also show that at 0 K the corresponding angle for PhC2 is 168–170° and  
that for C4 is 180°.

At room temperature, the width of the PL spectra is the combined result of Γ0 
and thermal broadening. We observed that C4 crystals show greater FWHM than 
PhC2, indicating that the more intense phonon vibration in C4 results in stronger 
thermal broadening.

μcv is the transition dipole moment, ωℏ  is the energy of the exciton and rB is the

Neutron scattering. Inelastic neutron scattering measurements were  
carried out using the Cold Neutron Chopper Spectrometer (CNCS)  
at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS), Oak Ridge National Laboratory.  
An incident neutron beam with an energy of 12 meV and an elastic resolution 
of 650 μ eV was used. Q in this measurement ranges from 0 to 4 Å−1. The 
perovskite single crystals were ground into powder and then loaded into 
cylindrical aluminium cans packed under helium for measurement. The spectra 
were integrated with |Q| =  2–3 Å−1 and then normalized to the elastic scattering 
peak (E =  0 eV). Background subtraction was done by measuring an empty 
aluminium can.

Elastic neutron scattering measurements were carried out using the 
Backscattering Spectrometer (BASIS) at the SNS. Low-statistic scans  
were performed at 10 K increments. The perovskite single crystals  
were ground into powder and then loaded into annular aluminium cans  
packed under helium for measurement. An incident neutron beam  

with an energy of 2.08 meV was used. Q in this measurement ranges  
from 0.2 to 2 Å−1.
