For nearly two decades, researchers in the field of plasmonics1—
which studies the coupling of electromagnetic waves to the motion 
of free electrons near the surface of a metal2—have sought to realize 
subwavelength optical devices for information technology3–6, 
sensing7,8, nonlinear optics9,10, optical nanotweezers11 and 
biomedical applications12. However, the electron motion generates 
heat through ohmic losses. Although this heat is desirable for some 
applications such as photo-thermal therapy, it is a disadvantage 
in plasmonic devices for sensing and information technology13 
and has led to a widespread view that plasmonics is too lossy to 
be practical. Here we demonstrate that the ohmic losses can be 
bypassed by using ‘resonant switching’. In the proposed approach, 
light is coupled to the lossy surface plasmon polaritons only in the 
device’s off state (in resonance) in which attenuation is desired, to 
ensure large extinction ratios between the on and off states and 
allow subpicosecond switching. In the on state (out of resonance), 
destructive interference prevents the light from coupling to the 
lossy plasmonic section of a device. To validate the approach, 
we fabricated a plasmonic electro-optic ring modulator. The 
experiments confirm that low on-chip optical losses, operation at 
over 100 gigahertz, good energy efficiency, low thermal drift and a 
compact footprint can be combined in a single device. Our result 
illustrates that plasmonics has the potential to enable fast, compact 
on-chip sensing and communications technologies.

Telecommunication devices such as electro-optic modulators must 
feature low insertion loss (the reduction of signal power resulting from 
insertion of the device into the transmission line) while providing a 
large change in phase (Δn) or amplitude (Δα) accumulated over a 
short device length14. Beyond that, modulators should offer low driving 
voltages and high-speed operation.

In recent years, silicon photonics has emerged that has low propaga-
tion losses (of the order of dB cm−1) but has struggled to achieve large 
modulation depth (that is, Δn and Δα) for submillimetre devices15. 
State-of-the-art devices maximize their modulation through the use 
of resonant structures16, enabling compact (few square micrometres) 
and energy-efficient components17,18. And although large quality  
factors (Q-factors, large values indicate low energy losses), of the order 
of several thousand, allow considerable reduction of the driving voltage, 
they limit the speed and increase the sensitivity of devices to temper-
ature and fabrication fluctuations19. More recently, surface plasmonic 
polariton (SPP) devices have exploited the extreme confinement of 
light to achieve exceptional modulation of phase and amplitude within 
a few micrometres3,20. However, the metals that give plasmonics such 
promise are also the largest hindrance, as such devices suffer from large 
on-state loss (of the order of dB μm−1). To combat plasmonic losses, 
some devices use hybrid plasmonic–photonic modes4,6,21 whereas 
others minimize the length of the active section5,22. Still, typical inser-
tion losses of 10 dB due to plasmonic propagation and photonic-to- 
plasmonic mode conversion remain a concern for high-speed state-
of-the-art devices5,6. Thus, plasmonic on-chip technologies have been 
unable to replace the existing photonic or electronic solutions.

We propose an approach in which losses in plasmonic waveguides 
can be selectively used or bypassed to achieve low insertion loss, 
strong modulation, compact footprint and high speed, simultane-
ously. Previously, the goal has been to reduce the ohmic loss as much 
as possible to minimize the device’s loss in the on state. Instead, we 
show that plasmonic losses can be tolerated by designing the device 
geometry such that light passes through the lossy section when required 
(in the off state). To achieve this, we use a plasmonic ring resonator 
coupled to a buried low-loss silicon photonic waveguide (see Fig. 1).

2.5 dB are measured with extinction ratios above 10 dB.

Unlike previous approaches, which aim to reduce the resonator loss to 
realize high-Q cavities or lasing7,23–26, our resonator exhibits typical 
propagation losses within the plasmonic cavity and mostly bypasses 
this lossy section in the on state through destructive interference. Using 
this design, we demonstrate a plasmonic modulator that can meet the 
key performance metrics of modern optical communications links.

Figure 1 shows the proposed device geometry, which comprises a 
gold metal–insulator–metal (MIM) slot waveguide ring coupled to a 
buried silicon bus waveguide, forming a notch filter with a resonant 
wavelength of λres (see section II of the Supplementary Information). 
The slot waveguide is filled with an organic electro-optic (OEO) mate-
rial which alters the device’s resonance condition through the Pockels 
effect (ΔnSPP)27. This permits fast and selective use of the resonator’s 
ohmic loss to attenuate the signal (Δα) in the bus waveguide by apply-
ing a voltage.

Figure 1c shows the measured transmittance over the wavelength 
of two representative devices that differ slightly in radius. The dif-
ference in radius does not affect their optical properties (insertion 
loss, extinction ratio, Q-factor), but results in a distinct off-resonance  
(λ0 ≠ λres) and on-resonance (λ0 = λres) behaviour at the telecom-
munication wavelength of 1.54 μm. The off-resonance ring reveals an 
insertion loss of about 2.5 dB, the on-resonance ring shows a Q-factor 
of about 30, and their difference in transmittance indicates an extinc-
tion ratio of about 10 dB. We note that non-resonant devices based on 

similar-length MIM waveguides feature an insertion loss ranging from 
8 dB to 10 dB (refs. 5,6,22).

The reduced insertion loss can be understood by comparing the 
exemplary operating principles of a non-resonant Mach–Zehnder 
modulator (MZ)5 (Fig. 2, left inset; white solid arrow indicates the plas-
monic section) and a resonant ring (Fig. 2, right inset). The insertion 
loss of the device is a function of its coupling efficiency, geometry and 
accumulated ohmic loss. In both concepts, light couples to and from 
the plasmonic structure with a coupling efficiency C. A transmission 
modulation is then induced by the Pockels effect over an active plas-
monic section of length or circumference l. The modulation depth ΔΤ, 
where T is transmittance, and also the loss LSPP scale with the length 
of the active plasmonic section6. Figure 2 shows the overall insertion 
loss over the LSPP in the active plasmonic area for a MZ (red curve) and 
for a critically coupled resonator (blue curve). The arrows in the plot 
indicate the performance of devices with an equal ΔΤ.

The following points arise from Fig. 2. First, the resonator’s total loss 
is always smaller than that of a MZ modulator (blue curve < red curve), 
owing to the bypassing mechanism28. The insertion loss increases with 
LSPP (that is, inverse to the cavity’s Q-factor) as the critical coupling 
condition requires that more light couples to the plasmonic section. 
Second, the resonator has an insertion loss 1 dB lower than that of the 
MZ at LSPP ≈ 0 dB. This is because the non-resonant device requires 
two photonic–SPP converters as both the on state and the off state 
propagate through the plasmonic section. Ohmic losses in the convert-
ers limit the conversion efficiency to about 1 dB (refs. 22,29). In contrast, 
the selection mechanism of the resonator (on state: bus waveguide; 
off state: ring) requires a converter which couples only a fraction of 
the light to the ring. Third, in the ring we take advantage of the reso-
nantly enhanced ΔΤ to reduce the device length (see section VII of 
the Supplementary Information). For our resonant structures, we have 
calculated an enhancement of about 1.5. Consequently, our ring with a 
circumference of l = 6 μm (LSPP ≈ 4 dB) offers the same transmittance 
change as a MZ of l = 9 μm (LSPP ≈ 6 dB). In total, the ring device offers 
an advantage of 6 dB insertion loss over the MZ modulator. Losses can 
be further reduced by under-coupling the resonator, as limited extinc-
tion ratios of 10 dB are sufficient for many practical applications30.

To illustrate the modulation performance (ΔΤ) of the plasmonic 
resonator, the effective refractive index for SPPs (ΔnSPP) is altered by 
applying a bias between the inner and outer rings27. Figure 3a shows 
the transmitted power versus applied voltage for a probe wavelength 
of approximately 1.52 μm. We observed an insertion loss < 3 dB, an 
extinction ratio of about 10 dB and a linear response (dashed green line) 
for a peak voltage of 3.5 V with an extinction ratio of about 6 dB. This 
performance in terms of insertion loss and extinction ratio is similar 
to that of well-developed complementary metal oxide semiconductor 
(CMOS) photonic resonators19. We estimate that operation under a 
digital peak-to-peak driving voltage (1 V)19 will soon be achievable 
by using other plasmonic materials such as silver or copper, using the 
newest OEO materials and improving fabrication (see Methods: Future

over non-resonant push–pull MZ device. The insertion losses are plotted 
against the active plasmonic loss (LSPP) in the slot waveguide of the MZ 
modulator (left inset, red) and resonator (right inset, blue). Losses can 
be reduced by more than 6 dB. This is for the following reasons: (i) the 
bypassing mechanism: only a fraction of light experiences plasmonic 
losses; (ii) resonant enhancement: the resonators achieve the same 
modulation depth (ΔT) for shorter active plasmonic sections than their 
non-resonant counterparts (indicated by the horizontal shift of the 
arrows); and (iii) coupling scheme: non-resonant approaches require two 
photonic/SPP converters whereas resonant approaches require only one.

improvements). To highlight the mechanism of the modulation, the 
transmission of the device was measured under a positive and negative 
bias ( ± 3.75 V) as a function of wavelength (see Fig. 3b). This results 
in a normalized sensitivity, Sλ/ΔFWHM = Δλres/(ΔFWHMΔn), where 
ΔFWHM is the full-width at half-maximum, of about 17 RIU−1 (RIU is 
refractive index unit), assuming a relative change in the OEO refractive 
index of about 0.03. This can be compared to commercial SPR sensors 
that achieve values of 50 RIU−1 by using a free-space Kretschmann 
configuration31. Therefore, our approach is already close to the non-in-
tegrated free-space approaches.

The moderate Q-factor guarantees a high operational speed and 
provides good thermal stability. For example, the measured resonance 
frequency is plotted in Fig. 3c over a temperature range from 20 °C 
up to 90 °C. In this case, the resonant frequency is found to follow a 
linear trend line with a slope of about 0.4% K−1. The insensitivity of 
the low-Q plasmonic resonator to temperature fluctuations is in strong 
contrast to high-Q photonic resonators, which are two orders of magni-
tude more sensitive to temperature fluctuations (approximately 100% 
K−1)18. This is extremely beneficial for applications in which strong 
temperature fluctuations occur. For example, a low-Q plasmonic reso-
nant sensor or modulator would be immune to thermal fluctuations 
of ± 5 °C which normally occur in CPUs, whereas high-Q photonic 
resonators require power-consuming temperature controls to main-
tain operation19. Furthermore, the moderate Q factors are beneficial 
for high-speed operation, as desired in electro-optic modulators. As a 
result, we are able to push the bandwidth of a resonant electro-optic 
modulator well beyond 100 GHz (see Methods section ‘Speed limita-
tions’). In comparison, photonic resonators are more likely to be limited 
to bandwidths of about 20 GHz and below18,19.

Subsequently, we performed high-speed data experiments to demon-
strate the robustness, high speed and low power switching capability.  
Although the ‘resonant switching’ principle can also be used to  
optimize sensors, we focus on high-speed applications because their 
sensitivity and stability requirements are stricter.

In the experiment of Fig. 4a, the peak driving voltage was approxi-
mately 3.3 V, and the laser wavelength was varied to capture the 
response of the modulator. Low device losses of 2.5 dB and fibre-to- 
silicon waveguide losses of about 7 dB resulted in fibre-to-fibre coupling  
losses of 16.5 dB, enabling successful operation with low laser powers 
of 4 dBm and below. The resulting bit-error ratio (BER) versus wave-
length for a 72 Gbit s−1 signal is shown in Fig. 4b, where a peak in the 
BER is observed at λres (dashed line). The BER shows a peak because 
the change of transmittance (ΔT) has a symmetric response to voltage 
when the probing wavelength λ equals λres. Consequently, we con-
firmed that the operating mechanism relies on amplitude modulation. 
Off-resonance, the BER quickly dropped to about 1 × 10−3, which is 

below the hard-decision forward error correction (HD-FEC) limit and 
allows for successful data modulation and detection32. No thermal 
heater was required for stabilization. Additionally, we reduced the data 
rate to 36 Gbit s−1 and 18 Gbit s−1 and found BERs of about 2 × 10−6 
and < 1 × 10−6, respectively, indicating that the BER at 72 Gbit s−1 is 
mainly limited by the electrical equipment (see Methods: Data experi-
ments). We estimate the energy consumption of the modulator to be 
about 12 fJ bit−1 at 72 Gbit s−1 (ref. 14) for a device capacitance of 1.1 fF.

We have demonstrated that low-Q resonant designs using highly 
confined SPPs can enable low-loss active plasmonic devices with a good 
modulation depth. We believe that our approach—unlike conventional 
resonant photonics—breaks the trade-off between sensitivity (high-Q) 
on the one hand and speed and temperature stability (low-Q) on the 
other. Our work can be seen as a step towards practical plasmonics that 
ultimately serves as a compact and fast gateway between electronics 
(local signal processing) and photonics (broad bandwidth and low-
loss data stream). The proposed slot waveguide approach could be of 
interest for sensing, because the resonant response could be exploited 
for many other material systems ranging from low-index materials such 
as aqueous solutions to high-index materials such as silicon.

MEthodS
Future improvements. The plasmonic material strongly influences the perfor-
mance of the ring resonator in terms of losses and resonant enhancement. In this 
section, we discuss the influence of various plasmonic materials and we show that 
the modulator performance improves when replacing gold with copper (CMOS-
compatible) or silver (lowest loss).

In a first step, we investigate the unloaded Q-factor for different plasmonic 
metals. Extended Data Fig. 1 shows the unloaded quality factor Q as a function of 
the slot width and the radius for Au (panel a), Cu (b) and Ag (c).

Both Cu and Ag feature higher Q-factors than Au. When changing the plas-
monic metal from Au to Ag, the Q-factor is more than doubled for geometries 
dominated by propagation loss (140 for Ag versus 60 for Au). Each material shows 
the trade-off between propagation loss and bending loss resulting in the characte-
ristic triangular contour lines (see section III of the Supplementary Information). 
Furthermore, using low-loss materials such as Ag will increase not only the intrin-
sic Q-factor but also the coupling efficiency C. Three-dimensional simulations 
indicate that C increases from 0.8 to 0.9.

Besides the plasmonic material, the OEO material provides an additional path 
for further improvement. Recent experiments have shown that electro-optic coef-
ficients over 300 pm V−1 are achievable by operating in close vicinity of the OEO 
material resonance (λ ≈ 1,250 nm)33. Additionally, other OEO materials such as 
JRD1 show electro-optic coefficients over 300 pm V−1 (refs. 34–36).

To evaluate the influence of these improvements on the modulator performance, 
Extended Data Fig. 1 shows the wavelength-dependent transmittance of a MIM-
ring resonator obtained by the analytic model (equation (2) in the Supplementary 
Information). Extended Data Fig. 1d shows the transmittance for Au while 
Extended Data Fig. 1e includes the possible improvements with Ag and JRD1 
(electro-optic coefficient of 300 pm V−1). The radius is 1 μm, the slot width is 80 nm 
and the outer electrode height is 350 nm. The solid lines correspond to positive 
(blue) and negative (red) biasing of 2 V.

Such improved configurations offer through-port insertion loss as small as 
0.5 dB (Ag) compared with 1.5 dB (Au). Furthermore, the switching sensitivity 
is increased because of the higher nonlinearity (sensitivity increase by 3 × ) and 
the larger Q-factor (2 × ). Thus, the absolute insertion loss reduces from 4.3 dB to 
1.2 dB, and the extinction ratio increases from 2 dB to 18 dB when driven with ± 2 V 
at the chosen probing wavelength (vertical green line, Extended Data Fig. 1d,e). 
Thus, low-power CMOS transistors may drive the plasmonic resonators without 
the help of electrical amplification. This would reduce the total energy consump-
tion of the modulators to below 1 fJ per bit.
Alternative active materials for modulation and sensing. Here, we discuss the 
influence of the refractive index of the slot material on the unloaded Q-factor of 
plasmonic ring resonators. The active material could be either an OEO material for 
modulation or a biosensitive material for sensing purposes. Extended Data Fig. 2 
shows the simulated Q-factors for different slot widths and radii. The simulated 
refractive indices range from 1.33 up to 3.48 as shown in subplots in Extended 
Data Fig. 2a to h.

All material systems achieve Q-factors above 30. The refractive index of the 
active material strongly influences the bending and propagation losses. In the case 
of low nslot, for Extended Data Fig. 2a and b, the Q-factor is mainly limited by 
bending losses for all slot widths as indicated by the diagonal contour lines (dashed 
lines). This behaviour changes when nslot increases to 1.75 (Extended Data Figs. 2c) 
or 2 (Extended Data Fig. 2d) and typical triangular contour lines can be observed 
highlighting the trade-off between bending losses and propagation losses (see sec-
tion IV of the Supplementary Information). A further increase of the refractive 
index results in dominating propagation losses. The triangular shape of the contour 
line changes to contour lines parallel to the bottom axis (radius). In this region (see 
subplots in Extended Data Fig. 2e to h), the Q-factor drops for the same geometrical 
parameters as propagation loss increases with the refractive index37.

The subplots shown in Extended Data Fig. 2a, c, e and h are of most interest as 
they represent materials that can be used for sensing: (a) nslot = 1.33 (H2O); or for 
electro-optic modulation: (c) nslot = 1.75 (OEO)35; (e) nslot = 2.25 (barium titanate, 
BTO)38; and (h) nslot = 3.48 (Si)22.
Sample fabrication. All reported devices were processed on silicon-on-insulator 
wafers with a 220-nm-thick Si device layer and 3-μm-thick buried oxide. Electron 
beam lithography (Vistec EBPG5200) in combination with ICP-RIE (Oxford 
Plasmalab System 100) were applied to pattern the Si photonic components. A 
positive tone resist (poly(methyl methacrylate), PMMA) and a negative tone resist 
(hydrogen silsesquioxane, HSQ) were used as masks to define the partially (70 nm) 
and fully (220 nm) etched Si structures, respectively39. Planarization of the pat-
terned Si structures was realized by spin-coating the samples with a 1-μm-thick 
HSQ layer followed by rapid thermal annealing to convert HSQ to SiO2 (ref. 40). We 
observed thickness variations of ± 10 nm with a periodicity of 50 μm throughout 
the chip. This does not affect device performance, as the footprint of the resonators  

is much smaller than the periodicity. We controlled the coupling between the ring 
and bus waveguide by using the following protocol, which enabled us to adjust 
the average vertical spacing between the gold ring and silicon bus (dAu–Si) to 
within 5 nm of the target value. First, we use an electron-beam-patterned PMMA 
resist mask to open silicon etch marks placed next to the device to measure the 
HSQ thickness during the following wet etching process. Afterwards, we used a 
second e-beam patterned PMMA resist to locally etch down the SiO2 over the 
bus waveguide to the desired spacing dAu,Si = 70 ± 10 nm by using a buffered HF 
(7:1) solution. The slow etch-rate of 1.2 nm s–1 enables good process control. Note 
that the spin-coating process rather than the wet etching process introduces the 
uncertainty of ± 10 nm. Contact pads, outer rings (height h = 350 nm), inner rings 
(h = 150 nm) and bridges (h = 350 nm) were produced with a sequence of e-beam 
lithography, e-beam evaporation of Au and lift-off processes as reported in ref. 5. 
Extended Data Fig. 3 shows a tilted top view of the fabricated ring resonator before 
the bridge fabrication step. The height of the outer electrode is 350 nm, whereas 
the inner electrode is only 150 nm, enabling a reduction of the bending losses (see 
section IV of the Supplementary Information).

We characterized the geometry of all devices using SEM for better comparison 
to simulations. This allows us to estimate parameters such as the electro-optic 
coefficient, r33. Finally, the binary OEO material (75%HD-BB-OH/25%YLD124)41 
was spin-coated then poled at its glass transition temperature (115 °C) by applying 
electric fields of approximately 130 V μm−1. It has been shown33 that this OEO 
material allows operation up to 80 °C.

We chose the following design parameter sets: slot widths of 80 nm and 100 nm 
with radii ranging from 900 nm to 1,200 m and 1,400 nm to 1600 nm.
Passive characterization. We determined the transmittance of the resonators by 
subtracting back-to-back measurements of structures that comprise the same grat-
ing couplers and photonic waveguides but lack the plasmonic section. The standard 
deviation of the back-to-back measurements was below ± 0.5 dB over the whole 
wavelength range of the tunable laser (1,465 nm to 1,635 nm). We measured the 
passive spectrum for various input power up to 10 dBm and did not observe any 
drift of the resonance wavelength due to self-heating. To prevent any self-heating, 
we set the laser power to 0 dBm for the passive characterization.

Extended Data Fig. 4 shows two histograms of the measured insertion loss 
(Extended Data Fig. 4a) and extinction ratio (Extended Data Fig. 4b) of 23 ring 
resonators with targeted slot widths of 80 nm. The average insertion loss is about 
2.5 dB and the mean extinction ratio is about 9.7 dB.

We designed rings with varying radii to account for fabrication variations. 
Extended Data Fig. 4c shows the passive spectrum of ring resonators with radii 
ranging from 940 nm up to 990 nm. The resonance wavelength shifts with increas-
ing radius by δλres/δR ≈ 1.1.
Sensitivity experiments. We used the same optical set-up as the passive characte-
rization measurements to estimate the d.c./low-frequency electro-optic response of 
six devices. In a first experiment, we applied a 100 Hz triangular shaped electrical 
signal with a peak voltage amplitude of 10 V. We measured the modulation of the 
optical signal when operating the resonator around its 3 dB point. In a second 
experiment, we applied a d.c. bias and measured the resonators’ wavelength shift 
as a function of the voltage. Extended Data Table 1 provides an overview of the 
insertion loss, extinction ratio and sensitivity of the resonance wavelength (Δλres 
per volt) as extracted from these two experiments. The extinction ratio (6–10 dB) 
and insertion loss (2–3 dB) during active switching match the values obtained from  
passive characterization. This shows that the modulators can be driven from 
minimum to maximum output power before dielectric breakdown occurs. Three-
dimensional simulation of device 79 revealed a Δλres/V ≈ 3.1 nm V−1 for an electro- 
optic coefficient of 100 pm V−1. Thus, we estimate an in-device electro-optic  
coefficient of about 90 pm V−1 and a Δn ≈ 0.03 when biasing with ± 3.75 V based 
on the Pockels effect. Device 79 (last row) is shown in Fig. 3a and b of the main text.
Speed limitations. The electro-optic bandwidth of resonant electro-optic modu-
lators is often determined by the photon lifetime of the resonant cavity. In the case 
of a ring-based electro-optic modulator with a Q-factor of 6,000, this equates to an 
electro-optic bandwidth of a few tens of gigahertz42. In the case of resonant plas-
monic structures, the photon lifetime does not limit the electro-optic bandwidth, 
as these structures feature Q-factors that are two orders of magnitude smaller than 
the Q-factors of photonic approaches.

In general, the slowest of the following effects limits the electro-optic bandwidth 
of an electro-optic-modulator: (i) the RC time constant; (ii) the timescale of the 
nonlinear effect (here the Pockels effect); and (iii) the cavity lifetime. In the case 
of the plasmonic MIM ring modulator presented in this work, these contributions 
can be approximated as follows:

• τRC: The calculated capacitance of the MIM ring is approximately 1.1 fF (electro- 
static 3D simulation), and its resistance is a few ohms with the nanometre-scale 
bridge being the main contributor5. This results in an RC bandwidth much greater 
than 1 THz.

• τPockels: The Pockels effect is based on the reorganization of π-electrons within 
a nanometre-long molecule and is estimated to be on the timescale of femto- or 
attoseconds27. This results in a Pockels bandwidth much greater than 1 THz.

• τcavity: The SPP lifetime is given by the quality factor divided by the angular 
frequency (τres ≈ Q/ωphoton). The resonant structures presented in this work fea-
ture Q-factors of 50, while future implementations may reach values of up to 150. 
Thus, the cavity lifetime of SPPs is about 100 fs or less, resulting in a cavity lifetime 
bandwidth limit of more than 1 THz.

Based on these approximations, we expect, at worst, a terahertz bandwidth for 
a plasmonic MIM resonator using the Pockels effect. To confirm that bandwidth 
limitations are not an issue for resonant plasmonic modulators we performed 
electro-optic bandwidth measurements with a plasmonic resonator of radius 
1.5 μm and a designed slot width of 100 nm. These design parameters are chosen 
because they feature the largest Q-factors and therefore the longest cavity life-
times. Extended Data Fig. 5a shows the wavelength-dependent transmittance of 
the plasmonic resonators and Extended Data Fig. 5b shows the normalized modu-
lation efficiency as a function of the modulation frequency. The ratio between the 
unmodulated carrier and the modulated sidebands is the modulation efficiency 
which was measured with an optical spectrum analyser and normalized with 
respect to the lowest applied frequency43.

The different colours correspond to three characteristic probing wavelengths. 
Red, yellow and purple are the off-resonance, 3 dB point and on-resonance probing 
wavelengths, respectively. For all three curves, a similar behaviour is observed, 
and electro-optic bandwidths beyond 100 GHz are found. This indicates that 
the cavity lifetime is not yet limiting the bandwidth. Otherwise, a discrepancy 
in bandwidth between on-resonance (purple) and off-resonance (red) operation 
should be observed. The kink at about 110 GHz is attributed to limitations in the 
electrical test set-up.

Two different measurement set-ups were required to cover the broad electrical 
spectrum ranging from 20 GHz up to 115 GHz in steps of 2.5 GHz. The first set-up 
(20 GHz to 70 GHz) used a tunable radiofrequency (RF) signal generator (100 kHz 
to 70 GHz) to generate a sinusoidal RF signal. The electrical output power of the 
source was adjusted for each frequency such that a constant power of 0 dBm was 
applied to the ring resonator via ground–signal–ground probes. The second set-up 
was used to cover the frequency range from 70 GHz to 115 GHz with a step size 
of 2.5 GHz. We used the sixth harmonic of a Schottky diode to generate these 
frequencies. The electrical input power to the Schottky diode was kept constant. 
We compensated the variations in the diode’s output power by measuring the 
power with a broadband power meter. The measured power values were used in 
a post-processing step to subtract the influence of the varying power. The power 
levels of the harmonic terms other than the sixth harmonic were negligible.

Note that the signal was applied via 100 μm × 100 μm contact pads. The reso-
nator itself (approximately 1.1 fF) does not determine the total capacitance as the 
large contact pads interact with the substrate resulting in a capacitance of several 
tens of femtofarads44. The modulator behaves like an open circuit element owing 
to the small capacitance.
Data experiments. This section provides details about the experimental set-up 
shown in Fig. 4 of the main text. A tunable, external cavity laser (1,465 nm to 
1,575 nm) was used as a light source with output powers ranging from 6 dBm up 
to 13 dBm. The laser light was fed to an attenuator to enable a flexible adjustment 
of the optical power. Light was coupled to and from the chip via grating couplers, 
which have an efficiency (CGC) of −7 dB each at 1550 nm.

All non-return-to-zero (NRZ) electrical data streams were random binary 
sequences of length 218 generated by a 72 gigasample s−1, six-bit digital-to- 
analogue converter (f3dB ≈ 20 GHz). An RF amplifier (f3dB ≈ 50–55 GHz) then  
amplified the electrical signal to a certain peak-to-peak driving voltage (Vpp,50Ω) 
measured over a 50 Ω resistor. Finally, the electrical signal was applied by 
ground-signal RF-probes (f3dB > 67 GHz) to the device via 100 μm × 100 μm 
contact pads. Two 25-cm-long RF cables (1.85-mm connectors) connected the 
generator, amplifier and RF probe. The modulated light was detected coher-
ently. We used a second laser for heterodyne detection. The 3 dB bandwidth of 
the coherent detector’s photodiode is 70 GHz. An erbium-doped fibre amplifier 
amplified the optical signal after the modulator to power levels of about 8 dBm 
to enable best performance. The electrical oscilloscope (electrical bandwidth 
63 GHz and sampling rate 160 GSa s−1) sampled and digitized the waveform. 
Offline digital signal-processing was performed to account for timing errors45, 
carrier frequency and phase offsets and the linear frequency response of the 
system by feedforward equalization with adaptive least mean square (LMS)-based 
filter updates. Extended Data Table 2 shows the results in terms of BER obtained 
from six different devices under various driving voltages (Vpeak), data rates (R), 
and optical input powers at the grating coupler. Similar BERs are obtained for 
different devices under equal conditions. For instance, low BERs are obtained at 
18 Gbit s−1 for small driving voltages of Vpeak ≈ 3.3 V and low input powers. At 
72 Gbit s−1, the BER drops to 10−3 under similar conditions. We increased the 

driving voltages twofold and the input power fourfold and measured only a mod-
erate reduction of the BER to 10−4. We attribute this to the limited bandwidth 
of the electrical components. Device 34 is shown in the Fig. 4 of the main text.
Comparison with state-of-the-art electro-optic modulators. In the following, we 
compare the plasmonic ring resonators with prior art. Electro-optic-modulators 
are expected to help replace electrical communication links with their optical 
counterparts for short-range applications. Potential candidates must be compact 
(footprint of a few square micrometres) to enable a dense co-integration of elec-
tronics and photonics. Furthermore, electro-optic modulators must be optimized 
for high speed ( > 100 GHz) and low insertion loss ( < 3 dB) to enable multi-gi-
gabit operation. Extended Data Fig. 6 shows the characteristics of state-of-the-art 
devices (photonic, crosses; plasmonic, circles) in terms of insertion loss and elec-
tro-optic-bandwidth5,6,18,22,43,44,46–50. The different abbreviations represent various 
electro-optic materials. Ideally, modulators should occupy the bluish area at the 
bottom right of the figure. However, large bandwidths correlate with large insertion 
loss. This is because the plasmonic waveguides also serve as highly conductive elec-
trodes, enabling a low RC time constant, but ohmic losses in the metals prevent low 
insertion losses. Conversely, the resonant switching of photonic modulators enables 
low losses but these suffer from limited bandwidths. Combining plasmonics and 
the resonant switching concept breaks the trade-off and enables high-speed and 
low-loss modulators.

For the convenience of the reader, we provide a detailed summary of key metrics 
in Extended Data Table 3 (demonstrated plasmonic modulators) and in Extended 
Data Table 4 (photonic electro-optic modulators). The performance of the plas-
monic ring resonator (last column) serves as reference in both tables. Extended 
Data Table 3 compares our modulator with four non-resonant modulators based 
on various nonlinear effects and material systems such as χ(2) in OEO materials, 
free-carrier dispersion (FCD) in silicon, FCD in transparent conductive oxides 
(TCO) and χ(2) in BTO.

• The resonant approach (last column) outperforms its direct non-resonant 
counterpart (first column).

• Plasmonic resonators requires moderate driving voltages, and only the TCO-
based modulator is driven with Vpeak = 1 V as required to enable integration with 
electronics. However, different data rates of 72 Gbit s−1 and 2.5 Gbit s−1 make a 
comparison between our modulator and the TCO modulator challenging.

• Finally, we note that applying the resonant plasmonic approach to other mate-
rial systems would enable a further boost in performance for each individual tech-
nology. For instance, one can imagine TCO-based plasmonic resonators operating 
with millivolt driving voltages.

Extended Data Table 4 shows six photonic modulators based on FCD in sil-
icon18,46, the Franz–Keldysh effect (FKE) in SiGe (ref. 48), χ(2) in BTO47, χ(2) in 
lithium niobate (LiNbO3)50 and Pauli blocking in graphene51.

bandwidth at the off-resonance, 3 dB and on-resonance operating 
point. a, Transmission spectrum; b, measured bandwidth. No bandwidth 

limitation can be observed up to 110 GHz. The drop at 115 GHz 
frequencies is due to a limited measurement set-up. Recent studies show 
that the modulation efficiency at lower radiofrequency is not limited44.
