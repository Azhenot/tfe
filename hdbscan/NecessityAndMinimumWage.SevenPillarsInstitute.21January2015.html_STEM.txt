necess and minimum wage 

june 23rd, 2016 by kara in case studi 







By john atherton 

compar someone’ choic to buy a luxuri decor with the 
purchas of a prescript that stave off death. while one of these 
choic be an aesthet prefer the other be a necess of survival. 
the distinct between these choic separ econom ‘wants’ and 
‘needs’. A depend on surviv need forc human behaviour through 
natur impos duress, compromis our freedom of choice. A moral 
right to freedom or exist argu for the remov of thi duress in 
favour of a default state, where survivalist compuls be make irrelevant. 

A perfect default state would be a system where our freedom 
to choos a necess be rais until it resembl our freedom to choos 
a luxury. To achiev thi ideal, the mitig of natur duress 
through a guarante of surviv be consid in the practic model of a 
minimum wage. At present, despit ani choic we make, we cannot exist 
without the necessities. the abil to meet the cost of food, water 
and shelter be a start in delay the repercuss of our natur 
shackl [1]. If we do not need these to survive, but regard them a 
optional, then our choic to buy them could certainli be consid more 
freeli made. how do the conflict between compuls to satisfi the 
need of surviv and freedom of choic factor into the econom of the 
minimum wage? 


self suffici 

the 2006 self suffici standard use in the unit state of 
america contain the major categori of housing, child care, food, 
transport and healthcar [2]. We call the cost of these provis 
the ‘cost of living’, though thi amount vari both local and abroad. 
internationally, differ nation use differ standards; canada, for 
example, assum educ be provid freeli by the state to canadian 
residents. educ assist all models, includ those consid 
late in thi article, and there be a valid case for it to be includ 
a a need, though for thi analysi current measur and their 
respect assumpt be used. the cost of live in differ 
counti also vari while within the same counti the cost of have 
child be the final point of difference. two exampl from a standard 
research in 2006 be list below. 



the self-suffici standard for 
select famili types* harrisburg-carlisle, PA msa, 2006 dauphin counti 
monthli expens and share of total budget 



tabl 1: 2006, univers of washington for pathwayspa [2]. 



the self-suffici standard for seattle-bellevue*, WA hmfa, 2006 king counti – bellevue, juanita, kirkland and redmond 



tabl 2: 2006, washington univers for the workforc develop council of seattle-k counti [3]. 

* the standard be 
calcul by add expens and tax and subtract tax credits. 
tax includ feder and state incom tax (includ state tax 
credit except state ietc and ctc) and payrol taxes. 

** the hourli wage be calcul by divid the monthli wage by 176 hour (8 hour per day time 22 day per month). 

*** the hourli 
wage for famili with two adult repres the hourli wage that each 
adult would need to earn, while the monthli and annual wage repres 
both parents’ wage combined. 



take the moral imper of an inher right to a default state, 
(a right to exist), into account where do these figur leav us? the 
begin of thi analysi resid in discuss mere the cost of 
live of a singl adult vers the current minimum wage of $7.25; 
though the variat in cost of live figur make thi difficult. 
given the differ between local self suffici wage we can first 
say the minimum wage should definit be high than the low live 
wage. If one say so relat to the unit state a a whole then it 
would onli be feasibl for minimum wage worker to live in the cheapest 
counti of the entir nation, a mildli impract notion give the 
distribut of minimum wage job throughout the country. If we take the 
low self suffici wage from a state we would find ourselv with a 
reduc version of the same problem. there be present no pervas 
survey connect minimum wage job locat to the cheapest nearbi 
resid so we will have to approximate. 

take the unit states’ gdp per capita, the intern monetari 
fund, world bank and central intellig agenc would all quot a 
figur between $54,000-$55,000, though a great deal of incom be unseen 
by the averag american due to the extrem natur of wealth inequ 
make the $28,889 per caput incom figur quot by the unit state 
censu bureau paint a more realist pictur with regard to the scope 
of the minimum wage worker [4, 5, 6, 7]. 

If we make the approxim that a minimum wage worker should, if 
make pure surviv base purchas (leav no money for luxuri or 
lifestyle), be abl to live in neighbourhood along peopl earn 
$28,889 or less, how effect would thi be a a measure? 

even attempt to base a minimum wage off approxim of the 
surviv wage in thi manner be inadequate. In bellevue, juanita, 
kirkland and redmond – king county, washington state, for example, where 
the surviv wage for an adult individu be on the high side at 
$41,767, it might seem unreason to say that it should be expect 
that a minimum wage worker should not be abl to afford to live there 
[7]. that is, however, until you also consid that king counti be by 
far the most popul counti in washington with over 2 million peopl 
(almost 30% of the state’ population). 

furthermore, though the surviv wage drop to almost $8 for the 
652,000 resid of seattle, it be $9.49 in renton, and high still 
for all remain fraction of king counti up until the $10.30 hourli 
wage see in tabl 2 [3]. In pennsylvania, resid of dauphin counti 
earn $30,491 per caput with a surviv standard of $17,392 whilst back 
in kitsap county, washington, per caput incom be a high $32,340 
while the annual surviv wage be the low valu of ani record 
counti in the state at a staggeringli low $13,807; requir an hourli 
wage of $6.54 [2, 3, 7]. 

the conclus of these wide vari surviv and incom figur be 
give all these counti employ minimum wage workers, if we do not want 
high unemploy or increas transport cost the minimum wage must 
be abov the surviv wage in a give area for employ to truli be 
viabl from the perspect of the employee. In analys these 
differ one might also ponder the ethic posit pose by vari 
minimum wage and it vari effect on local employment, though thi 
articl will focu on the nation a a whole. 

one nation poverti model use by the financi time (us), call 
three member household earn near or less than $31,402 a year “in or 
near to poverty”, with thi afflict affect one fifth of the 
american popul [8]. use the assumpt of the model above, if a 
singl adult in these household worked, he would have to earn $14.87 an 
hour, or if two member work full time then they would have to earn 
$7.43 an hour each. thi poverti line be still a more conserv 
estim than the local realiti of dauphin and king county, where a 
singl adult live alon without ani child at all would have to earn 
$8.23 and $8.06-$10.30 respectively. By all these standard a full time 
worker earn minimum wage may well be live in poverty. 

spend and profit 

employ be the next key issu when it come to the minimum wage; 
specif regard what be practic for employers. regardless of a 
wage base on the cost of living, if the valu of a person’ employ 
be low than their wage then their employ would incur a loss for 
hire them. If thi occur a ration employ would not hire 
them in the first place, make the minimum wage’ equivoc with a 
surviv wage irrelev to those left unemployed. from a 
consequentialist standpoint, where practic feasibl be favour 
over intang principl motivation, employ incent must be met 
for a minimum wage increas to be permissible. By extension, do so 
must be econom advantag for it to be affirmed. consid these 
principl motiv follow by a more pragmatic, consequentialist 
approach in analys the minimum wage. 

If product exce incom then employ be profitable. 
additionally, if one support the right of an individu to the ‘sweat 
of their brow’, or justice, then a wage near product and henc a 
minimum wage near minimum product would be support morally, 
a a practic implement of meritocracy. furthermore, with relat 
to the moral concept of egalitarian redistribution, a moral argument 
independ of a right to exist can also be made. the first of these 
argument be met in ani system, with or without intervention, where the 
minimum wage be set near the product wage. the second be met where 
a minimum wage, (or similar scheme), be set high than the cost of 
live such that a person might not mere surviv but also develop. 
finally, the imper to be free of the coercion of the natur order 
requir a minimum wage, (or similar scheme), that is, at the veri 
least, equal to the cost of living. 

all three of these posit also overlap a posit of deontolog 
capitalism. from the employer’ standpoint a person should not be 
view a a resourc or means, affirm their right to their own labour 
a state by the first moral position. the facilit for person 
growth propos by the second align with the portion of the categor 
imper where one be both subject and sovereign, a a world in which 
all worker be entrench in the circumst of the minimum wage 
worker would be vastli inferior [9]. the third of these posit find 
comport with kantian ethic also, where someone’ surviv may be see 
a their respons a an independ ration agent. If a minimum 
wage be set abov the cost of living, but not abov the product 
wage, then all these posit be in agreement. 

In contrast to this, however, a consequentialist might argu that the 
viabil of ani proposit be the most import consideration. A 
utilitarian, by extension, also favour an argument for redistribut 
give diminish return on happi from wealth – provid practic 
viabil be demonstr [10]. beyond a level of inequ requir a 
incentive, if incom distribut have no effect on spend habits, 
alongsid an increas in happiness, then a utilitarian would affirm it 
[11]. often, however, more equit system see improv econom 
conditions, affirm even a consequentialist posit without happi 
a a criterion. what be the practic benefit of an increas minimum 
wage? 

the reason for thi relat to spend behaviour. someon whose wage 
equal surviv wage, for example, cannot afford to save. hi spend 
be continu circul throughout the economy, it effect in turn 
amplifi by the multipli of the sector it be engag in. If these 
sector spend more, such a on wages, then their multipli be also 
increas [12]. thi increas rate of capit circul promot 
econom growth. A chang in incom of a set amount also have an 
increas effect on consum behaviour for low incom earners, and 
henc promot high consum confid and spend behaviour [13]. 

there be further studi on the effect of minimum wage increas 
too, with a studi from the cepr note that even if price increas from 
a wage hike then the net effect record be still posit [14]. thi 
mean it may be the case that the cyclic effect note earli could 
compens for a wage increas abov current productivity, effect 
increas product provid the wage increas be minimal. beyond 
the gener wage figur discuss late in thi articl minor 
increases, if support by specif case studies, indic the minimum 
wage can be margin higher. 

with regard to competit and unemployment, neg effect to 
employ be not found in a studi of two neighbour state where 
one increas it minimum wage, but where the increas minimum wage be 
still below the product wage [15]. the most obviou posit 
effect of all thi to a utilitarian, however, be not just the increas 
to happi from wealth redistribution, but also the reduct of the 
suffer of poverti [16]. 

return to the potenti conflict between the surviv and 
product wage we find a similar consideration. In all place where 
the product wage exce ‘cost of living’ employ be profitable. 
In determin a viabl minimum wage we should be awar that moder 
be required. what be the viabl minimum wage? 

the cost of live and product 

with the viabl wage near or below productivity, while hope 
exceed the cost of living, we need to find the product wage for 
minimum wage workers. though specif figur be difficult to quantifi 
we can judg the rate of growth in wage against the growth in 
productivity. the follow graph be make use data from the econom 
polici institute, note the valu of the minimum wage against 
product when we factor out inflation. 





graph 1: product and minimum wage (econom polici institut [17]) 



these figur suggest that if the minimum wage kept pace with 
product it would soon reach $20, well exceed the $15 hourli 
minimum wage some peopl be suggesting. furthermore, these results, 
along with gener result about averag worker compensation, (which 
also have lose pace with product to a huge extent sinc the 1970 
much like the minimum wage [18]), be note in an articl by the 
econom polici institut discuss a $12 minimum wage, (bi 2020, or 
$10.58 in 2014$), note how it would onli be just abov the $9.54, (in 
2014$), minimum wage from 1968 befor the declin in the wage’ real 
valu due to inflat [17]. 

though a $12 minimum wage would account for inflation, give the 
increas of productivity, minimum wage worker be perform a far more 
product servic today, so their minimum wage should not be mere 
indexed, but increas to account for the fact that they be more 
product today. accord to thi graph, their product wage in 
2014 be $18.42 [17]. set thi a a minimum wage, or just the $15 
minimum wage some politician be suggesting, should account for the 
differ in live cost while keep minimum wage work profitable. 
An $18.42 wage would go further morally, though an increas to the 
minimum wage would certainli be advised. 

wage stagnat in gener also entail further consequentialist 
harm from lower gener spend behaviour mention earlier, 
decreas confidence, increas inequity, increas relianc on debt 
and instabl [19]. present level of inequ have be link to 
greatli more financi difficult colleg years, make it more 
difficult for peopl to increas human capit through education, 
therebi slow econom growth [12, 19]. 

all of this, however, be assum the data be accurate. there be 
also some critic that should be consid in evalu thi data. 
the first be that the data for product relat to the whole economy, 
rather than just minimum wage work. although the minimum wage seem to 
keep pace with product until 1968 we cannot assum it continu to 
increas a quickly. one way to gaug the product increas of 
minimum wage work more accur be to use percentag growth figur 
releas by the bureau of labor statist in specif industries, and 
analys sector with more minimum wage worker such a the ‘fast food 
industry’, (accommod and food servic – limit servic 
restaurants). thi approach be use by the heritag foundat in 
critic of a minimum wage rise. 

In do so it note that the percentag growth in wage seem 
similar to the percentag growth in productivity, though there be a huge 
fault in thi method. that flaw be that these percentag growth figur 
onli date back in the labor department’ record to 1987, while the 
sourc of the dispar date to 1968 [20, 21]. after 1968 product 
begin to rise far more quickli than wages. In the graph use figur 
from the econom polici institut the real valu of the minimum wage 
actual declined. 

thi mean if we use percentag chang figur from 1987 they will 
fail to reflect the initi disparity. for exampl in 1987 a 20% 
increas to the minimum wage would be an estim $1.34 (2014$), while a 
20% increas to product would be an estim increas of $2.47 
(2014$). although thi method be preferable, a figur for specif 
industri be onli avail from 1987, thi method cannot be use 
without refer to an initi dispar estim by the neg 
redistribut of wealth in the gener economy. 

use thi approach, wage in the ‘accommod and food servic – 
limit servic restaurants’ sector would be 13.5% up from the $12.35 
1987 product wage, place it at around $14 a oppos to the 
approxim $8 minimum wage suggest by the article’ mathemat 
[22]. thi $14 figure, however, be still an import tool for the 
specif consider of thi industry, though it too come with it 
reduc generalis and the enhanc potenti for distort from 
both histor and current tip practices. 

An addit disagr with the valid of the graph be also 
rais by critic regard how it account for inflation. On thi 
account we have data back to 1968. the inflat figur give can be 
see in the graph below. 





graph 2: heritag foundat calcul use labor depart figur [22]. 



there be three main method of account for inflation. the 
institut of econom polici use the implicit price deflat (ipd) for 
product and the consum price index (cpi) for wages. By all three 
measur the real valu of the minimum wage, ($7.25), have dropped, 
though by differ amounts. rememb also that the real valu should 
not just be constant, but increas with respect to workplac 
product and so be notabl high than ani of these three figur 
make thi more than a matter of a $0.14 differ if we take the most 
pessimist project for a minimum wage supporter. 

regardless, the institut of econom polici do use the two method 
which make the divid between product and wage appear the largest. 
If we be to use the same deflat method then the product wage 
be 22% lower, make deflat calcul an import factor. what be 
the differ between the cpi and the ipd? 

put simpli the ipd relat to the economi overal while the cpi 
relat to a ‘basket of goods’ and be more a reflect of the part of 
the economi a minimum wage worker would like make purchas in than 
the economi a a whole [12, 23]. some measur of the ipd also exclud 
certain activ a minimum wage worker be like to be affect by, such 
a transfer payments, (welfare), and household to household payment 
[24]. effectively, both measur be design for differ things, with 
the cpi relat more to individu while the ipd relat more to the 
economi generally. It be due to thi differ that the econom polici 
institute, (and other govern take the same approach), would 
defend their method a most applic to the measur of product 
and wage specif while critic would claim the same measur should 
be use regardless to perform a fair test. 

know that the $18.42 wage would easili cover an individual’ cost 
of live and henc align right base and consequentialist moral 
interests, be the same possibl if you use the same deflator? In 2014$ 
it would be approxim $14.40, (take the scale deflat differ 
assum product kept pace with averag product growth) [25]. 
In expens citi like san francisco $18.42 would be insuffici for 
singl parent famili and $14.40 would be insuffici altogether, 
though both figur would allow singl adult worker in jersey city, 
washington d.c., phoenix, denver, tacoma, philadelphia, indianapolis, 
hartford and charleston to now afford the self-suffici standard [3]. 
even thi significantli reduc figur would still cover the cost of 
live in mani counties, sustain survival, profit and growth; though 
there be altern to the minimum wage, some of which argu profit 
aren’t enough motivation. 

altern to the minimum wage 

besid the minimum wage there be two common counter-models, the 
incom earn tax credit, (also refer to a neg tax), and the 
complet abolit of ani govern intervention. An incom earn tax 
credit be effect a mean test and bureaucrat implement 
payment from the govern to anyon make below a certain wage, so 
the economi be tax and a payment give to those earn the low 
incom earners. though it may involv the ineffici and cost of 
bureaucracy, the mean test capabl becom more import if you 
want to specif target certain famili structures, provid the 
argument basi for the similar program of the child care tax 
credit and the child tax credit, (also list in tabl 1 & 2). 

the incom earn tax credit (ietc), in it current form, be 
consid by some studi to be ineffect without a signific 
increas in size [26]. thi same studi also make note of the great 
capac for fraud open by such a program. Of the inform in 
tabl 1 and 2 none of the list famili structur would receiv an 
incom earn tax credit, though, a ‘one adult, one infant family’ in 
dauphin county, pennsylvania, would receiv a payment of $34 from the 
program everi month, cover 1% of the cost of live [2]. practically, 
although we have case of state a well a countri with high 
minimum wages, we do not have the same rang of inform relat to 
the incom earn tax credit make discuss around it speculative. 

david stockman, a propon of the ietc, note that minimum wage 
worker should also see machineri a competit to their employment. It 
be not enough for them to be profit but for them to be more 
profit than mechan replac [27]. though the long term 
effect of thi be inconclusive, the gener trend of mechan 
replac do provid an analog [28]. In a way, the ietc be the 
welfar equival of rais the minimum wage along great 
restrict on technolog replacement, so a comparison could also be 
make between such a proposit and the ietc a it stand for those 
want to consid thi further. 

beyond a comparison of the minimum wage and ietc, however, thi 
discuss also rais gener question about technolog growth. 
technolog be a major driver of econom growth, with machin ideal 
replac the most primit task while the human popul becom 
more product through educ specialisation. If educ be not 
suffici supported, however, a number of peopl might find 
themselv unskil and unemployed. historically, the former have be 
the most preval in the long term while the latter be the case in the 
short term. 

compar to increas the ietc or minimum wage which both, either 
independ or combined, fulfil the moral right to a default state of 
choice, the posit of laissez fair econom do not necessarili do 
so. 

laissez fair support claim the market equilibrium be the best 
measur of employment; however, thi be base on free choic and high 
competition. with 4 million job avail for 9 million unemployed, 
(discount discourag workers), the market may appear more evenli 
balanc than it actual be [29, 30, 31]. while anyon without 
disabl can perform the mostli unskil labour of minimum wage work, 
mani of those 4 million job requir technic skill a minimum wage 
worker may have financi difficulti obtain [32, 33]. A sizabl 
surplu in unemployed, unskil labour and the low bargain power 
thi creates, amidst the choic compromis coercion of necessity, be 
the main argument against a laissez fair approach’ assumpt of 
near-perfect competition. 

In a typic supply-demand scenario the gradient of a curv relat 
to elasticity, (an elast of labour suppli from employe and an 
elast of labour demand from employ respectively). generally, 
elast be increas by everi altern choic an individu has. 
elasticity, therefore, act a a practic measur for choic in the 
market and hence, in the context of the aforement notion of 
meritocrat fairness, reflect both a practic and ethic reality. If 
worker be under the threat of poverty, they be more pressur into 
find a job and their elast be decreased. low labour suppli 
elast mean that if wage be cut by a give amount then the 
number of peopl who continu seek employ declin by a far 
small margin. given the surplu of peopl seek employment, 
compani hardli have to compet with one anoth for unskil worker 
a they might have to in technic field [34]. In addition, there be 
littl percept of competit for the most elit of the unskil 
employees. 

although the best and brightest of softwar engin might see 
except offer due to their even more limit number, there be no 
such opportun for the savant cashier, mitig pressur from 
intern competit or an effici wage motiv toward increas 
minimum wage worker pay naturally. combin these factor with an 
inelast labour supply, mani compani might prefer to low their 
employees’ pay in spite of a rel trivial decreas in the number 
of unskil worker who would seek employ with them. the 
implic of thi be imperfect competition, place doubt upon 
simplifi supply-demand model analysi [35, 36]. 

elast also exist for employers; with technolog altern 
to worker act a an extra choic for employers. therefore, 
reduct to their access to technolog replac either through 
direct regul or indirectli through the ietc could be see a a 
decreas to the long term elast of labour demand. elast be 
often regard a positive, a it permit natur market forc of 
chang to chang behaviour to more effici practic for both the 
employ and employee. To thi end, a consequentialist may view free 
choic in a marketplac posit beyond it percept either a a 
right or a distribut justice. It should also be note that although 
most critic of meritocraci condemn it propens for inequ and 
relianc on the natur state in the case of the minimum wage, it 
interest align with the egalitarian against survivalist compulsion. 

beyond technolog replacement, under deregulation, offshor job 
could also pose a similar threat though nation interest in thi 
matter aren’t necessarili a moral prioriti [37]. support of 
deregul might also make the claim that despit ani regul 
multin migrat be a phenomenon too power to be combated, 
with regul onli worsen the phenomenon. 

Of the three altern minimum wage advoc should aim to set a 
wage near where a hypothet ideal equilibrium would place it if 
there be high elast or a lack of surviv pressur allow for 
exploitation. with thi minimum wage near the product wage and 
conveni exceed the live wage, the moral oblig to remov 
the survivalist restrict to choic a well a the consequentialist 
consider of the aggreg economi will both be satisfied. 

the ietc would counteract the pressur of necess in a more 
indirect manner, also potenti steepen employe elast 
alongsid an alreadi steep elast for employees. while if advoc 
for thi model be right it will also fulfil our initi moral dilemmas, 
less practic studi exist on the ietc than the minimum wage; though 
there be littl mutual exclus territori between the two. finally, 
laissez fair posit gener neglect the practic manifest of 
these moral hurdl and their effect on imperfect competition. although 
the laissez fair model be more ineffect in the unskil labour 
market, advoc still claim it be prefer to govern 
intervention. 

verdict 

there be sound reason to consid an increas to the minimum wage. 
with product estim exceed the live wage despit it 
variation, not onli be a right or justic base analysi satisfi by 
such a polici but so too be the posit of a consequentialist concern 
for the aggreg economy. 

specif for the case of dauphin counti and the whole of king 
county, a suggest $12 minimum wage would cover the cost of an 
individu while a $15 minimum wage would also cover cost for most two 
incom household and some singl incom household while the 
product wage project of $18.42 would cover cost for more, but 
still not all, remain singl incom families. even if we accept some 
critics’ claim about the econom polici institute’ deflat methods, 
a product wage of $14.40 be supported, with these product 
wage mark the high minimum wage which remain profit for 
employers. 

alongsid the proposit of a minimum wage increas be altern 
argument suggest for the ietc and deregulation, (with consider 
of an increas in educ hold no direct conflict to ani of these). 
In analys these models, some theoris profit be not enough, 
rais further avenu for moral inquiry.
