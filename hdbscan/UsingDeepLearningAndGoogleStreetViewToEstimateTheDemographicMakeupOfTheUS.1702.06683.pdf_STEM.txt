the unit state spend more than $1b each year on initi such a the amer- 

ican commun survey (acs), a labor-intens door-to-door studi that measur 

statist relat to race, gender, education, occupation, unemployment, and other 

demograph factor 1. although a comprehens sourc of data, the lag between 

demograph chang and their appear in the ac can exceed half a decade. As 

digit imageri becom ubiquit and machin vision techniqu improve, autom 

data analysi may provid a cheaper and faster alternative. here, we present a method 

that determin socioeconom trend from 50 million imag of street scenes, gath- 

ere in 200 american citi by googl street view cars. use deep learning-bas 

comput vision techniques, we determin the make, model, and year of all motor 

vehicl encount in particular neighborhoods. data from thi censu of motor vehi- 

cles, which enumer 22m automobil in total (8% of all automobil in the us), be 

use to accur estim income, race, education, and vote patterns, with single- 

precinct resolution. (the averag US precinct contain approxim 1000 people.) 

the result associ be surprisingli simpl and powerful. for instance, if the

number of sedan encount dure a 15-minut drive through a citi be high than 

the number of pickup trucks, the citi be like to vote for a democrat dure the next 

presidenti elect (88% chance); otherwise, it be like to vote republican (82%). 

our result suggest that autom system for monitor demograph trend may 

effect complement labor-intens approaches, with the potenti to detect trend 

with fine spatial resolution, in close to real time. 

for thousand of years, ruler and policymak have survey nation popul in order to 

collect demograph statistics. In the unit states, the most detail such studi be the american 

commun survey (acs), which be perform by the US censu bureau at a cost of approxim 

$250m per year 2. each year, ac report demograph result for all citi and counti with a 

popul of 65,000 or more 3. however, due to the labor-intens data gather process, small 

region be interrog less frequently, everi three or five years. thus, the most recent edit of 

the ac (the 2015 release) contain data collect in 2011 for some zip code and 2015 for others, 

reflect a half decad lag between some ac result and current demographics. moreover, the 

date of data collect for two region can differ by up to five years, limit the reliabl of so- 

cioeconom comparisons. taken together, such lag can imped effect policymaking, suggest 

that the develop of altern and complementari approach would be desirable. 

In recent years, comput method have emerg a a promis tool for tackl difficult 

problem in social science. for instance, antenucci et al. have predict unemploy rate from 

twitter 4; michel et al. have analyz cultur use larg quantiti of text from book 5; and 

blumenstock et al. use mobil phone metadata to predict poverti rate in rwanda 6. these 

result suggest that socioeconom studies, too, might be facilit by comput methods, 

with the ultim potenti of analyz demograph trend in great detail, in real time, and at a 

fraction of the cost. 

2 



here, we show that it be possibl to determin socioeconom statist and polit prefer 

in the US popul by combin publicli avail data with machin learn methods. our 

procedur onli requir labor-intens survey data for a hand of citi to creat nationwid 

estimates. thi approach allow for more frequent measur of demograph inform at a 

high spatial resolution. 

specifically, we analyz 50 million imag take by googl street view car a they drove through 

200 cities, neighborhood-by-neighborhood and street-by-street. We focu on the motor vehicl 

encount dure thi journey becaus over 90% of american household own a motor vehicl 7, 

and becaus their choic of automobil be influenc by dispar demograph factor includ 

household needs, person preferences, and econom wherewith 8. 

We demonstr that, by deploy a machin vision framework base on deep learn - specif- 

ically, convolut neural network - it be possibl to not onli recogn vehicl in a complex 

street scene, but to reliabl determin a wide rang of vehicl characteristics, includ make, 

model, and year. wherea mani challeng task in machin vision (such a photo tagging) be 

easi for humans, the fine-grain object recognit task we perform here be one that few peopl 

could accomplish for even a hand of images. differ between car can be impercept to 

an untrain person; for instance, some car model can have subtl chang in tail light (e.g., 2007 

honda accord vs. 2008 honda accord) or grill (e.g., 2001 ford f-150 supercrew LL vs. 2011 

ford f-150 supercrew svt). nevertheless, our system be abl to classifi automobil into one of 

2,657 categories, take 0.2 second per vehicl imag to do so. while it classifi the automobil 

in 50 million imag in 2 weeks, a human expert, assum 10 second per image, would take more 

than 15 year to perform the same task. use the classifi motor vehicl in each neighborhood, 

we infer a wide rang of demograph statistics, socioeconom attributes, and polit prefer

fig. 1. We perform a vehicular censu of 200 citi in the unit state use 50 million googl street view images. In each image, we detect car 

with comput vision algorithm base on deform part model (dpm) and count an estim 22 million cars. We then use convolut neural 

network (cnn) to categor the detect vehicl into one of 2,657 class of cars. for each type of car, we have metadata such a the make, model, 

year, bodi type and price of the car in 2012.

of it residents. 

In the first step of our analysis, we collect 50 million googl street view imag from 3,068 

zip code and 39,286 vote precinct span 200 US citi (fig. 1). use these imag and 

annot photo of cars, our object recognit algorithm (a “deform part model” 9) learn 

to automat local motor vehicl on the street 10 (see methods). We success detect 

22 million distinct vehicles, compris 32% of all the vehicl in the 200 citi we studied, and 

8% of all vehicl in the unit states. after local each vehicle, we deploy convolut 

neural network 11,12, the most success deep learn algorithm to date for object classification, 

to determin the make, model, bodi type, and year of each vehicl (fig. 1). specifically, we be 

abl to classifi each vehicl into one of 2,657 fine-grain categories, which form a nearli exhaust 

list of all visual distinct automobil sell in the US sinc 1990 (fig. 1). for instance, our model 

accur identifi car (identifi 95% of such vehicl in the test data), van (83%), minivan 

(91%), suv (86%), and pickup truck (82%). see fig. s1. 

use the result motor vehicl data, we estim demograph statist and voter prefer 

a follows. for each geograph region we examin (city, zip code, or precinct), we count the 

number of vehicl of each make and model that be identifi in imag from that region. We 

also includ addit featur such a aggreg count for variou vehicl type (trucks, vans, 

suvs, etc.), the averag price and fuel efficiency, and the overal densiti of vehicl in the region 

(see methods). 

We then partit our dataset, by county, into two subset (fig. 2). the first be a “train 

set”, compris all region which lie mostli in a counti whose name start with ‘a’,‘b’, or ‘c’ (such 

a ada county, baldwin county, cabarru county, etc.). thi train set encompass 35 of the 

200 cities, ∼ 15% of the zip codes, and ∼ 12% of the precinct in our data. the second be a “test 

5 



fig. 2. We use all the citi in counti start with ‘a’ and ‘b’ (shown in purpl on the map) to train a model estim socioeconom data from car 

attributes. use thi model, we estim demograph variabl at the zip code level for all the citi show in green. We show actual vs. predict map 

for the percentag of black, asian and white peopl in seattle, WA (i-iii), the percentag of peopl with less than a high school degre in milwaukee, WI 

(iv) and the percentag of peopl with graduat degre in milwaukee, WI (v). (vi) map the median household incom in tampa, fl. the ground truth 

valu be map on the left column and our estim result be on the right column. We accur local zip code with the high and low 

concentr of each demograph variabl such a the three zip code in eastern seattl with high concentr of caucasians, one northern zip 

code in milwauke with highli educ inhabitants, and the least wealthi zip code in southern tampa.

set”, compris all region in counti start with the letter ‘d’ through ‘z’ (such a dakota 

county, maricopa county, yolo county). We use the test set to evalu the model that result 

from the train process. 

use US censu and presidenti elect vote data for region in our train set, we train 

a logist regress model to estim race and educ levels, and a ridg regress model to 

estim incom and voter prefer on the basi of the collect of vehicl see in a region. thi 

simpl linear model be suffici to identifi posit and neg associ between the presenc 

of specif vehicl (such a hondas) and particular demograph (i.e., the percentag of asians) 

or voter prefer (i.e., democrat). 

our model detect strong associ between vehicl distribut and dispar socioeconom 

trends. for instance, sever studi have show that peopl of asian descent be more like to drive 

asian car 13, a result we observ here a well: the two brand that most strongli indic an asian 

neighborhood be honda and toyotas. car manufactur by chrysler, buick and oldsmobil be 

posit associ with african american neighborhoods, which be again consist with exist 

research 14. and vehicl like pickup trucks, volkswagen and aston martin be indic of 

mostli caucasian neighborhoods. see fig. s2. 

In some cases, the result associ can be easili appli in practice. for example, the 

vehicular featur that be most strongli associ with democrat precinct be sedans, wherea 

republican precinct be most strongli associ with extended-cab pickup truck (a truck with 

rear-seat access). We found that by drive through a citi for 15 minut while count sedan and 

pickup trucks, it be possibl to reliabl determin whether the citi vote democrat or republican: 

if there be more sedans, it probabl vote democrat (88% chance) and if there be more pickup 

trucks, it probabl vote republican (82% chance). see fig. 3(a)iii. 

7 



As a result, it be possibl to appli the associ extract from our train set to vehicl 

data from our test set region in order to gener estim of demograph statist and voter 

preferences, achiev high spatial resolut in over 160 cities. To be clear, no ac or vote data 

for ani region in the test set be use to creat the estim for the test set. 

To confirm the accuraci of our demograph estimates, we begin by compar them with 

actual ac data, city-by-city, across all 165 test set cities. We found a strong correl between 

our result and ac valu for everi demograph statist we examined. (the r-valu for the 

correl were: median household income, r = 0.82; percentag of asians, r = 0.87; percentag 

of blacks, r = 0.81; percentag of whites, r = 0.77; percentag of peopl with a graduat degree, 

r = 0.70; percentag of peopl with a bachelor’ degree, r = 0.58, percentag of peopl with some 

colleg degree, r = 0.62, percentag of peopl with a high school degree, r = 0.65; percentag of 

peopl with less than a high school degree, r = 0.54). see fig. s3, S4 and s5. taken together, 

these result show our abil to estim demograph parameters, a assess by the acs, use 

the autom identif of vehicl in googl street view data. 

although our city-level estim serv a a proof-of-principle, zip code-level ac data provid 

a much more fine-grain portrait of constituencies. To investig the accuraci of our method 

at zip code resolution, we compar our zip code-by-zip code estim to those gener by the 

acs, confirm a close correspond between our find and ac values. for instance, when 

we look close at the data for seattle, we found that our estim of the percentag of peopl 

in each zip code who be caucasian close match the valu obtain by the ac (r = 0.84, 

p < 2e − 7). the result for asian (r = 0.77, p = 1e − 6) and african american (r = 0.58, 

p = 7e− 4) be similar. overall, our estim accur determin that seattle, washington be 

69% caucasian, with african american mostli resid in a few southern zip code (fig. 2, i,ii). 

8 



As anoth example, we estim educ background in milwaukee, wisconsin zip codes, 

accur determin the fraction of the popul with less than a high school degre (r = 0.70 

p = 8e − 5), with a bachelor’ degre (r = 0.83, p < 1e − 7), and with postgradu educ 

(r = 0.82, p < 1e− 7). We also accur determin the overal concentr of highli educ 

inhabit near the city’ north east border (fig. 2, iv, v). similarly, our incom estim close 

match those of the ac in tampa, florida (r = 0.87, p < 1e− 7). the low incom zip code, at 

the southern tip, be readili apparent. 

while the ac do not collect voter prefer data, our autom machin learn procedur 

can infer such prefer use associ between vehicl and the voter that surround them. 

To confirm the accuraci of our voter prefer estimates, we begin by compar them with the 

vote result of the 2008 presidenti election, city-by-city, across all 165 test set cities. We found a 

veri strong correl between our estim and actual voter prefer (r = 0.73, p << 1e− 7). 

see fig. s5. these result confirm the abil of our approach to accur estim voter behavior 

dure a presidenti election. 

while city-level data provid a gener picture, precinct-level voter prefer identifi trend 

within a particular city. By compar our precinct-by-precinct estim to the 2008 presidenti 

elect results, we found that our estim continu to close match the ground truth data. for 

instance, in milwaukee, wisconsin, a veri democrat citi with 311 precincts, we correctli classifi 

264 precinct (85% accuraci (fig. 3,b)). most notably, we accur determin that there be a few 

republican precinct in the south, west and northeastern border of the city. similarly, in gilbert, 

arizona, a republican city, we correctli classifi 58 out of 60 precinct (97% accuracy), identifi 

one out of the two small democrat precinct in the citi (fig. 3,b). and in birmingham alabama, 

a citi that be 23% republican, we correctli classifi 87 out of the 105 precinct (83% accuracy).

fig. 3. (a) i. and ii map the actual and predict percentag of peopl who vote for barack obama in the 2008 presidenti elect (r=0.74). iii. map 

the ratio of detect pickup truck to sedan in the 165 citi in our test set. As can be see from the map, the ratio be veri low in democrat citi 

such a those in the east coast and high in republican citi such a those in texa and wyoming. (b) show actual vs. predict voter affili for 

variou citi in our test set at the precinct level. democrat precinct be show in blue and republican precinct be show in red. our model correctli 

classifi casper, wyom a a republican citi and lo angeles, california a a democrat city. We accur predict that milwaukee, wisconsin be 

a democrat citi except for a few republican precinct in the southern, western and north eastern border of the city. 

10 



overall, there be a strong correl between our estim and actual elector outcom at the 

single-precinct level (r = 0.57, p < 1e− 7). 

these result illustr the abil of our machin learn algorithm to accur estim both 

demograph statist and voter prefer use a larg databas of googl street view images. 

they also suggest that our demograph estim be accur at single-precinct level, which be 

high than the fine resolut avail for yearli ac data. use our approach, zip code or 

precinct-level survey data collect for a few citi can be use to automat provid up-to-d 

demograph inform for mani american cities. 

thus, we find that the applic of fulli autom comput vision method to publicli 

avail street scene can inexpens determin social, economic, and polit trend in neigh- 

borhood across america. By collect survey for a few citi and infer data for other use 

our model, we can quickli determin demograph trends. 

As self-driv car with onboard camera becom increasingli widespread, the type of data we 

use - footag of neighborhood from vehicle-mount camera - be like to becom increasingli 

ubiquitous. for instance, tesla vehicl current take a mani imag a be studi here everi 

singl day. It be also import to note that similar data can be obtained, albeit at a slow pace, 

use low-tech methods: for instance, by walk around a target neighborhood with a camera and 

a notepad. thus, street scene stand in contrast to the massiv textual corpu present use in 

mani comput social scienc studies, which be typic constrain by such seriou privaci 

and copyright concern that individu research cannot obtain the raw data underli ani give 

publish analysis. 

expand our object recognit beyond vehicl 15, incorpor global imag featur 16–19, 

other type of imagery, such a satellit imag 20 and social network 4 could consider strengthen 

11 



the present approach. although such method could be power resourc for both research and 

policymakers, their progress will rais import ethic concerns; It be clear that public data should 

not be use to compromis reason privaci expect of individu citizens, and thi will be a 

central concern move forward. In the future, such autom method could lead to estim that 

be accur updat in real-time, dramat improv upon the time resolut of a manual 

survey. thi might allow earli detect of import socioeconom trends, such a recessions, 

give policymak the abil to enact more effect measures. 

materi and method 

here, we describ our methodolog for data collection, car detection, car classif and de- 

mograph inference. some of these method be partial develop in an earli paper 10 which 

serv a a proof of concept focu on a limit set of predict (e.g. per caput carbon emission, 

massachusett depart of vehicl registr data, incom segregation). our work build on 

these method to show that income, race, educ level and vote pattern can be predict from 

car in googl street view images. In the section below, we discu our dataset and methodolog 

in more detail. 

dataset while learn to recogn automobiles, a model need to be train with mani imag of 

vehicl annot with categori labels. To thi end, we use amzaon mechan turk to gather a 

dataset of label car imag obtain from edmunds.com, cars.com and craigslist.org. our dataset 

consist of 2,657 visual distinct car categories, cover all commonli use automobil in the 

unit state produc from 1990 onward. We refer to these imag a product shot images. We 

also hire expert to annot a subset of our googl street view images. the annot includ 

a bound box around each car in the imag and the type of car contain in the box. We partit 

12 



the imag into training, validation, and test sets. In addit to our annot images, we gather 

50 million googl street view imag from 200 cities, sampl gp point everi 25 meters. We 

captur 6 imag per gp point, correspond to differ camera rotations. each street view 

imag have dimens 860 by 573 pixel and a horizont field of view of approxim 90 degrees. 

sinc the horizont field of view be larg than the chang in viewpoint between the 6 imag per 

gp point, the imag have some overlap content. In total, we collect 50,881,098 googl 

street view imag for our 200 cities. they be primarili acquir between june and decemb 

of 2013 with a small fraction (3.1%) obtain in novemb and decemb of 2014. see support 

inform for more detail on the data collect process. 

car detect In comput vision, detect be the task of local object within an image, and 

be most commonli frame a predict the (x, y, width, height) coordin of an axis-align 

bound box around an object of interest. the central challeng for our work be design an 

object detector that be 1) fast enough to run on 50 million imag within a reason amount of 

time, and 2) accur enough to be use for demograph inference. our comput resourc 

consist of 4 tesla k40 gpu and 200 2.1 ghz cpu cores. As discuss in 10, we be will to 

trade a coupl of percent in accuraci for a gain in efficiency. thus, instead of use state-of-the-art 

object detect algorithm such a 21, we turn to the previou state of the art in object detection, 

deform part model (dpms) 22. 

for dpms, there be two main paramet that influenc the run time and performance, 

which be the number of compon and the number of part in the model. tab. S2 provid 

an analysi of the performance/tim tradeoff on our data, measur on the valid set. base 

on thi analysis, use a dpm with a singl compon and eight part strike the right balanc 

between perform and efficiency, allow u to detect car on all 50 million imag in two weeks. 

13 



In contrast, the best perform paramet would have take two month to run and onli increas 

averag precis (ap) by 4.5. 

As discuss in 10, we also introduc a prior on the locat and size of predict bound 

box and use it to improv detect accuracy. incorpor thi prior into our detect pipelin 

improv AP on the valid set by 1.92 at a neglig cost. fig. s6(b) visual thi prior. the 

output of our detect system be a set of bound box and score where each score indic the 

likelihood of it associ box contain a car. 

We convert these score into estim probabl via isoton regress 23. isoton regres- 

sion learn a probabl for each detect score subject to a monoton constraint. concretely, 

after sort n valid detect score s1, . . . , sn such that si ≤ si+1, and with yi a binari vari- 

abl denot whether detect i be correct (ha jaccard similar of at least 0.5 with a ground 

truth car bound box), isoton regress solv the follow optim problem: 

minim 
p1,...,pn 

∑n 
i=1 ‖yi − pi‖22 

subject to pi ≤ pi+1, 1 ≤ i ≤ n− 1 
(1) 

given a new detect score, a probabl be estim by linear interpol of the pi. We plot 

the learn map from detect score to probabl in fig. s7a. 

We make a number of addit design choic while train and run thi car detector 

in practice. first, we onli detect car that be 50 pixel or great in width and height. the 

output of our detector be fed into the input of our car classifier. thus, detect car need to have 

suffici resolut and detail to enabl the classifi to differenti between 2,657 categori of 

automobiles. similarly, we train our detector use car with great than 50 pixel width and 

height. our dpm be train on a subset of 13,105 bound boxes, reduc train time from a 

week (projected) to 15 hours. use thi subset instead of all ground truth bound box result 

14 



in neglig chang in accuracy. 

We report number use a detect threshold of -1.5 (appli befor the locat prior). At test 

time, after appli the locat prior (which lower detect decis values), we use a detect 

threshold of -2.3. thi reduc the averag number of bound box per imag to be classifi 

from 7.9 to 1.5 while onli degrad AP by 0.6 (66.1 to 65.5) and decreas the probabl mass of 

all detect in an imag from 0.477 to 0.462 (a 3% drop). fig. S8 show exampl of car detect 

use our model. bound box with car have high estim probabl wherea the opposit 

be true for those contain no cars. the AP of our final model (measur on the test set) be 65.7, 

and it precis recal curv be visual in fig. s7b. To calcul chanc perform we use a 

uniform sampl of bound box great than 50 pixel in width and height. 

car classif our pipeline, describ in 10, classifi automobil into one of 2,657 visual 

distinct categori with an accuraci of 33.27%. We use a convolut neural network 24 follow 

the architectur of 12 to categor cars. cnns, like other supervis machin learn methods, 

perform best when train on data from a similar distribut a the test data (in our case, street 

view images). however, the cost of annot street view photo make it infeas to collect 

enough imag to train our cnn onli use thi source. thus, we use a combin of street view 

and the more plenti product shot imag a train data. We make a number of modif 

to the tradit cnn train procedur to good fit our setting. 

first, take inspir from domain adaptation, we approxim the weight method of 

daumé 25 by duplic each street view imag 10 time dure training. thi roughli equal 

the number of street view and product shot imag use for training, prevent the classifi from 

overfit on product shot images. 

anoth signific differ between product shot and street view imag be imag resolution: 

15 



car in product shot imag occupi a much larg number of pixel in the image. To compens 

for thi difference, we first measur the distribut of bound box resolut in street view 

imag use for training. then, dure the train procedure, we dynam downsiz each 

input imag accord to thi distribut befor rescal it to fit the input dimens of the 

cnn. resolut be parameter by the geometr mean of the bound box width and height, 

and the probabl distribut be give a a histogram over 35 differ such resolutions. the 

larg resolut be 256, which be the input resolut of the cnn. 

one further challeng while classifi street view imag be that our input consist of noisi 

detect bound boxes. thi stand in contrast to what would otherwis be the default for 

train a classifi – ground truth bound box that be tight around each car. To tackl thi 

challenge, we first measur the distribut of the intersect over union (iou) overlap between 

bound box produc by our car detector and ground truth box in the valid data. then, 

we randomli sampl the street view imag region input into the cnn accord to thi iou 

distribution. thi simul detect a input to the cnn and ensur that the classifi be 

train with similar imag to those we encount dure testing. 

At test time, we input each detect bound box into the cnn and obtain softmax probabl 

for each car categori through a singl forward pass. In practice, we onli keep the top 20 predictions, 

sinc store a full 2, 657-dimension float point vector for each bound box be prohibit 

expens in term of storage. On average, these top 20 predict account for 85.5% of the softmax 

layer activations’ probabl mass. We also note that, after extens code optim to make 

thi classif step a fast a possible, we be primarili limit by the time spent read imag 

from disk, especi when use multipl gpu to perform classification. At the most fine-grain 

level, classifi into one of 2, 657 classes, we achiev a surprisingli high accuraci of 33.27%. We 

16 



classifi the make and model of the car with 66.38% and 51.83% accuraci respectively. and we 

determin whether it be manufactur in or outsid of the u.s. with 87.71% accuracy. 

We show confus matrix for classifi the make, model, bodi type and manufactur 

countri of the car (fig. s9a,b,c,d). bodi type misclassif tend to occur among similar 

categories. for example, the most frequent misclassif for “coupe” be “sedan”, and the most 

frequent misclassif for truck with a regular cab be truck with an extend cab. On the other 

hand, there be no two make (such a honda and mercedes-benz) that be more visual similar 

than others. thus, when a car’ make be misclassified, it be mostli to a more popular make. the 

same be true for the manufactur country. for instance, most error at the countri level occur 

by misclassifi the manufactur countri a either “japan” or “usa”, the two most popular 

countries. due to the larg number of classes, the onli clear pattern in the model-level confus 

matrix be a strong diagonal, indic of our correct predictions. 

demograph estim In all of our demograph estim we use the follow set of 88 car-

to u by the author of 26 and consist of precinct-level vote count for barack obama and john 

mccain. for all of our analyses, we ignor vote cast for ani other person, i.e. the count of total 

vote be determin sole by vote for obama and mccain. 

To perform our experiments, we partit the zip codes, precinct and citi in our dataset 

into train and test set a discuss in the main text, train a model on the train set and 

predict on the test set. We use a ridg regress model for incom and voter affili esti- 

mation. for race and educ estim we use logist regress to util structur inher 

in the data. specifically, for each region, sum the percentag of peopl with each of the 5 

possibl educ background should yield 100%. similarly, sum the percentag of peopl 

from each race in a particular locat should result in 100%. In all case we train 5 model 

use 5-fold cross valid to select the regular parameter. our final model be the averag 

of the 5 train models. We normal the featur to have zero mean and unit standard deviat 

(paramet determin on the train set). We also clip predict to stay within the rang 

of the train data, prevent our estim from have extrem values. In all experiments, we 

restrict the region of interest to be one with a popul of at least 500 and at least 50 detect 

cars. 

We comput the probabl of vote democrat/republican condit on be in a citi with 

more pickup truck than sedan a follows. let r be the ratio of pickup truck to sedans. We would 

like to estim P (democrat|r > 1) and P (republican|r < 1). 

P (democrat|r > 1) = P (democrat, r > 1) 
P (r > 1) (2) 

P (republican|r < 1) = P (republican, r < 1) 
P (r < 1) (3) 

We estim P (democrat, r > 1), P (republican, r < 1), P (r > 1) and P (r < 1) a follows. let 

Sd = {ci} be the set of citi with more vote for barack obama than mitt romney. let Ss = {cj}

imag data 

In thi section, we provid addit detail on the methodolog use to acquir annot imag 

data for our study. thi data be requir for two steps: to train comput vision model that 

detect and classifi cars, and to appli these model on street view imag of citi of interest. thi 

section proce by detail how we obtain a comprehens list of car categories, collect a 

larg number of “product shot” imag use to train our car classifier, gather 50 million street 

view imag use in our analysis, and annot a subset for train and verifi our model. We 

conclud with a complet descript of the acquir metadata for each car category. 

car categori the first step in assembl a dataset of annot car imag be group car 

into set of visual indistinguish classes. for example, while a 2003 honda accord coup ex 

and a 2005 honda accord coup l special edit be manufactur in differ year and have 

differ trim (ex v l special edition), their exterior look identical. thus, these two car should 

be group into the same class. ideally, the set of class would contain everi type of car in common 

use. 27 present a workflow to perform thi group at minim cost. 

We first retriev an initi list of 15,213 car type from the car websit edmunds.com, collect 

in august 2012. thi form a gener complet list of all car commonli use in the unit state 

that be produc from 1990 onward. throughout thi document we use the term “car” to refer 

to all type of automobil with four wheels, includ sedans, coupes, trucks, vans, suvs, etc., but 

not includ e.g. semi-truck or buses. 

As a first step toward group these categori into a small number of visual distinct classes, 

use amazon mechan turk (amt) to determin whether certain pair of the 15k car type be 

24 



distinguishable. within each task we give six pair of categori and the user be prompt to 

determin 1) if the two class have ani visual differences, and 2) if they be different, on which 

part they differed. within each task we have two pair for which we alreadi knew the correct 

answer (a determin by hand), and we requir that each user on amt get the answer for those 

pair correct in order to count their response. photo for thi task be acquir from the hand 

of exampl imag that edmunds.com provides. the author clean up the data by hand, result 

in 3,141 categori of cars, with extrem subtl differ between these fine-grain categories. 

product shot imag after assembl a list of categori consist of visual indistinguish 

set of cars, we collect train imag for each class. these be annot imag contain the 

car of interest. A commonli use method in the comput vision commun be to perform web 

imag search for each categori and cleanup the queri imag by hand to ensur that they contain 

the categori of interest 28. however, the larg number of class in our dataset make it infeas 

to manual perform thi task. 

In order to collect train data in a scalabl manner, we leverag e-commerc websites. We 

crawl imag from cars.com and craigslist.org, two site where user be heavili incentiv to 

list the exact type of car they be selling. while these user be not necessarili car experts, they 

have detail knowledg about their own car. In the case of cars.com, car categori be repres 

in a veri structur format. thus, after establish a map between our categori and their 

format, we be abl to simpli scrape imag for each category. for craigslist.org, we scrap post 

from the “cars+trucks” list of a varieti of u.s. regions, and pars the post titl to determin 

which of our categori the post belong to. sinc these imag be from websit with the purpos 

of sell cars, we call them “product shot” images. 

some product shot imag show the car from an extrem close-up angle. other onli depict 

25 



the interior of the car. sinc our purpos be to recogn car in googl street view images, our 

train set should have car from view point that can appear in street view. thus, we filter 

out imag which do not contain one central automobile, with it exterior depict in it entirety. 

sinc thi task be rel simple, we crowdsourc it via amt, use 29 for qualiti control. 

In the final annot step, we collect a bound box (an axis-align rectangl tightli en- 

close the object of interest) around the car in each image. thi ensur that our car classifi be 

train use visual inform onli from the car itself and not extran background. bound 

box be collect use the label methodolog and UI of 30, but without the step for deter- 

mine if there be more than one car in the image. that step be not necessari becaus the output 

of the previou amt task ensur that each imag contain exactli one promin car. 

sinc some type of car have mani more imag than others, we stop annot imag for 

each categori after collect 200 label photos. our goal be to build a model that can recogn a 

mani type of car a possible. given our limit budget, it be more import to collect annot 

for categori with few label imag than for those with mani annot photos. 

In the final step, we remov categori that do not have at least three dispar sourc of data 

per class. We defin one sourc of data a one post on ani of the websit we used. thi process 

result in our final dataset consist of 2,657 car categories. 

street view imag thi section outlin our methodolog for collect approxim 50 million 

googl street view imag and annot a subset of them to train our car detector and classifier. 

the process includ select gp (latitude, longitude) point of interest, collect imag for each 

of these points, enclos car in a subset of these imag with bound boxes, and annot the 

type of car contain in each box. the final step be perform by car experts. 

26 



select gp point befor gather googl street view images, we first have to determin 

which geograph (latitude, longitude) point we want to collect photo for. We call each latitude, 

longitud pair a gp point. first, we select 200 citi for our analysis. these be the two larg 

citi in each state and the next 100 larg citi in the unit state a determin by popul 

(see tab. S1 for a complet list). for each city, we sampl potenti point of interest within a 

squar grid of length 20km, center on one point know to lie within the city. there be a 25 meter 

space between points. We revers geocod each of these point to determin whether they lie 

within the citi of interest and how far away they be to the near road. We keep all point within 

12.5 meter of the near road. thi process do not provid full coverag for a hand of cities. 

thus, we augment these point with gp sampl from road data provid by the u.s. censu 

bureau 31. 

sampl imag from street view for each gp point, we attempt to sampl 6 imag from 

googl street view, one for each of 6 differ camera rotations. thi be do via browser emu- 

lation and requir onli the latitud and longitud of each point. however, we cannot immedi 

use photo retriev with thi process a they appear warped: an equirectangular project be ap- 

pli to imag in a spheric panorama. We appli the revers transform befor all subsequ 

task use the images. 

annot on amazon mechan turk while our product shot imag can be use to train 

a car classifier, we cannot util them to train a car detector: a model that learn to local all 

the car in an image. thi be becaus all of our product shot imag includ onli one promin 

featur car in each image. 

use the system of 30, we collect bound box annot in a subset of our street view 

27 



images. To increas the effici of thi process, we first filter out all imag contain either 

zero or more than 10 car via amt, use the same interfac and pipelin describ in the section 

pertain to product shot images. A randomli select subset of 399,331 street view imag be 

annot in thi manner. We found that 26.6% of imag be annot a have no visibl car 

and 12.4% have more than 10 cars. the distribut of the number of car in the remain imag 

be show in fig. s6a. 

fig. s6b plot bound box size versu location. car locat closer to the bottom of the imag 

tend to occupi more space than those near the top. thi agre with the intuit that car low 

in the imag be closer to the camera and therefor appear larger. similarly, fig. s6c show a 

heatmap of bound box locat for car in street view. most automobil be locat near the 

horizon line becaus that part of the imag occupi more 3D space, i.e., more space in the real 

world. there be a sharp dropoff in the distribut of car abov the horizon line. 

expert class annot To learn to recogn automobil in street view images, a classifi 

need to be train with car from these images. To thi end, we label a subset of the bound 

box from street view imag with the type of car contain in them. thi annot data also 

enabl u to quantit evalu how well our classifi works. In contrast to product shot 

images, we do not know the type of car contain in street view photos. therefore, we hire 

expert car annot to label these images. expert be primarili solicit via craigslist ads. 

those who be interest in perform our task be first ask to annot car in street view 

imag for one hour, and onli those who could annot at a speed of 1 car per minut and a 

precis of at least 80% be allow to annot further. 110 expert human annot work 

for a total of approxim two thousand hour to label our images. 

veri small imag typic do not contain enough visual inform to discrimin fine level 

28 



of detail. thus, annot be onli show car in bound box whose height exceed 50 pixels. 

32.89% of bound box in our dataset fulfil thi criteria. the annot task itself proceed 

hierarchically: fig. s10 show the user interfac for the task. given a street view bound box, 

annot be first ask to select the make of the car (fig. s10(a)). they be then present 

with a list of bodi type for the chosen make (fig. s10(b)). after select the right bodi type, 

expert be show a list of option for the car model, and finally, the trim and year associ 

with each model. 

sinc differ between categori can be extrem subtl at that final level, we also provid 

exampl imag from each trim and year group for the annotator’ benefit (fig. s10(c)). At ani 

point in the process, the annot could declar that he or she do not have enough inform 

to make a selection. thus, each label at thi fine level of detail repres a confid select 

by a car expert. We collect a total of 69,562 car categori annot in thi manner. 

car metadata In addit to the images, categori labels, and bound boxes, we also have meta- 

data pertain to each class, list below. 

• make: the make of the car, of 58 possibl makes. the make we consid are: acura, AM 

general, aston martin, audi, bentley, bmw, buick, cadillac, chevrolet, chrysler, dae- 

woo, dodge, eagle, ferrari, fiat, fisker, ford, geo, gmc, honda, hummer, hyundai, in-

maybach, mazda, mclaren, mercedes-benz, mercury, mini, mitsubishi, nissan, oldsmobile, 

panoz, plymouth, pontiac, porsche, ram, rolls-royce, saab, saturn, scion, smart, subaru, 

suzuki, tesla, toyota, volkswagen, and volvo. 

• model: the model of the car, of 777 possibl models. 

29 



• year: the manufactur year of the automobile. sinc car might not chang appear 

over a small number of years, thi be typic list a a rang of years. the minimum year 

in our dataset be 1990, and the maximum year be 2014. 

• bodi type: the bodi type of the car. the 11 possibl valu are: convertible, coupe, 

hatchback, minivan, sedan, suv, truck (regular-s cab), truck (extend cab), truck (crew 

cab), wagon, and van. 

• country: the manufactur countri of the automobile. the 7 possibl countri are: eng- 

land, germany, italy, japan, south korea, sweden, and usa. 

• highway mpg: the typic mile per gallon of the car when driven on highways. If a class 

contain car with multipl years, it be annot with the highway mpg of the old car in 

the group. 

• citi mpg: the typic mile per gallon of the car when driven on non-highway streets. 

• price: the price of the car in 2012. 

thi metadata be acquir via edmunds.com in august 2012, with some miss data (a hand 

of car prices) fill in by car expert afterward. In case where a class consist of multipl visual 

indistinguish type of cars, it be annot with the metadata of the old car in the set. 

dataset summari tab. S3 provid a summari of the annot collect for both product shot 

and street view images, which we split into train (50%), valid (10%), and test (40%) set 

for use in train our car detector and classifier.

demograph data 

incom data for median household incom be obtain from the american commun survey 

(acs) 3, and be collect between 2008-2012. We use censu variabl b19013_001e, “median 

household incom in the past 12 month (in 2013 inflation-adjust dollars)”. 

educ educ data be also obtain from the ac 3. educ level be split into the 

follow mutual exclus categori (censu code in parentheses): 

• less than high school graduat (b06009_002e) 

• high school graduat (includ equivalency) (b06009_003e) 

• some colleg or associate’ degre (b06009_004e) 

• bachelor’ degre (b06009_005e) 

• graduat or profession degre (b06009_006e) 

race racial demograph data be also obtain from the ac 3, and correspond to censu 

code b02001_002e (“white alone”), b02001_003e (“black or african american alone”), and 

b02001_005e (“asian alone”). 

vote data for the 2008 u.s. presidenti elect be provid to u by the author of 26 and 

consist of precinct-level vote count for barack obama and john mccain. for all of our analyses, 

we ignor vote cast for ani other person, i.e. the count of total vote be determin sole by vote 

for obama and mccain. 

obama receiv great than 50% of the vote in most of the precinct in our dataset. thi can 

partial be attribut to the fact that he won the popular vote in the 2008 election. precinct 

31 



in our dataset be also locat in major citi which favor candid from the democrat party. 

interestingly, obama receiv an extrem high percentag (≥ 95%) of the vote in mani precinct 

in our dataset. A larg portion of these precinct have high concentr of african americans, 

who overwhelmingli vote for him dure the 2008 election.
