august 17, 2017 

A collabor between the depart of 

energy’ nation energi research scientif 

comput center (nersc), intel and five intel 

parallel comput center (ipccs) have 

result in a new big data center (bdc) that 

will work both on code modern and tackl 

real scienc challenges. 

accord to prabhat, bdc director and group 

lead for nersc data and analyt and 

servic team, “the goal of the bdc be to solv 

doe’ lead data-intens scienc problem 

at scale on the nersc cori supercomput 

(http://www.nersc.gov/users/computational- 

systems/cori/). the bdc, in collabor with 

intel and the ipccs, will test to see if the current 

hpc system can support data-intens 

workload that requir analysi of over 100 

terabyt dataset on 100,000 core or greater. 

the bdc will optim and scale the product 

data analyt and manag stack on cori. 

all bdc project will run on the nersc cori 

supercomputer. courtesi of nersc. 

“our first task will be to identifi capabl 

applic in the doe data scienc 

community, articul analyt requir 

and then develop scalabl algorithms.” prabhat 

continued. “the key be in develop algorithm 

in the context of the product stack. our multi- 

disciplinari team consist of perform 

optim and scale expert be well 

posit to enabl capabl applic on 

cori. all the optim do at the bdc will 

be open sourc and make avail to peer 

hpc center a well a the broader hpc and 

data analyt communities.” 

quincey koziol, bdc co-director and princip 

data architect at nersc, noted, “while data 

analyt be undoubtedli the rage at thi point in 

time, scalabl analyt fundament reli on 

a robust data manag infrastructure. We

will be work on examin the perform of 

parallel i/o a exercis through modern data 

analyt languag (python, R, julia) and 

machin learning/deep learn libraries.” 

joseph curley, director for intel’ code 

modern efforts, states, “we’v combin 

the bdc goal of provid softwar stack and 

access to hpc machin where the data driven 

method can be develop with our ipcc 

program. We marri the two idea togeth by 

combin research member of the commun 

with a program that we have for outreach. 

“the object of the big data center (bdc) 

come from a common desir in the industri to 

have softwar stack that can help the nersc 

user base, use data driven methods, to solv 

their larg problem at scale on the cori 

supercomputer. So one of our main goal be to 

be abl to use the supercomput hardwar to 

it full capability. some underli object 

at bdc be to build and harden the data 

analyt framework in the softwar stack so 

that develop and data scientist can use the 

cori supercomput in a product way to get 

insight from their data. our work with nersc 

and the ipcc will involv code modern 

at scale a well a creat the softwar 

environ and softwar stack need to meet 

these needs.” 

the five ipcc who be part of the bdc 

program includ the univers of california- 

berkeley, univers of california-davis, new 

york univers (nyu), oxford univers and the 

univers of liverpool. their initi bdc work 

includ thi research: 

the univers of california-berkeley team be 

work on the celest project. celest aim 

on develop highli scalabl infer 

method for extract a unifi catalog of 

object in the visibl univers from all 

avail astronomi data. 

the univers of california-davi group be 

work on develop of comput 

mechan techniqu to extract pattern from 

climat simul data. the techniqu build 

upon techniqu in inform theori to 

achiev unsupervis pattern discovery. 

the new york univers (nyu) team be 

work on extend deep learn to oper 

on irregular, graph-structur data. the 

techniqu be be appli to problem in 

high-energi physics. 

the oxford univers group be develop a 

new class of method call probabilist 

program and appli the method to 

challeng pattern and anomali detect in 

high-energi physics. the work combin 

probabilist program with deep learn 

to train larg network on cori. 

the univers of liverpool team be work on 

develop topolog method to analyz 

climat datasets. the techniqu be be 

use to extract stable, low-dimension 

manifolds, and robust pattern descriptor for 

weather patterns.

the bdc work will also benefit the larg data 

analysi and hpc communities. curley states, 

“in our ipcc program, we encourag system 

user to discov method of solv problem 

on hpc systems, document what they did, and 

teach other how to follow their methods. thi 

creat a benefici cycl of new research, 

harden the machine, develop new 

softwar stack lead to research that be more 

productive—what we call a virtuou cycle. 

“we be excit about the ipcc work in 

conjunct with the bdc becaus there will be 

peopl work on problem we never could 

have anticip and advanc human 

knowledg in way we never could have 

guessed. If you can combin thi with the bdc 

at nersc that have a larg machin like cori 

and a divers user group, you end up creat 

network of knowledg and creat scientif 

result that be unpredict wonderful.”
