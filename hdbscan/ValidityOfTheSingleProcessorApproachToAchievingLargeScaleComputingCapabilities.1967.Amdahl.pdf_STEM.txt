� introduct 

for over a decad prophet have voic the content that the organ of a singl comput 

have reach it limit and that truli signi�c advenc can be make onli by interconnect of a 

multipl of comput in such a manner a to permit cooper solution� various the proper 

direct have be point out a gener purpos comput with a gener interconnect 

of memories� or a special comput with geometr relat memori interconnect and 

control by one or more instruct streams� 

demonstr be make of the continu valid of the singl processor approach and of the 

weak of the multipl processor approach in term of applic to real problem and their 

attend irregularities� 

the argument present be base on statist characterist of comput on comput 

over the last decad and upon the oper requir within problem of physic interest� 

An addit refer will be one of the most thorough analysi of rel comput capabl 

current publish �chang in comput performance�� datamation� septemb ����� professor 

kenneth F� knight� stanford school of busi asministration� 

the �rst characterist of interest be the fraction of the comput load which be associ 

with data manag housekeeping� thi fraction have be veri nearli constant for about ten 

years� and account for � 
of the execut instruct in product runs� In an entir dedic 

special purpos environ thi might be reduc by a factor of two� but it be highli improb 

that it could be reduc by a factor of three� the natur of thi overhead appear to be sequenti 

so that it be unlik to be amen to parallel process techniques� overhead alon would then 

place an upper limit on throughput of �ve to seven time the sequenti process rate� even if the 

�thi paper be retyp a the present form by guihai chen� He wish you would enjoy read thi histor 

paper� 

� 



housekeep be do in a separ processor� the non housekeep part of the problem could 

exploit at most a processor of perform three to four time the perform of the housekeep 

processor� A fairli obviou conclus which can be drawn at thi point be that the e�ort expend 

on achiev high parallel process rate be wast unless it be accompani by achiev in 

sequenti process rate of veri nearli the same magnitude� 

data manag housekeep be not the onli problem to plagu oversimpli� approach to 

high speed computation� the physic problem which be of practic interest tend to have rather 

signi�c complications� exampl of these complic be a follows� boundari be like to 

be irregular 
interior be inhomogen 
comput requir may be depend on the state 

of the variabl at each point 
propag rate of di�er physic e�ect may be quit di�er 

the rate of convergence� or converg at all may be strongli depend on sweep through the 

array along di�er ax on succeed passes� etc� the e�ect of each of these complic be 

veri sever on ani comput organ base on geometr relat processor in a parallel 

process system� even the exist of regular rectangular boundari have the interest properti 

that for spatial dimens of N there be �N di�er point geometri to be dealt with in a near 

neighbor computation� If the second near neighbor be also involved� there would be �N 

di�er point geometri to contend with� An irregular boundari compound thi problem a do 

an inhomogen interiors� comput which be depend on the state of variabl would 

requir the process at each point to consum approxim the same comput time a 

the sum of comput of all physic e�ect within a larg region� di�er of chang in 

propag rate may a�ect the mesh point relationships� 

ideal the comput of the action of the neighbor point upon the point under consid� 

erat involv their valu at a previou time proport to the mesh space and invers 

proport to the propag rate� sinc the time step be normal kept constant� a faster prop� 

agat rate for some e�ect would impli interact with more distant points� final the fairli 

common practic of sweep through the mesh along di�er ax on succeed pass pose 

problem of data manag which a�ect all processors� howev it a�ect geometr relat 

processor more sever by requir transpos all point in storag in addit to the revis 

input�output scheduling� A realist assess of the e�ect of these irregular on a simpli� 

and regular abstract of the problem yield a degrad in the vicin of one�half to one 

order of magnitude� 

To sum up the e�ect of data manag housekeep and of problem irregularities� the 

author have compar three di�er machin organ involv approxim equal amount 

� 



of hardware� machin A have thirti two arithmet execut unit control by a singl instruct 

stream� machin B have pipelin arithmet execut unit with up to three overlap oper 

on vector of eight elements� machin C have the same pipelin execut units� but initi of 

individu oper at the same rate a machin B permit vector element operations� the 

perform of these three machin be plot in figur � a a function of the fraction of the 

number of instruct which permit parallelism� the probabl region of oper be center 

around a point correspond to �� 
data manag overhead and � 
of the problem oper 

forc to be sequential� 

figur 1 

the histor perform versu cost of comput have be explor veri thoroughli by profes� 

sor knight� the care analyz data he present re�ect not just execut time for arithmet 

oper and cost of minimum of recommend con�gurations� He includ memori capac ef� 

fects� input�output overlap experienced� and special function capabilities� the best statist �t 

obtain correspond to a perform proport to the squar of cost at ani technolog level� 

thi result veri e�ect support the often invok �grosch� law�� util thi analysis� one 

can argu that if twice the amount of hardwar be exploit in a singl system� one could expect 

to obtain four time the performance� the onli di�culti be involv in know how to exploit thi 

addit hardware� At ani point in time it be di�cult to forese how the preciou bottleneck in 

a sequenti comput will be e�ect overcome� If it be easi they would not have be left a 

bottlenecks� It be true by histor exampl that the success obstacl have be hurdled� so it be 

appropri to quot the rev� adam clayton powell��keep the faith� baby�� If altern one 

decid to improv the perform by put two processor side by side with share memory� 

one would �nd approxim ��� time a much hardware� the addit two tenth in hardwar 

accomplish the crossbar switch for the sharing� the result perform achiev would 

be about ���� the latter �gure be deriv from the assumpt of each processor util half of 

� 



the memori about half of the time� the result memori con�ict in the share system would 

extend the execut of one of two oper by one quarter of the execut time� the net result 

be a price perform degrad to �� rather than an improv to �� for the singl larg 

processor� 

compar analysi with associ processor be far less easi and obvious� under certain 

condit of regular format there be a fairli direct approach� consid an associ processor de� 

sign for pattern recognit in which decis within individu element be forward to some 

set of other elements� In the associ processor design the receiv element would have a set of 

sourc address which recogn by associ techniqu whether or not it be to receiv the de� 

cision of the current declar element� To make a correspond special purpos non�associ 

processor one would consid a receiv element and it sourc address a an instruction� with 

binari decis maintain in registers� consid the use of the �lm memory� an associ 

cycl would be longer than a non�destruct read cycle� In such a real analog the special purpos 

non�associ processor can be expect to take about one�fourth a mani memori cycl a the 

associ version and onli about one sixth of the time� these �gure be comput on the full 

recognit task with somewhat di�er ratio in each phase� No blanket claim be intend here� 

but rather that each requir should be investig from both approaches� 

� note by guihai chen 

� the veri famou amdahl� law� present a in the follow formula� be depriv from thi 

paper� however� amdahl give onli a liter descript which be paraphras by latecom 

a follows� 

speedup � 
� 

r � 
rp 
n 

where r � rp � � and r repres the ratio of the sequenti portion in one program� 

� onli a small part of thi paper� exactli the fourth paragraph� contribut to the amdahl� 

law� thi paper also discuss some other import problems� for example� amdahl have 

forseen mani neg factor plagu the parallel comput of irregular problems� such 

a �� boundari be like to be irregular 
�� interior be inhomogen 
�� comput 

requir may be depend on the state of the variabl at each point 
�� propag rate 

of di�er physic e�ect may be quit di�er 
�� the rate of convergence� or converg 

at all may be strongli depend on sweep through the array along di�er ax on 

succeed passes� etc�
