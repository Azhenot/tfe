pour through the bedroom window. He look down 

at hi companion, still pretend to sleep. “okay, 

kiri, i’m up.” 

steve sit up 

she stir out of bed and begin dressing. “you receiv 

164 messag overnight. I answer all but one.” 

In the bathroom, steve stare at hi dishevel self. 

“fine, give it to me.” 

“your mother want to know whi you won’t get a real 

girlfriend.” 

He burst out laughing. “anyth else?” 

“your cholesterol be creep up again. and there have 

be 15,712 attempt to hack my mind in the last 

hour.” 

“good grief! can you identifi the source?” 

“it’ distributed. mostli induc to purchas a 

new RF oven. i’m shift cipher and restrict 

network traffic.” 

“okay. let me know if you start hear voices.” steve 

pauses. “ani good deals?” 

“one with remot control be in our price range. It have 

mostli good reviews.” 

“you can buy it.” 

kiri smiles. “i’ll stay in bed and cook dinner with a 

thought.” 

steve go to the car and take hi seat.

but mayb they could if they experienc the

the experi with kiri.… 

but by midcenturi we could be 

live in steve and kiri’ world. computing, after 

about 70 years, be at a moment juncture. the 

old approaches, base on cmo technolog and 

the von neumann architecture, be reach their 

fundament limits. meanwhile, massiv effort 

around the world to understand the work of 

the human brain be yield new insight into one 

of the great scientif mysteries: the biolog basi of human cognition. 

it’ sci-fi now, 

the dream of a think machine—on like kiri that reacts, plans, and reason like a human—i a old a 

the comput age. In 1950, alan ture propos to test whether machin can think, by

comput would pa hi test by the year 2000. comput pioneer such a 

also set out to imit the brain. they have onli the simplest 

notion of neurons, base on the work of neuroscientist 

and other in 

the late 1800s. and the dream prove elusive, full of fals start and blind alleys. even now, we have littl 

idea how the tangibl brain give rise to the intang experi of consciou thought.

perhap the first benefit will be in mental health, organiz behavior, or even intern 

relations. 

such machin will also improv our health in general. imagin a device, whether a robot or your 

cellphone, that keep your medic records. combin thi person data with a sophist model 

of all the pathway that regul the human body, it could simul scenario and recommend healthi 

behavior or medic action tailor to you. A human doctor can correl onli a few variabl at once, 

but such an app could consid thousands. It would be more effect and more person than ani 

physician. 

re-creat the process of the brain will let u autom anyth human now do. think about fast 

food. just combin a neural control chip that imit the reasoning, intuitive, and mechanical-control 

power of the brain with a few thousand dollars’ worth of parts, and you have a short-ord bot. you’d 

order a burger with your phone, and then drive up to retriev your food from a build with no human 

in it. mani other commerci facil would be similarli human free. 

that may sound horrifying, give how rigid comput be today. ever call a custom servic or

charad creat human expectations, yet the machin frequent fail to deliv and can’t even get angri 

when you scream at them. think machin will sens your emotions, understand your goals, and 

activ help you achiev them. rather than mechan run through a fix set of instructions, 

they will adjust a circumst change. 

that’ becaus they’ll be model on our brains, which be exquisit adapt to navig complex 

environ and work with other humans. with littl consciou effort, we understand languag and 

grasp shade of mean and mood from the subtl cue of bodi language, facial expression, and tone of 

voice. and the brain do all that while consum astonishingli littl energy.

and there be hundr of differ type of neurons, each perform a special role in the neural 

circuitry. most neuron commun through physic contact, so they grow long skinni branch to 

find the right partner. signal move along these branch via a chain of amplifiers. ion pump keep the 

neuron’ cell membran charged, like a battery. signal travel a short sharp chang of voltage, call 

spikes, which rippl down the membrane. 

the power of the brain go beyond it intern connections, and includ it abil to commun with 

other brains. some anim form swarm or social groups, but onli human form deep hierarchies. thi 

penchant, more than ani uniqu cognit ability, enabl u to domin the planet and construct 

object of exquisit complexity. collectively, though, we human be capabl of achiev truli great 

things. 

now we be combin machin intellig along with our own. As our systems—industrial, 

technological, medical—grow in sophist and complexity, so too must the intellig that oper 

them. eventually, our tool will think for themselves, perhap even becom conscious. some peopl find 

thi a . If our tool think for 

themselves, they could turn against us. what if, instead, we creat machin that love us?

“I make a new painting.” she step away to show him. the canva contain a photo-perfect rendit of

“listen, kiri, I have to take you back to the lab. they say you’v progress a far a you can with me.” 

“I like it here. pleas let me stay. i’ll be anyth you want.” 

“that’ the problem. you tri so hard to pleas me that you haven’t found yourself.” 

water trickl down her cheek. she wipe it and studi her moist hand. “you think all thi be fake.” 

steve take kiri in a tight embrac and hold her for a long time. He whispers, “I don’t know.”
