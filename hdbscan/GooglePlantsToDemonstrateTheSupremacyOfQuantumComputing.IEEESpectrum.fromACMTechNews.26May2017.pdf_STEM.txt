By the end of 2017, googl hope to make a 49-qubit chip that will prove 
quantum comput can beat classic machin 

quantum comput have long held the promis of 

perform certain calcul that be 

impossible—or at least, entir impractical—for even 

the most power convent comput to 

perform. now, research at a googl laboratori in 

goleta, calif., may final be on the cusp of prove it, 

use the same kind of quantum bits, or qubits, that 

one day could make up large-scal quantum 

machines. 

By the end of thi year, the team aim to increas the 

number of superconduct 

it build on 

integr circuit to creat a 7-by-7 array. with thi 

quantum ic, the googl research aim to perform 

oper at the edg of what’ possibl with even the 

best supercomputers, and so demonstr “quantum 

supremacy.”

“we’v be talk about, for mani year now, how a 

quantum processor could be power becaus of the 

way that quantum mechan works, but we want to 

specif demonstr it,” say team member john

A system size of 49 superconduct qubit be still far 

away from what physicist think will be need to 

perform the sort of comput that have long 

motiv quantum comput research. one of those 

be shor’ algorithm, a comput scheme that 

would enabl a quantum comput to quickli factor 

veri larg number and thu crack one of the 

foundat compon of modern cryptography. In 

a recent commentari in , martini and 

colleagu estim that a 100-million-qubit system 

would be need to factor a 2,000-bit number—a 

not-uncommon public key length—in one day. most of 

those qubit would be use to creat the special 

quantum state that would be need to perform the 

comput and to correct errors, creat a mere 

thousand or so stabl “logic qubits” from thousand 

of less stabl physic components, martini says. 

natur 

there will be no such extra infrastructur in thi 

49-qubit system, which mean a differ 

comput must be perform to establish 

supremacy. To demonstr the chip’ superior 

over convent computers, the googl team will 

execut oper on the array that will caus it to evolv chaotic and produc what look like a 

random output. classic machin can simul thi output for small systems. In april, for example, 

lawrenc berkeley nation laboratori 

, cori, have simul the output of 45 qubits. but 49 qubit would push—if not 

exceed—th limit of convent supercomputers.

thi comput do not a yet have a clear practic application. but martini say there be reason 

beyond demonstr quantum supremaci to pursu thi approach. the qubit use to make the

googl will put it superconduct quantum 

comput chip in thi 10-millikelvin dilut refrigerator. 

put chip here: 

49-qubit array can also be use to make larg 

“universal” quantum system with error 

correction, the sort that could do thing like 

decryption, so the chip should provid use 

valid data. 

there may also be, the team suspects, untap 

comput potenti in system with littl or 

no error correction. “it would be wonder if thi 

be true, becaus then we could have use 

product right away instead of wait for a long 

time,” say martinis. one potenti application, the 

team suggests, could be in the simul of 

chemic reaction and materials. 

googl recent perform a dri run of the 

approach on a 9-by-1 array of qubit and test out 

some fabric technolog on a 2-by-3 array. 

scale up the number of qubit will happen in 

stages. “thi be a challeng system engin 

problem,” martini says. “we have to scale it up, 

but the qubit still have to work well. We can’t 

have ani loss in fidelity, ani increas in error 

rates, and I would say error rate and scale tend 

to kind of compet against each other.” still, he 

says, the team think there could be a way to scale 

up system well past 50 qubit even without error correction. 

googl be not the onli compani work on build larg quantum system without error correction. In 

march, ibm 

to creat such a superconduct qubit system in the next few years, 

also with roughli 50 qubits, and to make it access on the cloud. “fifti be a magic number,” say bob 

sutor, ibm’ vice presid for thi area, becaus that’ around the point where 

will start to outstrip classic comput for certain 

tasks.

google’ quantum comput chip be a 

2-by-3 array of qubits. the compani hope to make a 7-by-7 

array late thi year. 

step to supremacy: 

the qualiti of superconduct qubit have 

advanc a lot over the year sinc d-wave 

system begin offer commerci quantum 

computers, say 

, a professor of 

comput scienc at the univers of texa at 

austin. d-wave, base in burnaby, b.c., canada, 

have claim that it system offer a speedup over 

convent machines, but aaronson say there 

have be no convinc demonstr of that. 

google, he says, be clearli aim for a 

demonstr of quantum supremaci that be “not 

someth you’ll have to squint and argu about.” 

scott aaronson 

(http://www.scottaaronson.com/) 

it’ still unclear whether there be use task a 

50-or-so-qubit chip could perform, aaronson says. 

nor be it certain whether system can be make big without error correction. but he say quantum 

supremaci will be an import mileston nonetheless, one that be a natur offshoot of the effort to make 

large-scale, univers quantum machines: “I think that it be absolut worth just establish a clearli a 

we can that the world do work thi way. certainly, if we can do it a a spin-off of technolog that will be 

use eventu in it own right, then whi the hell not?” 

thi articl appear in the june 2017 print issu a “googl aim for quantum comput supremacy.”
