defens advanc research project agenc program inform 

dramat success in machin learn have lead to a torrent of artifici intellig (ai) applications. continu advanc promis to produc 

autonom system that will perceive, learn, decide, and act on their own. however, the effect of these system be limit by the machine’ 

current inabl to explain their decis and action to human users. the depart of defens be face challeng that demand more intelligent,

autonomous, and symbiot systems. explain ai—especi explain machin learning—wil be essenti if futur warfight be to understand, 

appropri trust, and effect manag an emerg gener of artifici intellig machin partners. 

the explain AI (xai) program aim to creat a suit of machin learn techniqu that: 

produc more explain models, while maintain a high level of learn perform (predict accuracy); and 

enabl human user to understand, appropri trust, and effect manag the emerg gener of artifici intellig partners. 

new machine-learn system will have the abil to explain their rationale, character their strength and weaknesses, and convey an 

understand of how they will behav in the future. the strategi for achiev that goal be to develop new or modifi machine-learn techniqu that 

will produc more explain models. these model will be combin with state-of-the-art human-comput interfac techniqu capabl of translat 

model into understand and use explan dialogu for the end user. our strategi be to pursu a varieti of techniqu in order to gener a 

portfolio of method that will provid futur develop with a rang of design option cover the performance-versus-explain trade space. 

figur 1: xai concept 

the xai program will focu the develop of multipl system on address challeng problem in two areas: (1) machin learn problem to 

classifi event of interest in heterogeneous, multimedia data; and (2) machin learn problem to construct decis polici for an autonom

system to perform a varieti of simul missions. these two challeng problem area be chosen to repres the intersect of two import 

machin learn approach (classif and reinforc learning) and two import oper problem area for the depart of defens 

(intellig analysi and autonom systems). 

xai research prototyp will be test and continu evalu throughout the cours of the program. At the end of the program, the final deliveri will 

be a toolkit librari consist of machin learn and human-comput interfac softwar modul that could be use to develop futur explain AI 

systems. after the program be complete, these toolkit would be avail for further refin and transit into defens or commerci applications.
