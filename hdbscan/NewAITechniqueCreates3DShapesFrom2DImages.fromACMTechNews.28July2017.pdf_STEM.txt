AI comput may soon be abl to 

creat new 3-d shape just by look 

at two 2-d images, such a photos, 

say purdu univers professor 

karthik ramani, and also come up with 

shape for new imag such a by 

"hallucination." (purdu univers

west lafayette, ind. — A new 

techniqu that us the artifici 

intellig method of machin learn 

and deep learn be abl to creat 3-d 

shape from 2-d images, such a 

photographs, and be even abl to creat 

new, never-before-seen shapes. 

karthik ramani 

(https://engineering.purdue.edu 

/me/people/ptprofile?id=12331), 

purdue' donald W. feddersen professor 

of mechan engineering, say that the 

"magical" capabl of AI deep learn be 

that it be abl to learn abstractly. 

"if you show it hundr of thousand of shape of someth such a a car, if you 

then show it a 2-d imag of a car, it can reconstruct that model in 3-d," he says. "it

new techniqu for an old challenge!!! 



comput use a new artifici 

intellig techniqu develop at 

purdu univers can creat 3-d 

shape from 2-d images, such a these 

photograph of airplanes. the 

techniqu could help technolog such 

can even take two 2-d imag and creat a 3-d shape between the two, which we 

call 'hallucination.'" 

when fulli developed, thi method, call surfnet, could have signific 

applic in the field of 3-d search on the internet, a well a help robot 

and autonom vehicl good understand their surroundings. 

perhap most exciting, however, be that the techniqu could be use to creat 3-d 

content for virtual realiti and augment realiti by simpli use standard 2-d 

photos. 

"you can imagin a movi camera that be take pictur in 2-d, but in the virtual 

realiti world everyth be appear magic in 3-d," ramani says. "inch-by-inch 

we be go there, and in the next five year someth like thi be go to 

happen. 

"pretti soon we will be at a stage where human will not be abl to differenti 

between realiti and virtual reality."

"you can imagin a movi camera that be 

take pictur in 2-d, but in the virtual 

realiti world everyth be appear 

magic in 3-d," ramani says. "inch-by- 

inch we be go there, and in the next 

five year someth like thi be go to happen. 

"pretti soon we will be at a stage where human will not be abl to differenti 

between realiti and virtual reality." 

the comput system then learn both the 3-d imag and the 2-d imag in pairs, 

and then be abl to predict other, similar 3-d shape from just a 2-d image. 

"thi be veri similar to how a camera or scanner us just three colors, red, green 

and blue—known a rgb—to creat a color image, except we use the xyz 

coordinates," he says. 

ramani say thi techniqu also allow for great accuraci and precis than 

current 3-d deep learn method that oper more use volumetr pixel (or 

voxels). 

"we use the surfac instead sinc it fulli 

defin the shape. it' kind of an 

interest offshoot of thi method. 

becaus we be work in the 2-d 

domain to reconstruct the 3-d structure, 

instead of do 1,000 data point like you 

would otherwis with other emerg 

methods, we can do 10,000 points. We 

be more effici and compact."

one signific outcom of the research would be for robotics, object recognit 

and even self-driv car in the future; they would onli need to be fit with 

standard 2-d cameras, yet still have the abil to understand the 3-d environ 

around them. 

ramani say that for thi research to be developed, more basic research in AI will 

be needed. 

"there' not a box of machin learn algorithm where we can take those and 

appli them and thing work magically," he says. "to move from the flatland to the 

3-d world we will need much more basic research. We be pushing, but the 

mathemat and comput techniqu of deep learn be still be invent 

and larg an unknown area in 3-d."

3D shape model be natur parameter use vertex and faces, i.e., 

compos of polygon form a surface. however, current 3D learn paradigm 

for predict and gener task use convolut neural network focu on a 

voxel represent of the object. lift convolut oper from the 

tradit 2D to 3D result in high comput overhead with littl addit 

benefit a most of the geometri inform be contain on the surfac boundary. 

here we studi the problem of directli gener the 3D shape surfac of rigid and 

non-rigid shape use deep convolut neural networks. We develop a 

procedur to creat consist ‘geometri images’ repres the shape surfac of 

a categori of 3D objects. We then use thi consist represent for category- 

specif shape surfac gener from a parametr represent or an imag by 

develop novel extens of deep residu network for the task of geometri 

imag generation. our experi indic that our network learn a meaning 

represent of shape surfac allow it to interpol between shape 

orient and poses, invent new shape surfac and reconstruct 3D shape 

surfac from previous unseen images.
