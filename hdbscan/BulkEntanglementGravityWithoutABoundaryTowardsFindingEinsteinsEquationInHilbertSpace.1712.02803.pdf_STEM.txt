abstract 

We consid the emerg from quantum entangl of spacetim geometri in a bulk region. 

for certain class of quantum state in an appropri factor hilbert space, a spatial ge- 

ometri can be defin by associ area along codimension-on surfac with the entangl 

entropi between either side. We show how radon transform can be use to convert thi data into 

a spatial metric. under a particular set of assumptions, the time evolut of such a state trace 

out a four-dimension spacetim geometry, and we argu use a modifi version of jacobson’ 

“entangl equilibrium” that the geometri should obey einstein’ equat in the weak-field 

limit. We also discu how entangl equilibrium be relat to a gener of the ryu- 

takayanagi formula in more gener settings, and how quantum error correct can help specifi 

the emerg map between the full quantum-grav hilbert space and the semiclass limit of 

quantum field propag on a classic spacetime.

I. introduct 

there have be consider recent interest in the idea of deriv an emerg spacetim 
geometri from the entangl properti of a quantum state [1–6]. much of thi work have 
take place within the context of the anti-d sitter/conform field theori (ads/cft) 
correspond [7]. In particular, variou result relat to emerg graviti [4, 5, 8] have 
yield not onli confid in the program, but also help insight in understand quan- 
tum graviti itself [9, 10]. moreover, the idea need not be restrict to the context of 
holograph duality. indeed, a it be origin propos [2], it can in principl be gener- 
aliz to deriv other geometri closer to our own physic univers [11–15]. entangl 
also play a role in entropic/thermodynam graviti [16–21] and the holographic-spacetim 
approach of bank and fishler [22–24] and of nomura et al. [25, 26]. 

the real world, needl to say, do not seem to have anti-d sitter boundari condi- 
tions. It be therefor interest to ask whether we can deriv spacetim and gravit 
field equat directli in the bulk from the entangl properti of quantum states. the 
emerg of a semiclass spacetim descript from a quantum state, thought of a an 
abstract vector in hilbert space, be essenti inevit if we think that such an evolv 
quantum state provid a suffici and complet descript of physic reality. our ap- 
proach be to take the quantum state a fundament and search for an appropri classic 
limit, rather than quantiz ani particular classic model. 

In thi work we tackl thi problem, build on previou work on deriv emerg 
spatial geometri from entangl of a quantum state [12]. there we investig how 
a spatial metric (distanc along curves) could be deriv from a quantum state use the 
mutual inform between differ factor in hilbert space. our interest here be dynam 
rather than static: to model the univers a a quantum state evolv in hilbert space, show 
how the geometri of spacetim can emerg from the entangl featur of such a state 
in an appropri factorization, and deriv einstein’ equat in the semiclass limit, 
an approach we label bulk entangl graviti (beg). thi requir u to consid a 
somewhat gener quantum system (or oper algebra), and examin which properti of 
a complex quantum system may be import in emerg spacetim geometri and gravity. 

To concret implement aspect of beg, we will restrict ourselv in thi paper to 
quantum state correspond to emerg spacetim in the weak-field regime, small per- 
turbat of minkowski space. (sinc boundari condit play no role in our analysis, 
the result will appli equal well to spacetim with a nonzero cosmolog constant, a 
long a we consid region much small than the background curvatur scale.) thi repre- 
sent a signific departur from the ads/cft version of the geometry-from-entangl 
program. that approach may be thought of a “maxim holographic,” with all of the 
bulk data encod directli on the conform boundary, and in particular the entangl 
from which geometri emerg be that of the cft state. our regim be “anti-holographic,” 
consid a small region that be a weak perturb of flat spacetime. We be therefor 
interest in the entangl of quantum state in hilbert space that can be decompos 
directli into factor correspond to local region of bulk spacetim (or equival way of 
encod entangl data). 

We will consid three differ aspect of the beg program. the first involv deriv 
emerg spatial geometri from entangl data. use assumpt (a1), (a2) and (a3) 
below, one may start from an appropri quantum state and obtain an emerg geometri 
and it best-fit dimensionality. rather than deriv distanc from mutual information, it be 

3 



more natur to deriv area of surfac use the entangl entropi across them. We will 
show in section iii that for some class of geometries, the metric tensor can be obtain from 
these data use the tensor radon transform [27]. In the case of ads/cft, a procedur like 
thi would correspond to directli recov the bulk geometri (plu matter) from a state of 
the fundament theory, such a that of a cft, but without reli on the knowledg that 
it have a flat geometri or that it can be interpret to resid on the asymptot boundari of 
the emerg geometry. In general, we still refer to thi emerg spatial geometri a the 
“bulk” geometry, even when no boundari theori be available. 

the second aspect be the emerg of gravit dynamics. In section iv, we show 
that the linear einstein’ equat can be deriv from a background-fre approach use 
quantum entangl when a set of assumpt outlin in the next section be satisfied. 
In particular, one can deriv the hamiltonian constraint IV A from assumpt (a1) through 
(a5). our approach be close relat to the entanglement-equilibrium propos of [19]. It 
differ from [19] in that the analog entangl condit be valid across global cuts, 
instead of small local spheric surfaces. In addition, it be valid for all matter field and 
do not reli on cft modular hamiltonians, which requir matter field to have UV fix 
points. the main differ be that we deriv our result directli from an abstract quantum 
state, rather than start with quantum field on an exist classic spacetime. 

the third aspect deal with the “emerg map”: the map from abstract quantum state 
in hilbert space to quantum field on a semiclass background geometry. part of thi task 
can be thought of a determin which quantum degre of freedom be respons for 
emerg geometri a oppos to matter fields. thi be import for the emerg of 
einstein’ equat with sources. To thi end, we elabor the relat with entangl 
equilibrium and the ryu-takayanagi (rt) formula in section V. In particular, we will discu 
how one can distinguish the semiclass geometri from quantum field on that geometri 
sole from the featur in a gener background-fre setting. follow harlow [28], we 
argu that thi can be do pure from the entangl structur of the state or from the 
properti of a quantum error-correct code (qecc). It seem that quantum error correc- 
tion properti can natur provid a separ between geometr and matter degre of 
freedom. 

our framework, partli inspir by [29], us the radon transform to tie togeth previ- 
ou work on the thermodynam of spacetim [16, 19], ads/cft approach to emerg 
graviti [4], and kinemat space [30]. the radon transform can also be use to construct 
emerg geometri for quantum error correct code or tensor network in general. 

for the sake of concreteness, we will use the specif languag of entangl a com- 
put from a quantum state in a hilbert space. however, thi work onli reli on a configu- 
ration that defin subsystem and entangl entropi data. consequently, it also appli 
to more gener formulations. 

ii. the road TO bulk entangl graviti 

our deriv of einstein’ equat from entangl in the bulk of spacetim can be 
consid axiomatically: we can specifi a list of explicit assumpt allow u to start 
with an abstract quantum state and deriv a semiclass spacetim geometri with the 
appropri dynamics. here we briefli list the assumptions, befor discuss them in detail 
in subsequ sections. some of these assumpt will seem prima faci reasonable, while 

4 



other be more conjectural. We will present argument for their valid where available, 
and sketch a roadmap for the futur work to complet thi kind of program. 

our assumpt be a follows: 

(a1) factorization. hilbert space H come equip with a prefer tensor product de- 
composit into individu factors, 

H = 
⊗ 
i 

hi. (1) 

the individu factor Hi will correspond roughli to local point or small region of 
space. the decomposit may be defin by the dynam of the theory, a in [31]. 

(a2) redund constraint. We be give a state |ψ〉 in thi decomposit with a veri 
specif behavior of the entangl entropy: the entangl entropi of individu 
factor (or group thereof) be approxim “redund constrained” (rc). given 
a collect B of factor of H and it complement b̄, a state be RC if it entropi can 
be write a a sum over the mutual inform of the individu factors, 

s(b) := 
1 

2 

∑ 
i∈b,j∈b̄ 

i(i : j). (2) 

(detail of our notat be give in section iii a.) thus, RC state gener the 
notion of area-law states. In an approxim RC state, the entangl entropi of 
a subsystem B can be write a 

s(b) = src + ssub, (3) 

where src be the lead order contribut that satisfi the RC condition, and ssub 
be a sublead correction. 

(a3) area from mutual information. for state that defin an emerg geometry, the 
mutual inform I between subsystem be proport to the interfac area A 
between correspond subregion in that geometry, 

a(b, b̄) = 1 
2α 
i(b : b̄). (4) 

(a4) entangl equilibrium. entangl perturb of thi configur satisfi a 
modifi entangl equilibrium condit (meec), follow jacobson [19]. that 
is, under small perturbations, the total entropi perturb δs(r) of certain subsys- 
tem vanish, so that 

0 = δsrc + δssub. (5) 

(a5) emerg field theory. the variat of the sublead correct can be gener by 

5 



the entangl variat of a state in some emerg effect field theori (eft), 

δssub = δseft. (6) 

here by seft we mean the vacuum-subtract or casini entropy, repres entan- 
glement over and abov the diverg contribut of the qft vacuum [32–34]. 

(a6) dynamics. there exist a consist dynam theory, e.g., a hamiltonian or a quan- 
tum circuit, that gener a sequenc of such configurations, each admit an emer- 
gent spatial geometry. furthermore, there be a way to organ these emerg geome- 
tri to creat a consist lorentzian spacetim geometri via time evolution. 

(a7) lorentz invariance. the abov assumpt hold for ani constant-tim slice of the 
emerg minkowski space, and the overal theori be lorentz-invari in an appropri- 
ate limit. 

In the section that follow we will show how to weav togeth these assumpt to 
deriv geometri and einstein’ equat in the weak-field regime. 

iii. emerg spatial geometri and radon transform 

In our earli work on emerg space [12] we deriv a spatial metric by use the 
quantum mutual inform of two factor of hilbert space to defin a distanc measure, 
base on our intuit from quantum field theori that the entangl of low-energi state 
decreas monoton with distance. If entangl be our main quantiti of interest, 
however, it be more natur to directli deriv area from the entangl across a boundari 
separ two regions, rather than to deriv distanc between ani two small regions. We 
expect the entropi across such a boundari to be proport to the geometr area, plu 
some subdomin correction. In thi section we explor the radon transform a a natur 
tool for character thi data, and convert the entangl of a quantum state into 
the metric tensor of a spatial slice. 

A. space from hilbert space 

here we briefli review the emerg of spatial geometri from appropri quantum 
state [12]. follow assumpt (a1), we be give a quantum state and a tensor product 
decomposit of the hilbert space, |ψ〉 ∈ H = 

⊗ 
ihi. the individu factor Hi correspond 

roughli to the degre of freedom (geometr and field-theoretic) associ with a small 
local region of space. In the back of our mind we be think of these factor a finite- 
dimension vector space [35], though thi doesn’t play a crucial role in our analysis. while 
thi local pictur of degre of freedom run against the spirit of holography, our interest 
here be in the weak-grav regime, where it should be suffici to think of graviti a a 
theori of local degre of freedom. 

one can gener an “inform graph” G = (v,e) base on thi structure. the graph 
vertex in V = {i} label each individu hilbert space factor in {hi}, and the edg E 

6 



between ani two vertex i, j be weight by the quantum mutual inform between 
those factors, 

i(i : j) = s(i) + s(j)− s(i ∪ j). (7) 

An exampl graph be show in figur 1. for convenience, when we talk about quantiti 
associ with the quantum state or the hilbert space, we will use graph vertex and set 
of vertex to denot tensor factor of the hilbert space and product of the tensor factors, 
respectively. note that we be not give the graph a a fundament piec of information; it be 
deriv from the quantum state in thi particular factorization. the factor itself could 
be derived, for example, from the requir that the hamiltonian look approxim local 
[31]. 

We say that the state |ψ〉 (or more generally, the entangl data) be “redund 
constrained” (rc) if the entangl entropi of ani subsystem B ⊂ V can be comput by 
sum over the weight of all edg that connect vertex in B with those in it complement 
b̄, a in assumpt (a2). more precisely, the entangl entropi of a subsystem B in a 
redundancy-constrain state be give by the cut function [36], 

s(b) = src(b) := 
1 

2 

∑ 
i∈b,j∈b̄ 

i(i : j). (8) 

other than the familiar examples, such a area-law state [37] in certain condens matter 
systems, a wider class of state such a project entangled-pair state [38], holograph 
quantum error correct code [39], and (bulk) random tensor network state [40] be also 
(approximately) redund constrained. note that a gener state in hilbert space will be 
veri far from rc, and the inform graph will be highli connect rather than take 
the spars form suggest by locality; the state we have in mind resembl low-energi state 
of approximately-loc hamiltonians. 

In state that be onli approxim rc, (8) hold to lead order, and the exact 
entangl entropi take on a sublead correct 

s(b) = src(b) + ssub(b), (9) 

where ssub � src. there be two natur sourc for such corrections. one be long-rang 
entangl even in the vacuum, which we expect to be present but subdominant. the 
other be entangl between excit degre of freedom over and abov the vacuum. An 
epr pair, for example, can have an entangl that be independ of the distanc between 
the two particles; howev in a quantum field theori such entangl be a veri small 
correct to the huge entangl between the vacuum modes. (for discuss of vacuum- 
subtract entropi in quantum field theory, see [32–34].) 

In order to obtain an emerg space, one have to make certain assumpt about the 
connect between entangl and geometry. A natur identif can be motiv 
by area-law systems, where the entangl entropi of a region scale a the interfac 
area that separ the region and it complement. To lead order, thi impli that 
the interfac area be proport to the mutual inform between the region and it 
complement. becaus RC state gener area-law states, a natur definit be to defin 
the “interfac area” of an emerg geometri a the mutual inform between a system

fig. 1. thi show an exampl of the inform graph in which vertex repres factor in a 

decomposit of hilbert space, and edg be weight by the mutual inform between the 

factors. In redundancy-constrain states, the entropi of a group of factor (such a the shade 

region B contain H1 ⊗ H2 ⊗ H3 ⊗ H4 ⊗ h5.) can be calcul by sum over the mutual 
inform of the cut edges, a in (8). 

and it complement, a in assumpt (a3). that is, 

a(b, b̄) := 1 
2α 
i(b : b̄). (10) 

see also [41, 42]. At thi level α serf a an undetermin constant of proportionality; we 
will late relat it to newton’ gravit constant via α = 1/4gn . 

given the inform graph, however, it be more conveni to work with the length 
measur between factors, instead of their mutual interfac areas. To deriv the approxim 
geometri that may be encod by the graph, [12] defin an ad hoc distanc function between 
vertex from the edg weights. this, togeth with the set V , gener a metric space, 
which be isometr emb in to a manifold. We defin the emb manifold a 
the emerg geometri of the graph. the techniqu of classic multi-dimension scale 
(mds) [43–47] can be use for thi purpos to determin the best-fit dimension of the 
geometry, a well a the emb coordin for the element of V . 

B. metric tensor from the invers tensor radon transform 

while straightforward in an approxim recoveri of geometry, the correct “transform” 
function from an area quantiti to distanc can, in principle, be non-local. A simpl local 
function from area to distanc be expect to yield a distort unless we oper in the case 
with a high degre of symmetry. To address thi deficiency, we seek an improv method to 

8 



directli transform (dualize) the area quantity, which be proport to mutual information, 
to a measur of distanc via a global transformation. In thi section, we reconstruct the 
spatial metric tensor directli from entangl data. 

In case of interest where the emerg geometri be not highli symmetric, we can imagin 
a two-part procedure, in which we use md to emerg a symmetr “background” geometry, 
and then recov the metric perturb from an invers tensor radon transform. (in fact 
the background geometri of interest to u will gener be flat euclidean spaces.) the 
recoveri procedur be valid a long a the tensor radon transform have a uniqu inverse. such 
be the case for simpl manifold in 2 dimens [48], which have be extens studi in 
the context of the boundary-rigid problem. In high dimensions, similar invers be 
also possibl in riemannian geometri that be close to flat space or hyperbol space [49]. 

intuitively, the radon transform map a function on a space to a function on a set of 
surfac emb in that space, by integr the function over the surfac [27, 29, 50]. 
more formally, consid an n-dimension riemannian manifold M and a totally-geodes 
codimension-1 submanifold S, where “total geodesic” mean that the geodes of the 
submanifold with respect to it induc metric be also geodes of the origin manifold.1 

most geometri will not admit ani totally-geodes submanifolds, but they be plenti 
in the highly-symmetr background of interest to u here, e.g. hyperplan in euclidean 
spaces. the radon transform of a function f on M at S be defin a the integr 

r[f ](s) = 
∫ 
S 
f dσ (11) 

over S with area element dσ. clearly, a well-defin transform requir the function to be 
regular in some way, e.g., by set f = 0 outsid some domain. If the geometri on 
M be euclidean (in the sens of flat), an appropri set of surfac S be give by plane 
specifi by a distanc and angl from the origin, a show in figur 2. 

We can also perform the radon transform of a tensor field. such tensor radon transform 
be use in [29] to deriv the linear einstein’ equat in the context ads/cft. We 
will employ analog techniques, but directli in the bulk, without refer to kinemat 
space or holography. 

let gij be the metric tensor onm and let wij be the induc metric of the submanifold S. 
(our notat follow [29], and differ from the more common notat in the mathemat 
literature.) the longitudin tensor radon transform of sij on M be defin a 

r‖[sij] = 

∫ 
S 
wijsij dσ. (12) 

(henceforth we will drop the explicit appear of the submanifold S on the right-hand 
side.) similarly, the transvers tensor radon transform be 

r⊥[sij] = 

∫ 
S 
(gij − wij)sij dσ. (13) 

1 analog transform along n − k dimension submanifold can also be defined. here we onli discu 
the case when k = 1.

indic be rais and lower with the spatial metric. sinc at thi point we be onli 
consid spatial geometri and relat tensors, we do not discu metric with lorentzian 
signatures. A process to invert the abov transform and obtain the tensor sij be refer to 
a invers tensor radon transform. 

the invers problem in n = 2 have be mostli studi in the context of the boundary- 
rigid problem [51, 52], which examin if the bulk geometri of a manifold can be recov 
know onli the pair-wis geodes distanc between all it boundari points. A manifold 
for which thi be possibl be call boundary-rigid. thi problem have be show [27] to 
be equival to the tensor geodes x-ray transform problem [27, 52, 53], which coincid 
with the tensor radon transform in 2 dimensions. An earli classif of boundary-rigid 
manifold be now know a the michel’ conjectur [54], where so-cal simpl manifold be 
boundary-rigid. (A riemannian manifoldm be simpl if, give ani two points, there exist 
a uniqu geodes join the points, and if the second fundament form be posit definit 
at everi point on ∂m.) A proof have be give in n = 2 [48], although some other higher- 
dimension result be also know [55]. see [52, 56, 57] and refer therein. result 
relat to appli the invers be explor both analyt [58, 59] and numer [60]. 
the invers problem of the higher-dimension tensor radon transform have remain larg 
unexplor until recently, where a proof on invert be produc [49], but an explicit 
invers formula and numer result be still unknown, to the best of our knowledge. 
henceforth we will simpli assum that the appropri tensor-transform invers can be 
performed.

C. spatial metric from entangl 

We now describ how to use the radon transform to obtain an emerg spatial geometri 
from the quantum state. suppos we begin with a quantum state |ψ〉 from which, follow 
[12], we may use md to find a best-fit maximally-symmetr geometri gij on a spatial 
manifold {m}, which we will refer to a the background. We now would like to consid a 
perturb state, 

|ψ〉 = |ψ〉+ δ|ψ〉. (14) 

the perturb entangl entropi δS associ with each subsystem also chang the 
associ emerg geometry. use these perturb data δS for differ subsystems, we 
will show that the invers tensor radon transform allow u to recov a perturb metric 
δhij on the background. 

2 

We be thu consid a situat in which we attempt to recov δhij when we be give 
a background metric gij and an entangl perturb δS that can be comput from 
the state itself. for discret finite-dimension quantum systems, such a some condens 
matter model [61–63] or the one we consid in [12], we will also assum a continuum 
limit or a smooth process over the data δS such that the usual radon transform be 
well-defin and can be performed. alternatively, a discret version may also be appli 
[64]. 

We illustr the reconstruct of δhij with an exampl in flat space, although the 
procedur can be easili gener to other backgrounds, a long a an invers transform 
exists. consid the case where one determin the exact geometri encod in the state |ψ〉 
to be an n-dimension flat space with metric gij = δij. for ani codimension-1 hyperplan 
c(p, n̂) that separ the space into two adjac region Σ, σ̄, one can comput the interfac 
area a(c) use the flat metric of the emb space. thi follow from assumpt (a3), 
that area be proport to mutual information,3 

a(c) = 1 
2α 
i(σc : σ̄c). (15) 

given the RC assumpt (a2), i(σc : σ̄c) be determin by the sum of mutual infor- 
mation along all edg that be cut by C [36]. ad a perturb δ|ψ〉 in gener 
also perturb the mutual inform across differ bipartitions. for the same bipar- 
tition along the cut, the perturb area be now give by perturb mutual inform 
A′ = (1/2α)i ′(σc : σ̄c), and one can defin the area perturb 

δA = A′ −A = 1 
2α 
δI = 

1 

2α 
(I ′ − i)(σc : σ̄c), (16) 

so that 
δi(c) = 2αδa(c). (17) 

let w̃ij be the induc metric of C in the perturb geometry, where wij be the induc 
2 A similar procedur may be use when md itself give an imperfect emb of the background 

geometry. 
3 with mds, we be consid onli a geometri that be finit in extent. In the case where the space be 

infinite, we restrict ourselv to a particular finit region for analysis. 

11 



metric in the background, 
w̃ij = wij + δwij. (18) 

the area be then 

a′(c) = 
∫ 
C 

√ 
det w̃ij dσ, (19) 

and the area perturb be 

δA = 
∫ 
C 

(√ 
det w̃ij − 

√ 
detwij 

) 
dσ. (20) 

use det(i + �m) = 1 + �tr[m ] +o(�2) for ani symmetr matrix M , thi becom 

δA = 1 
2 

∫ 
C 

tr(δw) dσ, (21) 

where tr(δw) = wijδwij. compar to (12), we see that the area perturb be directli 
relat to the longitudin radon transform of the induc metric perturbation, 

δA = 1 
2 
r‖[δwij]. (22) 

It be straightforward to show, for exampl by choos an appropri coordin system, that 
r‖[δwij] = r‖[δhij]. We therefor see that the mutual inform across the bipartit be 
proport to the radon transform of the metric perturbation, 

δi(c) = αr‖[δhij]. (23) 

given the entangl data δi(c) = 2αδa(c) over all such cut c(p, n̂), we can perform 
the invers tensor radon transform of r‖[δhij], thu complet the metric reconstruct 
procedure, so that the full spatial metric gij + δhij be obtain from entangl data of a 
quantum state in a background-fre approach. 

We therefor need assur that the tensor radon transform of interest be inde invert- 
ible. At first sight, thi requir of invert to recov a tensor from a scalar function 
seem unlikely, simpli from count degre of freedom; there be sever compon of the 
metric, and onli one valu each of R⊥ and r‖. however, thi be inde uniqu invert- 
ibl for a certain set of manifolds, up to natur obstruct that be not simpli fix by 
the data. In thi case, the degre of freedom that be undetermin by entangl be 
manifest a gaug transform of the δhij field by an arbitrari vector field ξ, 

δhij → δhij + ∂iξj + ∂jξi, (24) 

for the simpl reason that the longitudin tensor radon transform vanish for tensor of 
the form ∂(jξi) . 

from the exist mathemat literature, we conclud that for n = 2, an invers trans- 

12 



form can be explicitli implement to obtain δhij from an entangl perturb a 
long a the background manifold M be boundary-rigid. current knowledg classifi simpl 
manifold and certain quotient [65] a boundary-rigid, although other particul exampl 
such a toru have also be give [57, 66, 67]. for n > 2, an inverse, if it exists, can also be 
uniqu obtain near flat or hyperbol geometries. recently, [68] also propos a recoveri 
of the metric for certain type of riemannian manifold at n = 3. however, an explicit 
reconstruct algorithm for gener dimens be still conting on further progress in the 
mathemat community.4 

iv. emerg graviti from quantum entangl 

We now turn to the gravit dynam of our emerg geometries, and explain how 
assumpt (a1) through (a7) allow u to deriv the linear einstein equat in the 
weak-field limit. In the first subsect we look at classic spacetime, use the radon 
transform to write the term appear in einstein’ equat in a conveni form. In the 
follow subsect we use the result to deriv a modifi entangl equilibrium con- 
dition, and in the final subsect we deriv einstein’ equat for an emerg lorentzian 
spacetim geometri from the quantum state. 

A. the hamiltonian constraint and it radon transform 

let u momentarili set asid spacetim emerg from quantum mechan and instead 
consid the convent classic einstein’ equat linear around a minkowski back- 
ground. 

given a spacetim with a parameter set of time slice Mt with timelik unit nor- 
mal vector tµ, the classic hamiltonian constraint of gener rel correspond to the 
condit 

gµνt 
µtν = 8πgntµνt 

µtν . (25) 

In the follow derivation, we work in the linear regim where we consid metric 
perturb on a minkowski background: gµν = ηµν + δhµν . As such, we can consid 
the constant-tim slice of minkowski space. the (background) extrins curvatur vanish 
on each of these time slices. At the linear level we can then relat the einstein tensor 
to the spatial curvatur scalar via R = 2gtt [70]. therefore, for linear equations, the 
hamiltonian constraint read 

δR = 16πgnδttt. (26) 

becaus we be special to flat backgrounds, for each such constant time slice, let 
the background spatial metric be δij and the perturb be δhij, which be a tensor-valu 

4 the boundary-rigid problem be intim relat to that of reconstruct bulk geometri from bound- 

ari data in the context of ads/cft. the exist of a manifold that be not boundary-rigid may be 

indic of the limit of the ryu-takayanagi formula in ads3/cft2 for construct bulk geome- 

tries. similar conclus also appli to certain reconstruct scheme in high dimensions, which use 

correl function to estim geodes length [69]. for instance, consid the back-react geometri 

of a singl massiv particl in ads. the spatial geometri of a time slice be not boundary-rigid.

function on flat space. To linear order we can expand 

δR = δij 1 
2 

(∂i∂rδhjr + ∂j∂rδhir − ∂i∂jδh−∇2δhij), (27) 

where ∇2 be the laplacian in n-dimension flat space, with n be the dimens of the 
constant-tim slice. now consid take the radon transform of both side of equat (27) 
along (n− 1)-dimension hyperplanes. We can derive5 

r[δr] = −r‖[∇2δhij]. (28) 

radon transform obey an intertwin relat [50], 

r[∇2f ] = ∂ 
2 

∂p2 
r[f ], (29) 

where p be the distanc from the origin to the hyperplane. from thi and the fact that 
r‖[δhij] = 2δa, we find a relat between the spatial curvatur and the area perturbation, 

r[δr] = −2 ∂ 
2 

∂p2 
δa. (30) 

compar to (26), we end up with 

− ∂ 
2 

∂p2 
δA = 8πgnr[δttt]. (31) 

To solv (31) for δa, we convolv the sourc with the green function,6 

g(p, q) = (q − p)θ(q − p). (32) 

thi yield 

δA = − 
∫ 

(q − p)θ(q − p)r[8πgδttt] dq (33) 

= −8πgn 
∫ 
C 

∫ 
q>p 

(q − p)δttt dq dn−1σ. (34) 

recal that each surfac C be specifi by a distanc paramet p from the origin and it unit 
normal n̂. then the integr be over the half space up to a surfac with unit normal n̂ and 

5 the deriv be simpler by write the metric in the gaussian normal coordinate. 
6 the full green function have addit term c1p+c2. however, sinc the boundari condit be unknown, 

unlik the case in ads/cft, we fix the coeffici by requir the solut δA match to the rindler 
hamiltonian of the bulk matter fields, by choos c1 = c2 = 0. 

14 



distanc p from the origin. 

B. emerg entangl equilibrium 

We can now connect these classic GR concept to entangl data of an underli 
quantum state in an abstract hilbert space. although the physic mean of equat 
(34) be unambigu in the classic theory, these quantiti should ultim be deriv 
from the quantum state if space be emerg from entanglement. On the left-hand side, a 
we know from previou construct [12], the area perturb δA can be identifi with 
the sum of mutual inform δi/2α along the cut C in an RC state. In the case where the 
overal state be pure, 

δi(σc : σ̄c) = 2δs(σc). (35) 

On the right-hand side of (34), in a semiclass theori we interpret the classic quantiti 

δttt a the expect valu of a quantum oper t̂tt in some particular state of a quantum 
field theori on curv spacetime. We then recogn that the integr in (34) be relat to 
the modular hamiltonian of the right rindler wedg for a quantum field theory, translat 
spatial by p. more explicitly, take p = 0 and identifi the normal of C with the direct in 
which the rindler observ accelerates, which we take to be the x-axis. We then have the 
qft express for the rindler modular hamiltonian, 

ĥmod = 2π 

∫ ∫ 
x>0 

xt̂tt d 
nx. (36) 

We therefor consid the right-hand side of (34) to repres the expect valu of the 
modular hamiltonian of some effect field theori on a flat background, evalu with 
respect to some linear perturb of a quantum state δρeft, such that 

δttt = tr[δρeftt̂tt]. (37) 

In the linear regime, it must also be proport to the entangl entropi pertur- 
bation δseft(c) of the same half-spac demarc by C, via the entangl first law 
[71], 

δ〈ĥmod〉 = δseft(c). (38) 

substitut these new variabl and use (15), (34) becom 

1 

2 
δi(σc : σ̄c) + 4gαδseft(c) = 0 (pure state), (39) 

or use the RC relat (2), 

δs(σc) + 4gnαδseft(c) = 0. (40) 

let u tri to understand thi relat in the context of deriv geometri from a quantum 

15 



state. By construction, δs(σc), which be proport to the area perturbation, be the 
contribut that we have consist identifi with the RC part of the entanglement. the 
more difficult question be how δseft should be identified. recal that from assumpt (a2), 
in ground state of system satisfi an area law [37] or other approximately-redundancy- 
constrain states, one can write the total entangl entropi associ with a subsystem 
Σ a 

stotal(σ) = src(σ) + ssub(σ), (41) 

where the RC contribut src, or the area-sc contribut when there be a well-defin 
geometry, domin over the sublead correct ssub. motiv by the RT formula 
with sublead corrections, we claim in assumpt (a5) that seft can be interpret a 
origin from the sublead correct ssub to the RC entropi contribution. We will 
further discu thi claim and it similar with a gener form of the RT formula in 
section V. 

jacobson [19] deriv einstein’ equat in a semiclass bulk spacetim from the 
concept of entangl equilibrium. thi be the assumpt that the total entangl 
entropi of a small ball in some maximally-symmetr background spacetim be extremal, 
i.e., δstotal = 0 when a small perturb be added. To complet the derivation, one have to 
separ the entangl into UV and IR contributions, such that δstotal = δsuv + δsir. 
In [19], δsuv ∼ δA be assum to be the area variat in some background geometri and 
δsir be identifi with the entangl entropi of a field theori regul in some way. 

our equat (40) relat geometr entropi to the entropi perturb of an emerg 
eft can be thought of a a version of the modifi entangl equilibrium condit 
(meec) from assumpt (a4). the geometr term correspond to the UV contribution, 
while the eft (matter) term correspond to the infrared, 

δs(σc)↔ δsuv ↔ δsrc, (42) 

4gnαδseft(c)↔ δsir ↔ δssub, (43) 

and the condit (40) state that these sum to zero near the background. A crucial dif- 
ference, however, be instead of entangl across some small ball center at a point, the 
condit now have to hold across all cut C make by (n − 1)-dimension totally-geodes 
submanifold in the background space. thi also differ from [19] in that one no longer have 
to reli on cft modular hamiltonian by assum the special properti of the matter field 
theori have an UV fix point. the result hold for a gener qft with the correspond 
rindler hamiltonian. 

for now, we will proceed with the identif δssub = δseft. thi fix the constant 
α = 1/4gn , the valu requir for the consist of einstein’ equat and the holograph 
bound. consequently, meec translat into a more gener relation, wherebi UV and IR 
portion of the entropi be identifi not base on assumpt in semiclass physics, but 

16 



rather on the properti of quantum entanglement, 

0 = δstotal 

= δsrc + δssub 

= αδa+ δseft. (44) 

with thi identification, the abov relat be a necessari condit for a state to have 
emerg properti consist with gener rel at low energies. 

therefore, by make the identif that the sublead entropi to RC with matter 
field entropy, similar to the vacuum-subtract (casini) entropi [32–34], we establish an 
equival between the modifi entangl equilibrium condit (44) and the radon 
transform of the linear hamiltonian constraint (31). thi argument can also be use 
to gener the result of [4] in ads/cft to other (non-flat) geometries, a long a the 
function be invert under radon transform in the background riemannian manifold. 

C. linear einstein equat from entangl 

We can now put the pictur togeth to deriv dynam for the emerg spacetim 
geometry, in a way similar to [19]. for the sake of convenience, let’ assum that from our 
previou result one have alreadi emerg a flat background geometri from md or tensor 
radon transform techniques. similar to the ads/cft case consid in [4], we now wish to 
determin if the geometr deform from entangl perturb respond in a way 
consist with einstein gravity. A similar conclus can also be gener to hyperbol 
space use md with a best fit curvatur paramet follow the procedur of [29], but 
we will not consid that case here. 

consid the quantum system from which flat space be emergent. for concreteness, the 
total system could be describ by a quantum state |ψ〉 ∈ H = 

⊗ 
ihi, a in assumpt 

(a1). A subsystem be thu describ by the reduc densiti oper associ with some 
hilbert subspace. ani cut C that correspond to a codimension-1 hyperplan in the emerg 
geometri will bipartit the system into two adjac non-overlap regions. one can 
comput the entangl entropi for either region Σ, which read s(σ) = src(σ)+ssub(σ), 
a in (a2). now we add a perturb to obtain |ψ〉 = |ψ〉 + δ|ψ〉. the perturb will 
modifi the entanglement, which in turn chang the emerg geometry, follow the area 
perturb defin by (a3). 

the meec assumpt (a4) relat perturb in the RC and subdomin contri- 
bution to the entropi across C, 

0 = δsrc + δssub. (45) 

use assumpt (a5) to relat the subdomin term to the vacuum-subtract entropi 
of an effect field theory, the meec be equival to the (scalar) radon transform of the 
classic hamiltonian constraint linear against a flat background, 

r[δr] = 16πgnr[δttt], (46) 

17 



a argu in the previou subsection. here δR be the spatial curvatur perturb and 
δttt be the linear perturb of the stress-energi associ with an effect field theori 
live on the background. becaus thi relat hold for all such cut in the flat background 
space, equat (46) uniqu determin the linear hamiltonian constraint, 

δR = 16πgnδttt, (47) 

provid the invers be well-defined. 
follow assumpt (a6) about dynamics, we consid a sequenc of state |ψ(t)〉 la- 

bele by a singl paramet t, which togeth describ a lorentzian spacetime. the corre- 
spond emerg spatial geometri can be thought of a emb spacelik slice in a 
spacetim with coordin in synchron gauge. In term of a unit timelik vector field tµ 

normal to these slices, the hamiltonian constraint (47) can be write a 

δgµνt 
µtν = 8πgnδtµνt 

µtν . (48) 

under the lorentz-invari assumpt (a7), thi must be valid for arbitrari normal tµ. 
We therefor have the full linear einstein’ equation, 

δgµν = 8πgnδtµν . (49) 

while the number of conjectur assumpt need to reach the result be admittedli consid- 
erable, we find the path we’v outlin to be a promis rout to deriv bulk gravit 
dynam directli from the evolut of an abstract wave function in hilbert space. 

V. entangl RT formula and quantum error correct 

It would be use to have a more systemat approach to decompos an abstract 
quantum state into geometr (uv) and matter (ir) degre of freedom. In the previou 
section we propos one such procedure, identifi src = αA and ssub = seft when 
the state be approxim RC and admit an emerg geometry. thi identif also 
propos a background-fre way of understand these “uv” and “ir” entropi pure 
from the characterist of entanglement, which can be do for arbitrari quantum states. 

In thi section, we will connect these observ with the ryu-takayanagi (rt) formula 
from ads/cft. We will also argu that more gener emerg geometri can be assign to 
quantum error correct codes, where the code subspac natur separ the geometr 
and matter contribut to entangl entropy. our consider here be tent 
(even by the standard of the rest of the paper), and would requir more elabor to 
make precise. 

let’ first recal the RT entropi relat in the case of ads/cft with a sublead N0 

correct [72], 

scft(a) = 
aext(a) 

4gn 
+ sbulk. (50) 

here, scft(a) be the entangl entropi of a subregion A in the boundari field theory, 

18 



aext(a) denot the area of a bulk extrem surfac homolog to A, and sbulk be a correct 
repres contribut from bulk matter fields. 

the RT formula relat boundari quantiti to bulk quantiti in a holograph setting. 
but there be an obviou analog to the beg relat 

stotal = src + ssub (51) 

= 
a(c) 
4G 

+ seft(c) (52) 

for a cut C by a total geodes codimension-1 submanifold of an emerg spacetime. In thi 
case, the meec be an infinitesim version of (52), and can be interpret a a perturb 
version of an rt-like relat for which δscft = 0. It may be possibl to understand thi 
relat from a more gener perspective, in which ads/cft be a special case manifest a 
a duality. 

If we interpret the bulk ad a an emerg entiti from the boundari conform field 
theory, we can think of the cft to be the fundament theory, from which we reconstruct 
a theori in the IR that describ bulk gravity. In thi emerg limit, differ part of the 
entangl entropi of the suppos fundament theori take on other physic mean 
relat to geometri and matter. In [73], lin propos that such a separ of entangl 
may also be understood in a more gener setting, where the “fundamental” theory, whose 
hilbert space factor and do not have a gaug symmetry, have an emerg gaug theori 
in the ir.7 As such, the entangl entropi sfund of a subregion in the fundament theori 
can be write in a form sfund = sedg +sir. here sedge, which depend on the UV regul 
such a a lattic cutoff, take on the mean of the analog area-law term in rt. the IR 
entropi sir correspond to the entangl of the emerg gaug theori 

8. 
therefore, we may also specul that a geometri other than ad emerg from a funda- 

mental theori that be amorphous, in the sens that there be no pre-determin geometr 
elements. In thi case, a gener of the RT formula (50) should still provid a natur 
separ between UV and IR and identif of the geometr and matter part of the 
entangl without someth like a 1/n expansion. it’ worth investig the prospect 
that thi can be do directli from the state and it associ hilbert space. 

here we point out anoth possibl construct propos by harlow [28] make use of 
quantum error correct code (qecc), or more specifically, the erasur correct codes. 
A similar rt-like formula be deriv in the context of quantum error correction, without 
have to reli on a background geometry. for the sake of clariti we briefli review some 
find of [28]. 

A typic way to protect state against quantum error be to encod the inform non- 
locally, such that local error will not easili contamin the protect information. for 
instance, let |φ〉 ∈ Hφ be a qudit worth of quantum information. one can encod it in a 
larg hilbert space 

H = (hφ)⊗n . (53) 

A basi for H can be form from the tensor product of basi vector |ij〉 of each copi j of 
7 A gaug theori be emerg if the low energi behavior of the fundament theori can be identifi with 

that of a gaug theory. We refer the reader to the origin refer for the precis definit use in the 

derivations. 
8 similar idea appear in the studi of emerg graviti in condens matter model [74] with emerg 

gaug theori [75]. 
19 



hφ. To encod the origin state 

|φ〉 = 
∑ 
i 

ci|i〉 ∈ Hφ (54) 

by map it to H, we first map each basi element by some fix rule, 

|i〉 → |̃i〉 = 
∑ 

i1,i2...in 

µĩi1i2...in |i1, i2 . . . in〉 (55) 

for some coeffici µĩi1i2...in . the encod then take the form 

|φ〉 → |φ̃〉 = 
∑ 
ĩ 

cĩ |̃i〉 ∈ H. (56) 

the vector subspac of H span by {|̃i〉} be the code subspace, hcode. 

To be consist with the notat in the literature, we will refer to the N qudit make 
up H a the physic qudits. let A be a subsystem consist of a subset of the physic 
qudits, and Ā it complement, so that 

H = HA ⊗hā. (57) 

the encod inform be say to be protect against erasur on Ā if for all 

|φ̃〉 ∈ hcode ⊂ H, (58) 

there exist an oper UA ⊗ iā such that 

UA ⊗ iā|φ̃〉a∪ā = |φ〉j∈a ⊗ |χ〉a∪ā\{j} (59) 

for some state |χ〉 ∈ ⊗i 6=jhφ. intuitively, thi properti allow one to recov the encod 
quantum inform even though degre of freedom in hā be inaccessible. 

now consid the scenario in which the code subspac can encod mani qudits. one 
construct be to consid a qecc in which the code subspac factor 

hcode = Ha ⊗hā. (60) 

We want the subset a of these code-subspac qudit to be recover from the subsystem 
A of the larg hilbert space, and similarli the complementari set ā to be recover from 
ā. assum each of ha,hā be further factorizable: 

HA = ha1 ⊗ha2 , hā = hā1 ⊗hā2 , (61) 

20 



where dimha1 = dimhā1 = dimhcode. As demonstr by harlow, a qecc that perform 
the desir complementari recovery, which satisfi 

|̃i〉|j̃〉 = uauā(|i〉a1|j〉ā1 |χ〉a2ā2) (62) 

for some entangl state |χ〉a2ā2 and unitari ua⊗iā, ia⊗uā, will also satisfi an analog 
RT relation. here, |̃i〉, |j̃〉,|i〉a1 , |j〉ā1 be orthonorm basi vector for the hilbert space 
ha, hā, ha1 and hā1 respectively. 

given a densiti oper in the code subspac 

ρ̃ = |φ̃〉〈φ̃| ∈ l(hcode) ⊂ l(h), (63) 

defin reduc densiti matrix 

ρ̃a = trā ρ̃ (64) 

ρ̃a = trā ρ̃ (65) 

ρχ = trā2 |χ〉〈χ|. (66) 

the result rt-like relat for the entropi then take the form, 

s(ρ̃a) = s(ρχ) + s(ρ̃a) 

s(ρ̃ā) = s(ρχ) + s(ρ̃ā), (67) 

In the familiar exampl of holograph tensor network and quantum error correct 
code [39, 40], the term s(ρχ) be proport to the area of the minim RT surfac anchor 
at the boundari of a.9 consequently, the term s(ρχ) can be understood a the geometr 
entangl contribution, while s(ρ̃a) be natur identifi with the “matter” contribut 
to bulk entropy. the sum of these two quantiti be equal to s(ρ̃a), which be the entangl 
entropi of the boundari subregion A. 

thi gener rt-like formula can be compar to our equat for the entangl 
entropi of a subsystem (41) a the sum of an RC contribut and a subdomin correction. 
In particular, the emerg entangl equilibrium relat (40) can be thought of a the 
first-ord variat of thi formula, with the first term repres an area and the second 
the contribut from the emerg eft. In thi sense, the entropi formula underli 
beg can be found more gener in the context of quantum error-correct codes. thi 
relat help shed light on the decomposit of the entangl entropi into UV geometr 
contribut and IR contribut from matter fields. 

the deriv lead to (67) make no refer to a pre-exist geometri or holog- 
raphy. indeed, it be reason to expect such properti to appli to context more gener 

9 for example, the entropi s(χ) be comput by a distil process and count the bell pair in sec 4 

of [39]. the cut along the bell pair be precis the bulk minim surfac γaā anchor at the boundari 

of A and ā. 

21 



than ads/cft. In particular, convent qecc a well a the operator-algebra quan- 
tum error correct seem directli applic to bulk entangl gravity. In fact, they 
can be use to reconstruct a geometri a long a a notion of entangl entropi can be 
consist defin and computed. 

In the case we be current interest in, the overal finite-dimension hilbert space H 
in beg can be identifi with the physic hilbert space in qecc. A state |ψ〉 that encod 
geometr inform correspond to the code state |φ̃〉 ∈ H above. the subsystem A in the 
form of physic qudit can be identifi with some collect of hilbert space factor (graph 
vertices) in beg. In addition, the code come equip with a code subspac hcode ⊂ H 
which be now identifi with the IR subspac of the emerg matter fields. thus, a natur 
separ of UV (geometric) and IR (matter) degre of freedom be simpli provid by the 
subspac or subalgebra associ with a qecc. 

hence, a spatial geometri can be obtain and assign to quantum error correct 
code that do not presum a geometr interpret a priori. beg can be particularli 
use in the case when one consid deviat from maxim symmetr spaces. for a 
dynam theori that preserv the code subspac and lorentz invariance, the linear 
einstein’ equat may emerg a a more gener property, rather than come from a 
special theory. 

vi. discuss 

In thi work, we have extend the “space from hilbert space” program of [12], which 
posit that spatial geometri can emerg from the entangl featur of appropri quan- 
tum states, to consid the gravit dynam of spacetime. By suggest a modifi 
entangl equilibrium condit a well a other assumptions, we be abl to sketch how 
the spacetim metric can be reconstruct from entangl use the radon transform, 
and it how it natur obey einstein’ equat at the linear level. our analysi be 
carri out entir in (what emerg as) the bulk of spacetime; the entangl we consid 
be between hilbert-spac factor repres local degre of freedom, without refer to 
ads/cft or ani other holograph boundari construction. colloquially, thi bulk entan- 
glement graviti approach can be thought of a find graviti within quantum mechanics, 
a oppos to the more convent approach of quantiz a particular model of spacetim 
structure. It also seem to indic the plausibl of discov gravit featur from 
more gener complex quantum systems. 

further work will clearli be requir to flesh out thi program and put the necessari 
assumpt on a firmer footing. We can list a few of the big loom questions. 

• one be to explor the feasibl of develop a specif theori of quantum graviti use 
quantum inform beyond the context of ads/cft, for exampl by specifi 
an explicit hamiltonian, but perhap by less direct means. for instance, a set of 
constraint on the quantum dynam could be deriv by requir the emerg of 
classic gener relativity. 

• geometri from entangl be an interest program all by itself, even without 
the emerg of gravity. It be import to understand how and if more gener 
emerg geometries, possibl along with their metric tensors, can be reconstruct 
from entangl data. 

22 



• It be also import to address the hope that lorentz symmetri can be emergent. 
while there have be discuss mostli in the loop quantum graviti and condens 
matter communities, a clear understand of it feasibl be still lacking. 

• given the recent interest in emerg gaug theori in condens matter models, it 
may be possibl to understand if certain condens matter model can be “gravitized” 
by emerg the geometri through entangl of a state, instead of use the pre- 
exist geometri provid by the lattic structur or hamiltonian. thi may yield 
interest toy model that exhibit (analogous) featur of gravity. 

• It would be use to contempl the emerg of holographi from thi perspective, 
go beyond the weak-field graviti context consid here. 

In addition, one can point to a few more circumscrib and well-defin challenges. 

• the beg framework be natur for assign emerg geometri to tensor network 
directli from entanglement. It be also use for deriv emerg geometri for con- 
vention qecc a well a their gener in the form of operator-algebras. It 
may be interest to construct toy model use these concret tool set to improv 
our intuit for the program. 

• gener the tensor radon transform approach to other riemannian backgrounds. 
one particular direct be to make contact with ads/cft by consid asymptot- 
ical hyperbol spaces. 

• anoth task be to further understand the uv/ir separation. sinc qecc provid 
a natur separ and a concret test ground, specif toy model may be con- 
struct that have non-trivi dynam properti [76]. effort in thi direct would 
also improv our understand in add backreact and incorpor gener ge- 
ometri in a tensor network model. On the other hand, geometr character 
may also help categor entangl and code properties. 

• It would be use to understand how gener the meec be in quantum system near 
equilibrium, and what physic interpret can be attach to the two terms. 

thi work have be guid by the convict that quantum mechan be the most fun- 
dament theori we have, and implicitli by the everettian formul of the theori (the 
wave function be the onli physic variable, and it evolv smoothli and determinist 
over time). In that context, one can argu inform that quantum graviti must emerg in 
roughli the way outlin here. We human be gener construct quantum theori by 
start with classic theori and quantiz them, but presum natur doesn’t work 
that way. there simpli be a quantum state, repres by a vector in hilbert space, evolv- 
ing accord to the schröding equat with some particular hamiltonian. (for these 
purpos we take time a fundamental, but it be also conceiv that time itself be emer- 
gent, aris through the entangl of “system” and “clock” factor of hilbert space.) 
familiar classic concept such a “locat in space” and “fields” be necessarili emerg 
from thi basic structure. here we have sketch how space and it geometri may plausibl 
emerg from the entangl between discret hilbert-spac factors, and how gravit 
dynam obey einstein’ equat can be relat to entangl equilibrium. the be a 
promis rout to a perspect on quantum graviti that put “quantum” first.
