progress IN human health and life expect be close associ with 
socioeconom development. better nutrit and great afford of 
health care associ with high incom have be wide consid a 
primari determin of histor and contemporari mortal declines. 
mckeown’ (1976) influenti book on the modern rise of popul at- 
tribut the secular mortal declin larg to improv standard of liv- 
ing. review mortal improv in britain dure the second half of 
the nineteenth centuri and the begin of the twentieth, he argu that 
medic discoveri be of littl consequ for the signific gain in 
surviv dure thi period. hi analysi serv a a refer point of pre- 
ston’ (1975) article, which be the focu of the present study. preston show 
that the global pattern over the twentieth centuri indic an upward shift 
of the curv that link gdp per person on the horizont axi and life ex- 
pectanc on the vertic (figur 1).1 preston interpret thi shift a the 
effect of medic progress and health care over and abov the effect of in- 
come. In mani of the studi of thi issu that follow preston’ lead, the 
assumpt that incom be the most import driver of mortal declin 
have be an unquest start point. 

A veri differ pictur be drawn by caldwel in a 1986 articl on 
rout to low mortal in poor countries. base on a major rockefel 
foundat studi on kerala (india), sri lanka, and costa rica, caldwel 
discuss the factor that lead to breakthrough mortal declin in those 
popul a oppos to other and identifi “femal autonomy,” which 
he saw larg a a function of femal education, a the singl most im- 
portant factor, togeth with effici local health services. He also state 
that hi conclus that low mortal do not come a an unplan 
spinoff from econom growth be “out of step with today’ domin eco-

p. 209). and thi still seem to be the case three decad later, despit the 
fact that more recent research point to the overrid import of educa- 
tion and the associ cognit chang affect risk perception, plan 
horizon, and access to inform promot health-rel behavior and 
use of health care facil (baker et al. 2011; lutz and skirbekk 2014). 

the question whether incom or educ be the more import de- 
termin of global health and mortal declin be relev for set pol- 
ici prioriti in both develop and industri countries. the answer be 
of immedi concern in choos between program that directli promot 
econom growth and those that focu on enhanc school enrol and 
qualiti of schooling. In an ideal world one would choos both in addit 
to good local health servic but, in reality, even in rich countri there be 
budgetari constraint that requir policymak to set priorities. for help- 
ing to set these priorities, it be necessari to ass the rel import of 
both factors. the question of rel import be the focu of what fol- 
lows. We address the issu at the macro level by plot a modif of 
the preston curv in which gdp per person be replac by mean year of 
school among the adult population. thi be do both for life expect 
at birth and for child mortality, and in both case educ attain ex- 
plain the pattern good than gdp per person. thi redraw of the curv 
be complement by a multivari analysi to quantit ass the 
rel differ of the two effects. 

the preston curv and it percept 

In 1975 samuel preston publish an influenti paper, “the chang re- 
lation between mortal and level of econom development,” in which he 
plot the global relationship between gdp per caput and life expect at 
differ point in time. He find that over time the curv that depict the 
relationship have move upward, impli that a similar level of incom be 
associ with high life expect at late point in time (preston 1975). 
He attribut thi extra gain to medic progress. thi view of the relation- 
ship, know a the preston curve, have sinc becom wide cited. although 
preston be cautiou in interpret thi relationship a an associ and 
not necessarili a causal one, subsequ interpret of thi relat of- 
ten have no doubt that it be base on direct causat (e.g., pritchett and 
summer 1996). 

In a more elabor follow-up study, preston (1980) introduc liter- 
aci and calori suppli in addit to gdp per person into regress model 
to explain differ in level of life expect for 36 countri in 1940 
and 120 countri in 1970. the estim coeffici show similar pat- 
tern for both times, and literaci be highli significant. In preston’ words: 
“the coeffici indic that a 10 percentag point increas in literaci be 
associ at both point with a gain in life expect of approxim 2 



4 educat ion and health 

years, and that a 10% gain in nation incom by itself increas life ex- 
pectanc by approxim one-half year” (preston 1980, p. 306). these 
interest findings, however, be larg overlook in subsequ re- 
search on develop and mortality. 

thi appar posit associ between incom and health have 
give rise to the widespread view among develop economist that in- 
creas wealth lead causal to increas health. In the extreme, pritchett 
and summer (1996) argu that focu on econom growth in develop- 
ing countri will lead directli to reduct in infant mortal rate and 
gain in life expectancy. while mani other economist hold a less defini- 
tive posit and acknowledg driver in addit to income, the possibl 
that the appar empir associ between incom and health could 
be larg spuriou and not of a causal natur have not be consid in 
thi bodi of econom literature. 

In 2007 an issu of the intern journal of epidemiologywa devot 
to a reprint of preston’ 1975 articl and sever comment by distinguish 
scholar in the field (iea 2007). In the contribut most relev for our 
analysis, bloom and can (2007) revisit the preston curv and state 
that hi paper “remain a cornerston of both global public health polici 
and academ discuss of public health. preston’ paper illumin two 
central ‘styliz facts’. the first be a strong, posit relationship between 
nation incom level and life expect in poorer countries, though 
the relationship be non-linear a life expect level in richer countri 
be less sensit to variat in averag income. the second be that the 
relationship be changing, with life expect increas over time at all 
incom levels. … although the basic fact set out by preston be gener 
accepted, there be still a great deal of disput about the mechan that 
lie behind the relationship and the polici implic we can draw from 
them” (p. 498). 

bloom and can also point to anoth bodi of literatur in pub- 
lic health in which, for example, cutler, deaton, and lleras-muney (2006) 
conclud that scientif and technic advanc should be see a “the ul- 
timat determin of health.” A further argument against focu on in- 
come growth a the primari method of reduc the burden of ill health 
lie in the appar veri weak tempor associ between period of 
econom growth and period of improv in popul health, sug- 
gest that if the relationship be causal, it have long and variabl lags. 
while rise incom impli great resourc for society, these resourc 
need not necessarili be spent in way that improv health. while bloom 
and can do not question the basic assumpt that incom growth and 
health be close linked, they add a cautionari sentenc that be the start 
point for our study: “although there be a strong case for the direct effect 
of incom on health due to nutrit and health intervent becom 
more affordable, it may be that incom be also act a a proxi for a wider 



wolfgang lutz / endal kebed 5 

measur of socioeconom statu and develop and that the causal effect 
be due to other mechanisms, for example, education” (p. 498). 

In a more recent assess of the preston curve, mackenbach and 
looman (2013) find that for european countri increas in life expect 
after 1960 have be accompani by a much small upward shift in the 
curv than previously. they attribut thi to a chang pattern of caus 
of death away from infecti diseas and conclud that “declin in mor- 
taliti from cardiovascular diseas be mainli attribut to increas in 
nation income.” thi conclus seem to be reach simpli by eliminat- 
ing medic progress a a domin reason and assum that the onli 
other possibl determin of mortal be income, which thu should be 
the caus of thi decline. the possibl of anoth driver that jointli deter- 
mine incom and health and caus their correl be not considered. 

In thi article, we address the hypothesi that the appar statisti- 
cal associ between incom and health—a describ by the preston 
curve—could in fact be a larg spuriou associ result from the fact 
that improv educ attain be a key determin of both good 
health and rise incomes. befor do so, we discu the issu of causality. 

On causal 

the question of the causal natur of the effect of educ and incom 
on health have attract much attent and controversy. It be a question 
that need to be address in order to rule out the possibl that the as- 
sociat that be be interpret could also be spurious. the question 
have import polici implications. if, for instance, the empir associ 
between incom and health be not directli causal but rather due to a third 
factor such a education, then an increas in income—e.g., through poli- 
cie directli aim at econom growth—would not result in the expect 
health improv unless educ attain also improv simul- 
taneously. the same be true mutati mutandi for the associ between 
educ attain and health. 

causal in the social scienc have to be view differ than in 
the natur scienc becaus human behavior be cultur emb and 
what be found to be direct causat of behavior in a give set cannot be 
assum to have univers predict power for all societi and all times. 
inspir by the comprehens review of causal in demographi by Ní 
bhrolcháin and dyson (2007), lutz and skirbekk (2014) introduc the no- 
tion of “function causality” in the context of “intervent sciences” (lutz 
and striessnig 2015; pearl 2000). intervent scienc be the social and 
econom scienc that tri to understand how the most import forc 
of chang in a societi function in order to predict the futur evolut of 
the social system. such condit predict about futur trend can be 



6 educat ion and health 

base on the assumpt of no intervent or of altern intervent 
and their like consequences. 

To establish function causality, three criterion have to be met: (i) there 
must be strong empir observ associ between the two factor 
studied; (ii) there must be a plausibl narr about the mechan 
through which one forc influenc the other; and (iii) other obviou 
compet explan of the observ associ should be rule out. 
exampl of such compet explan be self-selection, revers causal- 
ity, and joint determin by a third forc (lutz and KC 2011; lutz 
and skirbekk 2014). lutz and skirbekk (2014) give a comprehens 
overview of dozen of relev studi on the topic and conclud that it 
be justifi to assum function causal for the global-level relationship 
between educ attain and health/mort over the twentieth 
and twenty-first centuries. 

sever global assess of the relationship between health and 
mortal (baker et al. 2011; KC and lentzner 2010; pamuk, fuchs, and 
lutz 2011) show that, on all contin and at differ level of socio- 
econom development, the less-educ segment of the popul have 
significantli high mortal and morbid than those who be good ed- 
ucated. In virtual all countries, child of better-educ mother ex- 
perienc low mortality. but sinc better-educ peopl also tend to 
live in richer households, the question arises: what be more import for 
child surviv in develop countries, mothers’ educ or household in- 
come/wealth? thi question have be the focu of studi use the larg 
avail individual-level data set by pool the sampl of demograph 
and health survey (dhs) in 43 develop countri (fuchs, pamuk, and 
lutz 2010; pamuk, fuchs, and lutz 2011). use multi-level regress 
models, analysi of the rel effect of mother’ educ and econom 
resourc on infant mortal at the family, community, and countri level 
show that the effect of educ clearli domin over income/wealth 
at all levels. the empir evid be equal compel for the effect of 
educ on adult mortality. In virtual all countri for which data exist, 
better-educ peopl have high life expect (caselli et al. 2014). 
the differ vari in extent among countri and be gener great 
for men than for women. among industri countries, differ tend 
to be low in southern european countri and be high in eastern 
europe. In russia, the differ between the high and low educ 
group among adult men be up to 12 year (caselli et al. 2014). It have also 
be show that the overal declin in life expect that russian men ex- 
perienc over the 1990 be driven by a strong declin among the low 
educ group wherea the high group continu to enjoy moder 
increas (shkolnikov et al. 2006). In virtual all industri countri 
for which data be available, the educ differenti in adultmort in- 
creas over time despit improv health care coverag in most countri 



wolfgang lutz / endal kebed 7 

(caselli et al. 2014). one explan for thi pattern lie in the increas 
import of lifestyle-rel factor for which educ seem to be more 
import than the health care system. 

there be a plausibl narr of causat that be found in brain re- 
search. It have be demonstr that literaci and educ in gener en- 
hanc the synapt densiti in relev part of our brain and thu make 
u physiolog differ for the rest of our life (kandel 2007). It have 
also be show in a control experi among illiter indian young 
adult men that the sub-sampl who be taught how to read and write 
have last structur chang in their brain after six month of learn- 
ing that be associ with execut function and cognit abil 
(baker, salinas, and esling 2012; blair et al. 2005; brinch and galloway 
2012; skeid et al. 2017). neurocognit and neuroimag studi have 
show strong associ between adapt chang in the brain and learn- 
ing experi in the classroom (lewi et al. 2009; welberg 2009). these 
chang have be show to be associ with abil for abstract thinking, 
time preference, and the capac to plan for the futur (cutler and lleras- 
muney 2010; kenkel 1991; van der pol 2011; heckman, humphries, and 
veramendi 2017). these cognit chang and result chang in behav- 
ior have relev for health outcomes. In thi context, it should also be 
stress that the larg number of studi that focu on natur experi 
for the education/health link by look at chang in compulsori school- 
ing by a year do not seem to be a promis rout becaus they do not 
refer to a plausibl causal pathway. when young peopl be forc to stay 
in school against their will for ten rather than nine years, thi be unlik to 
result in a signific chang in their overal brain function that would 
be expect to have direct health effects. but such relev chang have 
be show for major cognit transit such a from illiter to liter 
or from compulsori to post-secondari educ (cutler and lleras-muney 
2010; peter et al. 2006; skeid et al. 2017). 

anoth concern in the context of assess function causal be the 
possibl of revers causality, which be also implicit in the notion of simul- 
taneity. thi can pose a difficult challeng if there be reason to assum simul- 
taneou influenc go in both directions. model of granger causal can 
be use to sort out the tempor sequenc of possibl effect that can then be 
the basi of causal infer base on the principl that the caus need to 
preced the effect. but in the case of educ suchmodel be unnecessari 
becaus the tempor sequenc can be identifi a priori. school tend to 
happen earli in the life course, and it be onli the human capit (educ 
stock) at adult age that be expect to have consequ for health-rel 
behavior. the time lag between when the school happen (educ 
flow) and when the result stock of human capit influenc health can 
be mani decad and, when we studi the education/health differenti for 
peopl abov age 70, even half a century. hence, onc a proper distinct be

figur 2 triangular interact between educ flow and stocks, 
health, and incom 

make between educ flow and educ attainment, there be no way 
in which period condit at time t (includ income, medic inventions, 
etc.) can influenc the school that occur decad before. 

with respect to the possibl that the empir associ be caus 
by a third factor, differ pathway of causat need to be distinguished. 
figur 2 show the possibl interact between education, health, and in- 
come in the form of a triangl with educ and health at the base and 
incom at the top. the cognit skill associ with adult educ 
attain and a person’ health statu be close interwoven and both 
embodi in individuals. A certain minimum level of physic health be nec- 
essari for a child to develop mental and to be abl to attend school. partic- 
ularli in develop countries, school absente due to poor health of the 
child themselv or of famili member for whom they must care or for 
whose lose econom output they must compens be a seriou handicap for 
improv level of educ and, consequently, the build of key cog- 
nitiv skill and rais learn outcomes. similarly, child often bring 
home from school knowledge, attitudes, and access to inform relev 
to the health and even surviv of themselv and their famili members. 

better health and longer life be not onli close link to educa- 
tion and cognit capac but also in turn directli affect econom growth. 
A grow literatur show that health be both a direct sourc of human 
welfar and a driver of incom growth (bloom and can 2008). In 
particular, three mechan have be defined: good health lead to 
high labor productivity, good childhood health lead to good school 



wolfgang lutz / endal kebed 9 

attend and cognit development, and a longer expect life span lead- 
ing to more save and investment. empir studi also find that good 
health have a positive, sizable, and statist signific effect on aggre- 
gate output, even control for the experi of the work forc (bloom, 
canning, and sevilla 2003). thewho-sponsor report of the commiss 
on macroeconom and health (sach 2001) also highlight the impor- 
tanc of basic health for poverti reduct by show how the burden of 
diseas in some low-incom countries, especi in sub-saharan africa, 
be a barrier to econom growth and therefor should be address in ani 
comprehens develop strategy. 

finally, the effect of improv educ attain and qualiti of 
educ have long be a part of econom growth theory. past empir 
effort to demonstr thi effect on the basi of aggreg time seri have 
be hamper by the lack of appropri data on educ attain 
(de la fuent and doménech 2006). more recent assess base on full 
educ attain distribut by age cohort demonstr the consis- 
tentli posit and signific effect of human capit on econom growth 
(crespo cuaresma, lutz, and sanderson 2014; lutz, crespo cuaresma, and 
sanderson 2008). the same have be show with respect to qualiti of ed- 
ucat for countri where such data exist (hanushek and woessmann 
2008). 

updat the global empir analysi 
for 1970–2010 

To explor the associ between educ attainment, income, and 
mortal across time and space, we employ a balanc panel of 174 coun- 
tri (both develop and developing) over the period 1970–2010 in five- 
year intervals. follow the logic of preston’ 1975 and 1980 papers, we 
first present graphic present of the bi-vari relationship between 
gdp per person and life expectancy, follow by multivari statist 
analyses. We also studi the pattern with respect to child mortality. while 
the dichotom variabl of literaci be the onli one avail to preston, 
we use mean year of school of the adult popul age 15 and old 
in the case of life expect and of woman age 20–39 in the case of child 
mortality. 

data 

data be obtain mainli from two sources. country-level indic of 
educ attain for the year 1970–2015 be extract from the 
wittgenstein centr data explor (wic 2015). panel data on incom and 
mortal be obtain from the world develop indic (world 
bank 2017). merg the two dataset give u our panel of data with 



10 educat ion and health 

onli a few miss data for some countri in earli years. follow 
preston’ origin design, incom be measur a gdp per person (2010 con- 
stant usd). for themultivari analysis, we also perform sensit run 
where ppp (purchas power parity) per person be use instead of con- 
stant 2010 usd. 

descript analysi 

figur 3 present a visual analysi of the cross-countri associ be- 
tween income, educ attainment, and life expect for the year 
1970, 1990, and 2010, similar to the way in which preston (1975) plot- 
ted life expect against gdp per person for the 1930 and 1960s. In 
panel A, the plot of life expect at birth against gdp per person for 1970, 
1990, and 2010 close resembl the pattern of the origin preston curv 
(figur 1). the curv clearli continu to move upward over time. this, 
accord to preston, be due to the factor other than incom that he as- 
sum to be mostli relat to medic progress and health care. panel B 
of the figur show an isomorph curv with the onli differ that gdp 
per person be replac by mean year of school of the adult popul 
(mys15+). the result pattern, however, differ consider in that ris- 
ing educ attain seem to explain rise life expect much 
good than gdp per person. the associ look much more linear with- 
out a level off at high levels, and there be veri littl upward shift that 
would indic an unexplain gap that need to be explain by medic 
progress. 

figur 4 show the correspond pair of curv in which life ex- 
pectanc be replac by child mortal (age 0–4) in order to see whether 
the previou pattern also hold for thi mortal rate, which be often more 
easili influenc by target health intervent than be overal life ex- 
pectancy. here, mean year of school of woman age 20–39 be use a 
the educ indicator. In panel A, the plot of child mortal against gdp 
per person show essenti the same pattern a for life expect v gdp 
per person in panel A of figur 3. panel B of the figur reveal that the rela- 
tionship looksmuchmor linear for educ than for gdp per person; and 
for 1970–1990 there be no shift in the curves, with chang in mothers’ edu- 
cation evid explain declin child mortal much good than gdp 
per person. for 1990–2010, however, there be an interest deviat from 
thi gener pattern, a child mortal in the high-mortality/low-educ 
countri declin more rapidli than would be expect from the gain in 
mothers’ educ over the same period. evidently, thi be the consequ 
of the massiv intern child health intervent in those countri 
over the past two decades. thi show that, at least with respect to child 
mortality, concert public health effort can low mortal more than 
social develop alon would predict.

these multivari result strongli confirm what the visual analysi 
abov suggested: rais educ attain be a much more import 
driver of increas life expect and fall child mortal than income. 
As we discuss in the introduction, thi find should have signific im- 
plicat for priorit polici aim at improv health and longevity. 
under a global perspect over the last half century, increas educ 
attain clearli have be the key factor in improv health, rather than 
increas incom a have frequent be claimed. 

summari and conclus 

We revisit the influenti 1975 paper by preston on the relationship be- 
tween incom and life expect across most countri of the world for 
the 1930 and 1960 and extend the analysi to the period 1970–2015. 
We demonstr that the distinct pattern identifi by preston, show- 
ing a strongli concav relationship and an upward shift of the curves, 
continu over the subsequ half centuri a assess at the global 
level. 

We then plot the same kind of relationship replac gdp per per- 
son with the mean year of school of the adult popul to see whether 
educ attain could be a good predictor of life expect than 
income. the associ turn out to be veri different, with the curv 
becom larg linear and overlapping. thi suggest that educ 
attain be a good predictor in the sens that it effect on life ex- 
pectanc do not diminish at high level and, in particular, it do not 
leav an unexplain shift over time that have to be explain by other 
factors. 

To valid thi visual analysis, we conduct multivari analysi on 
a balanc panel of 174 countri for 1970–2015, which in addit to gdp 
per person and mean year of school of the adult popul includ 
countri and period fixed-effects, and we perform sensit run with 
altern incom indic and weight schemes. In all of the model 
the effect of educ attain on life expect be highli signific 
in the expect direction, and the standard coeffici be clearli larg 
than those of income. 

To consid the possibl of a differ pattern for the determin 
of child mortality, we carri out the analysi separ for under-5 mor- 
tality. again, for the associ with gdp per person there be strong non- 
linear and a shift of the curv over time that be particularli pronounc 
between 1970 and 1990. view in relat to mean year of school 
of woman age 20–39, the relationship again be much more linear with 
virtual no shift between 1970 and 1990. between 1990 and 2010 child 
mortal in the highest-mort countri declinedmor rapidli than sug- 
gest by the gain in mothers’ education. thi be an indic that massiv

effort by the intern commun and privat donor in recent year to 
low child mortal in some of the least develop countri be success- 
ful in do so to a great extent than would be expect from improv 
educ attain alone. thi be not equal the case with respect to 
adult mortality. 

where do thi empir evid leav u with respect to test the 
hypothesi that the empir associ between gdp and life expect 
depict by the preston curv and wide assum in the literatur be a spu- 
riou one, with educ in fact drive both changes? the macro-level 
evid present here strongli support the view that thi be a plausibl 
hypothesi that deserv further elaboration. In our section on causality, 
we also assess the differ specifi criterion for function causality, in- 
clude a strong empir association, a valid narr of the causal mecha- 
nism, and rule out altern explan such a select and revers 
causality. thi strong aggregate-level find should be further explor at 
the individu and commun level under differ cultural, social, and 
econom conditions. 

studi at the micro level be more easili conduct for child mortal 
than for adult mortal sinc the inform can be provid in survey by 
mothers. multi-level analysi of the determin of child mortal across a 
larg number of develop countri have show that mothers’ educ 
at everi level of attain be more import than wealth/income, be 
the domin factor at the household and commun level, and play 
a key role at the nation level (pamuk, fuchs, and lutz 2011). A compa- 
rabl individual-level studi for adult mortal be much more difficult be- 
caus there be no consist data on adult death by education, income, 
and other relev characteristics. even in most industri countri 
with effici vital registr systems, such micro-level analysi will be 
difficult unless a comprehens popul regist exists. with some ex- 
tra effort, censu data that have inform on these characterist can 
be link with inform about subsequ deaths. where such match- 
ing studi have be conducted, they all show signific mortal dif- 
ferenti by level of educ (caselli et al. 2014). but such studi often 
lack the incom inform for compar analysis. for develop coun- 
tries, the data challeng be much great and—poss except for the 
case of demograph surveil systems—prob insurmount at 
present. 

the global time seri analysi of nation data strongli suggest that 
the appar posit associ between health and incom can larg 
be attribut to increas educ attainment, which at the same time 
lead to rise incom (lutz, crespo cuaresma, and sanderson 2008) and 
good health outcomes. while addit individual-level analysi of thi 
issu be needed, the pattern present here suggest that educ should 
be consid a polici prioriti for improv global health.
