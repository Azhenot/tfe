redox-bas resist switch random access memori (reram) offer excel properti to 
implement futur non-volatil memori arrays. recently, the capabl of two-stat reram to 
implement boolean logic function gain wide interest. here, we report on seven-st tantalum 
oxid devices, which enabl the realiz of an intrins modular arithmet use a ternari number 
system. modular arithmetic, a fundament system for oper on number within the limit of a 
modulus, be know to mathematician sinc the day of euclid and find applic in divers area 
rang from e-commerc to music notations. We demonstr that multist devic not onli 
reduc the storag area consumpt drastically, but also enabl novel in-memori operations, such a 
comput use high-radix number systems, which could not be implement use two-stat devices. 
the use of high radix number system reduc the comput complex by reduc the number of 
need digits. thu the number of calcul oper in an addit and the number of logic devic 
can be reduced. 

redox-bas resist switch random access memori (rerams) be consid a one of the most promis- 
ing emerg non-volatil memori technologies1–3. the devic can be scale down to 5 nm4,5, offer endur 
up to 1012 cycles6, 10 year retention7 and fast read/writ speed of below 200 ps8. the devic be switch to a 
low resist state (lrs) for a posit set voltag and switch to the high resist state for a neg reset 
voltage. Up to 8 multi-st have be shown9, allow the storag of up to three binari digit in a singl cell. 
addit reram devic offer highli non-linear switch kinetics, i.e. the set time depend exponenti 
on the puls amplitude10. due to abrupt switch event the common approach be to appli an extern current 
complianc (cc) to enabl multi-level resist states11. the drawback of thi approach be that the final resist 
be defin by the cc, but not by the actual appli puls amplitudes. however, a direct correl between puls 
height and final resist state be feasibl for a gradual reset process, where a vstop voltag defin the resist 
state in advanc valenc chang mechan (vcm) devices12,13. In thi work, we use optim pt/w/taox/pt 
reram devices, offer highli reliabl stop-voltag behavior and use the correspond multi-level properti 
to implement modular arithmet operations, a discuss in the result section. 

modular arithmet find usag in everyday applications, e.g., quantifi a specif clock-time, which wrap 
around after a fix valu be reached. A rigor mathemat framework of modular arithmet be develop 
by carl friedrich gauss14 by defin a congruenc relat between integers. two integers, a and b be say to 
be congruent modulo n, when their differ (a-b) be divis by n. In thi case, n be know to be the modulu 
of thi relation.

apart from applic in mathematics, modular arithmet play a fundament role in modern comput 
arithmetic. here, a ring of integ modulo 2 be term a a boolean ring and everi boolean ring give rise to 
boolean algebra, where the ring multipl be conjunct oper (∧ ) and the ring addit be exclus 
disjunct oper (∨ ). furthermore, the idea of secur and fault-toler data commun reli on the 
principl of public-key cryptographi and error-correct codes, respectively. both of these field requir effi- 
cient implement of modular arithmetic. 

modular arithmet be also use for reduc the complex of standard arithmet circuits15,16 and be essen- 
tial for build the residu numer system (rns). the rn represent allow overflow-fre addition, sub- 
traction and multiplication, therebi enabl high degre of parallelism. 

state-of-the-art modular arithmet circuit in cmo technolog be implement use two-stat boolean 
arithmet operations, which follow directli from the two-level switch algebra introduc by shannon17. 
memrist devic be suggest to replac regist file in convent signed-digit adders18 or to be use in 
conjunct with complex quantiz circuits19. the current paper report the first implement of modu- 
lar arithmet use multi-st reram devices, which be fulli crossbar array compat in conjunct with a 
selector device. So far, most previou memrist circuit studi be base on over simplist memristor models20, 
we herebi use real memrist devic fabric in word structur to verifi the propos functionality. It should 
also be note that we perceiv no theoret limit in scale the number of state for memrist devices, thereby, 
open a new research direct on multi-st storag and comput devices.

devic properties. In thi work, 5 μ m × 5 μ m pt/w/taox/pt cross-point devic arrang in word structur 
(fig. 1a) be use to realiz the three trit (trinari digit) modular addition. the devic stack 25 nm pt/ 13 nm 
w/7 nm taox/30 nm Pt be depict in fig 1b. the typic i-v characterist of thi devic be show in fig. 1c. In 
supplementari s1, the i-v characterist of an 80 nm × 80 nm cross-point devic be also shown, highlight the 
scale potenti of these devices. dure reset process, the maximum appli voltag |vstop| defin the final 
resist state (1.8 V in fig. 1c). thi featur be also present in puls mode, thu can be implement in memori 
and logic oper for control the multi-level states. 

figur 2a show the cumul probabl of low resist state (lrs) and six multi-level resist states, 
which be obtain for 200 n puls in the rang of vstop = − 1.50 V to − 2.25 V. each state be base on 5 devic 
with 10 cycles. the inset explain the statist inform of distribution. the tight distribut highlight the 
excel switch properti of thi device. In fig. 2b, the mean valu for each of the resist state R0 to R5 be 
given. 

for the propos arithmet operation, the input operand be appli to the top (te) and bottom (be) electrode, 
respectively. To enabl an equidist voltag stepping, we use a predefin offset voltag (voffset) for each pulse. 
the operand voltag be vop = 0.00 V to 0.75 V with increment of 0.15 V. the actual puls appli at the bottom elec- 
trode be therefor vbe = voffset + vop1 and vte = − (voffset+ vop2) for the top electrode. thus, the overal potenti 
differ be vstop = vte–vb = − (2 voffset + vop1 + vop2). sinc the overal devic voltag be alway negative, a logic 
oper correspond to a reset puls whose amplitud depend on the actual operands. To show the multi-level 
puls oper mode, we set vbe = 0.75 V and vari vte from − 0.75 V to − 1.50 V (fig. 3a). the result resist 
be depict in fig. 3b. depend on the overal devic voltag (vstop = − 1.50 V to − 2.25 V) six differ resist 
state (r0, r1, r2, r3, R4 and r5) be easili access (fig. 3b). note that three resist state would be suffici 
to repres a ternari numer system (trit). thi multi-level devic properti be use for the modular arithmet 
operation. To enabl highli reproduc reset operation, we alway appli a DC set oper befor each puls 
reset operation. note that also nanosecond puls set oper be feasible, but not appli in thi work. detail 
on the puls set oper can be found in supplementari s2. 

develop modular arithmet work principle. the new develop algorithm calcul the carri 
and sum directli in the reram devices, which store the result until they be read out. initially, all the devic in 
a wordlin be initialized, i.e. write to the lrs. start from thi state the sum bit of signific 0 (s0) can be 
directli calcul in the devic of signific 0 while the other devic be calcul the first output carri c1. 
the actual sum or carri calcul devic be shift for each signific one devic to the left. 

In general, for the carri algorithm (fig. 4a), first the devic state of the actual devic be read, to check whether 
the input carri cin be 0 or 1. In case of 1, voffset be set to 0.875 V wherea in case of 0, the offset remain 
voffset = 0.75 V. next, the logic oper be conduct after a set oper use the evalu offset. We 
appli vte = − (voffset + vop1) to the top electrod and vbe = voffset + vop2 to the bottom electrode. finally, the 
resist state of the devic be read and evaluated. To enabl a proper modulu oper the reram devic have to 
provid 2n state for an n-ari number system. the background be that in a n-ari number system the operand at 
each specif signific be in the rang of 0… n-1, i.e., the sum of two operand be at most 2n-1. since, an input 
carri of 1 may also occur, the total requir number of state per devic be 2n. thus, for a ternari number system 
six state (r0… r5) be required. If the state be R ≤ r2, the output carri cout be 0 and R0 be write back. for R > r2, 
the devic be write to r1, i.e. cout = 1. note that prior to the write back operation, the set oper be conduct 
to enabl a highli control R1 state. In supplementari s4, the requir peripher circuitri be depicted. note 
that a certain minimum crossbar array size be requir to justifi the peripher circuitri overhead. In thi respect, 
a suitabl selector devic be a key compon enabl large-scal ultra-dens multi-level reram arrays.

base on the input carry, the final sum can be calcul (fig. 4b). As for the carri calculation, the requir 
level of the voffset (either 0.75 V or 0.875 V) be first evaluated. next, the operand voltag vte = − (voffset + vop1) 
and vbe = voffset + vop2 be appli after the set operation. base on a final readout, the map R3 → r0, 
R4 → R1 and R5 → R2 have to be conduct to complet the modulo sum operation. the correspond write back

the algorithm describ in fig. 4 realiz the follow mathemat modulo sum operation: 
In devic z0, the sum oper be conduct directly: 

• z0 = (1 + 2) rem 3 = 0 (s0). 

note that the function ‘rem’ return the remainder. start from lrs, the devic be reset (p0 = 1 = > vte = − 0.9 V 
and q0 = 2 = > vbe = 1.05 V, i.e. − 1.95 v). accord to fig. 2b, thi voltag lead to state r3, a can be also see in 
fig. 5c directly. accord to the sum algorithm (fig. 4b), R3 be final map to r0, see fig. 5c. 
In devic z1, first the carri oper be conducted: 

• z1 = (1 + 2) div 3 = 1 (c1 = 1). 

the function ‘div’ return the floor quotient. start from lrs, the devic be toggl to R3 state by appli p0 
and q0 to calcul the carri c1. accord to the carri algorithm (fig. 4a), R3 be then map to r1, see fig. 5b. 

next, the second cell sum trit be obtain by the follow operation: 

• z1 = (2 + 2 + c1) rem 3 = 2 (s1). 

sinc c1 = 1 hold the voffset = 0.875 V be applied, and the access state be r5. accord to the sum algorithm 
(fig. 4b), R5 be then map to r2, see fig. 5b. 

for cell z2 (fig. 5a), again the carri oper be conduct first: 

• z2 = (1+ 2) div 3 = 1 (c1 = 1). 

start from lrs, R1 state be access via r3. 
sinc we consid a two trit addition, the final sum bit equal the carri c2: 

• z2 = (2 + 2 + c1) div 3 = 1 (c2 = s2 = 1). 

accord to the carri algorithm (fig. 4a), R5 be then map to r1, see fig. 5a. 
the final sum be store directli in memory: 

• sum z = z2 z1 z0 = 120 (= 15).

discuss 
We have demonstr a ternari number system implementation, use multi-st tantalum oxid devic in 
word structures. depend on the avail number of resist states, high order number system can also 
be implement in the same way. for n-ari systems, we would need 2n resist states, henc further progress 
in reram memori technolog will directli enabl arithmet oper use high radix number systems. 

On the other hand, the choic of radix for a number represent can be motiv from the perspect of 
underli implement a well a the analysi of radix economy. A quantifi measur of radix economi 
propos in ref. 21 be a following: 

= ⋅ +⌊ ⌋E b N b N( , ) log ( ) 1 , (3)b 

where, b be the radix and N be the number to be represented. thi metric yield E a the most econom 
real-valu radix. It also turn out that the radix valu of 3 (ternary) be more econom compar to binary. We 
argu that the abov measur do not take the growth of the implement medium into account. for sever 
devic technologies, the area requir grow linearli with the radix size and make the radix implement 
veri tough. however, it be not true for multist memrist devic such a the pt/w/taox/pt reram, sinc the 
implement radix size depend on the number of resist states. considering, a k-state devic can be realiz 
at the same cost of a two-stat device, a more appropri metric would be 

= ⋅ + .⌊ ⌋E b N b 
k 

N( , ) log ( ) 1 (4)b 

compar to binari arithmetic, an n-ari number represent reduc the space complex in a logarith- 
mic ratio. given compar perform for the base devices, the gain in arithmet circuits, such as, integ 
addit be also expect to be in logarithm scale. however, the actual gain will be somehow small due to need 
for good sens amplifi and more control circuitry. 

the present approach be not limit to a specif multist reram device, but would work for ani mem- 
ristiv devic offer multipl resist level induc by differ stop voltag vstop. the propos algorithm 
could further be simplifi by avoid in between set operations, howev thi requir ultra-low varianc 
reram devices. for the consid reram devic onli reset puls be allow a logic inputs. appropri 
set puls enabl step-by-step decreas of the resist could be use to implement also subtract within 
the same devic similar to the here show addit operation. 

the present approach be compat to the passiv crossbar array configuration, by integr a selector 
devic to each taox junction. the implement of the arithmet function within the resist memori 
devic use the avail multi-resist level be a highli attract option for futur function enhanc 
hybrid cmos/reram chips. thi approach enabl a reduct of cycl count compar to boolean logic base 
reram approaches22–25. for example, a recent propos cipher applic could be decis improv use 
multi-level rerams26, enabl effici in-hardwar encrypt and decrypt for futur smart devices. the 
energi per oper depend on the devic properties, name switch voltage, multi-level resist state and 
inher switch speed and control circuit properti such a the appli puls width. sinc the puls width (t) 
that will be use in real applic be much shorter than 200 n (use in study), the final power consumpt will 
be reduc further. In summary, low-vari multi-level reram could play a key role for implement of 
public-key cryptographi and error-correct code in smart devices. 

conclus 
pt/w/taox/pt devic enabl highli reliabl multi states, which can be access reproduc by puls of specif 
height, start from a defin lrs. By use word and bit line a input for pulses, the resist multi-level can 
be use to store and calcul in-memori logic operations. To avoid an overflow in individu devices, a modulu 
arithmet be implemented, assur the devic to be alway in a valid 0, 1, 2 (trit) state. By use a ternari num- 
ber system, the amount of devic and cycl can be reduc significantly. In contrast to two-stat devices, multi- 
state devic provid good radix economi with the option for further scaling. therefore, establish multi-st 
reram for non-volatil memori open the door to novel storag and in-memori comput arithmet options. 

method 
devic fabrication. devic be fabric for 1 × 3 array with crossbar structur base on 5 × 5 μ m2 sin- 
gle cell size. three top electrod share singl bottom electrode. for the bottom electrod (be), 5 nm titanium 
(ti) and 30 nm platinum (pt) layer be deposit by sputter on top of thermal grown sio2 layer (430 nm). 
A photolithographi and dri etch process be appli to pattern the bottom electrode. and then 7.0 nm-thick 
taox be deposit by reactiv sputter under process ga mixtur of Ar (23%) and oxygen (7%) with the RF 
power of 116w at the chamber pressur of 2.3 × 10−2 mbar. without break the vacuum, 13 nm tungsten (w) 
ohmic electrode, and 25 nm platinum (pt) be deposit consecutively. and then top electrod (te) be pattern 
with a photolithographi and a reactiv ion etch. A scan electron microscopi of 1 × 3 crossbar array with 
5 × 5 μ m2 size cell be show in fig. 1a and it correspond cross-sect structur with tunnel electron 
microscopi be show in fig. 1b. 

measur set-up. initi the resist switch devic remain in high resist state (hrs) and we 
need to appli irrevers form process in order to activ the devic befor repetit switch cycl be 
possible. detail inform be give in supplementari section. dure the form process, the resist state 
of devic chang from hr to lrs. In order to chang the resist state from lr to hrs, a ‘reset’ process be 
required. In revers way, a ‘set’ process convert the hr to lrs. the DC oper of a singl devic also know

a current-voltag (i-v) sweep be show in fig. 1. the voltag sweep be appli onli to the top electrod (te) while 
the bottom electrod be grounded. In order to achiev good control on the resist state of devic with singl 
puls operation, the ‘set’ process be base on DC operation. however, the other oper such a ‘reset’ and 
‘read’ use AC puls operation. for the reset operation, 200 n puls width base on full width half maximum 
(fwhm) be appli for switch oper with 40 n rising/fal times. the read oper at 0.1 V us 
120 μ s long puls in order to verifi the each resist valu more accurately, especi hr values. By appli 
a 0.15 V stepping, seven resist level can be distinguish in the consid devices. depend on the actual 
devic even more multi-level state be feasibl in reram devices. however, due to variability, e.g., induc by 
random telegraph noise27, the maximum number of properli access multi-level be limited.
