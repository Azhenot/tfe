summari 

randomised, control trial have be retract after public becaus of data fabric and inadequ ethic approval. fabric data 

have includ baselin variables, for instance, age, height or weight. statist test can determin the probabl of the distribut of means, 

give their standard deviat and the number of particip in each group. randomised, control trial have be retract after the data 

distribut have be calcul a improbable. most retract trial have be write by anaesthetist and publish by specialist anaesthet 

journals. I want to explor whether the distribut of baselin data in trial be consist with the expect distribution. I want to determin 

whether trial retract after public have distribut differ to trial that have not be retracted. I want to determin whether data 

distribut in trial publish in specialist anaesthet journal have be differ to distribut in non-specialist medic journals. I analys 

the distribut of 72,261 mean of 29,789 variabl in 5087 randomised, control trial publish in eight journal between januari 2000 and 

decemb 2015: anaesthesia (399); anesthesia and analgesia (1288); anesthesiolog (541); british journal of anaesthesia (618); canadian 

journal of anesthesia (384); european journal of anaesthesiolog (404); journal of the american medic associ (518) and new england 

journal of medicin (935). I chose these journal a I have electron access to the full text. trial p valu be distort by an excess of baselin 

mean that be similar and an excess that be dissimilar: 763/5015 (15.2%) trial that have not be retract from public have p valu that 

be within 0.05 of 0 or 1 (expect 10%), that is, a 5.2% excess, p = 1.2 × 10 . the p valu of 31/72 (43%) trial that have be retract after 

public be within 0.05 of 0 or 1, a rate differ to that for unretract trials, p = 1.03 × 10 . the differ between the distribut of 

these two subgroup be confirm by comparison of their overal distributions, p = 5.3 × 10 . each journal exhibit the same abnorm 

distribut of baselin means. there be no differ in distribut of baselin mean for 1453 trial in non-anaesthet journal and 3634 

trial in anaesthet journals, p = 0.30. the rate of retract from jama and nejm, 6/1453 or 1 in 242, be one-quart the rate from the six 

anaesthet journals, 66/3634 or 1 in 55, rel risk (99%ci) 0.23 (0.08–0.68), p = 0.00022. A probabl threshold of 1 in 10,000 identifi 8/72 

(11%) retract trial (7 by fujii et al.) and 82/5015 (1.6%) unretract trials. some p valu be so extrem that the baselin data could not be 

correct: for instance, for 43/5015 unretract trial the probabl be less than 1 in 10 (equival to one drop of water in 20,000 olympic-s 

swim pools). A probabl threshold of 1 in 100 for two or more trial by the same author identifi three author of retract trial (boldt, fujii 

and reuben) and 21 first or correspond author of 65 unretract trials. fraud, unintent error, correlation, stratifi alloc and poor 

methodolog might have contribut to the excess of randomised, control trial with similar or dissimilar means, a pattern that be common to 

all the survey journals. It be like that thi work will lead to the identification, correct and retract of hitherto unretract randomised, 

control trials.
