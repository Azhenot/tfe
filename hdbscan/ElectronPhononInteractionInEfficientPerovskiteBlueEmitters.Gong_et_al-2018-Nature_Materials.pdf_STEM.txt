the promis of energy-sav solid-st light and full-colour display have motiv rapid advanc in lumi-nesc materi that exhibit bright emiss and high colour 
purity1. red, green and blue sourc that span the full colour gamut 
be requir to gener white light2. blue have proven to be the most 
challenging3,4: in epitaxi inorgan technology, for example, it take 
20 addit year to creat the first blue light-emit diod 
(leds) after red and green led be success creat in the 
1950 and 1960s5. 

A princip challeng for blue emiss remain the design of 
materi that simultan exhibit high luminesc effici 
and narrow emiss linewidth. tabl 1 summar the key photo- 
physic properti of current avail blue emitt (fig. 1e,f). 
among inorgan semiconductor singl crystals, wide-bandgap 
analogu of gaas, gap, sic, znse and gan have be explored6,7; 
however, even the highest-pur and most defect-fre epitaxi 
grown gan film exhibit a maximum photoluminesc quantum 
yield (plqy) of less than 1% at low inject density8–10. the loss 
of luminesc effici come from rapid non-radi recom- 
binat through surfac and bulk defects11, combin with a low 
radi recombin rate associ with a small exciton bind 
energi (eb = 20 mev)12. 

though inorgan phosphor have demonstr high bright- 
ness with plqi over 90%, their rel insul natur and 
long radi lifetim result in high turn-on voltages, and thi lim- 
it their applic in leds13,14. In addition, their spectral broad 
luminesc (full width at half maximum, fwhm > 100 nm) 
diminish the usabl PL yield when a narrow emiss bandwidth 
be required15. similarly, recent synthes blue organ emit- 
ter with 70~85% plqi in solid-st thin films16 also suffer from 
spectral broad emiss (fwhm ~ 75 nm). organ materials, in 
contrast to inorgan materials, exhibit bind energi of sever 

hundr millielectronvolts17. their strongli bound exciton there- 
fore luminesc radi with high rates18, and the desir radia- 
tive process domin recombin (fig. 1b). 

organic–inorgan hybrid perovskit have emerg a prom- 
ise candid for light-emiss applications19. chloride-bas 
three-dimension (3d) perovskit emit in the deep-blu region 
with sharp emiss (fwhm ~ 25 nm)20. however, owe to their 
small exciton bind energi (~50 mev) and their appreci trap- 
ping loss (fig. 1c), these materi have so far show low plqi 
(< 1%)20,21. colloid perovskit quantum dot recent achiev 
high plqi in the blue region through strong quantum confine- 
ment22,23; however, the high plqi of colloid dot have so far be 
lose onc solid-st perovskit cqd film be made24. 

In thi work, we focu on reduced-dimensional—also know 
a 2D layered—perovskites. when we add longer organ ligand 
to an otherwis 3D perovskit crystal, the new ligand segreg at 
the surface, and thi lead to local within the newli form 
layer materials. two-dimension (2d) layer perovskit offer 
fast radi recombin rate (krad)25 due to exciton localiza- 
tion and therefor be promis candid to address the above- 
mention need for high plqi combin with narrow emiss 
width. photogener exciton insid 2D perovskit be strongli 
confin insid each layer (fig. 1d). thi be exemplifi by exciton 
bind energi that can reach up to 300 mev, valu compar to 
those of organ materials26. 

intens studi have be carri out that have link struc- 
ture and perform in low-dimension (2d, 0d) perovskites27,28. 
the import goal of high luminesc effici (plqi > 80%) 
with broadband emiss (fwhm > 100 nm) have be achiev 
in the yellow and red regions29,30. nevertheless, blue-emit 
perovskit have yet to deliv the desir performance: the 
plqi of polycrystallin thin film have be report to be

low-dimension perovskit have—in view of their high radi recombin rates—shown great promis in achiev 
high luminesc bright and colour saturation. here we investig the effect of electron–phonon interact on the 
luminesc of singl crystal of two-dimension perovskites, show that reduc these interact can lead to bright 
blue emiss in two-dimension perovskites. reson raman spectrum and deform potenti analysi show that strong 
electron–phonon interact result in fast non-radi decay, and that thi lower the photoluminesc quantum yield 
(plqy). neutron scattering, solid-st nmr measur of spin–lattic relaxation, densiti function theori simul 
and experiment atom displac measur reveal that molecular motion be slowest, and rigid greatest, in the 
brightest emitter. By vari the molecular configur of the ligands, we show that a plqi up to 79% and linewidth of 20 nm 
can be reach by control crystal rigid and electron–phonon interactions. design crystal structur with electron–pho- 
non interact in mind offer a previous underexplor avenu to improv optoelectron materials' performance.

about 10%, and recent 26% be obtain from atom thin 
2D perovskit singl crystal fabric use a solvent anneal- 
ing strategy31–33. thi contrast with colloid materi that can 
achiev high plqi (54% for 2D perovskit and 84% for 3D 
perovskit quantum dots23,34). the applic of 2D perovskit 
in blue leds—which reli on solid-st materials—remain lim- 
ite by low solid-st plqys. We argu herein that the origin of 
previou low emiss effici and larg emiss linewidth 
need further studi in order to inform progress toward bright 
narrowband emitters. 

We sought therefor to explor further the potenti of 2D 
perovskit blue emitt use high-qual singl crystals, and 
investig the determin of high bright and thu offer an 
improv set of guidelin in materi design. specifically, we focu 
on the origin of non-radi rate and on devis strategi to 
achiev a substanti reduct of these parasit processes. 

In our initi experiments, we sought to produc larg (macro- 
scopic, ~mm3 and above) singl crystal of 2D perovskite. singl 
crystal have the potenti to achiev high plqi due to their low 
defect densiti when compar with polycryst and amorph 
materials; they also provid a platform for studi the determi- 
nant of the plqi of a material, a they be substanti free from 
the effect of film morpholog and grain boundaries. recent stud- 
y have also elucid the promis of perovskit singl crystal 
directli util in electron devic applications35. 

build these macroscopic, atom layer sheet structur 
requir u to develop a new synthesi strategi a high-bright 
macroscal 2D perovskit singl crystal have not previous be 
reported. We have initi attempt the previous report vapour 
diffus method36, but the crystal obtain therebi be small in 
size (< 1 mm) and poor in luminesc quality. 

toward the goal of achiev high-qual crystals, we pur- 
sue the use of a ternari solvent system to control crystalliza- 
tion kinet (fig. s1). our crystal strategi be base 
on a co-solv n,n-dimethylformamide–dimethylsulfoxid 
(dmf–dmso) mixture. when we reli on a mixtur of dmf– 
diethyl ether (dee) alone, undesir fast crystal lead to 
small crystal size and low plqys. We found that—compar 
with the case of pure dmf, wide util in perovskit prepa- 
ration—introduc dmso dramat enhanc both crystal 
size and the optic qualiti of the singl crystals. We attribut the 
improv crystal qualiti and the high plqi to the format 
of the dmso–pbbr2 complex37, which slow the crystal 
process, ultim lead to higher-qu perovskit crystal 
(fig. S1 and tabl s1). singl crystal grow a dee slowli diffus 
into the perovskit solution38. 

We then explor two class of organ ammonium cation 
base either on aliphat chain group (R = alkyl chain) or phenyl 
group (ph = c6h5) motifs. the macroscop shape of the singl crys- 
tal reveal a strong cation dependence: c4, c12 (R = ch3(ch2)3,

R = ch3(ch2)11) and phc, phc2 (ph–r = ph–ch2, ph–r = ph– 
(ch2)2) grow into thin flakes, while with Ph and phc3 (ph–r = ph– 
(ch2)3) the crystal result in needle-lik crystal (fig. s2). 
the product also show dramat differ luminesc 
properti (tabl s2): layer-shap crystal show narrowband 
(fwhm ~ 20 nm) deep-blu emission, while needle-shap crystal 
result in non-2d crystal structur (fig. s3) with broadband white- 
light emiss (fig. 2g–i, fwhm > 70 nm). 

To measur the absolut plqy, we exfoli thin sampl 
mechan from singl crystal (supplementari materials, 
exfoli sampl preparation). exfoli reduc the sampl 
thick and henc the reabsorpt of PL (fig. s4). crystal that 
form 2D solid (c4 and phc2) be easili exfoli into thin flakes, 
in contrast with the needle-shap crystals. 

for the deep-blu region, the best sampl of phc2 crystal have 
a plqi of 79%, a notabl improv compar with previ- 
ousli report 2D perovskites33,34 (tabl 1). thi high plqi be also 
accompani by a sharp emiss spectrum (fwhm ~ 20 nm) and 
be independ of photoexcit power (fig. s5). We account for 
thi by note the strong exciton qualiti of the 2D perovskit 
and that no multi-exciton recombin occur under low injec- 
tion intens (1010 cm−3)39. thi plqi be up to two order of mag- 
nitud high than that of inorgan materials. It be compar to 
that of the brightest organ blue emitt (tabl 1)16; yet, it exhibit 

a fulli three time narrow emiss linewidth (fwhm of 20 nm 
compar with 75 nm for organ emitters). 

We then turn to studi the structur of each crystal with the 
goal of elucid the physic origin of the effici blue emis- 
sions. We carri out single-cryst x-ray diffract (scxrd) on 
sampl with high plqi (phc2), low plqi (c4) and broadband 
emiss spectrum (ph). In Ph singl crystals, the precursor prefer- 
ential form a network of truncat pbbr6 octahedron (pbbr3), while 
plate-shap crystal (c4 and phc2) form layer structures, with 
corner-shar inorgan pbbr6 octahedron sandwich between 
organ layer (fig. 2d–f). In the phc2 structure, benzen ring 
stack between the adjac pbbr6 layer via ch–π interactions. 

To gain further insight into the crystal qualiti and high plqy, 
we carri out densiti function theori (dft) calcul on c4, 
Ph and phc2 structures. We first calcul the format energi 
of these compound by relax the scxrd-determin struc- 
tures. the calcul format energi of c4, Ph and phc2 be 
determin to be 160, 595 and 200 mev/f.u. respect rel to 
solid precursors. the high format energi suggest more stabl 
structur with a low chanc of defect formation. however, cal- 
culat predict Ph to have an indirect bandgap, in contrast with 
direct bandgap calcul for C4 and phc2 (fig. s6). 

We thu focu on the two best 2D perovskit within the ali- 
phatic and phenyl group (c4 and phc2 respectively). We carri

out transient absorpt spectroscopi to probe the defect densiti 
in C4 and phc2 and found compar densiti in these materi- 
als, in agreement with dft calcul (methods, fig. s7, s8). the 
compar defect densities, contrast with the dramat differ- 
enc in plqy, lead u to probe further the origin of the high bright- 
ness for the case of phc2. 

the quantum effici be determin by the ratio of the radia- 
tive recombin rate (krad) to the sum of radi and non-radi- 
ativ (knon) recombin rate (ktot):

To identifi and compar krad and knon, we use equat (1) with 
the directli measur ktot (from transient pl) and the mea- 
sure plqi (supplementari materials, photoluminesc 
measurements, fig. s9). 

figur 3a show that radi recombin be domin over 
the entir temperatur rang for phc2 crystals, consist with the 
fact that their high plqi be preserv even at room temperature. 
the fast radi recombin rate be relat to a small bohr 
radiu (tabl s3). In the case of C4 crystals, the non-radi rate 
surpass the radi rate when the temperatur increas beyond 
250 K (fig. 3b). the dramat increas knon result in the pro- 
nounc drop of plqi in C4 to 17% at room temperature. It should 
be note that no phase transit be observ over the tempera- 
ture rang discuss here (fig. s10). 

We then investig the caus of the undesir rapid knon. 
from the preced discussion, we note that the intrins trap den- 
siti in C4 and phc2 be similar, while the knon of C4 be four time 

high than that of phc2. clearli the transit from bandedg to 
trap state must be increas in C4 compar with phc2. We there- 
fore investig the role of electron–phonon interact in facili- 
tat these transitions. 

one way to quantifi the intens of electron–phonon interac- 
tion be by use the deform potenti (d)—the shift in energi 
band per unit strain. We extract D for both phc2 and C4 by 
studi the temperature-depend behaviour of their PL line- 
widths40,41 (tabl s5). We first observ that the fwhm increas 
fivefold from 10 K to 290 K in c4, but by less than twofold in phc2: 
thermal broaden be dramat more intens in c4. the quan- 
tit indic of electron–phonon coupl strength—d—i also 
twice a high in C4 a in phc2, reflect the faster bandedge-to- 
trap process in the case of c4. 

these initi result lead u to investig further the impact 
of electron–phonon coupl on the electron transit 
rate. We select reson raman (rr) spectroscopi sinc it 
directli reveal phonon coupl to the electron transit 
between the excit and ground states. We employ a photoex- 
citat energi (457 nm) near the energi of the relev band- 
to-band transition. figur 3d show the RR spectrum of C4 and 
phc2 after normal for sampl concentr and transi- 
tion dipol strength. the C4 RR spectrum be sever time more 
intens than that of phc2, indic that the vibrat mode 
of C4 be substanti more strongli coupl to the electron 
excit than those of phc2 (fig. s11, tabl s4). C4 be there- 
fore expect to undergo faster non-radi decay due to the 
improv vibrat overlap between the ground- and excited- 
state vibrat wavefunctions. thi result corrobor the 
observ faster knon and low plqi for C4 rel to phc2 
(detail in methods).

To investig the connect between materi structur and 
electron–phonon coupling, we character the role of crystal 
rigidity. We sought to compar atom displac (from both 
simul and experiment), spin–lattic relax and the time- 
variat in the electron bandstructure. 

atom displacements—at their essence, optic phonons—ar 
import indic of crystal rigidity. figur 4a present calcula- 
tion result (bottom panel) alongsid experiment determin 
atom displac for atom of interest, the latter quantifi 
use the equival isotrop displac paramet (ueq) from 
single-cryst xrd measur (fig. 4a top panel). We find that, 
in c4, tail carbon atom have a larg root mean squar displace- 
ment compar with respect atom in phc2. the larg root 
mean squar displac indic that more phonon mode be 
activ in c4. In particular, the root mean squar displac 
of Br and Pb (which determin the valenc band maximum and con- 
duction band minimum in perovskites) be high in the case of c4. 
overall, phc2 show a more rigid structure. 

the crystal rigid be further investig use solid-st 
nmr spin–lattic relax time (t1) measur (fig. s12). 
In the C4 crystal, relax rate (r1) of 0.5 s−1 be observ for 
termin methyl carbon (cd), while phc2 show an order of mag- 
nitud slow R1 of 0.02 s−1 at the termin aromat ring carbon 

(fig. 4b). thi agre with the observ from scxrd that the 
rigid structur of sp2 phenyl ring result in small thermal dis- 
placement ellipsoid of atom and less vibrat motion in phc2 
compar with the case of aliphat c4. thi also agre with our 
observ of the sharpen PL emiss peak. We propos that 
denser molecular pack insid the organ layer in the phc2 
structur contribut to high crystal rigidity. 

As note earlier, the deform of a crystal result in a chang 
in it crystal geometri and therefor a shift in it electron energi 
bandstructure. We can therefor character the structur fluctua- 
tion by probe the bandstructure. figur 4c and fig. s13 present 
the time variat of the valenc band maximum and conduct 
band minimum in c4, phc2 and phc (fig. s14) from dft calcula- 
tions. We plot the histogram of instantan bandgap for each 
materi class. We again see the larg variat in the bandgap in 
C4 compar with phc2, consist with it low crystal rigidity. 

figur 4d show the neutron scatter spectrum of phc2 and C4 
powder measur at differ temperatures. when the temperatur 
be increas from 2 K to room temperature, the low-temperatur 
inelast featur submerg into the broad quasi-elast scatter 
peaks, while a pair of damp harmon oscil peak arises. 
A strike differ can be see between these peak for phc2 
and c4; the peak be consider narrow in phc2 than in

c4. thi indic that the ligand of C4 crystal undergo great 
librat motion (includ the rocking, wag and twist 
modes), while the movement of the lattic in phc2 be more confin 
spatially. We ascrib therefor the high crystal rigid of phc2 to 
the low conform freedom of the crystal structur associ- 
ate with closer pack among the organ molecules. 

To further complement these measurements, we measur the 
mean squar displacement, u2 , for the crystals. To achiev this, 
we use elast neutron scatter a a function of temperatur 
(fig. 4e). these measur (which be most sensit to the 
motion of hydrogen) give inform relat to the rigid pos- 
sess by the ligands. the slope of the mean squar displac 
with temperatur provid a mean forc constant that describ the 
motion of the ligand rel to their equilibrium positions42. At 
low temperatur we see phc2 and C4 behav similarly, but abov 
about 150 °C the motion of C4 increases, caus it to diverg from 
phc2. thi behaviour for C4 correl with the transit to faster 
knon at high temperature, a show in fig. 3b. 

thi work report a deep-blu emitt with a high plqi base

materi and characterization. growth of high-qual singl crystals. pbbr2 and 
anh3br (1 to 2 by molar ratio, 1 m), with A = organ cation, be dissolv in a 
mix solvent of dmf and dmso (fig. s1). In thi study, we found that add 
30–60% dmso be favour for high-qual crystal growth, result in larg 
crystal size and plqy, and thi have be util a the crystal condit 
for all samples. 0.2 ml of perovskit precursor solut be put into a 20 ml vial 
with no cap, which be put in a larg and seal contain with 40 ml antisolv 
(for example, diethyl ether or chloroform). crystal proce at room 
temperatur and the final product be take out after few days, rins use 
antisolv three time and dri under vacuum. all step be carri out under 
ambient conditions. 

exfoli sampl preparation. sampl for all PL measur be prepar by 
mechan exfoli from singl crystals. perovskit singl crystal be put on a 
clear, transpar and non-emiss one-sid tape, on top of which anoth clean 
area of tape be folded. part of the crystal be detach from the crystal for further 
exfoliation, expos fresh cleav layers, and the rest of the crystal remain on the 
tape. for the plqi measurements, we chose one piec of crystal and transfer 
it onto the tape. the later dimens of the chosen crystal be in the macro 
rang of mm × mm, therefor the effect from the grain boundari be neglig 
and do not need to be take into consideration. sampl with reduc thick 
and freshli peel 2D layer be prepar by repeat thi process sever times. 
the coverag of crystal on the tape will be multipli with increas number 
of exfoliations. the lamp that be util a the excit sourc for the plqi 
measur have a round spot with a diamet of 2 mm. the tape with variou 
flake of 2D perovskit crystal be attach to the glass substrate. 

single-cryst x-ray diffract measurements. singl crystal be mount on a 
nylon loop with oil. scxrd data be collect on a P4 bruker diffractomet 
upgrad with a bruker smart 1 K ccd (charge-coupl device) detector and a 
rotat anod util Mo KR radiat (λ = 0.710 73 å). all measur be 
make at room temperature. fit and refin of single-cryst structur be 
do use olex2. 

the equival isotrop displac paramet (ueq in fig. 4a, top panel) be 
defin and quantifi a one-third of sum of the eigenvalu of the orthogon 
displac tensor (uij). the result come directli from the refin of the 
structur from the scxrd measurement. 

photoluminesc measurements. absolut plqi measur of exfoli 
crystal be carri out in a quanta-phi integr sphere. for each 
measurement, a larg perovskit singl crystal be ground into small crystals, and 
crystal with an area of 0.5 mm × 0.5 mm and thick of ten of nanometr be 
select for mechan exfoliation. the exfoli be continu until the crystal 
could fulli cover the tape and becom appropri thin (around 50 nm). then the 
tape be transfer to a clean glass substrate. for each sample, the absorpt of 
the incid pump (350 nm) be control between 10% and 15%, so that the film 
thick be close enough to make a fair comparison. 

the valu of plqi be measur and calcul base on a previous 
report method43. A continuous-wav xenon excit lamp be use a the 
excit sourc with an excit wavelength of 350 nm, with a power densiti 
of 0.25–3.5 mW cm−2, and the carrier densiti be measur around 1010 × cm−3 
(use the follow equat n ≅ × ×incid power relax lifetim absorpt coefficientenergi of each phonon 
with the absorpt coeffici approxim 1 × 104 cm−1, and about 10−9 s). 
the bandpass valu be 5 and 5 nm for the excit and emiss slits, 
respectively. the incid and PL spectrum be collect with the exfoli sampl 
(tape/exfoli crystals/glass substrate) directli in the excit beam path offset 
from the beam path and remov from the sphere, in accord with the standard 
method. the tape use for exfoli should not have photoluminesc in 
the visibl range. If the tape absorb incid light, the effect of the tape should 
be excluded. for example, 3M scotch tape absorb 15% incid light (350 nm 
excitation) befor it reach the exfoli crystals, the effect of which be 
calibr by multipli the measur plqi by 1/(1 − 0.15) = 1.17. the detector 
and integr sphere be calibr for spectral varianc with a newport 
white-light source. 

temperature-depend steady-st PL spectrum be collect use an ocean 
optic usb 2000 spectrometer. the sampl be in an ar closed-cycl cryocooler. 
time-resolv PL be measur use horiba tcspc (time-correl single- 
photon counting) components. 

I. temperature-depend PL (fig. s8) be plot by take the peak 
intens of the PL spectrum and then normal to the high bright 
over the temperatur rang from 10 K to 290 K. At low temperature, T = 10 K 
in thi study, the radi recombin rate be dominant, which lead to 
plqi close to 100% and non-radi recombin near zero33. therefore, 
the plqi at other temperatur can be estim by the ratio between 
the PL intens at high temperatur and the low-temperatur pl. thi method 
be cross-valid by the current work: the room-temperatur plqi of phc2 
and C4 be 70% and 17% use thi extrapol approach, which be in good 
agreement with the independ and directli measur values. In the sampl 
of exfoli phc2 singl crystals, the PL intens of phc2 slightli increas 
from 10 K to 150 K, which might origin from gradual thermal activ 
of the bright exciton state. thi be common for nanoscal emitters, 
where due to the exchang interact the lowest-energi exciton be alway 
dark (spin forbidden). 

ii. temperature-depend PL dynam (fig. 3a,b): we choos the 
monoexponenti decay to obtain the total recombin rate, a exciton 
decay be a first-ord recombin process, and therefor the kinet 
follow a monoexponenti model. We also observ deviat from 
monoexponenti behaviour mainli after 10 n (fig. s8), which we attribut 
to trap recombination. therefore, the fit of the lifetim be mainli do 
within 10 ns, when PL be the domin depopul process of excitons. 

iii. power-depend plqi measur (fig. sx): we vari the incid power

reson raman spectroscopy. RR spectrum of C4 and phc2 dilut in a kbr 
pellet be collect with a 457 nm pre-rr pump, from a continuous-wav 
diod laser (cobolt). thi wavelength be chosen so that the raman spectrum 
be not contamin by sampl photoluminescence, but it be close enough 
to electron reson that the raman intens will be domin by 
reson terms. scatter light be collect by an aspher collect len in a 
backscatt geometry. the rayleigh line be attenu by a 458 nm long-pass 
edg filter (semrock, razoredge). A singl monochrom with a 1200 gr mm−1

the raw spectrum be first normal to the intern intens standard at

contribut to the raman scatter cross-sect due to the vibrat franck– 
condon displac from the strength of the transit dipole, the transit 
dipol scale of the signal be take into account. the spectrum be scale for 
their rel transit dipol length use the experiment rate of radi

photoluminesc spectrum at 10 K where the quantum effici be assum to be

In other words, a vibrat mode with the same displac in phc2 and 
C4 will have a raman cross-sect that be seven time high in phc2 than in c4. 
In order to isol a rough measur of the rel displac between the two 
perovskites, the C4 raman spectrum be multipli by 7.0. 

the spectrum in fig. 3d demonstr that the vibrat mode of C4 be 
substanti more displac in the excit state than those of phc2. thi suggest 
that C4 will have a faster non-radi decay rate due to the improv vibrat 
overlap between the ground- and excited-st vibrat wavefunctions. thi 
result corrobor the observ photoluminesc effici for C4 rel to 
phc2 and suggest that nuclear rigid upon electron excit be an essenti 
featur of effici emit materials. tabl S2 contain the raman shift and 
intens for repres raman mode of the samples. fig. s10 repres 
the control experi of 457 nm raman of the ligand in the absenc of 
the perovskit material. from fig. s10 it be clear that the perovskit structur 
resonantli enhanc the ligand vibrat modes, thu valid the scale by 
the rel radi rates. 

solid-st nmr. A solid-st nmr experi be carri out on powder 
sampl of C4 and phc2 on an agil dd2 700 mhz nmr spectrometer. spectra 
be obtain use a cross-polar magic angl spin experi at 25 °C 
and 70 °c. the relax rate R1 = 1/t1 be obtain by fit the intens of 
individu 13c reson a a function of the invers recoveri time τ (detail 
in supplement information). A high R1 valu indic high mobil and 
faster molecular motion. for the phc2 sampl three peak be observed, at 128 
(phenyl), 43.5 (ca) and 34.8 (cb) ppm, with R1 relax rate of 0.0162 s−1 (ph), 
0,1226 s−1 (ca) and 0.1135 s−1 (cb) at 25 °C and 0.58 s−1 (ca) and 0.19 s−1 (cb) at 
70 °c. for the C4 sampl four peak be observed: 41.38 ppm (ca), 31.25 ppm 
(cb), 20.47 ppm (cc) and 16.25 ppm (cd) with R1 relax rate of 0.098 s−1 (ca), 
0.1387 s−1 (cb), 0.1828 s−1 (cc) and 0.4978 s−1 (cd) at 25 °C and 0.7699 s−1 (ca), 
0.36 s−1 (cb), 0.44 s−1 (cc) and 0.4982 s−1 (cd) at 70 °c. 

In C4 crystals, we observ a relax rate of 0.5 s−1 for the termin methyl 
group (cd) compar with 0.1 s−1 for the carbon atom proxim to the ammonium 
group (ca) (fig. s11), indic that the termin methyl group exhibit faster 
molecular motion. thi observ be in good agreement with the increas 
thermal ellipsoid size from Ca to Cd from scxrd data. In comparison, phc2 
show an R1 of 0.02 s−1 at the aromat ring end, which be an order of magnitud 
slow than for the aliphat carbon (cc, 0.2 s−1; cd, 0.5 s−1). 

transient absorption. femtosecond puls be gener use a regen 
amplifi yb:kgw laser at a 1 khz repetit rate (light conversion, pharos). 
A portion of the 1030 nm fundament be sent through an optic parametr 
amplifi (light conversion, orpheus), and the second harmon of the signal 
puls be chosen for a 360 nm or 460 nm pump. both the pump and residu 
fundament be sent into an optic bench (ultrafast, helios), and the time delay 
be adjust by optic delay the probe pulse, with time step increas 
exponentially. the repetit rate of the pump be halv use an optic chopper. 
the fundament be focu into a calcium fluorid crystal to gener a white- 
light continuum probe, and both the probe and pump be focu onto the 
sample. the probe be then direct onto a ccd after dispers by a grate 
spectrograph (ultrafast, helios). 

transient absorpt be use to compar the rel number of trap between 
C4 and phc2. exfoli single-cryst sampl be first excit with 360 nm light, 
with increas power rang from 25 μ W to 1000 μ W (fig. s6a,b). for both 
samples, the magnitud of the bleach signal increas with increas power, and a 
neg signal be present at wavelength longer than 450 nm. bleach below the 
bandgap have be assign previous to absorpt involv trap state within 
the bandgap45. 

We then photoexcit the same spot on the sampl with 460 nm light 
(fig. s6c,d), which be onli absorb by trap state (a 450 nm shortpass filter be 
use to low the pump scattering). sinc thi result in electron in the conduct 
band, a bleach of the bandgap be still expected. In thi way, the observ signal 
should be proport to the number of trap states, although we have to ensur that 
the signal be not influenc by other factors. We measur the transient signal at 
500 μ W, 1000 μ W and 2000 μ W pump power, and the observ signal show a linear 
depend on power, rule out two-photon pumping. In order to exclud effect 

from crystal thick (that is, pathlength) and absorpt cross sections, 
we compar the magnitud of signal obtain from pump the sampl with 
1000 μ W of 360 nm light (fig. s7a). C4 have a bleach of about 17 Δ mod, wherea 
phc2 have a signal of about 6 Δ mod. essentially, if the two crystal have a similar 
trap density, we would expect a similar bleach ratio when pump with 460 nm 
(fig. s7b). for clarity, we have includ a comparison for 460 nm pump sampl 
(fig. s7c), where we have adjust the spectrum to take into account the ratio from 
the 360 nm pump experi (bi divid by a constant equal to the bleach 
magnitud mention above). the result spectrum (fig. s7c) show similar bleach 
magnitud for C4 and phc2, with phc2 even exhibit a slightli (around 22%) 
larg signal (that is, number of traps). thi indic that the number of trap state 
be veri unlik to be the caus behind the differ in plqi (that is, plqi of 
phc2 be high than c4). 

deform potenti calculation. the origin of the thermal broaden of 
exciton emiss linewidth stem from the fluctuat of the bandgap, which be 
caus by the displac of the atom in the crystal. therefore, the temperatur 
depend of the fwhm be govern by the strength of electron–phonon 
coupling. one of the quantit express of electron–phonon coupl be the 
deform potenti (d), defin a the chang in the bandgap energi per unit 
strain due to phonon scattering. 

deform potenti have be use sinc 1950 to describ the electron– 
phonon interaction40. It be defin a the deriv of the electron energi level 
with respect to strain. one way to estim deform potenti be by model 
the fwhm of photoluminesc linewidth, the broaden of which be due to 
phonon scatter when crystal lattic vibrates. We appli the follow model to 
fit the temperature-depend fwhm of phc2 and C4 in our study, base on the 
report from previou literature41:

the effect mass of the electron and hole be calcul use dft with 
the result in tabl s2; the ωhomo homopolar phonon mode for the pb–br–pb 
stretch be measur from RR result (for phc2 the correspond wavenumb 
be 133 cm−1, and for C4 it be 131 cm−1). densiti (ρ) of for both perovskit be 
calcul use the unit-cel volum measur from scxrd (2.8 g cm−3 for both 
materials). the width of the quantum well (l) be quantifi use the thick of 
the pb–br–pb inorgan layer (0.6 nm). 

the fit result be list in tabl s5. 
It also should be note that the inhomogen linewidth (γ0) be 

larg in phc2 than in c4, indic that the structur distort (even 
at veri low temperature) be higher. thi structur distort come from 
within the pb–br6 octahedra: the br–pb–br bond angl insid the octahedron 
of phc2 be 172–174°, instead of the 180° in the C4 crystals. however, structur 
distort do not vari with temperature: the br–pb–br bond angl be 
measur a 168–172° (phc2) and 180° (c4) at 100 K. the dft calcul 
also show that at 0 K the correspond angl for phc2 be 168–170° and 
that for C4 be 180°. 

At room temperature, the width of the PL spectrum be the combin result of Γ0 
and thermal broadening. We observ that C4 crystal show great fwhm than 
phc2, indic that the more intens phonon vibrat in C4 result in strong 
thermal broadening.
