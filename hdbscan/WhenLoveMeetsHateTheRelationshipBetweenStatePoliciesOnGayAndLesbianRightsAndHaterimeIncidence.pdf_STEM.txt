Do public polici on gay and lesbian right affect the incid of hate crime base on 
sexual orientation? We propos that legal inequ increas hate crime becaus they 
provid discurs opportun for bias, discrimination, and violence. legal equality, 
however, will reduc violence. use annual panel data from 2000 to 2012, a period of 
substanti polici change, we analyz how three state polici affect report hate crimes: 
same-sex partnerships, employ non-discrimination, and hate crime laws. hate crime 
and employ non-discrimin law that includ sexual orient reduc hate 
crime incidence. partnership recognit increas report hate crimes, though it may not 
increas actual crime incidence. becaus incid be spatial correlated, polici chang in 
one state yield spillov benefit in other states. these result provid some of the first 
quantit evid that public polici affect hate crime base on sexual orientation. 
find confirm the role of institut heterosex and discurs opportun in 
produc hate crimes.

sweep social chang be the subject of a long line of sociolog inquiri (e.g., burstein, 1998; burstein and monaghan, 1986; 
dobbin et al., 1993; korpi and palme, 1998; rosenberg, 2008). the practic consequ of these polici be clear, and gay 
and lesbian individu who live in state with pro-equ polici report few psychiatr disord and low psychiatr 
comorbid (hatzenbuehl et al., 2009). In addit to these individu impacts, extern have long accompani polici 
chang and other type of organ social action (merton, 1936). for example, pro-equ polici might not onli promot 
equal in access to individu benefits, but they also could foster a more toler social climate. 

one indic of increas social toler would be a reduct in hate crimes. scholarship on anti-gay and lesbian 
violenc identifi heterosexist ideolog (herek, 1992) and cultur stereotyp (franklin, 1998) a potenti driver of in- 
dividu bia and, in extrem cases, violence. among these societ drivers, the law stand out a a particularli salient 
institut (herek, 2009b). As far a we be aware, however, extant sociolog research have yet to investig the effect of 
public polici e or broader sociocultur environ e on hate crime base on sexual orientation. research on racially- 
motiv hate crime be compar well-developed. blalock (1967) identifi power threat a a key driver of discrimi- 
nation. likewise, lynch and racial hate crimesmay bemotiv by discurs opportun (koopmans,1996; koopman 
and olzak, 2004) or defens of a neighborhood against in-migr of racial minor (grattet, 2009; green et al., 1998; 
lyons, 2007). We bridg the literatur on cultur heterosex and racially-motiv hate crime to examin how 
chang in public polici relat to sexual orient creat or restrict discurs opportun for hate crimes, condit 
for defend marriage, and crime motiv by econom competition. 

thi articl examin the relationship between law and hate crime by analyz the impact of chang in a particularli 
salient social polici issue: public polici relat to sexual orientation. specifically, we ask whether polici chang affect the 
incid of report hate crime base on sexual orientation.1 We begin by discuss the literatur on anti-gay and lesbian 
attitudes, the impact of attitud and polici on hate crimes, and promin theori of hate crimes. next, we present the 
data and our method of analysis. We leverag the recent, rapid chang in polici regard gay and lesbian right by use a 
prais-winsten panel regressionmodel with state fix effect to analyz the impact of polici on annual report hate crime 
over a period of 13 years. thi research also includ a spatial lag depend variabl to captur the artifici natur of 
state border and diffus of hate crime product across space. then, we present and discu our results, which gener 
find posit extern (reduct in report hate crimes) from pro-equ policies. these findings, which be 
consist with theori of institut heterosex and the law a a driver of discurs opportun for bia crimes, 
provid some of the first quantit evid regard the impact of public polici on hate crime base on sexual 
orient and demonstr that social extern like hate crime should be includ in pro-equ arguments. 
1. background and literatur 

1.1. polici chang 

pass in 1996, the defens of marriag act be just one promin exampl of a recent spate of feder and state policy- 
make limit same-sex partnership dure the late 1990 and 2000s. over the past fifteen years, twenty-eight state have 
implement constitut amend restrict marriag to one man and one woman (human right campaign, 2014). 
eleven of these amend be pass in the 2004 gener election, when activist and state legisl may have place 
them on the ballot to increas conserv turnout (smith et al., 2006). earlier ban arose, in part, a a backlash against 
progress polici gain (soule, 2004). recently, however, state and feder appel court have overturn state ban on 
same sexmarriage. befor the suprem court rule state ban unconstitutional, nearli forti state plu the district of columbia 
issu same-sex marriag licenses, and sever other provid recognit or right to same-sex coupl (human right 
campaign, 2014). moreover, in the 2012 gener election, maine, maryland, and washington becom the first state to pa 
(or affirm) same-sex marriag at the ballot box, and minnesota becom the first state to reject a marriag ban by popular vote. 

As same-sex marriag polici have chang over time, so have polici on hate crime base on sexual orientation. sexual 
orient be onli recent add to the feder hate crime law with the matthew shepard and jame byrd, jr. hate crime 
prevent act of 2009, but state have address the issu for over twenti year with some pass their own law prior to 
2009. although the feder law allow for the provis of resourc to state and local authorities, 20 state do not cover 
sexual orient a part of their hate crime law (anti-defam league, 2011). conversely, a number of state take action 
befor the feder polici chang in 2009, with the district of columbia pass it law in 1989, a hand of state pass law 
in the 1990s, and mani state pass law in the earli 2000 (human right campaign, 2014). 

nondiscrimin polici have receiv less public attent recent despit some signific polici actions. A 1998 
execut order sign by presid clinton prohibit feder employ discrimin base on sexual orient in the 
execut branch (offic of personnel management, n.d.). In addition, 21 state plu the district of columbia prohibit 
employ discrimin base on sexual orientation, with 10 state enact their first nondiscrimin polici in the 
past 10 year and an addit 5 state in the past 20 year (human right campaign, 2014). 
1 although thi articl focu on gay and lesbian individuals, other populations, such a bisexual, transgend and queer individuals, be often impact 
by same-sex partnership, employ nondiscrimination, and hate crime policies. scholar may wish to expand thi research to includ these addit 
popul in the future.

1.2. chang in social attitud 

As public polici have liberalized, so too have peopl becom more accept of homosexu e though most of the 
declin in stigmat do not begin until the 1990 (hick and lee, 2006; keleh and smith, 2008; loftus, 2001). the 
major of research suggest that there be a relationship between public polici and approv of homosexu (andersen and 
fetner, 2008; hoogh and meeusen, 2013; lewi and oh, 2008). nevertheless, to date there exist “no systemat analysi of 
the relat between public attitud toward homosexu and the legal recognit of same-sex marriag and regist 
partnership” (hoogh and meeusen, 2013, p. 258), particularli the causal direct of ani relationship. 

besid public policy, other cultur and polit forc be relat to an individual’ odd of approv of homosexuality. 
state and nation ideolog affiliations, especi religi and polit orientations, be relat to public opinion on same- 
sex relationship (adamczyk and pitt, 2009; lewi and oh, 2008). nation emphas self-express over a survivalist 
orient tend to be more accept of homosexu (adamczyk and pitt, 2009). In the unit states, counti with high 
commun cohes be less approv of same-sex marriag bans, wherea counti with tradit valu and gender 
employ pattern be more approv of a ban (mcveigh andmaria-elena, 2009). other factor associ with increas 
toler over time includ a reduct in right-w authoritarianism, increas awar of research suggest that 
homosexu be innate, the de-link of aid with sexual orientation, and increas accept by public, religious, and 
polit author (altemeyer, 2001). these find suggest that despit the need for addit research on the impact of 
public policy, broad cultur and polit forc be relat to accept of homosexu at the individu level. 

A logic question follows: if public polici be relat to attitudes, could they encourag or prevent hate crimes? given 
that prejudic be the “basic underli factor” for all individu commit hate crime base on sexual orient 
(mcdevitt et al., 2002, p. 306), societ forc also seem a like influenc on hate crime incidence. We now turn to the 
literatur explor public polici and the sociocultur environ a distal caus for hate crimes. 

1.3. hate crime base on sexual orient 

there be a dearth of theori and research a to whi hate crime base on sexual orient occur, perhap becaus most 
research on hate crime focu on experi of survivor (roxell, 2011). studi that explor the motiv behind these 
hate crime tend to examin the characterist and attitud of individu perpetrators. for instance, perpetr of anti-gay 
action be more like to be young, male, black, religious, conservative, and heterosexu (franklin, 2000; jewel and 
morrison, 2010; roxell, 2011). In addition, mcdevitt et al. (2002) have develop a typolog of offend that identifi 
four distinct motiv for hate crimes: thrill, defense, retaliation, and mission. 

although individu attitud and situat context certainli play key role in motiv anti-gay behavior and hate 
crimes, societ attitud and norm ideolog be factor a well (parrott and peterson, 2008; willis, 2004). thi be not 
surprising, consid that individuals’ attitud be often ground in societ norm that stigmat gay and lesbian in- 
dividu and privileg heterosexu (willis, 2004). homophobia and institution heterosex can cultiv an envi- 
ronment inwhich anti-gay behavior and hate crime be accept (willis, 2004). In fact, research identifi the enforc of 
societ gender norm a motiv for anti-gay behavior (franklin, 1998, 2000; jewel and morrison, 2010) and broader 
approv of hate speech and hate crime (cowan et al., 2005). mani perpetr believ that violenc and harass be 
necessari form of punish for those who do not adher to societ gender norm (franklin, 1998, 2000) and a way to 
accentu their ownnorm ident (franklin, 2000; jewel andmorrison, 2010; parrott andpeterson, 2008; roxell, 2011). 

the invers may be true a well; wherea heterosexist and homophob societ norm can motiv hate crime and anti- 
gay behaviors, pro-equ norm may curb these behaviors. individu in canada be less like to engag in anti-gay 
behavior than those in the unit state due to the differ in cultur norm and pressur (jewel and morrison, 
2010). even individu identifi a more homophob be mind of how other would perceiv their attitud and 
behaviors, and be “motiv tomonitor their prejudici express to control how theywould be perceiv by others” (p. 
2102). In sum, social and cultur norm may play a role in hate crime and anti-gay behaviors. 

1.4. theori of hate crime 

wherea extant research suggest a link between sociocultur context and hate crime base on sexual orientation, it have 
yet to offer a guid theori for whi hate crime occur. In thi regard, research on racially-motiv hate crime be rel 
well-developed. specifically, when legal conflict or discrimin becom salient, they creat discurs opportun for 
racially-motiv bia crimes2 (finkelman, 1992; koopmans, 1996; koopman and olzak, 2004). join the institut 
heterosex literatur with research on racially-motiv hate crimes, we examin the law a a key social institut of bia 
motiv violenc base on sexual orient (herek, 2009b). In fact, research show a moder relationship between 
2 In europe, for instance, polit tension over immigr instig anti-immigr violenc (koopmans, 1996), and mass medium coverag of discord 
and violenc rais the salienc and further facilit thi process (koopman and olzak, 2004). In the unit states, histor examin of lynch 
implic the explicit or implicit approv of public offici who refus to indict lynch particip a contributor to the racist mob violenc 
(finkelman, 1992). 



b.l. levy, d.l. levi / social scienc research 61 (2017) 142e159 145 
neg stereotyp and prejudic toward gay and lesbian individu (simon, 1998), and “antigay violenc can be see 
primarili a an extrem manifest of pervas cultur norm rather than a a manifest of individu hatred” 
(franklin, 1998, p. 20). thus, we test the follow hypothesis: 

h1. constitut amend ban same-sex marriag will increas the incid of sexual orientation-motiv 
hate crime over sever years. 

inversely, legal polici that de-stigmat homosexuality, such a hate crime law and well-public commit by 
law enforc to pursu anti-gay and lesbian crimes, can be expect to reduc individu bia and the incid of 
hate crime base on sexual orient (hamner, 1992). 

h2. pro-equ polici e those promot equal e will decreas the incid of sexual orientation-motiv hate 
crime over sever years. 

along with the long-term impacts, it be import to consid short-term impact of polici changes. contrari to the long- 
term predict in h2, there be two reason whi one might expect a short-term increas in hate crime follow pro- 
equal policies: 1) increas incid due to perceiv threat and 2) increas reporting. research on racially- 
motiv hate crime inform our expect regard short-term increas in incidence. the defend neighborhood 
model of racially-motiv hate crime posit that (primarili white) resid of racial homogen neighborhood that 
experi great in-migr of racial divers individu will commit more hate crime a they perceiv an increas 
threat to their neighborhood (grattet, 2009; green et al., 1998; lyons, 2007). similarly, histor research on lynch find a 
posit relationship between the percentag of black resid in a locat and the number of lynch (beck and tolnay, 
1990; corzin et al., 1983; reed, 1972; soule, 1992; tolnay et al., 1989). blalock’ (1967) work develop a theori of majority/ 
minor relat highlight threat to power a a primari explan for increas violence. pro-equ polici repres 
a clear threat to institut heterosex and heterosexist power. In fact, homophob individu might commit hate 
crime to defend their marriag or the institut of marriag (a defendedmarriagemodel). although a short-term increas in 
hate crime could accompani ani pro-equ policy, partnership recognit seem a especi like candidate. glaser 
et al. (2002) find that although employ competit and neighborhood in-migr of racial minor produc lit- 
tle chang in violent discours of white racist in internet chat rooms, interraci marriag prompt signific increas in 
support for racially-motiv violence. 

In addit to increas incid due to perceiv threat, pro-equ polici might lead victim of hate crime to report 
those crime at increas rate becaus they perceiv great social accept ewithout ani increas in actual hate crimes. 
In her studi of sexual orientation-bas hate crime on colleg campuses, stotzer (2010) found that school with pro-equ 
polici at the state and campu level report high rate of hate crimes. however, when compar to the low number of 
crime report to the fbi in the same locales, stotzer conclud that high rate of report on campu be due to the 
support environ rather than high incid of crime. 

some pro-equ polici victori be associ with an increas in social movement organ (kane, 2010), 
themselv associ with great rate of report (mcveigh et al., 2003). such chang in report would yield a sta- 
tistic increas in incid when an actual increas may not exist. We consid both increas incid and increas 
report in our third hypothesis: 

h3. the introduct of pro-equ policies, especi partnership recognition, may produc a short-term increas in hate 
crime incid via great violenc or increas reporting. 
1.5. impact of chang public polici 

exist research on other topic highlight the impact of polici and law by state. for instance, in maurelli and ronan’ 
(2013) analysi of sex offend notif law and sex crime data between 1960 and 2008, they found that 17 of 50 state 
have a signific reduct in forcibl rape follow the pass of sex offend notif laws. On the other hand, 32 
other state have no signific chang follow laws. In addit to sex offend notif laws, state regul of 
firearm impact crime rates. research on state firearm legisl found that stricter law be associ with few sui- 
cides, homicides, and non-fat injuri use firearm (anesti et al., 2015; irvin et al., 2014; simonetti et al., 2015). 

despit the number of studi on state law and crime rates, there be scant research investig the link between public 
polici and hate crimes. the effect of hate crime reform have not be evalu (shively, 2005), and in most states, part- 
nership recognit polici have not be in place long enough to allow for evaluation. evid frommassachusetts, where 
the state’ suprem judici court legal same-sex marriage, suggest that there may be a relationship between same-sex 
marriag legal and reduct in hate crimes. In 2003, when the court legal same-sex marriage, report hate 
crime drop by roughli thirti percent (bantley, 2008). similarly, in 1996 when the defens of marriag act be passed, 
hate crime in massachusett be rising. these statist be hardli definitive, and addit investig use more 
rigor analysi be necessary. still, the suggest that “action or inact by the govern have have a tremend 
impact on thi group of citizens” be worth explor (bantley, 2008, p. 564). 

among the most sever stressor that be preval in the gay and lesbian commun be violence, harassment, and fear 
for safeti (berrill, 1992). research suggest that roughli 20 percent of gay and lesbian adult experi crime base on their 



b.l. levy, d.l. levi / social scienc research 61 (2017) 142e159146 
sexual orient (herek, 2009a), and over half experi some form of harass or victim e a rate that be 
moder high than their heterosexu counterpart (katz-wis and hyde, 2012). moreover, 8 out of 10 gay, lesbian, 
bisexual, and transgend individu between the age of 13 and 20 experi harass at school, includ verbal 
harass (81.9%) and physic harass (38.3%) (gay, lesbian & straight educ network (glsen) 2011). victimi- 
zation of gay and lesbian youth and adult tend to occur in public with perpetr who be stranger (herek et al., 2002) 
and be relat to increas absenteeism, academ difficulties, problem functioning, depression, low self-esteem, stress, 
anger, and crime-rel fear (dunbar, 2006; glsen, 2011; herek et al., 1999). ultimately, the preval of violenc and 
harass against gay and lesbian individu coupl with the observ impact of polici on other measur of well- 
be suggest that polici could affect hate crime incidence. 

2. data and method 

thi research estim a prais-winsten autocorrelation-coefficient-weight first differ panel regress model with 
state fix effect (specifi later) to analyz the impact of public polici regard gay and lesbian right on the incid of 
hate crime base on sexual orientation. We use annual data from 49 state (includ washington, dc)3 over 13 year 
(2000e2012) and reli on variat in time of chang to state polici to identifi their relationship with hate crime inci- 
dence. thi be a common strategi to analyz the impact of specif policies. for example, hatzenbuehl et al. (2012) use the 
“quasi-natur experiment” (p. 286) of the 2003 massachusett court decis to gaug the impact of same-sex marriag on 
health care usage, and dee (2008) us variat in the time of same-sex partnership legal in europ to ass it 
impact on sexual transmit infections. 

2.1. depend variabl 

state-level data on sexual orientation-motiv hate crime be avail from the feder bureau of investigation’ 
(fbi’s) uniform crime report program (feder bureau of investigation, 2012).4 the hate crime statist act of 1990 
mandat the collect of data on report crime which display manifest evid of prejudice, includ prejudic base 
on sexual orientation5 even though sexual orient be not includ in hate crime law in everi state. the offici report 
file with the fbi be regard a the “best sourc of nation hate crime data” (mcdevitt et al., 2000, p. 3), and they be use 
commonli by research analyz hate crime (e.g., alden and parker, 2005; grattet, 2009; medoff, 1999). hate crime 
includ murder, non-neglig manslaughter, rape, aggrav assault, simpl assault, intimidation, robbery, burglary, 
larceny-theft, motor vehicl theft, arson, destruction, damage, vandalism, and crime against societi (feder bureau of 
investigation, 2012). 

the number of report hate crime base on sexual orient have remain quit steadi recently, declin onli 
slightli from 1331 crime in 2000 to 1302 crime in 2012. By divid sexual orient motiv hate crime by annual 
state popul (u.s. censu bureau, n.d.db), we analyz the incid of report hate crime in a state. due mostli to u.s. 
popul growth, report crime declin by slightli more than one crime per two million individu over the period. A 
dickey, pantula (1987) test for first-, second-, and third-degre unit root in state-level report hate crime bare fail to 
reject the null hypothesi that a first-degre unit root may exist. levin et al. (2002) and harris, tzavali (1999) tests, however, 
confirm that the depend variabl be stationary. 

2.2. focal independ variabl 

We will be test the relationship between hate crime base on sexual orient and four differ polici measures. 
We operation state marriag polici a a seri of dummi variables. although data be avail regard the type of 
same-sex partnership and benefit offer by a state (i.e., full marriag equal for same-sex couples, a marriage-lik union 
that be not marriag for same-sex couples, or some spousal right for same-sex couples), these variou polici sum to be 
present in a total of 90 observ e leav insuffici case to model the three type separately. As a result, we collaps 
these into a singl partnership recognit dummi variable. anoth dummi variabl identifi state with a constitut 
3 hawaii be miss data for all observations, and mississippi have miss or sporad report prior to 2008. 
4 there be some potenti limit to use the fbi hate crime data. like mani administr data, hate crime data be subject to underreport and 

heterogen in reporting. nevertheless, state fix effect and first-differenc both help to account for ani bia in thi study. moreover, to the extent 
that pro-equ polici would be accompani by an increas in report e at both the individu and jurisdict level e ani bia in the data would 
oper in the opposit direct of the hypothes long-term relationship between polici and hate crimes. thus, our paramet estim could be 
consid low bounds. thi research proce cautious while consid the possibl of underreporting. 

5 includ in thi categori of hate crime be crime against individu base on heterosexu orientations. thi introduc some level of bia in the 
outcom measure, but it be like to be minim for two reasons. first, unlik attitud toward and hate crime against gay and lesbian individuals, attitud 
toward and hate crime against heterosexu would not seem to vari across states. second, hate crime against heterosexu plausibl can be expect to 
be quit rare. 



b.l. levy, d.l. levi / social scienc research 61 (2017) 142e159 147 
amend ban same-sex marriage. these variabl be mutual exclus from each other and from the base categori 
of a gener statewid ban on same-sex marriag with no legal recognit of spousal rights.6 data for these variabl be 
avail from the human right campaign’ (hrc’s) and nation gay and lesbian task force’ (nfltf’s) websites. 

state hate crime polici be a dummi variabl indic whether or not a state’ hate crime law includ crime motiv 
by bia against sexual orientation. although it be possibl to further distinguish between state whose law address gender 
ident and those whose law do not, thi research do not incorpor thi variat becaus the outcom variabl 
measur onli hate crime base on sexual orient and not those base on gender identity. finally, we operation 
state nondiscrimin polici a a dummi variabl indic whether or not a state ban discrimin base on sexual 
orientation. data for both variabl be avail from the hrc’ and ngltf’ websites. appendix A provid a tabl of state- 
level polici and when they be enacted. 

To ass how state polici might be causal relat to report crime over time, we test sever lag and lead 
variabl specif of marriage, hate crime, and nondiscrimin policies. thi follow the logic of a granger causal 
test, which suggest that if one time seri be use in forecast futur valu of anoth time series, the former can be 
consid predict causal of the latter. the time of these relationship be import give the possibl that increas 
public toler might be expect to caus a reduct in hate crime and then passag of pro-equ polici along the 
line of a dynam representationmodel (stimson et al., 1995). We determin the appropri number of lag or lead for each 
variabl by begin with two lag and leads, use a wald test for group of lag or leads, and remov the long lag or 
lead one-by-on if insignificant. appendix B present the progress of stepwis model use the wald test to elimin 
lag and leads. 

2.3. control variabl 

thi analysi includ sever control variables: twomeasur of the incid of gener crime in states, threemeasur of 
incid of other report hate crimes, citizen and state polit ideolog measures, two measur of state parti gover- 
nance, state unemployment, and state fix effects. crime incid data be avail from the fbi’ uniform crime 
report program and cover both violent crime and properti crime, a well a report hate crime base on race/ethnicity, 
religion, and disabl status. We calcul these gener crime and hate crime incidencemeasur in the samemann a the 
depend variable. To the extent that report hate crime fluctuat be due to chang in state-specif gener crime 
trends, the gener crime measur should captur that. if, on the other hand, ani relationship between public polici and 
hate crime base on sexual orient be spuriou and captur broad social trend in hate crimes, our other hate crime 
measur should captur that. 

We includ sever measur of the sociopolit climat of a state becaus cultur context can foster or discourag hate 
crime base on sexual orient (parrott and peterson, 2008; willis, 2004), and conservat be associ with antigay 
behavior (franklin, 2000; herek, 2009b). citizen polit ideolog be a measur of how liber or conserv the state’ 
elector be in term of it polici preferences; we use the revis 1960e2010 citizen ideolog series7 first describ by berri 
et al. (1998). state govern ideology8 measur how liberal/conserv elect official’ polici prefer are; we use 
the nomin measur of govern ideology, which us common-spac congression ideolog prefer (poole, 1998) 
and have somewhat strong valid than a similar measur (berri et al., 2010). citizen and state govern ideolog 
measur rang from 0 (most conservative) to 100 (most liberal). state parti govern includ a dummi variabl captur 
whether or not the governor be a democrat9 and a variabl averag the share of the state repres and senat that 
be democrats10 (univers of kentucki center for poverti research, n.d.). 

We also includ the unemploy rate a a control for econom condit becaus although the literatur be mixed, 
some research find a relationship between econom downturn and racially-motiv hate crime (e.g., beck and tolnay, 
1990; hovland and sears, 1940; soule, 1992). the bureau of labor statist calcul state-level unemploy rate 
(univers of kentucki center for poverti research, n.d.). finally, state fix effects11 control for time-consist omit 
variabl caus across-st variat in hate crimes. for example, the share of a state’ popul identifi a gay, 
lesbian, bisexual, transgender, or queer might affect the incid of hate crimes. although there be no annual data avail 
to quantifi thi for our studi window, the within-st share of the popul be plausibl time-invari and control 
use state fix effects. summari statist for our variabl appear in tabl 1. 

after identifi the appropri number of lag or lead for the polici variables, we test sever theoretically-inform 
interact of our polici variabl with social context control variables. previou research suggest that the sociocultur 
climat of a state can affect how state implement polici regard gay, lesbian, and bisexu rights, a well a the 
6 It be possibl for state to have a constitut amend ban same-sex marriag and while also offer a marriage-lik union or some spousal 
rights. In the few situat where thi occurred, we cod the state a have the pro-equ polici and not the constitut ban. 

7 data be not avail for 2011e2012; we code thi variabl a miss for those years. 
8 data be not avail for 2011e2012; we code thi variabl a miss for those years. 
9 We code the district of columbia a have a democrat governor becaus the mayor of the district be a democrat in each year. 

10 We code observ from nebraska and the district of columbia a miss for thi variable. nebraska’ state legisl do not identifi with a party. 
the district of columbia’ council member do identifi with a specif party, but there be a quota for non-major parti member on the citi council. 
11 A wald test recommend the inclus of the gener crime incid paramet and state fix effects.

extern that result (bernstein, 2003; eskridge, 1999). for instance, bernstein (2003) util a multidimension 
framework for understand polit movement and activists. she explain that cultur factors, defin a social norms, 
behaviors, and discourse, often impact the strategi of lesbian and gay activist and the outcom of their efforts. In the case 
of sodomi laws, cultur chang often occur even without chang in law. further, cultur differ by state impact 
activ and polici implementation, with some effort promin display via town meet or judici challeng and 
some occur behind the scene (bernstein, 2003). 

the literatur on racially-motiv hate crime also suggest econom downturn or resourc deprivationmight increas 
lynch and bia crime due to increas competit for resourc (beck and tolnay, 1990; green et al., 2001b; hepworth 
and west, 1988; hovland and sears, 1940; soule, 1992). In other words, white frustrat by econom hardship and lack of 
resourc blame and attack african american for their difficulties. recent find on racially-motiv hate crimes, 
however, do not necessarili show such clear connect with econom (grattet, 2009; green et al., 1998; lyons, 2007; 
medoff, 1999). We test interact of unemploy with nondiscrimin law and citizen ideolog with all polici 
variables, and they prove statist and substant insignificant. We do not discu the result here (avail upon 
request). 

A robust lagrang multipli test (pisati, 2001) indic spatial autocorrel in the depend variabl across the 
states. We account for the spatial autocorrel by includ a spatial effect term. the spatial effect for a state in a give year 
be theweight averag of the depend variabl for all other state in that year, where state areweight use the number 
of individu migrat to the state for which a lag be calculated. migrat data for creat the spatial weight be averag 
annual migrat flow between state a measur by the pool 2005e2007 american commun survey (u.s. censu 
bureau, n.d.da). thus, the spatial lag captur the impact of popul flows, includ the attitud and ideolog peo- 
ple carri with them, between states. 

In addition, test for serial correl (drukker, 2003) and heteroskedast indic that both violat of linear 
regress assumpt be present. thus, we estim a prais-winsten autocorrelation-coefficient-weight first differ 
model (xtpcse in stata) with heteroskedast panel correct standard errors. given the moder larg cross-sect size, 
the cluster error be unlik to be biased, and concern of finit sampl properti should not appli (kezdi, 2004). the 
assumpt of strict exogen of the regressor for feasibl gener least squar should not be violat by the spatial 
effect term becaus it exclud hate crime incid of the estim observ (state). the model be reflect by the 
follow equations:

hate crime incid (y) in state s dure year t be explain by k lags/lead of state polici variabl (p), a weight (w) 
spatial effect term (y�s), sever control (z), state fix effect (d),12 and a heteroskedast panel correct error (εst). We 
obtain the autocorrel coeffici (brþ by use ol to estim the model without weight differenc and regress 
the residu on the one-year lag residuals. By take an autocorrelation-coefficient-weight first difference, we remov 
the portion of each year’ independ and depend variabl that be due to serial correlation. thi be not the same a a 
complet first difference, which would subtract the full previou year valu from the present year valu for all variables. As a 
result, although the model be not estim year-to-year changes, signific polici variabl do have an impact both for the 
year that they take place13 and in the follow year(s) at a reduc rate (br). To account for miss data on the citizen and 
govern ideolog variables, the democrat governorship and legislatur variables, we use multipl imput with 
chain equat (mi ice in stata) and 50 imput data sets. We calculatemean coeffici and standard error use rubin’ 
(1987) formula. finally, we scale all coeffici e except the spatial lag e to repres the number of addit hate crime 
per one million individu per year that can be expect give a one-unit chang in the independ variable. 

thi model strategi depart from research on hate crime use neg binomi model for three reasons. first, 
although hate crime be rel rare, there be not an overabund of zero in the present data (less than 5 percent of 
observ be zero); poisson and neg binomi model be especi superior to linear regress model when there 
be a substanti number of zeros. second, in our base prais-winsten model, neither the depend variabl nor the residu 
be heavili skewed, though the residu do display significantli more kurtosi than a normal distribution. third e and most 
importantli e we anticip that the function form of the relationship between public policies, citizen attitudes, and hate 
crime be linear a oppos to log-linear. for example, we expect similar impact when the liber of a citizenri increas 
from 5 to 10 and from 10 to 15. To test the sensit of our result to our choic of estimator, we estim a fix effect 
neg binomi panel regress of our prefer model, and the result be larg consist with the present findings.14 

3. result and discuss 

We begin our analysi by plot nation incid of report hate crime motiv by sexual orient against the 
share of the popul cover by each of the four public polici we consid from 2000 to 2012. In thi section, we will 
integr these descript result with our multivari model and proceed by consid each of our hypothesi in 
succession. 

3.1. hypothes 1 & 2 

our initi two hypothesi posit that pro-equ polici will be associ with reduct in incid of report hate 
crimes, wherea anti-equ polici will be relat to increas report incidence. fig. 1 present trend for the share of 
the american popul live in state with employ nondiscrimin law (dash line) and hate crime law that 
includ crimesmotiv by sexual orient (dot line) from 2000 to 2012. these percentag chang over time a state 
enact new laws. We compar the trend with the annual incid of report hate crime (solid line) over the same period. 
the dramat rise in the share of the popul cover by hate crime law in the earli 2000 slightli preced an equal 
dramat declin in hate crimes. In 2000, onli one in six american live in a state with hate crime law includ sexual 
orientation; in 2005, the number have risen to seven in ten americans. In 2000, therewer 4.8 hate crimesmotiv by sexual 
orient per million people; by 2005, that rate be cut by 27 percent to 3.5 hate crime per million people. the time 
order of thi relationship be consist with the implement of hate crime law granger caus a drop in hate crimes, 
though a definit determin of causal would requir more rigor controls. 

similarly, the substantive, yet less dramatic, increas of employ nondiscrimin polici that includ sexual 
orient in the earli 2000 also coincid with the declin in report hate crimes. In 2000, one in four american live in 
state with employ nondiscrimin laws; in 2005, roughli four in ten american live in such a state. rather than 
preced the drop in hate crime by a year like the hate crime law increase, the rise in nondiscrimin law seem to 
occur simultan with the decline. 

fig. 2 be analog to fig. 1, except that it present trend for the share of peopl live in state with constitut 
amend ban same-sex marriag (dash line) and partnership recognit polici that offer marriage, a marriage- 
like union, or some spousal right (dot line). As thewav of state implement constitut ban on same-sexmarriag 
begin in 2004, hate crimeswer in decline. the decline, however, revers cours after 2005 and rise to it post-2005 peak of 
4.3 hate crime per million peopl in 2008 e the same year that coverag of constitut ban peak in their coverag of 
12 becaus the fix effect option be not avail follow xtpcse in stata, we calcul fix effect manual use the xtdata command prior to 
estim the model. 
13 Or the follow year(s) in the case of a lag policy. 
14 the constitut marriag ban be statist insignificant. one partnership recognit variabl be signific and posit relat to report 
crimes, and one employ nondiscrimin variabl be neg and significantli associ with report crimes. onli the coeffici on lag hate 
crime law vari in it relationship, becom statist insignific (but still negative) in the neg bimoni regression. the magnitud of the 
coeffici be not directli compar becaus the neg binomi model take a log-linear form. result be not present here but avail upon 
request.

the population. It be plausible, though again hardli definitive, that the discriminatori natur of constitut bans, a well a 
the heat polit environ that they produc (smith et al., 2006), broke the momentum of the declin and incit a 
new wave of anti-gay and lesbian violence. 

Of the four polici we examine, partnership right be by far the last to see substanti change. marriag and partnership 
polici coverag hardli increas until 2007, and it saw onli small growth until 2010. dure the period of signific growth 
from 26 percent coverag in 2010 to 41 percent coverag in 2012, hate crime incid remain flat (see fig. 3). It be possibl 
that the potenti reduct in report hate crime achiev through pro-equ polici have alreadi be realiz 
through hate crime and nondiscrimin laws, and partnership recognit thu do not yield the same posit externality. 
alternatively, thi pattern may be confirmatori of H3 and a short-term increas in hate crime report that counteract the 
reduct associ with pro-equ policies, and we discu thi further in section 3.2. 

although the bivari relationship we observ suggest an impact of public polici regard gay and lesbian right on 
hate crime incidence, disentangl the uniqu effect of four polici chang at differ time across differ state be a 
complex task. We turn to multivari analysi to test these initi find more rigorously. tabl 2 present the result of 
prais-winsten fix effect panel regress model analyz hate crime incidence. model 1 be our initi model, which 
includ one-year lag of constitut bans, partnership recognit laws, hate crime laws, and employ nondiscrim- 
inat laws. additionally, we includ present year partnership recognit and employ nondiscrimin laws, a well 
a a two-year lag of partnership recognition. hate crime law that includ sexual orient be neg relat to hate 
crime incidence, wherea constitut ban on same-sex marriag be posit associ with hate crimes. for example, 
state institut a constitut ban on same-sex marriag be associ with one addit hate crime per million peopl 
than state that have neither a ban nor partnership recognit polici in the year follow enactment. these polici have 
signific one-year lags, which be consist with polici chang granger caus chang in report hate crimes. 
employ discrimin polici also be neg relat to report hate crime incidence, but the paramet fail to 
meet tradit threshold for statist signific use a joint wald test. 

model 2 add a spatial lag to the base model. the spatial lag miss signific thresholds, but the coeffici be positive, 
substantive, and suggest of an increas of roughli one hate crime per everi three hate crime in ‘nearby’ states. moreover,

recal that a robust lagrangemultipli test indic signific spatial autocorrel in the depend variabl (p < 0.001). 
the potenti influenc of nearbi state be not surpris give that individu tend to cluster geograph along di- 
mension like polit ideolog and valu (bishop, 2009; tam cho et al., 2013), and thu state where the societ forc be 
more conduc to hate crime base on sexual orient be like to ‘neighbor’ each other (or at least have resid that 
migrat between each other). the substant import of neighbor state suggest that there may be spillov effects 
in the posit or neg direct depend on the policy of a state’ polici regard gay and lesbian rights. the polici 
variabl signific in model 1 remain signific at a substant similar magnitude, indic that the relationship 
between polici chang and hate crime incid be unlik to be endogen to sociopolit chang occur in nearbi 
areas. 

model 3 includ control for gener form of crime, report incid of other type of hate crimes, econom condition, 
citizen ideology, and polit structur and ideology. among these, onli the report incid of hate crime base on race/ 
ethnic be significant. In addition, the liber of a state’ citizen bare miss the p < 0.05 threshold for significance, but 
it be substant and posit correl with report hate crime incidence. although such a relationship may seem 
counterintuitive, it be consist with research report great report of hate crime with increas in gay movement 
organ (mcveigh et al., 2003); liber citizenri also like foster a social cultur that encourag report of hate 
crimes. 

hate crime law continu to be neg relat to report hate crime incidence, and employ nondiscrimin 
law be now significantli and neg relat to incidence. state institut a nondiscrimin law be associ with 
one few report hate crime per 900 thousand peopl dure the year the polici be adopt and an addit one few 
report crime per 1.2 million peopl in the year follow enactment. constitut ban on same-sex marriag be no 
longer relat to report hate crime incidence, indic that the relationship between the two be correl but not 
causal. finally, partnership recognit polici be posit relat to report hate crime incidence, and we discu thi 
further in section 3.2. 

over all, our find thu far be gener support of h2. We predict that pro-equ polici will reduc report 
incid of hate crime base on sexual orientation, and thi seem to be the case with hate crime and employ 
nondiscrimin law includ sexual orientation. both polici granger caus reduct in report hate crimes, 
indic of potenti posit externalities. In contrast, we reject H1 e at least in it causal form. constitut ban be 
posit correl with report hate crimes, but thi relationship be explain by the mani control we includ in our 
model. 

3.2. hypothesi 3 

our final hypothesi (h3) posit a short-term increas in hate crime incid follow enact of pro-equ pol- 
icies, especi partnership recognition, via great violenc or increas reporting. recal from fig. 2 that we observ no 
chang in report hate crime associ with the rise in partnership recognit polici nationwide. In our multivari 
model in tabl 2, however, we find that state partnership recognit law granger increas report hate crimes. specif- 
ically, a partnership recognit law be associ with one addit hate crime per 1.2 million peopl in both the imple- 
mentat year and the year follow implementation, a well a an addit hate crime per one million peopl two year 
follow implementation. 

thi find be confirmatori of h3, but the caus of the increas remain unclear. We cannot determin definit if the 
increas in report crime result from an actual increas in violenc or an increas in report only. given the particularli 
contest natur of marriag polici (glaser et al., 2002), it be not inconceiv that partnership recognit might incit 
retaliatori violence. If the increas be due to retaliatori hate crimes, wewould expect the effect to be strong in conserv 
locat give the relationship between an individual’ conserv ideolog and propens to commit a hate crime 
(franklin, 2000; jewel and morrison, 2010; roxell, 2011). when test interact between citizen ideolog and part- 
nership recognit polici (despit their statist insignificance), however, there be littl differ in themargin effect of 
partnership recognit between liber and conserv citizenries. alternatively, becaus hate crime law and employ 
nondiscrimin law tend to be adopt befor partnership recognition, the former polici may yield the bulk of the gain 
in hate crime reductions. such a scenario could leav increas in report a the primari impact of the later-enact 
partnership recognit policies. thus, it be possibl that the time order of polici implementation, a oppos to the 
specif type of policy, determin a policy’ impact. We address thi possibl now. 

3.3. polici order effect 

We re-estim our model of hate crime incid use time variabl and lag for pro-equ polici implement 
instead of indic variabl for specif pro-equ policies. for example, if a state implement a hate crime law includ 
sexual orient in 2005 and an employ nondiscrimin law in 2008, the state would be cod a implement 
their first pro-equ polici in 2005 and their second in 2008. In thi time specification, thi hypothet state would look 
exactli like a state that implement an employ nondiscrimin law in 2005 and partnership right in 2008 (but have 
no hate crime law) from a model perspective. We again begin by test two year of lag and lead for each polici time 
variabl and elimin lag or lead base on signific test and jointwald tests. tabl 3 present the result of our polici

time model, which includ the present valu of the first pro-equ policy, a one-year lag of the second pro-equ 
policy, and the present value, a one-year lag, and a two-year lag of the third pro-equ policy. 

most of the benefit of pro-equ polici appear to aris from the second polici that be implemented. the second pro- 
equal polici reduc report hate crime incid in the year follow implement by one hate crime per 600 
thousand people, again indic granger causality. the first pro-equ polici have a muted, statist insignific 
neg relationshipwith hate crime incidence. It be worth note that we be unabl to captur a sizeabl share of the chang 
in report hate crime that may be due to the first pro-equ polici becaus 12 state implement such a polici in 2000 
or beforeemean it impact would be captur entir by the state fix effects.15 As a result, wemay simpli be unabl to 
estim the impact of an initi polici with our data. 

the third pro-equ polici be associ with an increas in report hate crime in the implement year and the 
two year follow implementation. thi result be unsurpris as, with onli one exception, when a state enact a third pro- 
equal polici it be establish some type of partnership recognition, which also be associ with an increas in report 
hate crime incid (see tabl 2). although the result be hardli definitive, we be inclin to interpret thi increas a a rise 
in report rather than a spike in hate crime commit by individu retali against same-sex partnerships. wewould 
15 An addit 19 state have yet to institut a pro-equ polici by 2012. thus, 12 of the 30 state (40 percent) with pro-equ polici have their first 
pro-equ polici complet control with state fix effects. 



b.l. levy, d.l. levi / social scienc research 61 (2017) 142e159154 
expect retaliatori violenc to be strong when the polici discours be at it peak e the period surround implementation. 
In contrast, the increas in report crime be strong in the two year follow implementation. 

finally, we attempt to gaug the rel import of polici type versu implement order by pool both set of 
variabl into a singl prais-winsten model. unfortunately, it be difficult to distinguish which be drive the chang in hate 
crime due to the high degre of multicollinear between the two type of variables. We then compar the explanatori 
power of the base model from tabl 2 and 3 that estim the relationship of polici type and polici order with hate crime 
incidence. these model provid littl evid to adjud the issu a they have compar explanatori power16 and 
similar paramet estimates. although we cannot settl the debate, it be instruct that the implement order model 
perform essenti a well a the polici type model. thi indic that at least some of the posit extern of pro- 
equal polici be due to their adopt in state that previous have one or no such policies. 

ultimately, we find signific effect of most polici despit includ a strong control for across-st varianc with 
state fix effect and examin onli within-state, over-tim variat in polici and hate crime incidence. for at least the 
twelv state that have implement their first pro-equ polici by 2000, three of which also have implement their second 
by 2000, the fix effect complet absorb the (immediate) impact of these policies. most likely, the fix effect also 
captur some of the addit observ varianc in hate crime that might be attribut to polici chang dure the 
window of analysis. thus, we consid our estim potenti low bound of the true relationships. 

4. conclus 

the substanti chang in state polici on gay and lesbian right over the past 15 years, a well a the persist het- 
erogen across states, have import consequ for the well-b of gay and lesbians. alreadi establish be the 
implic of public polici for mental and physic health, a well a a host of individu benefits. We examin the po- 
tential for polici extern in the form of hate crimes. previou research on racially-motiv violenc suggest perceiv 
threat of integr (grattet, 2009; green et al., 1998; lyons, 2007) and discurs opportun (koopmans, 1996; 
koopman and olzak, 2004) be potenti driver of hate crimes. the present find provid the first rigor quantita- 
tive evid that public polici on gay and lesbian right affect the incid of hate crime base on sexual orientation. our 
result be consist with institut heterosex theory, wherein the law provid or restrict discurs opportun 
for bias-bas violence. 

employ nondiscrimin and hate crime law be associ with reduc report of hate crimes, provid evi- 
denc confirmatori of h2. although it be unclear whether it be the implement order or type of polici that drive chang 
in incidence, these relationship be clear, in the expect direction, and consist with polici chang granger caus 
chang in incidence. along with potenti benefit for gay and lesbian in a state implement pro-equ policies, the 
posit spatial lag term that bare miss tradit signific threshold indic that pro-equ polici in one state 
may yield spillov benefit for individu in other ‘nearby’ states. 

consist with h3, partnership recognit law yield increas in report hate crime incid in the implement 
year and two year following. whether the increas be due to retaliatori violenc or great report cannot be determin 
definit with the present analyses, but the result be suggest of increas in report crime a oppos to retaliatori 
violence. under a defendedmarriag model, wewould expect a spike in hate crime coincid with implement and the 
strong increas in conserv states; in contrast, we see the strong effect two year follow implement and 
roughli equival increas by across level of citizen polit ideology. thi find in particular would benefit from 
addit exploration. 

these result build on exist argument that anti-gay and lesbian violenc be an extrem manifest of social stig- 
matiz and cultur norm that be foster by social institutions, and futur research should explor the potenti 
mediat role of stigma in the product of hate crimes. accord to both goffman’ (1963) and link and phelan’ (2001) 
models, the process of stigmat includ statu loss and discrimin that subsequ legitim stigma. law and 
public polici can be key sourc of social stigmat by codifi and perpetu differ in statu and institu- 
tional heterosex (herek 2009b, 2011). public referendum and ballot initi in particular may crystal attitud and 
behavior toward gay and lesbian individu (vanhorn, 2008). It be through these individu attitud and behaviors, of 
course, that public polici and stigmatizationwould have an effect on hate crimes. not onli be individuals’ attitud relat 
to their pro-gay and lesbian activ (wilkinson and sagarin, 2010), their attitud also be associ with behavior in case 
of hate crime (parrott and peterson, 2008). accordingly, to good understand the impact of pro-equ polici on hate 
crime incidence, it will be import to examin the role of stigmat and it impact on social attitudes. 

the present research also be not without it limitations. hate crime be notori difficult to count accur (cramer, 
1999; herek et al., 1999; jen and grattet, 2005). although the uniform crime report be commonli use (e.g., alden and 
parker, 2005; grattet, 2009;medoff,1999) and regard a the best avail data sourc (mcdevitt et al., 2000), our estim 
of hate crime incid still like suffer from signific undercount. In the future, repres survey or experiment 
test report of hate crime would be benefici to good quantifi the extent of the problem. fortun for the present 
16 the model R2 statist be less than one percentag point different. the base model in tabl 2 have an R2 of 0.2852, wherea the base model in tabl 3 
have an R2 of 0.2926. 



b.l. levy, d.l. levi / social scienc research 61 (2017) 142e159 155 
research, however, the variou sourc of hate crime data tend to be in agreement regard how hate crime be distribut 
across commun despit report differ total (green et al., 2001a). thus, though count of incid may be inac- 
curate, dispar and trend between state be plausibl correct. moreover, give that underreport be the primari 
challeng e and underreport can be expect to decreas with the institut of pro-equ polici e the effect of 
report bia should run counter to the expect polici effect in H1 and h2. base on thi and stotzer’ (2010) findings, 
the data challeng accompani hate crime research should suppress, rather than inflate, our estim effects. 

these find add to the newli form literatur on the social product of hate crimes. the small bodi of quantit 
research focu on racially-motiv bia crime and explor econom and neighborhood transit model of causation. 
We extend thi literatur to hate crime commit against gay and lesbians, individu for whom civil right advanc be 
rel recent and ongoing. additionally, we test the applic of the defend neighborhood and discurs oppor- 
tuniti model to hate crime base on sexual orientation. We find evid consist with a discurs opportun model 
(koopmans, 1996; koopman and olzak, 2004) in which the law be a key social institut that induc or discourag bias- 
motiv violence. 

thi research also have implic for current social policy. In addit to the individual-level benefit that character 
current pro-equ argument in the gay and lesbian right debate, there be posit social externalities, such a a reduct 
in hate crimes, associatedwith pro-equ laws. although public opinion onmarriag equal remain fairli close divided, 
the gener public is, for the most part, not divid in it opposit to hate crimes. thus, the potenti for state polici to 
influence, if not serv as, societ forc in the product of hate crime will be an import consider for legislatur 
and court deliber marriag equality, hate crime, and employ nondiscrimin laws.
