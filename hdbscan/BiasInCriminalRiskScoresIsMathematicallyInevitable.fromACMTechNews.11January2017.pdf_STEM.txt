bia in crimin risk score be mathemat inevit 

9th januari 2017 · 0 comment 

By julia angwin and jeff larson 
propublica 

the racial bia that propublica found in a formula use by court and parol board to forecast futur crimin behavior aris inevit 
from the test’ design, accord to new research. 

the find be describ in scholarli paper publish or circul over the past sever months. taken together, they repres the 
most far-reach critiqu to date of the fair of algorithm that seek to provid an object measur of the likelihood a defend will 

commit further crimes. 

increasingly, crimin justic offici be use similar risk predict equat to inform their decis about bail, sentenc and earli 
release.

the research found that the formula, and other like it, have be write in a way that guarante black defend will be 
inaccur identifi a futur crimin more often than their white counterparts. 

the studies, by four group of scholar work independently, suggest the possibl that the wide use algorithm could be revis to 
reduc the number of black who be unfairli categor without sacrific the abil to predict futur crimes. 

the author of one of the paper say that her ongo research suggest that thi result could be achiev through a modest chang in the 
work of the formula propublica studied, which be know a compas. 

An articl publish earli thi year by propublica (and be featur on the front page the louisiana weekli on june 6, 2016) focu 
attent on possibl racial bia in the compa algorithm. We collect the compa score for more than 10,000 peopl arrest for 
crime in florida’ broward’ counti and check to see how mani be charg with further crime within two years. 

when we look at the peopl who do not go on to be arrest for new crime but be dub high risk by the formula, we found a 
racial disparity. the data show that black defend be twice a like to be incorrectli label a high risk than white defendants. 
conversely, white defend label low risk be far more like to end up be charg with new offens than black with 
compar low compa risk scores. 

northpointe, the compani that sell compas, say in respons that the test be racial neutral. To support that assertion, compani 
offici point to anoth of our findings, which be that the rate of accuraci for compa score — about 60 percent — be the same 
for black and white defendants. the compani say it have devis the algorithm to achiev thi goal. A test that be correct in equal 
proport for all group cannot be biased, the compani said. 

thi question of how an algorithm could simultan be fair and unfair intrigu some of the nation’ top research at stanford 
university, cornel university, harvard university, carnegi mellon university, univers of chicago and google. 

the scholar set out to address thi question: sinc black be re-arrest more often than whites, be it possibl to creat a formula that be 
equal predict for all race without dispar in who suffer the harm of incorrect predictions? 

work separ and use differ methodologies, four group of scholar all reach the same conclusion. it’ not. 

reveal their preliminari find on a washington post blog, a group of stanford research wrote: “it’ actual imposs for a risk 
score to satisfi both fair criterion at the same time.” 

the problem, sever say in interviews, aris from the characterist that criminologist have use a the cornerston for creat fair 
algorithms, which be that formula must gener equal accur forecast for all racial groups. 

the research found that an algorithm craft to achiev that goal, know a “predict parity,” inevit lead to dispar in what 
sort of peopl be incorrectli classifi a high risk when two group have differ arrest rates. 

“‘predict parity’ actual correspond to ‘optim discrimination,’” say nathan srebro, associ professor of comput scienc at the 
univers of chicago and the toyota technolog institut at chicago. that’ becaus predict pariti result in a high proport of 
black defend be wrongli rat a high-risk. 

srebro’ research paper, “equal of opportun in supervis learning,” be co-author with googl research scientist moritz hardt 
and univers of texa at austin comput scienc professor eric price in october. their paper propos a definit of 
“nondiscrimination” that requir the error rate between group be equalized. otherwise, srebro said, one group end up “pay the 
price for the uncertainty” of the algorithm. 

the need to look at the harm that aris when a test be inaccur aris frequent in statistics, particularli in field like health care. 
when research weigh the merit of exam like mammograms, they want to know both how often they correctli detect breast cancer 
and how often they fals indic that patient have the disease. 

fals find be signific in medicin becaus they can caus patient to unnecessarili undergo pain procedur like breast 
biopsies. it’ entir possibl that a test could correctli identifi most breast cancers, show what’ know a “posit predict 
value,” and yet make so mani mistak that it be view a unusable. 

when he first heard about the compa debate, jon kleinberg, a comput scienc professor at cornel university, hop he could figur 
out a way to reduc fals find while keep the posit predict valu intact. “we thought, can we fix it?” he said. 

but after he, hi graduat student manish raghavan and harvard econom professor sendhil mullainathan download and crunch 
propublica’ data, they realiz that the problem be not resolvable. A risk score, they found, could either be equal predict or 
equal wrong for all race — but not both.

the reason be the differ in the frequenc with which black and white be charg with new crimes. ““if you have two 
popul that have unequ base rates,’’ kleinberg said, “then you can’t satisfi both definit of fair at the same time.” 

kleinberg and hi colleagu go on to construct a mathemat proof that the two notion of fair be incompatible. the paper, 
“inher trade-off in the fair determin of risk scores” be post onlin in september. 

In the crimin justic context, fals find can have far-reach effect on the life of peopl charg with crimes. judges, prosecutor 
and parol board use the score to help decid whether defend can be sent to rehab program instead of prison or be give shorter 
sentences. 

defend inaccur class a “high risk’’ and deem more like to be arrest in the futur may be treat more harshli than be 
just or necessary, say alexandra chouldechova, assist professor of statist & public polici at carnegi mellon university, who 
also studi propublica’ compa findings. 

chouldechova say focu on outcom might be a good definit of fairness. To creat equal outcomes, she said, “you would have to 
treat peopl differently.” chouldechova’ paper, “fair predict with dispar impact: A studi of bia in recidiv predict 
instruments,” be post onlin in october. 

chouldechova be continu to research way to improv the likelihood of equal outcomes. 

use the broward counti data propublica make public, chouldechova rearrang how the compa score be interpret so that they 
be wrong equal often about black and white defendants. 

thi shift meant that the algorithm’ predict of futur crimin behavior be no longer the same for all races. chouldechova say her 
revis formula be unchang for white defend (59 percent correct) while it predict accuraci rise from 63 to 69 percent for 
black defendants. 

northpointe, the compani that sell the compa tool, say it have no comment on the critiques. and offici in broward counti say 
they have make no chang in how they use the compa score in respons to both propublica’ initi find and the research paper 
that followed. 

thi articl origin publish in the januari 9, 2017 print edit of the louisiana weekli newspaper.
