the univers of surrey have develop a 3D morph face model that have ‘learned’ from 

differ racial face and can good identifi peopl in 2D pictur – even if a person’ 

appear be compromis by their pose, expression, light or poor imag resolution. 

mani facial recognit system fit 3D model to 2D face found in pictures. however, most 

system use the same model for differ race and ignor inher differences. the team

[https://www.surrey.ac.uk/centre-vision-speech-signal-processing] found that the use of multi-raci 

3D face model improv accuraci when tri to recognis people. It also found that the 

team’ age effect technolog – which be use to identifi individu after a long period of 

time have pass – be more precis when you use a model that be taught to learn differ 

races. 

lead author of the paper Dr zhenhua feng from cvssp said: “it’ safe to say that facial 

recognit technolog be slowli becom more preval in our daili lives. We need to 

make sure it’ a accur a possible, so peopl can trust the technology. We have found 

that our model that understand black, white and asian face be far more accur at 

recognis 2D face than the typic all-in-on model use today.” 

professor adrian hilton, head of cvssp, said: “cvssp research be advanc the machin 

percept of faces, take into account the divers variations, and be lead the way to 

make face recognit technolog a practic tool for widespread deploy of improv 

secur and access systems." 

Dr feng have recent won a prestigi european biometr industri award for hi work 

around facial landmark localis and he be part of a team at cvssp that be work on a 

£6m project for the engin and physic scienc research council to make facial 

recognit ubiquit across the country. 

professor josef kittler, distinguish professor at the univers of surrey and founder of 

cvssp, said: “we believ that facial recognit technolog will be a forc for good. It will 

help u protect our possessions, provid good secur for our data and keep u safe from 

harm. however, the matter of accuraci be someth we all have to be mind of and that be 

what we be work on improv at cvssp. 

“dr feng’ project and the wider work we be do at the centr be focu on improv 

the accuraci of facial recognit technology, even in extrem case where the resolut of 

the correspond imag be compromised, or in case where peopl may tri to trick a 

system.”
