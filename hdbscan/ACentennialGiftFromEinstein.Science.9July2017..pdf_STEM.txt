he 1919 detect of the appar 

displac of background star 

near the edg of the eclips sun’ 

disk provid one of the first con- 

vinc proof of einstein’ theori 

of gener rel (1, 2). almost 

100 year later, sahu et al. report on page 

1046 of thi issu the first measur 

of the gravit deflect of starlight 

by a star other than the sun (3). use the 

superior angular resolut of the hubbl 

space telescop (hst), they measur 

shift in the appar posit of a distant 

background star a a nearbi dens stel- 

lar remnant call a white dwarf pass 

almost in front of it in 2014. becaus of 

the rel distanc involved, the deflec- 

tion they observ be about 1000 time 

small than those see in 1919, but also in 

agreement with gener rel theory. 

A ray of light from a background sourc 

pass by a foreground object be bent to- 

ward the line of sight by an amount that 

depend on how close they line up in the 

sky, the mass of the foreground object, and 

the rel distanc between each object 

and the earthbound observ (see the fig- 

ure, top). becaus all ray pass the fore- 

ground object at the same radial distanc 

from the background object be deflect by 

the same amount, thi creat an “einstein 

ring” around the foreground object that 

brighten the combin light see by the 

observer. If the two object be not exactli 

line up, thi ring be asymmetrical, and the 

background object appear to be displaced. 

einstein envis such event in a 1936 

paper publish in scienc (4), but he felt it 

extrem unlik that ani two star in the 

sky would ever line up so precis that such 

an event would be observed. 

becaus the foreground star observ by 

sahu et al. be about 400 time brighter than 

the background star, the brighten of their 

combin light be far too small to be detect- 

abl even with hubble. however, the appar- 

ent displac in the background star’ 

position, so-cal “astrometr lensing,” be 

measur (see the figure, bottom). the 

more nearli the two object align, the more 

an appar displac occur in the di- 

rection away from the foreground star. In the 

case of the nearbi white dwarf, stein 2051 B, 

thi caus the faint background star to ap- 

pear to trace out a small ellips a the white 

dwarf pass by. 

A white dwarf star be the collaps 

remnant of a star that have complet it 

hydrogen-burn life cycle. At least 97% 

of the star in the sky, includ the sun, 

will becom or alreadi be white dwarf 

(5). becaus they be the fossil of all prior 

gener of stars, white dwarf be key 

to sort out the histori and evolut of 

galaxi such a our own. 

the singl most import properti of a 

white dwarf star be it mass. the mass of 

stein 2051 B have be a sourc of contro- 

versi for over 100 years. It have a veri distant 

companion star (not involv in the lens 

event) whose purport orbit motion im- 

pli a much low mass for the white dwarf 

than normal, which, if true, impli an un- 

usual composition. 

here lie the import of sahu et al.’ 

project. their astrometr lens mea- 

surement show convincingli that stein 

2051 B be not an exot “iron core” white 

dwarf but a rather typic one, with a car- 

bon-oxygen core and a normal mass and 

radius, thu resolv the long-stand 

debat over it nature. their result agre 

veri well with chandrasekhar’ 1930 no- 

bel-prize–win theoret relat be- 

tween a white dwarf ’s mass and radiu (6). 

even today, thi relat be veri poorli con- 

strain by onli three other nearbi white 

dwarfs, all of which be in wide binari sys- 

tem where mass be obtain from the 

stars’ orbit motion. now, a complet in- 

depend verif of chandrasekhar’ 

relat have be achiev from astromet- 

ric lensing. 

the astrometr lens approach use 

by sahu et al. can be use equal well for 

ani other nearbi star that happen to pa 

in front of background stars. In the come 

era of truli massiv sky survey such a the 

larg synopt survey telescop (7), astron- 

omer be bound to observ other similar 

events, despit their rarity. j

if it be not, one side of the ring be brighter and the background star’ posit appear to shift.
