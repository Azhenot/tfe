can the human brain learn to interpret input from a virtual world deliv directli 
through brain stimulation? We answer thi question by describ the first demonstr 
of human play a comput game util onli direct brain stimul and no other 
sensori inputs. the demonstr also provid the first instanc of artifici sensori 
information, in thi case depth, be deliv directli to the human brain through 
non-invas methods. our approach util transcrani magnet stimul (tms) 
of the human visual cortex to convey binari inform about obstacl in a virtual 
maze. At certain intensities, tm elicit visual percept know a phosphenes, which 
transmit inform to the subject about their current locat within the maze. use 
thi computer–brain interface, five subject success navig an averag of 92% 
of all the step in a varieti of virtual maze worlds. they also becom more accur 
in solv the task over time. these result suggest that human can learn to util 
inform deliv directli and non-invas to their brain to solv task that cannot 
be solv use their natur senses, open the door to human sensori augment 
and novel mode of human–comput interaction.

introduct 

consider progress have be make in interpret inform record from the brain to build 
non-invas brain–comput interfac (bcis) (rao, 2013) that allow control over a wide varieti 
of devices, such a cursor (wolpaw et al., 1991), robot (bell et al., 2008), and speller (xu et al., 
2013). while these effort have focu on decod inform from the brain, an import 
question that have not receiv a much attent is: can novel inform from artifici sensor 
or computer-gener virtual world be encod and deliv non-invas to the human brain 
to solv use tasks? We address thi question by show that transcrani magnet stimul 
(tms) can be use to deliv use inform to the human brain to solv a simpl navig task 
in a virtual world. To our knowledge, thi be the first demonstr that non-invas human brain 
stimul can be use for such a purpose, the most close relat previou demonstr be 
the work of thomson et al. (2013) who use invas stimul of somatosensori cortex in rat to 
deliv infrar inform for solv a discrimin task. other research efforts, also in rats, 
have focu on the neural mechan of navig in virtual realiti use visual or auditori cue 
(cushman et al., 2013; aghajan et al., 2015) rather than direct sensori feedback through stimulation.

transcrani magnet stimul have be and continu to 
be use a an import investig tool for cortic “knockout” 
studi (pascual-leon et al., 1999; devlin and watkins, 2007), 
neurophysiolog (terhun et al., 2015), and medic treatment 
(menk et al., 1999; georg et al., 2000). the realm of applica- 
tion of tm have recent expand a it have emerg a a tool 
for non-invas neural encod of inform via a computer– 
brain interfac (cbi), specif within the context of human 
brain-to-brain commun (grau et al., 2014; rao et al., 2014; 
stocco et al., 2015). rao et al. (2014) util tm over the pri- 
mari motor cortex to elicit a hand movement in correspond 
with chang in the motor rhythm (mu band power) of anoth 
subject. As with rao and colleagues, grau et al. (2014) transfer 
inform through a brain-to-brain interfac util chang 
in mu band power and encod inform in tms-produc 
phosphenes, though the inform transfer be not in real 
time. the presenc or absenc of phosphenes, temporari visual 
percept of line or spot that can occur upon neuromodul 
of the visual cortex repres a binari messag that be use to 
build simpl words. stocco et al. (2015) also util phosphen 
percept in a differ brain-to-brain interfac that allow 
2-way communication. In thi case, yes/no answer in a 20-ques- 
tion game be decod from one subject’ steady-st visual 
evok potenti (ssveps) and sent in real-tim to anoth 
subject, where thi inform be encod in the presenc or 
absenc of phosphenes. 

In the present study, phosphen elicit via singl puls 
tm over the primari visual cortex be util for augment 
human sensori capability. inform be relay to the subject 
about obstacl depth in a virtual environ where the subject be 
depriv of visual inform about the world they be navigat- 
ing. the intens of stimul depend on the rel posit 
of an avatar to the wall of the maze, such that be close to the 
wall caus the subject to perceiv a phosphen and be far 
from a wall result in the absenc of a phosphene. the subject 
advanc in the maze if they correctli interpret the stimulation. 

We demonstr that the decis time in classif of 
phosphen directli correl with the probabl of answer- 
ing correctly. subject also becom more accur in solv 
the navig task over the cours of the experiment. both of 
these result suggest that phosphen percept be an interpret- 
abl phenomenon, allow subject to learn to interpret and 
incorpor input from a cbi a a new artifici sourc of use 
sensori signals. 

materi and method 

subject recruit 
five healthi particip (age: M = 30.6, SD = 6.95, rang 
19–39; 3 females; see tabl 1) be recruit via word of mouth 
among the univers of washington student, staff, and faculti 
population. thi studi be carri out in accord with the 
recommend of the univers of washington institut 
review board under applic #48773. all subject give write 
inform consent in accord with the declar of helsinki 
prior to particip in the study. all subject recruit success- 
fulli complet the experiment. 

gener of maze 
fourteen experiment maze and seven control maze (see 
control condit below) be gener and util for all 
participants. all maze be 10 step in length and consist 
of a path that requir a combin of forward or downward 
movement (figur 1). the 14 experiment maze compris of 
two set of seven mazes. each set of seven maze consist of one 
maze with each of zero through six “turns” randomli distribut 
throughout the maze, where a turn be a switch between forward 
and downward movements. the second set of seven experiment 
maze repres the mirror imag of the first set, such that all 
forward movement be replac with downward movement 
and vice versa. the control maze be select such that for each 
of the one through six turn conditions, a maze from the origin

interpret the input from the cbi and make the correct movement.

set or the mirror set be randomli select and add to the 
control set. the control maze with 0 turn be select to includ 
onli downward movement to avoid the trivial case in which a 
subject would like finish the maze under the control conditions. 
the order in which the maze be present to the subject be 
random onc and kept consist between subjects. figur 2 
illustr the maze use in the experiment. 

control condit 
In order to ensur that inform come sole from the cbi, 
7 control game be randomli intermix with the 14 experi- 
mental games. dure these control trials, a custom-mad plastic 
prop, whose design be intend to mimic the shape and textur 
of the tm coil, be place over the coil, separ the coil from 
the scalp of the subject by 20 mm (figur 3). thi addit 
distanc prevent the appear of phosphen while mimick- 
ing other sensori cue that could provid inform about the 
subject’ locat in the maze, such a the nois and the vibrat 
gener by the tm machin upon firing. thi prop be test 
for each subject dure the threshold phase (describ below) 
to ensur it effect in prevent phosphen perception. 

prior to the experiment, subject be make awar of the 
exist of the control condit but be not inform about 

which game the control condit would appli to or the ratio of 
experiment to control games. dure the control condition, the 
tm machin still fire at intens appropri to the avatar’ 
locat within the maze, irrelev of it design a a control 
game. upon complet of the control maze, the subject be 
notifi of the game’ design a part of the control set so a 
to not mislead the subject about their performance, which may 
imped their confid in phosphen percept and influenc 
their futur performance. 

the methodolog with which the maze be construct 
ensur that one maze consist of a straight hallway with no 
turns, which would caus all tm puls to be subthreshold, and 
would thu mimic the percept of a control condit while 
not actual be a control maze. thi be do to help prevent 
subject from tri to guess whether the control condit be 
in place from a prolong lack of phosphenes. 

determin of phosphen threshold 
prior to the experiment, each subject underw a screen ses- 
sion in order to determin the intens and locat at which they 
reliabl perceiv phosphen from a singl puls tm stimula- 
tion. As convention, the intens of stimul be express a a 
percentag of the maximum output, which, in thi case, be a 2.2-t

first mark a 4 cm × 4 cm grid 1 cm dorsal to the inion. A candid 
locat be determin by stimul at increas intens up to 75%. 
If a phosphen be not perceived, a new locat be examined. the final 
above-threshold intens be establish a the minimum intens for which 
subject perceiv a phosphen for 10 consecut stimulations. conversely, 
the subthreshold intens be establish a the maximum intens for which 
a subject do not perceiv a phosphen after 10 consecut stimulations.

swim cap in front of a touch screen monitor (a) with their head situat in a 
two-prong head-and-chin-rest (b). the current maze be display to the 
experiment on a separ monitor not visibl to the subject (c). A 
figure-eight tm coil (d) be situat over the stimul site in the 
orient shown. the angl of the coil be consist across all subjects. In 
the control condition, the coil be cover by the control prop (partial 
visibl in the figure; see figur 3). the coil, power by a magstim super 
rapid2 stimul (e), be posit use a laser pointer (f) at the 
begin of everi maze game.

design to mimic the textur and size of the tm coil, but when appli to 
the coil (b), it separ the coil from the head by 20 mm, thu prevent 
the appear of phosphenes.

alpha coil, magstim, uk; figur 4) gener by a 660-v electr 
field from a biphas transcrani magnet stimul (super 
rapid2, magstim, uk; figur 4). the subject wore a tight-fit 
cap, in which the locat of the inion be mark a a refer 
point for the stimul process. A 4 cm × 4 cm grid of locations, 
arrang in 1-cm space row and columns, be then drawn 1 cm 
dorsal to the inion (figur 5). for a give location, the suitabl 
a a candid “hotspot” for stimul be determin by 
administ seven puls of increas intensity, in increment 
of 5%, start at 45%. If the subject do not perceiv a phosphen 
by the 75% mark, a new locat be examined. base on the 

result of stocco et al. (2015), the first stimul site examin 
be 2 cm dorsal, 1 cm left of the inion. subsequ site be 
then examin at increas distanc from thi start point. 
the first locat at which the subject could perceiv phosphen 
at intens less than 75% be design a the target site for 
the stimul hotspot. for safety, the subject be not stimu- 
late more than onc in a give 8 s interval, either dure the 
threshold procedur or dure the experiment session. the 
above-threshold intens be determin a the low intens 
for which the subject report phosphen percept for 10 con- 
secut stimulations. conversely, the subthreshold intens be 
determin a the larg intens for which no phosphen be 
perceiv for 10 consecut stimulations. the control condit 
be then test to ensur that particip could not perceiv 
phosphen when stimul at the above-threshold intensity. 

It should be note that thi method of phosphen percept 
implicitli account for minut individu differ between 
subjects, such a vari skull thick or neural architecture. 
additionally, onli a subset of all possibl stimul locat 
and paramet be examined. while a more reliabl stimul 
site may exist, the first reliabl locat be select in order to 
minim the number of stimul administ dure the 
threshold phase. therefore, becaus the choic of the locat 
be not optim for each subject, our result be like a con- 
serv estim and underestim the participants’ achiev 
performance.

note that the maze be not visibl to the subject until the end of the trial, and 
all movement decis must be make base onli on tm pulses. (a) the 
avatar be directli in front of a wall, thu trigger an above-threshold tm

no wall directli in front of the avatar, a subthreshold puls be fire again. the 
subject correctli identifi that no obstacl be directli in the avatar’ path and 
advanc one space forward. (e) thi mark the end of the game. At thi 
point, the maze be display on the subject’ screen to provid feedback on 
how far they progress through the maze. note that whenev the subject

noise-cancel earplug be use to help mask potenti extern 
cue and allow for good concentration. the tm coil be place 
over the subject’ occipit lobe at a locat determin dure 
the threshold procedur (describ above). the subject’ 
avatar start in the upper-left portion of the maze (figur 1). 
If the avatar be directli in front of a wall, an above-threshold 
tm puls be fired; otherwise, a subthreshold puls be fired. 
note that the maze be display on a second screen visibl 
onli to the experiment (figur 4) and remain hidden from 
the particip until the end of each maze. instead, the screen 
visibl to particip display a fixat sign cross while they 
wait for the next stimulation. two second after the tm fired, 
a question box appear ask if the subject wish to move 
forward in the maze or down a ladder. To avoid potenti confu- 
sion, a remind that the presenc of a phosphen correspond 
to a downward movement also display on screen. the subject 
answer the question by hit one of two button on the touch 
screen comput monitor to move forward or downward. If the 
subject identifi the necessari movement correctly, their avatar 
advanc one space in that direction. If the subject misinter- 
prete the stimulation, they do not advanc forward in the maze 
(figur 6); in thi case, the avatar remain in the same location, 
and the same intens stimul be fire in the next time step, 
effect repeat the time step. each maze requir 10 correct 
step to be travers completely. correspondingly, each subject 
be give 10 stimul per maze, and thu 10 opportun 
to move. after the 10 simulations, the maze be display on the 
subject’ screen to allow them to view their avatar’ final locat 
within the maze, and the subject be notifi if that game be 
part of the control set. the maze be then hidden from their view 
a the next game commenced. prior to the start of each game, the 
experiment examin the subject’ head posit and rel 
coil posit use a guid laser point at the stimul site 
(figur 4). If the next maze be a part of the control set, the 
experiment attach the control prop (figur 3) to the tm 
coil when readjust head position. To keep the time of the 
oper consist across differ conditions, the experi- 
menter mimick the procedur of insert the control prop 
befor everi trial, includ experiment trials. 

result 

On average, particip complet travers 70% of the maze 
under the experiment condit and 0% in the control 
conditions. the differ be statist signific [pair 
t(4) = 3.89, p < 0.02; figur 7a]. note that, a particip 
need 10 consecut correct categor in order to 
complet a maze, a singl mistak caus them to fall short of 
travers the entir maze. therefore, thi analysi be a conserva- 
tive measur of performance. A more sensit measur be the 
number of correct step perform by particip under each 
condition. particip complet an averag of 92% of the step 
in the experiment condition, significantli more than 15.4% 
of the step in the control condit [t(4) = 11.59, p = 0.0003; 
figur 7b]. In the control conditions, an ideal observ would 
alway assum that, sinc no phosphen be be perceived, he 
or she should alway move forward. thi would result in correctli 

perform onli the initi forward movement for the control 
maze and get “stuck” at the first wall obstacle. thi repre- 
sent 14.2% of the total number of movement and be thu the 
baselin perform for the control condition. two one-sid 
t-test show that particip perform abov baselin in the 
experiment condit [t(4) = 14.15, p = 0.0001], but not in the 
control condit [t(4) = 1.00, p = 0.38]. 

signal detect theori also provid anoth dimens of 
analysis. specifically, the perform of each subject can be 
visual describ use roc curv (fawcett and tom, 2006), 
which plot the true posit rate vs. the fals posit rate for 
both experiment and control conditions. In thi analysis, the 
“signal” be the correct direct at each step, and the “predic- 
tion” be the action select by the participant. figur 8 show the 
roc curv for each participant. within thi framework, the 
perform of each particip in both the experiment and 
control condit can be quantifi a the area under the curv

valu rang from 1.0 (an ideal detector that recogn all true 
posit with 0 fals positives) to 0.5 (a random responder). 
individu auc be calcul use the rocr packag for 
R (sing et al., 2005). becaus the auc be inher non-normal, 
the raw data be arcsin-root transform befor be ana- 
lyzed. the mean raw auc for the control condit be exactli 
at chanc (0.50), wherea the raw auc for the experiment 
condit be 0.93. thi be significantli larg than chanc 
[t(4) = 9.40, p = 0.0007]. 

A final measur of interest be the number of bit success 
transfer to the particip use the tm stimul by 
the cbi. thi measur be best captur by the mutual informa- 
tion between the seri of tm puls and the participant’ 
responses. the mutual inform valu be calcul use 
the infotheo packag for R (meyer, 2014), use the empiri- 
cal probabl distribut of zero and one to estim the 
correspond entropi (cover and thomas, 2005). the actual 
number of bit transfer can be calcul by first convert 

the mutual inform into bits, and then multipli it by 
the total number of puls for each maze (in thi case, 10), so 
that thi measur can be compar between the two condit 
(which have differ number of mazes). In the experiment 
condition, the raw mean number of bit transfer per maze 
be 5.16, which be significantli great than the mean of 0.01 
bit transfer dure the control condit [pair t(4) = 5.18, 
p = 0.006; figur 7d]. the raw number of bit transfer in 
the experiment condit be also great than chance, which 
in the mutual inform framework, correspond to zero bit 
[t(4) = 5.25, p = 0.006]. the averag of 0.01 bit transfer 
dure the control condit be not significantli differ than 
chanc [t(4) = 1.00, p = 0.38]. 

the five particip in our studi vari consider in 
term of perform dure experiment conditions, rang- 
ing from the 100% accuraci of subject 2 to 70.7% accuraci 
of subject 3. It be import to understand the origin of these 
differences, and how they might affect the use of tm in a 
cbi. In principle, these differ could reflect two differ

phenomena, name irreduc individu differ in sen- 
sitiv to visual neuromodul or individu differ 
in the rapid of learning. To clarifi thi issue, we analyz 
the data from the experiment mazes. As subject 2 make no 
mistak dure the experiment condition, thi subject’ data 
be exclud from thi analysis. 

A well-known psycholog phenomenon be that decis 
time relat to the similar between the avail altern 
to choos from; the more similar the alternatives, the longer the 
decis time. In thi instance, decis time repres the time 
that it take to determin whether to move forward or down in 
the maze from the time the tm machin fired. decis time 
be measur from the moment the altern (i.e., the screen 
button correspond to move forward or downward) be 
present to the subject, which occur exactli 2 s after the tm 
puls fired. the mean decis time be calcul separ 
for correct and incorrect trials. In the case of errors, particip 
take significantli longer to respond than in the case of correct 
trial [4,102 ± 582 vs. 3,362 ± 423 ms, respectively; pair 
t(3) = 5.97, p = 0.01; figur 9]. 

If error be due to the difficulti in categor an unusual, 
stimulation-induc visual percept, then it becom interest 
to examin whether particip be abl to familiar them- 
self with phosphen and learn how to recogn them over the 
cours of the experiment. If the particip be inde learn 
in thi manner, then the number of error should declin over 

time. To test thi hypothesis, the mean accuraci for each of the 
14 experiment maze across particip be calculated. As 
show in figur 9, a signific posit correl be found 
between the probabl of correctli classifi a phosphen and 
the posit of a maze (maze index) within the experiment

strategi of persever in the same direct (instead of decid at 
random) when the stimul result in an ambigu percept.

sequenc [pearson r = 0.57, t(12) = 2.42, p = 0.031]. thi cor- 
relat strongli suggest that some form of learn take place 
a particip progress through the experiment mazes. thi 
find be consist with the hypothesi that, a particip 
gain more experience, they becom good at interpret the 
initi unusu input from the cbi. 

while it be possibl that subject could learn to improv accu- 
raci by some other means, the notion that subject exploit 
pattern within the maze be not support by our data. becaus 
half of our 14 experiment maze be mirror imag of the 
other half, subject could not have reli on ani asymmetri in 
the distribut of forward and downward moves, a they be 
bound to be equal (each forward move in one maze be convert 
into a downward move in it mirror image). the symmetri of the 
maze also impli that there be an equal number of chang 
in direction, from forward to downward and from downward to 
forward. however, becaus the maze be gener by vary- 
ing the number of turn from 0 to 6, an intrins asymmetri in 
the distribut of move be that there be more continu 
(downward–downward and forward–forward) than chang 
of direct (downward–forward and forward–downward). 
becaus of the asymmetri in the distribut of turns, onli 
33.3% of all the move (across all 14 experiment mazes) 
result in a chang of direction. thi percentage, however, be 
an imperfect represent of the true statist experienc by 
participants. becaus the software’ feedback (phosphen vs. no 
phosphene) depend on the actual posit of the avatar on the 
screen, and becaus a mistak result in the participants’ avatar 
remain stuck in the same position, the actual percentag of 
turn particip move through repres 29.1% of the total 
moves. thus, subject could have learn the simpl strategi 
of persever in the same direct (instead of decid at 
random) when the stimul result in an ambigu per- 
cept. If thi be the case, however, we would expect not onli a 
declin of error with practic but also an asymmetri in the error 
distribution. specifically, the probabl of an error occur 

on a turn should be high in the late maze than in the earli 
ones. To test thi prediction, we calcul the condit prob- 
abil that the move where an error occur be a turn [i.e., 
p(turn | error); note that, becaus a move be either a turn or a 
continuation, p(turn | error) = 1 − p(continu | error)] for 
each maze where at least one error occurred. We averag thi 
probabl across participants. As see in figur 10, no signifi- 
cant correl exist between maze index and the probabl 
that an error occur on a turn [pearson r = 0.04, t(12) = 0.15, 
p = 0.88]. 

discuss and conclus 

our result suggest that human subject can learn to interpret 
the inform deliv via non-invas brain stimul to 
solv a task in a virtual world. In our experiments, a total of 72 
bit be transfer on averag per subject in approxim 
60 min; to our knowledge, thi be both the larg cbi infor- 
mation transfer use tm [superior to rao et al. (2014) and 
stocco et al. (2015)] a well a the larg cbi bit-rat to date. 
the type of inform deliv to the brain was, however, 
quit restricted. onli a binari signal gener base on pre- 
defin criterion be transmit to a singl region of the brain. 
nevertheless, a the technolog advances, we anticip that 
more sophist transmiss of inform may becom 
possible, facilit more fluid commun between the 
comput and the brain. At present, there be some critic 
limit that need to be overcom with regard to the spatial 
resolut of tm (walsh and cowey, 2000) and the need for a 
good understand of how complex and conceptu informa- 
tion be process in the brain. 

there be also some practic limit of our approach. 
tm machines, at present, tend to be too larg for portability. As 
thi aspect of the technolog improves, the paradigm present 
here could be useful, for example, in develop a non-invas 
sensori prosthesi for the blind. patient with certain type of 
blind have show the abil to perceiv phosphen (walsh 
and cowey, 2000; silvanto et al., 2007), suggest that the 
technolog present here could eventu allow such subject 
to good navig their environ use phosphene-bas 
feedback. thi would requir util dynam physic depth 
inform instead of the static virtual depth inform use 
in our study. 

four of the five subject answer correctli for the experimen- 
tal trial at a rate great than 93%, with one subject correctli 
identifi all 140 stimulations. accuraci for thi task also 
improv over time. these result suggest that human can learn 
to util inform deliv non-invas to their brain 
to solv task that cannot be solv use their natur senses. 
explor thi emerg field of human sensori augmentation, 
with it technolog a well a ethic and social implications, 
remain an activ area of research.
