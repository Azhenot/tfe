abstract zipf’ law have be found in mani human-rel fields, includ 

language, where the frequenc of a word be persist found a a power law function 

of it frequenc rank, know a zipf’ law. however, there be much disput whether it 

be a univers law or a statist artifact, and littl be know about what mechan 

may have shape it. To answer these questions, thi studi conduct a larg scale 

cross languag investig into zipf’ law. the statist result show that zipf’ 

law in 50 languag all share a 3-segment structur pattern, with each segment 

demonstr distinct linguist properti and the low segment invari 

bend downward to deviat from theoret expectation. thi find indic 

that thi deviat be a fundament and univers featur of word frequenc 

distribut in natur languages, not the statist error of low frequenc words. A 

comput simul base on the dual-process theori yield zipf’ law with the same 

structur pattern, suggest that zipf’ law of natur languag be motiv by 

common cognit mechanisms. these result show that zipf’ law in languag be 

motiv by cognit mechan like dual-process that govern human verbal 

behaviors.

introduct 

about 80 year ago, georg kingsley zipf report an observ that the frequenc 

of a word seem to be a power law function of it frequenc rank, formul a 

f(r) ∝ 𝑟𝛼 , where f be word frequency, r be the rank of frequency, and 𝛼 be the 

exponent(1, 2). thi linguist regular be late term a zipf’ law. In subsequ 

years, similar power law function have be wide found in variou domains, 

draw attent of scientist with differ academ backgrounds—it may reflect a 

univers law underli variou natural, social and cognit phenomenon (3-5). To 

specifi the mechan motiv such power-law functions, much work have be 

do from differ perspect (6-19). however, a univers acknowledg 

conclus be yet to obtain, which reflect a failur to fulli understand the role and the 

signific of these power function in natural, social and cognit spheres. 

In an effort to explor the motiv of zipf’ laws, we conduct a case studi on 

natur languages. though thi law be first observ in language, it signific in 

verbal commun and deep-level motiv be far from be clear. We know 

neither whi thi law have be persist found in sampl of differ languages, 

and with differ sizes, nor what underli mechan may have shape it. As a 

result, it be often propos that thi law have no linguist signific and cognit 

motivations: simpl and meaningless statist process (16), such a random type 

model (6, 8, 20), can result in power-law distribut similar to zipf’ law a well. 

however, a law usual describ the fundament natur of something. the failur to 

pin down deep level motiv actual suggest that zipf’ law be not a law: it 

shed no light on the fundament natur of verbal commun and the cognit 

mechan underli it. To trace the possibl cognit mechan that shape thi 

law, it be necessari to find a univers valid linguist interpret of zipf’ law, or 

rather it univers signific in verbal communication, which mean that zipf’ 

curv (word frequenc a a function of rank on a log-log scale) should exhibit, across 

differ languages, similar structur pattern that have similar linguist significance. 

hence, corpus-bas investig be need that cover languag a divers a 

possible. nevertheless, previou studi be gener limit to a rather limit 

rang of languag and paid littl attent to it underli cognit mechan and 

signific in languag communication.

base on text from 50 languages, thi quantit studi reveal that zipf’ law 

found in these languag all exhibit a 3-segment structur pattern, with the low 

segment invari bend downward to deviat from the theoret expectation, 

which have linguist signific and can be constru a motiv by dual-process 

model—a cognit mechan common among human beings. We further 

demonstr that comput simul base on thi cognit mechan can 

gener zipf’ curv that be structur similar to those found in human languages. 

these find suggest that zipf’ law found in human-rel field be like to 

have deep-level motivations, especi the cognit ones, and that big-data analysi 

base on corpu may provid valuabl mean to uncov languag law and to trace 

cognit law hidden behind. 



materi and method 

data 

languag materi use in our studi be take from bnc and leipzig corpus. In 

these corpora, we choos 50 languages. the sampl of each languag contain over 

300,000 sentences, rang between 80,000 and 43,000,000 word tokens. these 

languag belong to such typolog branch a indo-european, uralic, altaic, 

caucasian, sino-tibet, dravidian, afro-asiatic, etc. Of these 50 languages, 25 includ 

text of both news and wiki. 

To avoid the stochast influenc of text genr on overal word frequency, we 

conduct text-bas random upon the materi from bnc. the leipzig corpu 

have alreadi be random on the basi of sentences. 

piecewis fit of frequency-rank curv of 50 languag to differ power-law 

function 

the rank-frequ curv found in these 50 languag seem all to exhibit a 3- 

segment structur pattern. We therefor fit these 3 segment respect to the 

follow power law functions: y = a ∙ x𝑏, y = a ∙ x𝑏, and y = a ∙ (x + c)𝑏. In other 

words, for the fit function of the low segment that cover the word with low 

frequency, the definit domain be not sole confin to the frequenc rank. In 

addition, to prevent the influenc of too mani word with extrem low frequency, 

the fit of the low segment be base on logarithm equal size spaces, not 



4 / 18 



linearli equal size space, and offset C be add to the fit function to indic the 

steep and the direct of the bending. 

the influenc of text genr on the 3 segment of the curv 

25 languag be chosen in leipzig corpu to find out the influenc of the genr on 

the expon of fit function of these curves. for each language, the sampl 

cover two genres, includ both wiki text and news texts. for each genre, there be 

more than 300, 000 sentences. the expon deriv from text of wiki be pair 

with the expon deriv from text of news to conduct wilcoxon rank sum test. If 

the p-valu of test be small than alpha, the null hypothesi be reject that paramet 

of fit function be not influenc by genres. 

relat between linguist typolog and function expon of each curv 

segment. To studi the effect of typolog differences, we chose, among the 50 

languages, 37 languag that fall into 7 typolog branch that each contain at 

least 3 of these 37 languages. In other words, these 37 languag be unevenli divid 

into 7 group to conduct a f-test, which can reveal whether typolog differ 

affect expon of fit functions. 

the growth rate of word frequenc in upper segment, middl segment, and 

low segment. To investig how word frequenc grow with increas sampl 

size, the follow formula be use to calcul the averag growth rate of word 

frequency: 1 
𝑁−1 

∑ 𝑓(𝑛+1)/𝑓(𝑛) 
𝑐(𝑛+1)/𝑐(𝑛) 

𝑁−1 
𝑛=1 , in which f(n) be the frequenc of a word in languag 

sampl whose size be n word tokens. for each language，𝑆1﹦𝑆2﹦𝑆3﹦… … 𝑆𝑛 be 

sampl with differ sizes; n(s) be the number of word token in a sample; the 

relat among these sampl be 𝑆1 ⊂ 𝑆2 ⊂ 𝑆3 ⊂, … … ⊂ 𝑆𝑛 and 2 c(𝑆1) = 

c(𝑆2), 2c(𝑆2) = c(𝑆3), … … 2c(𝑆𝑛−1) = 𝐶(𝑆𝑛). 

We also investig the relat between the number of word type and the number of 

word token (sampl size) through linearli fit the logarithm of number of word 

type to the logarithm of the number of word token of each sampl in a language. 

the monomi coeffici of the fit function be the heaps’ exponent. To examin 

the influenc of genr and typolog on heaps’ exponent, a f-test be conduct on 

the news text and wiki text of 25 languages, and on the sampl of 37 languag that 

fall into 7 typolog branches.

comput simul of dual-gener mechan model .thi model includ 

two mechan to simul the growth of word tokens, one for the 3000 high- 

frequenc word that be cover in the upper and the middl segment of the curve, 

and the other for low-frequ word and new word that be cover in the low 

segment of the curve. for high-frequ words, the increas of sampl size will 

caus their total frequenc to escal accord to a fix probabl a found in 

exist samples. In other words, total probabl of high frequenc word (their 

rel frequency) be not much influenc by the variat in sampl size. the 

remaind probabl (1 minu the total probabl of high frequenc words) be 

assign to low frequenc word and new words. for example, if the total probabl 

of high frequenc word be 0.8, the frequenc of these word will stabli increas in 

accord with the increas of sampl size, and thu the total probabl will remain 

steadili a about 0.8. At the same time, the remaind 0.2 probabl will be assign 

to low frequenc words. sinc the total probabl be persist 0.2, more new 

word that may appear in a larg sampl will reduc the averag occurr 

probabl (or the mean rel frequency) of each word, which shape the 

downward bend of the low segment. 



result 

zipf’ law reflect the power law relat between word frequenc and it rank. sinc 

zipf’ law be found, in our study, invari to exhibit a 3-segment structur pattern, 

we be mainli concern with dynam pattern and the limit valu of the power 

expon of these 3 segments, that is, the power expon of the upper segment 

(hereaft expon 1), the power expon of the middl segment (hereaft expon 

2), and the power expon of the low segment (hereaft expon 3). the result 

of fit variat of expon 1 and 2 in sampl of increas size to power law, 

with adjust r2=0.8506 and 0.9177, show that, when the sampl size approach 

infinity, increas sampl size result in zero differ of expon 1 and 2 go to, 

and that expon 3 have a limit value, with the average, the maximal, and the 

minim good of fit be respect 0.9603, 0.5277, and 0.9996. In other 

words, with increas sampl size, expon 1 and 2 gradual reach constants, 

expon 3 go to a limit value. sinc expon 3 be alway significantli small 



6 / 18 



than expon 1 and 2, the downward deviat of the low be a univers 

phenomenon in natur languages. 

As see in figur 1, for all the 50 languages, the frequency-rank curv all deviat 

from the theoret expect of zipf’ law. for ani of these 50 languages, the 

zipf’ curv can be dissect into 3 segments. piecewis fit of zipf’ curv to 

power-law function in 50 languag indic that the minim adjust r2 of the 3 

segment be 0.9619, 0.9908, and 0.9482; the maxim adjust r2 be 0.9976, 

0.9998, and 0.9966; the mean adjust r2 be 0.9879, 0.9976, and 0.9831.the upper 

segment of the curv be consist unsmooth, roughli cover word whose 

frequenc rank be within 200 (the 200 most frequent words); the middl segment be 

smoother, cover the word whose frequenc rank be between 200 and 2000 (or 

3000 in some languages); the low segment be also smooth, but slope more steepli 

(that is, thi segment bend downward), cover the rest of the word in the sample. 



figur 1． the frequency-rank curv found in 50 languag of leipzig corpus. the 

upper segment of each curv (the segment befor the 1st vertic line) be unsmooth; the 

middl segment of each curv (the segment between the 1st and the 2nd vertic lines) 

be smooth, with the gradient be roughli 1. the low segment of each curv (the 

segment after the 2nd vertic line) be also smooth, but bend downward to deviat 

from the expect line.

In addition, the 3 segment also seem to regist distinct dynam properties. As 

can be see in figur 2, the sampl size have differ influenc on the 3 segments: 1) 

expon 1 and expon 2 remain stabl despit the growth of sampl size; 2) 

expon 3 and the power expon of the entir curv decreas with the growth of 

sampl size, go to a limit valu when the sampl size be approach infinity. In 

other words, these 3 segment exhibit differ dynam properties. due to limit 

space, figur 2 demonstr onli the statist of english. In fact, for the expon 

of the 3 segment in 50 languages, the pearson' linear correl coeffici be 

0.2543 between expon 1 and 2, 0.0746 between expon 1 and 3, -0.2384 between 

expon 2 and 3. So zipf’ curv of 50 languag all show similar patterns. and 

statist test indic no correl between expon of ani two segment of the 

curves. 

apart from the sampl size, linguist factors, such a text genr and typolog 

difference, seem to also have differ effect on the 3 segments. thus, 25 languag 

with both wiki text and news text be chosen to studi the influenc of genr on the 

3 segments. On the basi of these 25 languages, thi study, first of all, investig the 

ochiai coeffici of word that be share by text of both genr in each segment. 

the mean valu be respect 0.6362, 0.524, and 0.3477 in the 3 segments. In 

other words, in the upper segment, about 36% of word be differ across the two 

genres, while for the low segment, more than 65% of word be different. such a 

differ may have much to do the differ topic that differ text genr usual 

involve. then, we use nonparametr test to investig the influenc of genr on 

expon 1, 2, and 3, sinc littl be know of the distribut pattern of the 

expon of thesi languages. A wilcoxon rank sum test be conduct to investig 

the influenc of genr on the expon of each segment, which indic that the P- 

valu of expon 1, 2, 3 and heaps’ be respect 0.3033, 0.0598, 0.3417, and 

0.1160. obviously, the test onli yield low p-valu for expon 2. In other words, if 

we set signific level a 0.1, expon 1, 3 and heaps’ be insensit to genr 

differ while expon 2 be sensitive. To investig the influenc of typolog 

differ on expon 1, 2, 3 and heaps’ exponent, we conduct f-test on 40 

languag that fall into 7 typolog branches. the result indic that the f-valu 

and p-valu of expon 1, 2, 3, and heaps’ expon be 22.98 and 1.7786e-10, 

13.36 and 1.26e-07, 0.8742 and 0.5243, 0.7701 and 0.5988, which suggest 



8 / 18 



signific influenc of typolog differ on expon 1 and 2. . therefore, it 

can be see that genr differ influenc expon 2, and typolog differ 

influenc both expon 1 and 2. for the upper segment of the curves, most word 

remain the same regardless of differ text genres. for the low segment, on the 

contrary, most word be differ across differ genres. however, the expon of 

segment 1 and 3 be insensit to genres, suggest that semant have littl 

influenc on the overal frequenc distribut of word in these two segments. what 

be more, these segment seem to cover word of differ categories: the upper 

segment mainli includ the function word while the middl and the low segment 

mainli cover content words. 



figur 2． the relat between expon 1, 2, 3 and the sampl size a found in 

english sampl of leipzig corpu 



the differ dynam properti of the 3 segment can be see more clearli in the 

fact that, for differ segments, the increas of sampl size will bring about differ 

growth rate of word frequency. the statist of 50 languag indic that the 

frequenc of most word in the upper and the middl segment increas in proport 

to the sampl size, while the frequenc of word in the low segment do not. In 

other words, the upper and the middl segment of curv rise in accord with the 

growth of the sampl size, but the low segment rise much slower, lead to the 

downward bend of the curve.

for larg scale languag samples, especi those that have be shuffled, the 

probabl of word occur in it be expect to be stable, and a a result, their 

frequenc be expect to be in a constant proport to sampl size (the number of 

word tokens). To investig the growth rate (dynam properties) of word frequenc 

in each segment, we calcul the growth rate of word frequenc in relat to 

doubl sampl sizes. the result show that, for most word in the upper and the 

middl segments, the growth rate cluster around 2 when sampl size doubles. that is, 

frequenc of most word grow in proport with the increas of sampl sizes. In 

contrary, for most word in the low segment, the growth rate cluster around 1, 

which mean that, in thi segment, the frequenc of most word grow much slow 

than the increas of sampl sizes. sinc the frequenc of most word in the low 

segment fail to increas proport with the growth of the sampl size, the rel 

frequenc of word in thi segment be like to diminish in larg samples, or rather, 

the tempor interv between two occurr of a word be like to widen in larg 

samples. 

In short, word frequenc distribut in natur languag be character by a 

tendenc for zipf’ curv of larg sampl to bend increasingli downward. thi 

phenomenon can be explain in term of the cognit mechan of the dual- 

process model (21-25) that suggest two quit differ gener mechan for 

high-frequ word and low-frequ words. To test thi hypothesis, we conduct a 

comput simul to find out whether a model includ two differ gener 

mechan be necessari to gener the univers observ downward bending. In 

the simulation, new words’ occurr probabl be predict by heaps’ law and 

statist fitting. accord to heaps’ law, there be a good power-law relat 

between the size of a text (the number of word tokens) and the number of word types. 

our statist investig into heaps’ expon of 50 languag suggest that the 

distribut of heaps’ expon be insensit to genr and typolog differences. 

the differenti form of the function of heaps’ law be the ratio of increas of word 

type to the increas of word tokens, i.e. the occurr rate of new words. the 

heaps’ expon be small than 1, and hence, the expon of the correspond 

differenti form be small than 0, or, decreas with the increas of sampl sizes. In 

other words, new word do not grow at a steadi rate, but slow and slower, with 

increas sampl size. 



10 / 18 



present there be two influenti model to account for the frequenc distribut of 

words, both base on a singl gener process. one be simon model (12, 26), 

which assign no fix probabl to high-frequ words, prescrib that new 

word appear with equal probabilities. thi model have be attract scholar 

becaus it can gener power law distribut of word and have explanatori power 

outsid of linguistics. the other one be random type model, which gener word 

frequenc distribut by randomli hit the key of typewrit and calcul the 

frequenc of string separ by spaces. thi model, though mathemat simple, 

be capabl of gener power law distributions. figur 3 illustr the simul 

result of these two models. As show in figur 3, both model produc frequency- 

rank relat that, though in agreement with power-law functions, lack the downward 

bend found in natur languag (27). In other words, the frequenc distribut of 

word in natur languag can be explain by neither of model that be respect 

base on onli one gener process. however, the propos model base on the 

mechan of dual-process yield curv with downward bend similar to those 

found in natur languages.

the statist result suggest that zipf’ curv of natur languag seem to 

univers have a 3-segment structur pattern: the upper segment, the middl 

segment, and the low segment, a persist found in 50 languages. sinc each 

segment have it distinct linguist properties, zipf’ curv with thi peculiar 3- 

segment structur pattern be like to reflect a linguist law, not a mere statist 

artifact. In fact, zipf and mani other scholar have long notic that zipf’ curv may 

consist of segment with differ properties, a reflect in the observ deviat 

from expect curv (28-29). some other scholar have tri two-seg piecewis 

fit in english and obtain result that be capabl of linguist interpret (13, 

30). but their two-seg piecewis fit be all base on one languag sample, 

and henc cannot univers reveal the dynam properti of these differ 

segments. base on 50 differ languages, our find probabl suggest univers 

linguist pattern that be underpin by univers motiv such a common 

human cognition. 

sinc the 3 segment present differ linguist properties, it be possibl to 

linguist account for how thi pattern be shaped. the upper segment of the curv 

cover mostli function words—th fundament syntact mean in sentenc 

organ and comprehension. therefore, their frequenc in one languag be 

expect to be stabl regardless of text genr and sampl sizes. however, syntact 

mean (e.g. function words, inflection, and word order) may weigh differ in 

typolog differ languages, which be a possibl linguist explan for our 

find that typolog differ have influenc on expon 1. expon 2 

seem sensit to text genre. linguistically, thi may have much to do with basic 

categori or concept (31) becaus the middl segment consist mainli of most 

frequent content words. text of differ genr may cover veri differ field and 

topics, which may reli differ on these basic categori (concepts) in semant 

presentation. As a result, the content word denot these concept may account for 

differ proport of word in text of differ genres, or rather, their rel 

frequenc may vari with differ text genres. In addition, typolog differ 

also affect the expon of the middl segment, which may impli that typolog 

differ languag may somewhat differ in the use of basic categories. however, in 

one language, the basic categori and their role in semant present be rather 

stabl in a specif field, and henc the rel frequenc of these word should be 



12 / 18 



stable, regardless of the text size. thi be probabl a linguist explan for the 

find that expon 2 be sensit to differ in both typolog and genre, but 

insensit to differ in corpu size. use quit infrequently, and in mani case 

onli once, the word cover in the low segment of the curv be larg neither 

function word nor basic categori content words. for these words, their rel 

frequenc be not stable, with the averag decreas with larg sampl sizes. what 

be notic be that the limit valu of expon 3, insensit to text genres, sampl 

size or typolog differences, be like to be a linguist univers share by 

differ languages. 

univers linguist pattern be believ to be driven by more fundament 

mechanisms, such a those of human cognition. As a result, the abov linguist 

pattern a reflect by the 3-segment structur pattern may also be account in 

term of common human cognit mechanism, which may further explain whi thi 

law univers exist in variou languag and in mani other human relat areas. . 

high-level human cognit activ be probabl character by the dual-process 

model. type-1 process featur promptness, automaticity, effortlessness, freedom 

from consciou attention, etc.; type-2 process featur slowness, control attention, 

consciou effort, etc. (32). the upper and the middl segment of zipf’ curv mainli 

cover those high-frequ words, whose frequenc rise in proport to increas in 

sampl size. thi dynam properti mean that there be no need to introduc ani 

tempor paramet or other constraint into formal probabl model to account for 

their probabl of occurrence. cognitively, the freedom from extra constraint mean 

littl or no effort for activ of these high-frequ words. such effortless and 

prompt character type-1 process. In contrast, the low segment mainli cover 

those low-frequ words, whose rel frequenc be tempor unstable, 

decreas with the growth of sampl sizes. therefore, tempor paramet or other 

constraint be need to account for variabl rel frequenc of low-frequ 

words. for these words, the relat between frequenc and number of word type 

(frequenc spectral) be also a power law function (1, 33). thi can be consid a 

the 1/f noise, a phenomenon wide found in both natur and social worlds. the 

frequenc of low-frequ word be subject to model through non-stationari and 

non-ergod stochast process (34-35). such extra constraint cognit 



13 / 18 



correspond to extra mental effort to activ or process these words. thi effort- 

demand process be typic of type-2 process. 

In fact, numer psycholog studi have evinc that word frequenc bear 

close on nearli all psychological/cognit process relat to words, includ 

intellig (36-37), recogniz (38), pronunci (39), memori retent (40), 

name time, and semant categor time (41), which be call word frequenc 

effect. that is, the process of high-frequ word call for less 

cognitive/psycholog cost than low-frequ word (42-43). these find be 

consist with the find of thi studi that high-frequ word and low- 

frequenc word have veri differ dynam properties. the probabl reason be that 

languag system may reli heavili on the former for effici type-1 process, and at 

the same time, limit the growth rate of the latter to moder regul type-2 

process. 

govern by the principl of least effort, human cognit should mold languag in 

such way that type-1 process can be fulli utilized. the organ and 

comprehens of sentenc depend heavili on syntact mean such a function 

words, which may play key role in trigger type-1 process so a to automat 

syntact organ and parsing. cognitively, the access of function words, thank 

to their high frequency, be larg effortless and automatic. As a result, function word 

may contribut to automat and quick syntact parsing. more sentenc mean more 

function words, and henc their rel frequenc in one languag should be stabl 

regardless of genr and sampl sizes. however, differ syntact mean (unction 

words, inflection, and word order) may weigh differ in typolog differ 

languages, which mean the overal frequenc of function word may bear on 

typology. 

nevertheless, sentenc comprehens be more than syntact parsing—it ultim 

aim to build semant representations. cognitively, the basic categori play vital and 

fundament role in our knowledg of world and semant representation, frequent 

used, and cognit easi to access. that is, these word may also be subject to 

type-1 process. In brief, their frequenc should steadili grow in proport to the 

increas of sampl sizes. however, sinc differ genr may rely, to differ 

degrees, on basic categories, the frequenc of these word be subject to influenc of 

differ genres. 



14 / 18

ineffici to constantli store these word in mind a independ units—it would be 

more econom to provision assembl a low-frequ word when needed, an

In brief, it be type-1 process that shape the upper and the middl segment of zipf’ 

curve, and type-2 process, the low segment. If human be share similar 

cognit mechanism, such a dual-process model, and if human languag be larg 

driven by cognition, it may be predict that the 3-segment structur should be found 

in variou languages, which be what have be found in our work on 50 languages. 



conclus 



through the first large-scal cross-languag investigation, our work have found that 

zipf’ law in 50 languag all share a 3-segment structur pattern, with the low 

segment invari bend downward to deviat from theoret expectation, and 

each segment demonstr distinct linguist properti and differ bia in 

use. further comput simul suggest the fundament cognit mechan of 

dual-process a a deep level motiv for the 3-segment structure. that is, zipf’ 

law found in natur languag be probabl the result of the gener constraint of 

human cognition. these find suggest that zipf’ law found in human-rel 

field be like to be human driven, have deep-level motiv such a gener 

cognit mechanisms, and that big-data analysi into languag may provid valuabl 

mean to uncov languag regular and to trace cognit law hidden behind 

them.
