the heat engine, a machin that extract use work from thermal sources, be one of the 

basic theoret construct and fundament applic of classic thermodynamics. the 

classic descript of a heat engin do not includ coher in it microscop degre of 

freedom. By contrast, a quantum heat engin might poss coher between it intern 

states. although the carnot effici cannot be surpassed1–3, and coher can be per- 

formanc degrad in certain conditions4–9, it be recent predict that even when use 

onli thermal resources, intern coher can enabl a quantum heat engin to produc 

more power than ani classic heat engin use the same resources10,11. such a power boost 

therefor constitut a quantum thermodynam signature. It have also be show that the 

presenc of coher result in the thermodynam equival of differ quantum heat 

engin types10,12, an effect with no classic counterpart. microscop heat machin have 

be recent implement with trap ions13,14, and propos for heat machin use 

superconduct circuits15,16 and optomechanics17,18 have be made. when oper with 

standard thermal baths, however, the machin implement so far have not demonstr 

ani inher quantum featur in their thermodynam quantities. here we implement two 

type of quantum heat engin by use of an ensembl of nitrogen-vac centr in diamond, 

and experiment demonstr both the coher power boost and the equival of dif- 

ferent heat-engin types. thi constitut the first observ of quantum thermodynam 

signatur in heat machines.

A quantum heat engin consist of a microscop system, or an ensembl of such systems, 

whose intern state can be a coher superposit of energi states. the engin cycl consist 

of a sequenc of oper (strokes), which includ the interact of the system (or part thereof) 

either with a thermal bath (cold or hot), or with an extern classical/semi-class field respon- 

sibl for work extraction. interact with the thermal bath act to chang the popul of the 

energi state of the heat engin incoherently, in contrast to the field, which chang the popula- 

tion coherently. fig. 1 schemat present three basic quantum heat-engin types: continuous, 

two-strok and four-stroke, which differ by the order of the differ strokes. Of these types, 

the four-strok engin bear the strong resembl to macroscop classic engin such a 

the otto engine. It can be describ (classically) by a two level system undergo a four part 

cycle, illustr in the top panel of fig. 1a, consist of altern coupl to the hot and cold 

baths, interspers with coupl to the work reservoir, whose effect be to chang the space 

between the levels. It can be show that thi dynam be equival to classic swap oper 

in a multilevel system10 (multilevel embedding), a show in the middl panel of fig. 1a (take 

U = swap). In a quantum heat engine, the oper U can be ani unitari transformation, allow 

for the gener of coher between the two low level dure the applic of the exter- 

nal field. It be coher gener in thi manner that enabl quantum heat engin to exhibit 

non-class behaviour and so underli the result in thi paper. note that no non-therm energi 

sourc such a squeez baths19–21, or extern inject coherence22–24 be required. A gener 

four-strok cycl be schemat illustr in the bottom panel of fig. 1a. one can simplifi the 

cycl structur of the engin by combin the distinct hot and cold stroke into a singl thermal 

stroke, obtain a two-strok engin (fig. 1b). reduc the complex of the engin oper 

even further, one obtain the continu engine, implement by simpli coupl the system to 

both thermal bath and the extern field continu (fig. 1c).

cal case of the top panel. bottom: schemat description. the gray rectangl repres the unitari

pling rate. the area of each rectangl be the stroke action (in unit of ~). b, the two-strok engine. 

top: three-level embedding. bottom: schemat description. c, schemat descript of the con- 

tinuou engine. all the three exampl present here have the same coher and thermal action 

per cycle. In thi work we experiment implement the continu and two-strok engines. 

the coherence-rel improv in work and power output of a quantum heat engine, con- 

stitut a quantum thermal signatur (qts), can be understood a follows: when the coher 

produc by the field dure the work stroke be not complet eras dure the thermal stroke, the 

work output, proport to the popul chang dure the work stroke, would be proport 

to cτw, where C be the surviv coher and τw be the durat of the work stroke. In con- 

trast, for a fulli stochast engine, where no coher surviv the thermal stroke, the popul 

4 



chang be onli due to the coher produc within the same work stroke, and the work output 

be therefor quadrat in τw. for a fix duti cycl d = τw/τcyc, where τcyc be the cycl time, the 

averag power of a stochast engin be therefor linear in τcyc, while that of a quantum engin be 

constant. thus, for τcyc → 0, the power of a stochast engin vanishes, while that of a quantum 

engin do not. note that thi picture10 hold onli when the engin action be significantli less 

than ~. the action of a period quantum heat engin be formal defin a the oper norm of 

the gener of motion integr over the cycle10. for a two-strok quantum heat engin (see 

fig. 1b) the action be simpli give by s = ~ [ωd+ γth (1− d)] τcyc, where Ω be the rabi frequency, 

proport to the amplitud of the extern field, and γth be the total coupl rate to the heat bath 

(includ both popul transfer and pure dephasing). thus, for the action to be small enough, 

both Ω and γth should be much low than the repetit rate of the engine. 

In thi small-act regim we also observ the predict quantum heat machin equival 

(qhme)10: the three basic quantum heat engin type (four-stroke, two-strok and continuous) all 

show the same perform per cycle. thi effect take place sinc in time-symmetr cycles, the 

stroke commut up to second order in the action. therefore, for small actions, the order of the 

stroke do not matter. 

the system we use in order to experiment demonstr qt and qhme be an ensembl of 

neg charg nitrogen vacanc (nv−) centr in diamond25. the nv− centr be an atomic- 

like system that exhibit sever featur desir for thi purpose. first, it ground state contain 

three spin states, | − 1〉, |0〉, and | + 1〉, that maintain coher even at room temperature, and 

can coher interact with a microwav (mw) field, that can serv a the work reservoir. sec- 

ond, after optic excitation, the system decay back into the ground-stat manifold both by direct, 

spin-preserving, optic de-excit (fluorescence), and by spin-depend non-radi chan- 

nels, through a meta-st spin-singlet state |0′〉. the system therefor tend to a steadi state with 

a popul differ between the differ spin compon of the ground state. the dynam- 

ic of thi process be equival to that produc by heat bath coupl [see the supplementari 

inform (si)]. finally, the fluoresc decay channel provid a direct mean to measur the 

popul within the ground-stat manifold. As spin be preserv dure the optic excitation, 

but the non-radi decay be spin-dependent, the fluoresc intens be also spin dependent. 

the power output of the engine, relat to the chang in popul within the ground-stat mani- 

5 



fold, can thu be deduc from the chang in fluoresc intens upon introduct of the MW 

field. thi technique, know a optic detect magnet resonance25, provid a signific 

advantag over direct measur of microwav amplification, especi when work in the 

small action regime.

upward arrows) and inter-system cross (orang downward arrows) transfer popul from the 

| ± 1〉 state to the |0〉 state through the upper |0′〉 state. the width of the arrow repres the 

transit rates. b, steadi state popul emul the equilibrium popul due to coupl

MW radiation, can be extract by resonantli drive of the |+ 1〉 ↔ |0〉 transition. note that the 

| − 1〉 state do not contribut to the work extraction. 

the specif experiment scheme we use be present in fig. 2. under an axial magnet field 

of 0.2 T, the state | + 1〉 be lower below the state |0〉 by the zeeman interaction, a show in 

fig. 2a. It be possibl to excit the |+ 1〉 ↔ |0〉 transit with a MW field without excit the 

| − 1〉 ↔ |0〉 transition, due to the differ in their reson frequencies. As show in fig. 2b, 

optic excit and subsequ non-radi decay through |0′〉 result in popul invers 

between |+ 1〉 and |0〉. thi enabl the extract of work, in the form of stimul emiss 

of MW radiation, upon reson MW drive of the |+ 1〉 ↔ |0〉 transit (fig. 2c). indeed, thi 

specif system have be recent consid for the product of a chip-scale, room-temperatur

reservoir, result from reson MW driving, can either be interlac or both be on continuously,

fig. 3: quantum heat machin equival (qhme) of two-strok and continu engin 

types. the data point present the power output of the two-strok engin a a function of the 

action per cycl (vari by chang the cycl time), for a varieti of peak rabi frequencies. the 

continu output power (togeth with their uncertainty) be indic by the shade regions. 

the theori predict for the continu (two-stroke) engin be give by the dot (solid) line. 

It can be see that, for each rabi frequency, the output of the two-strok engin have the continu 

engin output a it zero action asymptote. 

It can be show (see si), that the averag output power of the engin (per nv− centre) be 

proport to the rel averag chang in the fluoresc intens upon MW driving, 〈P 〉 = 

κ(γ)~ω10 〈∆f 〉〈f0〉 , where 〈∆f 〉 be the mw-induc chang in the averag fluoresc intensity, 〈f0〉 

be the averag fluoresc intens in the absenc of MW driving, ~ω10 be the energi of a MW 

photon emit in the transit between the two low ground states, and κ(γ) be a rate which, 

for a fix duty-cycle, depend onli on the optic excit rate, Γ. In fig. 3, the power output 

of the heat engine, work in two-strok mode, be present a a function of the engin action 

per cycle, vari by chang the cycl time, for a thermal bath coupl rate of γth = 0.41 ± 

0.02 mhz and sever valu of the peak rabi frequenc (symbols). the duti cycl be fix 

at d = 1/3. In addition, fig. 3 show the output of the continu engin (shade area with 

width signifi the measur error. see si), with the same mean rabi frequenc and optic 

7 



pump rate a for the two-strok engine. the converg in perform constitut the first 

experiment verif of qhme. the theoret predict for the output power of the two- 

stroke (continuous) engin be present in fig. 3 by the solid (dashed) line (see si). 

In order to measur a qt in a quantum heat engine, we first determin an upper power bound 

for a fulli stochast engine, which be equival to the quantum engin in all respect (energi 

levels, coupl rate and stroke durations), bar the presenc of coher at the end of the thermal 

stroke. sinc the power of a fulli stochast engin be constrain to lie below thi bound, ani 

measur output exceed the bound be indic of quantum effects. for the case of a two- 

stroke engine, it can be show that the stochast bound be give in the small action regim by10 

pstoch ≤ 14~ω10d 
2ω2τcyc (see si). fig. 4a present the measur power output of the two-strok 

engin vs. the action per cycl (vari by chang the cycl time), for Ω = 1.6± 0.05 mrad/s, 

γth = 0.41 ± 0.02 mhz, and d = 1/3, along with the correspond stochast bound (blue line). 

It be clearli see that for the small action appli (dash frame, enlarg in the inset), the 

bound be violat by 2.4 standard deviations, correspond to a p valu of 0.0082 (see si). thi 

constitut a clear qts. 

We also studi the work output a the coher of the system be reduced. fig. 4b present 

the work per cycl in the two-strok engine, where the work stroke durat be fix at 10 ns, the 

rabi frequenc be fix at 1.6 mrad/s, and the thermal stroke contain a fix population-transf 

action, but be of variabl duration. the total action per cycl exclud pure dephas be fix at 

0.05~. thus, by chang the length of the work stroke, onli the pure-dephas relat action 

be increased, due mostli to inhomogen dephas (T ∗2 ∼ 75 ns), enabl the examin of 

the depend of the output work on the coher of the system. the inset in fig. 4b show 

scheme of thi cycl for short and long thermal strokes. It be clearli see that the output work per 

cycl decreas a the thermal stroke durat be increased, and drop below the stochast bound 

(blue line). the bound, take into account experiment imperfections, increas slightli at long 

thermal strokes. the slight discrep between theori and measur for long thermal stroke 

might be attribut either to homogen dephas or to charg effects, both neglect in the 

present theori (see si). these measur clearli demonstr that coher in microscop 

heat engin can be perform enhancing.

In conclusion, we have use an ensembl of nv− centr in diamond for implement differ 

type of quantum heat engines. We have use these to demonstr the equival of the power 

output of two differ engin types, continu and two-stroke, for small actions. additionally, 

we have show that, for veri small actions, the engin produc more power than their classic 

counterparts, significantli exceed the stochast power bound. these measur constitut 

the first observ of quantum thermodynam effect in heat machines. We hope that thi work 

will motiv further research along at least three lines: 1) demonstr of quantum effect in 

other physic realis of heat machin such a superconduct circuits15,16 and ion traps13,14. 

2) theoret search of quantum thermal signatur in heat machin base on other quantum 

agent such a entanglement28 and quantum discord. 3) applic to the design and develop 

of novel devic such a room-temperatur masers26,27. We further hope that thi work will be of 

interest to other research area concern with the role of quantum coher in the enhanc 

of work extract by microscop heat engines, such a the studi of photosynthesis29 and the 

develop of solar cells.

A type Ib high-pressure-high-temperatur 3×3×0.5 mm, (100) diamond slab (element-six) 

with an initi nitrogen concentr of ∼200 ppm be electron irradi (1018 cm−2) and then 

anneal (950◦c, 2.5 hours), to form a dens (∼1018 cm−3) ensembl of nv− centres. the ori-

microwav (mw) drive be reson onli with the centr orient parallel to the magnet field, 

and thu onli these centr (∼25% of all centres) produc the work. 

s2. the experiment setup 

the experiment system be schemat present in fig. s1(a). the diamond sampl be 

place between two perman magnet align along the [111] direction. A solid-st continuous- 

wave laser at 532 nm be focu insid the diamond sampl to a spot of (nominally) 2.2 µm 

in diamet by a long-working-dist object len (na=0.29). An acousto-opt modul 

(aom) be use for the intens modul of the laser-light reach the sample. In addition, an 

AC magnet field be appli to the sampl by a broad-band MW strip-lin waveguid emb 

in the sampl holder. just below the sample, the strip-lin be narrow down to a width of 

300 µm, in order for the appli field to be both strong enough and uniform across the activ 

volume. A photograph of the sampl on the MW waveguid be present in fig. s1(b). A fast 

MW switch (ms) between the MW gener and the MW amplifi be use for the amplitud 

modul of the appli mws. the MS and the aom have switch time of 1.5 n and 12 ns, 

respectively, and be both simultan driven at ∼mhz rate by a fast function generator.

To effici detect the chang in fluoresc due to the oper of the engine, that is, due to 

the MW driving, lock-in detect be used, where the output of the MW gener be amplitude- 

modul by a ∼100 Hz squar wave, much slow than the repetit rate of the engine, and a 

13 



lock-in amplifi be lock to thi slow modulation. 

s3. spectroscopi and calibr 

first, the distanc between the magnets, a well a their mean posit with respect to the 

sampl be adjusted, such that the reson frequenc be 2π · 2600 mhz. dure thi process, 

we observ an anti-cross between |0〉 and |−1〉. the angl of the magnet field be adjust 

to minimis the gap at the anti-cross point, from which we be abl to infer the field angl 

rel to the NV axis. In our case, the angl be determin to be 0.6◦. the transit be found 

to be inhomogen broaden with minim full-width at half maximum of 2π · (7± 0.7) 

mhz, determin by a gaussian fit. thi impli a maxim ensembl coher time (1/e) of 

75 ± 7.5 ns. thi be also confirm by directli measur the decoher time use ramsay 

interferometry, which yield a similar result. then, by measur the chang in fluoresc a a 

function of the MW puls length, the rabi-frequ be measur for differ MW intensities. 

It be found that the ratio between the rabi frequenc and the squar root of the appli MW 

power (after the amplifier) be 2π · (244± 2) khz/ 
√ 

mw. the maximum MW power avail 

after the amplifi be 3000 mw. 

To determin the depend of the optic excit rate, Γ, on the laser power in our set-up, 

we scan the laser power whilst measur the total fluorescence. As can be see in fig. s2, one 

obtain a curv which be linear for small laser powers, but then deviat from linear dependence. 

We use a rate equat model (see sec. S4 below) to fit to the data use the ratio between the laser 

power and Γ a a fit paramet (togeth with the overal coeffici for the fluorescence). all 

the other paramet be know from previous, independ measurements30. the obtain ratio 

between Γ and the laser power measur befor the object len be r = 436±25 khz/mw. note 

that thi number depend on the posit in the sampl of the focu of the beam, most probabl 

due to absorpt in the sample. the maximum optic power avail (a measur befor the 

object lens) be 4.0 mw. one can compar thi result with a simpl calcul use the know 

absorpt cross-sect of an nv− centr at 532 nm (ς = (3.1±0.8)×10−17 cm231), r = ς/(aεl), 

where A be the laser spot area and εL be the energi of one laser photon. when take into account 

the measur transmiss of the object len (81%), the fresnel transmiss of the diamond 

14 



surfac (83%), and absorpt due to propag to the middl of the sampl through a dens 

ensembl of 1018 cm−3 nv− center (45% transmission), one find that the focal spot diamet 

that yield the measur valu of r be 2.7 ± 0.4 µm, in good agreement with the nomin valu 

of 2.2 µm predict for a perfect 0.29 NA object lens. the small discrep might be due 

to deviat of the exact posit of the focal spot or the exact nv− densiti from the estim 

valu use above, or due to aberrations. 

fig. s2: measur (symbols) and fit (red line) fluoresc satur curves. use the rate 

equat model describ in sec. s4, the ratio between the optic excit rate, Γ, on the light 

intensity, ilaser, be determined. the green line be the tangent at zero laser intensity, show that 

the satur curv significantli deviat from linear behaviour. 

s4. rate equat model 

the spin-state-depend fluoresc intens exhibit by nv− centres25 be a part of our 

initi motiv for use nv− centr to implement a quantum heat engine. In thi section we 

show how thi property, quantifi use a rate equat model, allow u to take all the measure- 

ment requir for the experiment. 

the fluoresc spectrum for the optic excit intens use in thi experi con- 

tain less than 1% neutral NV (nv0) emission. furthermore, the charg rate for these excita- 

tion intens be expect to be on the order of ∼ 1µs32, longer than all the other characterist 

time in the system (see below). We therefor neglect optic charg effect (transit from 

15 



nv− to nv0 and back), and focu on the dynam within the nv− states. 

the nv− centr consist of a ground state spin triplet, denot by 3a2, two excit spin triplets, 
3e, a well a three intermedi singlets, 1e1,2 and 1a. Of the variou interact that lift the 

degeneraci of the sub-level in the ground and excit states, orbit averag at room temperatur 

result in onli the axial spin-spin interact remaining33; thi allow u to treat the two excit 

state triplet a a singl triplet. additionally, the upper of the three singlets, 1a1, decay directli 

into the low pair, 1e, and have so short a lifetim (< 1 ns) a to allow u to treat the three singlet 

a an effect singl state . A diagram of thi structure, togeth with the allow transit be 

show in fig. s3.

s5. emul OF A thermal action 

We now show that the optic cycl in the nv− centr do inde emul a thermal interaction. 

the intuit idea be that the optic cycl transfer popul from |±1〉 to |0〉 in the ground state 

manifold. We will formalis thi and show precis how to obtain the emul action. the 

goal be to find a project operator, P , on the set of popul vectors, togeth with a reduc 

evolut oper L, which satisfi the requir for a thermal evolut operator, such that 

the follow condit be satisfied: 

elt (pσ) = P 
( 
emtσ 

) 
(s2) 

thi condit be a statement that the thermal oper L should describ the time evolut of 

the reduc state, when the evolut of the whole system be gener by the optic matrix M . 

the approach we take be to treat our system a an effect 4 level system, consist of the ground 

state togeth with the singlet, σred = [ g0 , g1 , g−1 , s ], which be describ by the projection, 

P =

thi be a justifi choic if we can find the oper L which satisfi the requir for a 

thermal oper (lij ≥ 0 for i 6= j, lij ≤ 0 for i = j, and lij ≤ lji for i > j ) and eq. S2 to a 

good approximation. thi will be do through an eigen-analysi of the matrix M. use eq. s1, 

it can be show that M be give by,

where V be a diagon matrix with the element of v on it diagonal. 

find the eigenvector of M a a function of Γ be not feasibl analytically, so instead we use 

perturb theory. ordinarili one might wish to expand about Γ = 0, however, thi bring about 

the difficulti of deal with the degeneraci in the ground state, which be not lift by the first order

We can split these eigenvector (and their eigenvalues) into two group a follows: the first four 

eigenvector be those which describ the chang in the 3 ground state and the singlet and for 

which the compon correspond to the excit state be at least an order of magnitud small 

than the other components; the other three eigenvector have larg compon correspond to 

the excit state triplets. thi partit also split the eigenvalu accord to their magnitude, 

with the last three at least an order of magnitud great than the first four. note too that, if we 

restrict our attent to the ground state triplet togeth with the singlet, then the first four form 

a linearli independ set span these states. therefore, if the system have littl popul in 

it excit states, the coeffici of the final three eigenvector will be correspondingli small and 

we can write such a state in term of the first set of eigenvector to a good approximation. By 

consid the first and second order perturb corrections, it can be show that thi be true for 

all Γ use in the experi (|∆γ| ≤ 0.5 mhz, where ∆Γ ≡ Γ− 0.5 mhz). We now return to the 

problem of find L. consid eq. S2 – note that thi condit hold if the follow holds: 

[lp − PM ]σ = 0 

It be clearli not possibl to find a L which satisfi thi for all possibl state σ; howev give 

that the first four eigenst span the possibl state of our system to a good approximation, 

21 



we instead requir that it hold on the subspac span by these states. We therefor requir 

[lp − PM ]σi = 0 and so [l− λii] (pσi) = 0 for i = 1, 2, 3, 4, where σi (λi) be the ith eigenvec- 

tor (eigenvalue) of M . So we see that the condit can be satisfi exactli if we requir that L 

would have eigenvector {pσi | i = 1, 2, 3, 4}with correspond eigenvalu {λi | i = 1, 2, 3, 4}. 

sinc there be four eigenvector/eigenvalu pairs, thi complet determin L. perform the

the oper L gener in thi way be veri close to be popul conserv for small Γ, 

but not exactli so, sinc some popul can be transfer to the excit state manifold. thu we 

simpli calcul L a above, and then manual impos popul conservation, modifi it by 

the minim amount requir to obtain the thermal evolut L that we seek. 

We now consid what thermal reservoir and coupl thi matrix correspond to. first notic 

that all the coupl be between the ground state and the singlet, with no coupl between 

state within the ground state triplet. also, becaus the energi differ between the ground state 

manifold and the singlet be much great than the differ within the ground state manifold, we 

can treat the effect temperatur and coupl between the |±1〉 state and the singlet a be the 

same. further, by examin the ratio of the rates, we see that the effect temperatur between 

the singlet and |0〉 be less than that between the singlet and |±1〉. So we be left with the pictur in

where ν = (−1 1 0 · · · 0 0)t . the rate R be the quantiti we wish to determin from the experimen- 

talli measur fluorescence. We proceed by consid how the inhomogen solut differ 

from the homogen solut (physic the differ between MW drive and no driving). 

let φ(t) be the fundament matrix solut to the homogen version of eq. S3 (that is, a 

matrix which satisfi (∂t −m)φ = 0). then it can be check that the follow be a solut to

the same period, τcyc, a that of m(t), a the microwav be puls at the same rate a the laser 

pulses. thi follow quit gener from floquet theori and physic considerations. To proceed 

we need to find the state at the start of the cycle, σ0 , dure thi steadi state operation. use the

We would like to solv for σ0, howev the matrix on the left hand side be singular. note that 

φ(τcyc) be diagonalis [it have an inverse: φ(−τcyc)], which allow u to write (i− φ(τcyc)) = 

udu−1, where D be diagonal. We defin the pseudo-inverse, (i− φ(τcyc))− = ud−u † , where

s9. uncertainti analysi 

In examin express S7 it be appar that there be a number of contribut to the uncer- 

tainti in the final valu of the power, 〈P 〉. there be measur variat in the valu 〈∆f 〉 from 

one measur to the next, due to detector shot noise. the mean and standard error be simpli 

calcul from a sampl of individu measurements. the valu for κ depend on the paramet 

list in tabl s1, togeth with the valu calcul for Γ, which itself depend on the former 

parameters. We use a monte-carlo simul to propag the uncertainti in these parameters, 

and the calcul uncertainti for Γ, to a final uncertainti in κ. the error in the valu for 〈f0〉 

be determin to be neglig (rel error < 1%) rel to the other error and therefor 

disregarded. final we also need to account for uncertainti in the valu for the bound. thi stem 

princip from the uncertainti in the valu for the rabi frequency. 

the quantiti of interest be the certainti with which we can demonstr pmeasured−pbound > 0. 

thi requir that we use a one side normal distribution. the null hypothesi be pmeasur − 

pbound ≤ 0, whilst the altern hypothesi be that the measur power break the stochast 

bound. In our case the test statist for the null outcom be t = 2.4, which correspond to a p- 

valu of 0.0082. thu we can discard our null hypothesi and adopt the altern hypothesis, to 

a signific of < 1%.
