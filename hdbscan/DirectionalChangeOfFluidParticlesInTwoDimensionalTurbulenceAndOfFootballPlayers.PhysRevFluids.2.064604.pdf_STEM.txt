multiscal direct statist be investig in two-dimension incompress 
turbulence. It be show that the short-tim behavior of the mean angl of direct chang 
of fluid particl be linearli depend on the time lag and that no inerti rang behavior 
be observ in the direct chang associ with the enstrophy-cascad range. In 
simul of the inverse-cascad range, the direct chang show a power law behavior 
at inerti rang time scales. By compar the direct chang in space-period and 
wall-bound flow, it be show that the probabl densiti function of the direct chang 
at long time carri the signatur of the confinement. the geometr origin of thi effect 
be valid by mont carlo simulations. the same effect be also observ in the direct 
statist comput from the trajectori of footbal player (soccer player in american 
english).

I. introduct 

In the absenc of a success theori deriv from the navier-stok equations, the understand 
of turbul be base on phenomenolog and statist characterization. one of the most univers 
featur of turbul be perhap it energi distribut among scales, which in a wide varieti of 
flow be well approxim by kolmogorov’ descript of local isotrop turbul [1,2]. A 
complementari descript of turbul flow be it geometr characterization. In the eulerian 
frame, such a descript could involv the statist of vortic patch and filaments, or region 
of signific strain. In the lagrangian frame, i.e., follow fluid particles, an obviou geometr 
character would involv the tortuos or curvatur of the turbul trajectories. indeed, it be 
the spiral motion of the fluid particl that character the turbul natur of the flow in the 
lagrangian setting. 

the curvatur in turbul flow be studi in refer [3–8]. the extens to a time scale– 
depend curvature-rel statist measur be onli recent propos in ref. [9], and we use 
thi measur to character the direct chang of trajectori in isotrop three-dimension (3d) 
turbul [10]. It be show that three distinct regim could be observ in the direct change: 
first, there be a ballist regim in which the particl chang it direct a expect in a spatial or 
tempor smooth flow. then, for larg time lag we show the exist of an inertial, self-similar 
regim where the link could be make with kolmogorov’ inerti rang phenomenology. finally, 
for time scale larg than the lagrangian correl time, an uncorrel regim be observed, 
in which the angl character the direct chang be randomli distributed. one singl type 
of turbul be considered, the academ case of space-period isotrop 3D incompress 
turbulence. 

the present work can be see a a logic continu of the investig report in ref. [10]. 
We will address two addit questions. first, how do the statist chang if we be in two 
space dimensions? indeed, the flow structur and lagrangian correl be differ in the two- 
dimension (2d) case, and we expect the direct chang to reflect thi difference. second, what 
be the influenc of the finit size of the domain on the statistics? thi be an import question, sinc in 
a wide rang of practic flows, solid boundari modifi the properti of the turbulence. To address

these question we consid statist stationari incompress turbul in two dimensions. 
We will consid two differ geometries: a spatial period case, i.e., an unbound domain, 
and a wall-bound circular domain. use mont carlo simul we will in particular show 
which featur of the statist be flow-depend and which be due to geometr constraints. 
the statist featur which be geometry-depend but flow-independ should be observ in 
other physic systems. We have therefor also consid the trajectori of footbal player (soccer 
player in american english) and show that thi system have a certain number of featur in common 
with the turbul motion of fluid particles. 

after a descript of the setup in the next section, we will discu the result on large-scal 
forc turbulence, small-scal forc turbulence, and football-play trajectori in secs. iii, iv, 
and V, respectively. 

ii. definit and setup OF the simul 

A. preliminari analysi and definit 

the direct chang of a fluid particl be character by consid the angl between 
two subsequ posit increment on a lagrangian trajectory, defin by x(x0,t), where x0 = 
x(x0,t = t0) be the initi position. the posit increment be defin by 

δx(x0,t,τ ) = x(x0,t) − x(x0,t − τ ), (1) 
and the cosin of the angl character the direct chang be 

cos(�(t,τ )) = δx(x0,t,τ ) · δx(x0,t + τ,τ )|δx(x0,t,τ )||δx(x0,t + τ,τ )| . (2) 

As in our recent investig [10], the main quantiti we will analyz be the averag modulu of 
the angle, 

θ (τ ) ≡ 〈|�(t,τ )|〉, (3) 
and the probabl distribut function of �(t,τ ). sinc we consid statist stationari 
turbul flow, we perform ensembl and time averaging, denot by 〈·〉. It be show by a 
second-ord taylor-expans of the posit vector that at short time the angl θ (τ ) could be 
estim by the relat 

θ (τ ) ≈ 2τ 〈a⊥(t)/u(t)〉, (4) 
where u(t) be the norm of the lagrangian veloc and a⊥(t) the norm of the acceler perpendicular 
to the trajectory. irrespect of the type of flow, it be thu expect that at short time the direct 
chang θ , be linearli proport to τ . physic thi correspond to the rang in which the flow can 
be consid smooth. the smooth of the trajectori in turbul flow which allow such an 
expans have be show in ref. [11]. In 2D turbulence, the veloc scale in the forward-enstrophi 
cascad rang can be consid smooth, sinc the energi distribut fall off with a power law 
k−α , with α � 3. what thi impli for the lagrangian statist and in particular whether an inerti 
rang scale be expect for θ (τ ) at intermedi valu of τ be not clear from the outset. 

In the scale rang associ to the backward cascad of energi of 2D turbulence, the energi 
spectrum approxim display the same k−5/3 power law a for 3D turbul in the inerti range. 
It be anticip that the result observ in ref. [10] will also be valid for thi case. We will address 
thi subject in sec. iv. 

B. setup 

the flow databas we analyz be describ in ref. [12]. the flow be statist stationary, 
forc 2D turbul with a reynold number, base on the domain size and the rm veloc 
fluctuations, of the order of 104. A forc term be add to the navier-stok equations, act in

e/ν. for the period geometri we have Rλ = 751 and for the circular 

geometri Rλ = 633. two type of physic domain be considered: a squar double-period 
domain and a circular domain with no-slip boundari conditions. numerically, all comput be 
carri out on a double-period domain use a standard pseudospectr solver. In the nonperiod 
case the circular boundari be impos by a volum penal method [13,14]. the penal 
techniqu introduc a numer paramet η which be chosen proport to �x2 (with �x the 
grid size), to minim the error [15]. therebi the model error of the no-slip condit be of 
the same order a the discret error. the quantit influenc of thi error on the statist 
be in the present case negligible. all statist be comput in a statist stationari state, where 
104 fluid particl be track for about 103 eddy-turnov times. the sensit to the number of 
particl be assess and the error between the statist obtain in the period domain, use either 
5×103 or 104 particles, be less than 1% for all time lags. the paramet of the simul be give 
in tabl I. for further detail on the method and the paramet we refer to ref. [12]. 

In addit to these simulations, we also consid a 2D flow forc at small scales, which allow 
for the develop of an invers cascad of energy. the flow be similar to the one describ in 
ref. [16]. the domain be again a squar period box discret by 10242 gridpoints. the forc 
be a narrow band random energi input at k = 210. At the larg scales, energi be evacu by a 
rayleigh friction term, −αψ on the right-hand side of the navier-stok equations, with ψ the 
stream function and α the friction constant. At larg wave number the flow be damp by a fourth 
order hyperviscos (in the viscou term, the laplacian � be replac by �4). the paramet of 
thi simul be summar in tabl ii. 

To illustr the univers of geometr confin on the statistics, we also consid a differ 
physic system: football. the football-play statist consid in sec. V correspond to a train 
match of two footbal team of eight player each. the data use be collect by the real-tim 
locat system deploy on a footbal field of the nuremberg stadium in germany. data origin 
from sensors, sampl with 200 Hz frequency, locat near the players’ shoe one sensor per leg). 
consid the small reaction time of a human to be of the order of 0.1 s, thi frequenc be larg 
suffici to captur the small relev time scale of the movement of the players. however, at 
such small time lag the angl which we calcul be most certainli influenc by the measur 
error in the posit of the footbal players. In particular, when the footbal player be nearli at rest, 
the angl �(τ,t) be hard to determine, and such event be more frequent for footbal player (free 
kicks, penalties, etc.) than in incompress turbulence, where due to incompress particl be 
rare immobil for long time intervals. for the small time lags, the result be therefor expect 
to be less accurate. the posit of the player be monitor dure the full durat of the game.

iii. direct statist IN 2D turbul forc AT the larg scale 

A. averag absolut angl 

In fig. 1 the mean absolut angl θ (τ ) be show a a function of the time lag for 2D turbulence. 
the time τ be normal by the kolmogorov time scale τK , defin a τK = (2z)−1/2, where Z 
be the enstrophy. We find that at short time the evolut be approxim linear in τ , which be 
expect when τ becom small than all physic time scale of the flow, and express (4) be 
valid. At larg time an asymptot valu be reached. In the case of a period domain thi valu 
be π/2, a expect for the angl between three random point in an infinit domain. for confin 
flow thi asymptot valu be larger, approxim equal to 2π/3. the effect be geometr a we will 
demonstr in the following. It be further observed, if we compar with our previou studi [10], in 
three dimensions, that no power law be present for intermedi times. indeed, in three dimens 
we have θ (τ ) ∼ τ 1/2 for intermedi time lags, and the expon can be relat to kolmogorov 
scale of the pressur gradient spectrum. In the present flow, where the turbul be stir at larg 
scales, no kolmogorov scale be observed. see, for instance, the spectrum in fig. 4(b) of ref. [16],

where we use a similar numer methodolog to gener a 2D turbul flow. It be observ 
there that a power law scale approxim proport to k−3 be present in the spectrum. indeed, 
the forward-enstrophi rang do not show the same scale a kolmogorov’ spectrum in three 
dimensions. We will show that these result will chang in 2D flow in the invers cascad range, 
where kolmogorov scale be observ in general. there we expect to obtain result similar to those 
present in ref. [10]. 

B. probabl densiti function 

In fig. 2 the probabl densiti function (pdfs) of the instantan direct chang �(τ,t) 
be shown. In the follow all pdf be estim by histogram with 100 equidist bins. It be 
observ that, start from a peak distribut around � = 0 for short times, the pdf chang 
shape, to gradual approach the long-tim asymptot shape of the distribution. for the pdf of the 
angl thi shape be an equidistribution, sinc all angl be equal probabl for three decorrelated, 
random point in an infinit larg 2D domain. In three dimensions, it be not the angle, but it 
cosin that tend to an equidistribut for long time [10]. the reason for thi be that in three space 
dimens we have for the measur of surfac integr in spheric coordin cos(θ )dθ , which 
becom dθ in two space dimensions. 

follow the reason in ref. [10], we can tri to fit these pdf by a know distribution, by 
assum both the veloc and the acceler to be near gaussian and independent. If thi be 
so, their squar be χ2-distribut and the ratio of two χ2-distribut quantiti follow a fischer 
distribution. for small valu of �, the cosin of the direct chang can be approxim by 
cos(�) ≈ 1 − �2/2, so that the pdf of 1 − cos(�) should, under these assumpt and when 
properli normalized, obey an f-distribution. As show in fig. 3, the shape of the pdf can inde 
be reason well approxim by an f1,2 fischer distribution. the paramet 1,2 correspond to 
the dimens of the perpendicular acceler and local velocity, respectively. indeed, in a 2D 
veloc field the acceler perpendicular to a trajectori be a one-dimension (1d) quantity. the 
collaps be not perfect, and thi be not expect either, sinc the deriv of the shape of the pdf 
lead to the f-distribut assum gaussian of both the veloc and the acceleration, which 
be onli partial true in general. apparently, the fischer-distribut reason well describ the 
distribut of the ratio of two random variables, even when these random variabl be not precis 
gaussian distributed. the pdf for the circularli confin case be similar, except for the long-tim 
asymptot shape, where no equidistribut be observed. We will now discu the influenc of 
confinement.

model. 

C. the influenc of geometr confin on the statist 

We have see in figs. 1 and 2 that the differ in the direct chang induc by solid 
boundari manifest itself onli at long times. thi be expected, sinc most of the veloc trajectori 
be at short time situat far away from the boundaries, so the statist should be determin by 
these trajectori for which the influenc of the wall be small. indeed, it be show in ref. [12], by 
position-depend measures, that the solid boundari do not strongli affect the statist in the 
consid flow away from the wall. At long time the statist be howev significantli affected, 
when compar to the period domain. In particular, the long-tim asymptot of θ (τ ) chang from 
π/2 to a valu of θ (τ ) ≈ 2. what we will show now be that thi effect be not due to the modifi 
properti of the veloc field, but due to the effect of geometr confinement, irrespect of the 
flow, a long a the lagrangian veloc correl of fluid particl decay to zero at long times. 

It can be understood that at long times, when the separ of the fluid particl on a trajectori 
becom of the order of the domain size, the angl might not be equidistributed. for instanc 
consid the sketch in fig. 4, it can easili appreci that for a give distanc between the 
first and the second of three random points, and if all posit within the circl be equiprobable, 
the chanc to have a configur I, with a larg valu of � be larg than the chanc to have a 

fig. 4. sketch illustr the effect of confin on the direct chang at long time in (a) a circular 
domain and (b) rectangular domain with a larg aspect ratio.

configur ii. larger valu of � becom thu more probabl when the distanc between the three 
posit point x(x0,t) becom compar to the domain size. 

To confirm thi idea we carri out mont carlo simul use 6×107 randomli distribut 
point in a circular domain and rectangular domain of differ aspect ratio. comput the pdf 
for the angl between two connect line segments, defin by three randomli distribut point in 
a circle, the pdf have exactli the shape of the long-tim asymptot pdf in fig. 5, with an averag 
valu θ ≈ 2, a observ in fig. 1. the function form that we have fit for thi pdf be 

p∞(�) = a + b exp{−[(1 − �/π )/c]2} (5) 
with a = 0.10, b = 0.54, c = 0.46. the chosen function form is, however, not good justifi 
than by the fact that it accur fit the data points. use the same algorithm, comput the 
angl between randomli place points, we have further determin the influenc of confin on 
angular statist for rectangular domain with differ aspect ratios. the result be also show in 
fig. 5. It be observ that the shape of the pdf chang a a function of the aspect ratio. when the 
aspect ratio becom large, a sketch in the right side of fig. 4, the problem becom close to 1d, 
and the pdf can easili be determin analytically. 

In thi 1D limit when the rectangl approach a line, the pdf should tend to the form 

P (�) = 13δ(�) + 23δ(� − π ). (6) 
thi be qualit confirm in fig. 5 for the maximum aspect ratio of 400, where two distinct 
peak of differ height be found. the mean angl correspond to the first moment of the pdf, and 
thu we get 

∫ π 
0 �P (�) d� = 2π3 . 

the pdf in the 1D limit case can be justifi theoretically. consid three random point (r1,r2,r3) 
on a line segment (of length L) have a uniform probabl distribut U . use condit 
probabl we find that the probabl that r3 > r2, give that r2 > r1, have a probabl of 1/3, 
while the probabl that r3 < r2, give that r2 > r1, have a probabl of 2/3. for the correspond 
angl we have onli two values, 0 for r3 > r2 > r1 and π for r3 < r2 > r1. thi justifi the abov 
pdf. 

for rectangl with finit aspect ratio we consid three random vector 
ri = (xi,yi) for i =1,2,3. 
each compon have a uniform probabl distribution, i.e., 
ri ∈ U (−lx/2,lx/2)×u (0,ly). 
without loss of gener we suppos Ly > Lx and we consid the y compon first. again 
we can show that we have a probabl of 1/3 for y3 > y2, give that y2 > y1 (or y3 < y2, give

to 2/3. thi impli valu for the angl in π/2 < θ < 3π/2. again by symmetri argument of the 
domain we find a mean valu of π . the mean valu of the angl for all realiz thu correspond 
to 2π/3, which be inde observ in our mont carlo simul for rectangl of aspect ratio 
rang from 1 to 400 in fig. 6(a). 

the abov argument be also valid for other confin geometri which poss a reflect 
symmetri with respect to an axis, like the circular case. furthermor these argument also hold for 
confin geometri in high dimensions, e.g., in three dimensions. these result concern the mean 
valu θ , it seem that it varianc be more complic to determin from symmetri arguments. 
however, for the infinit aspect ratio pdf (correspond to the 1D limit) [eq. (6)], it be directli 
found that the second center moment (or variance) be equal to (2/9)π2. thi asymptot valu be 
confirm in fig. 6(b) by mont carlo simulations. 

iv. angular statist IN the invers cascad rang 

We anticip in the previou section that the direct chang in the invers cascad rang 
of 2D turbul should resembl the statist of the 3D case. our reason to believ thi be that 
kolmogorov scale be in gener even good observ in such flows, and the scale of the energi 
spectrum, proport to k−5/3, be often close approached. In fig. 7(a) we show the energi 
spectrum. We observ a power law in the spectrum close to k−5/3 for the larg scales. 

the time lag depend [fig. 7(b)] of the direct chang contain a expected, a in 3D 
turbulence, two distinct power law befor the long-tim asymptot be reached. the ballist regim 
can again be associ with a linear depend on τ . for inerti rang time lag a second power 
law be inde observed. In thi range, the predict direct chang be proport to τ 1/2. 
It be observ that the expon be somewhat smaller. thi could be due to the finit of the 
reynold number. In gener lagrangian time correl be rather sensit to reynold number 
correct [18]. furthermore, thi be also consist with our previou result in 3D turbulence, 
where the scale of τ be observ to be proport to a power law of the time lag with an 
expon small than 1/2. 

the pdf of the angl a a function of τ (fig. 8) do again evolv from a peak around zero for 
short time toward an equidistribut for long times. the intermedi evolut of the pdf of 
1 − cos(�) can be captur by a fischer distribution, a in the foregoing. It do seem that the main

V. angular statist OF footbal player 

let u come back here to the influenc of confin on direct change. sinc the influenc of 
confin be pure geometr at larg time lags, it should be univers present for trajectori of 
quantiti in other physic situat than turbul flow in confin domains, a soon a time lag 
be consid long compar to the typic correl time of the move body. We have therefor 
studi a total differ system: football. more precisely, we have consid the statist of a 
train match of two team of eight footbal players. In fig. 9 we show the trajectori of four 
of these player dure a 5 min interval. for the trajectori of the 14 player (exclud the goal 
keepers) we will evalu the same statist a for the fluid particl in the forego sections, in 
order to evalu which effect be robust enough to surviv when we complet chang the physic 
system. 

We have comput the lagrangian veloc spectrum, which be show in fig. 10(a). the data 
seem valid up to a frequenc f ≈ 0.6, where the spectrum show an import chang of slope, 
which we do not have a clear interpret for. for frequenc small than f ≈ 0.6, the spectrum

show a clear power law with an expon close to −2. In the case of 2D flows, thi expon can 
be expect from kolmogorov-argu in the energy-transf inerti rang and be also observ 
in experi on 3D turbul [19]. 

We have comput the averag absolut angl a a function of the time lag, and the result be 
show in fig. 10(b). It seem that at small time the accuraci be not suffici to show a power law 
behavior correspond to a ballist regime. At such small time lag the angl be most certainli 
influenc by the measur error in the posit of the footbal players, and the lagrangian 
energi spectrum also show an unexplain increas behavior for these time lags. however, for 
larg times, the mean absolut angl show a behavior correspond to a kolmogorov-lik inerti 
range, where θ be proport to τ 1/2. If we would push the analog further, we would be tempt 
to say that the trajectori of footbal player be similar to those of fluid particl in the invers 
cascad rang of 2D turbulence, but at high enough reynold number to observ asymptot scaling. 
In thi same range, an f −2 power law for the lagrangian veloc spectrum be observ [fig. 10(a)], 
analog to the inerti rang scale of isotrop turbulence, therebi corrobor our conjectur 
that these two rang be associ with the same dynamics. 

the long-tim behavior observ in the turbul wall-bound flow be show to be remark 
robust. indeed, even though a footbal match do not seem to be ergodic, and some may argu that 
the trajectori of footbal player be not complet random, the long-tim pdf of the direct 
chang converg to a shape close to the one for fluid particles, a show in fig. 10(c). moreover, 
the mean-absolut angl for long time converg to a valu θ ≈ 2π/3, exactli a for confin 2D 
turbulence. It seem that the fact that in a footbal match the movement of the player be strongli 
anisotrop do not prevent the pdf from converg to a univers shape correspond to random 
posit in a close domain. the anisotropi might onli show up in more global statistics, such a 
the global veloc correlations, in a sens similar a the return to isotropi of the small scale in 
complex turbul flows. furthermore, again the pdf of 1 − cos(�) be close to an f1,2 distribut 
[fig. 10(d)]. 

vi. conclus 

We have investig geometr multiscal statist by analyz the direct chang of 
fluid particl in 2D turbulence, and we have put a particular emphasi on the distinct between 
flow-depend and geometry-depend features.

for the two halftim of the match; (c) pdf of the instantan angl �(τ,t); (d) normal pdfs. 

for the averag absolut angl θ (τ ), character the direct chang a a function of the 
time lag τ , it be show that in the case we considered, a short-tim regim could be identifi 
where the angl scale linearly, θ (τ ) ∼ τ . thi linear regim correspond to smooth trajectories, and 
it exist be roughli independ of the type of flow, or the confin geometry. 

for intermedi time lags, unlik 3D turbulence, no inerti rang scale be observ in a 
flow domin by forward enstrophi transfer, which be due to the fact that such flow be statist 
smooth in space. differ result be observ for the inverse-cascad range, which be show to 
behav similar to 3D turbul with respect to scaling. indeed, an inerti rang be observ 
for the mean angl of direct change, but it expon deviat from the predict base on 
kolmogorov scaling. the presenc or absenc of an inerti rang scale in the angular statist be 
thu clearli flow-dependent, at least in two space dimensions. 

A salient featur of the present studi be the investig of the effect of confinement. It be 
show that the size of the domain influenc the long-tim behavior of the direct change, 
and the precis behavior can be reproduc by consid the angl between two connect line 
segment defin by three points, randomli place in the domain. mont carlo simul allow 
to disentangl the geometr depend featur from the flow-depend features. indeed, the 
effect of confin seem independ of the flow properties, a long a the flow can be consid 
ergodic, which should be the case for time lag much larg than the lagrangian correl time. 

In all consid cases, for short time the shape of the pdf for differ time lag be reason 
well describ by a fischer distribution. At long times, the pdf be entir determin by the shape 
of the geometri and becom independ of the flow properties. even for the case of footbal

players, who are, in general, not randomli space on a field, the shape of the pdf of the direct 
chang be close to these behaviors, both at short and at long times.
