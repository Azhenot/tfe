abstract 

As a large-scal instanc of dramat collect behavior, the 2005 french riot start in a poor suburb 
of paris, then spread in all of france, last about three weeks. remarkably, although there be no 
displac of rioters, the riot activ do traveled. daili nation polic data to which we have access have 
allow u to take advantag of thi natur experi to explor the dynam of riot propagation. here 
we show that an epidemic-lik model, with less than 10 free paramet and a singl sociolog variabl 
character neighborhood deprivation, account quantit for the full spatio-tempor dynam of the 
riots. thi be the first time that such data-driven model involv contagion both within and between citi 
(through geograph proxim or media) at the scale of a countri be performed. moreover, we give a precis 
mathemat character to the express “wave of riots”, and provid a visual of the propag 
around paris, exhibit the wave in a way not describ before. the remark agreement between model 
and data demonstr that geograph proxim play a major role in the riot propagation, even though 
inform be readili avail everywher through media. finally, we argu that our approach give a 
gener framework for the model of spontan collect uprisings. 

introduct 

dure the autumn of 2005, franc experienc the 
long and most geograph extend riot of the 
contemporari histori of europe[1, 2]. without ani 
polit claim nor leadership, local be mainli 
limit to the “banlieues” (suburb of larg metropoli- 
tan cities), where minor group be larg confined. 
contrari to the london “shop riots” of 2011, ri- 
ote in franc essenti consist in car destruc- 
tion and confront with the police. the trigger- 
ing event take place in a depriv municip at the 
north-east of paris: on octob 27, 2005, two youth 
die when intrud into a power substat while 

tri to escap a polic patrol. inhabit sponta- 
neousli gather on the street with anger. the exten- 
sion in time and space of these riot – three weeks, more 
than 800 municip hit across all of franc – pro- 
duce a natur experi amen to analysi thank 
to detail polic data available[3]. the present work 
aim at analyz these data through a mathemat 
model that shed new light on qualit featur of 
the riot a instanc of collect human behavior[4, 5]. 

sever works[6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15] have 
develop mathemat approach to riot dynam- 
ics, and their sociolog implic have also be 
discussed[16]. the 1978 articl of burbeck et al. [10] pi-

the dynam of riots. veri few work follow the 
same route, but similar idea have be appli to 
other social phenomenon such a the spread of idea 
or rumors[17] and the viral propag of meme on 
the internet[18]. thi origin epidemiolog model- 
ing be howev limit to the analysi within singl 
cities, without spatial extension. few studi aim at 
quantit describ the spatial spread of riot cou- 
plead with contagion. notabl except be an anal- 
ysi of the US ethnic riots[13], correl the occur- 
renc of riot in differ cities, and the studi of the 
2011 london riots[7, 11], which describ the displace- 
ment of rioters. In contradistinct with the london 
case, medium report and case studies[3, 19] show that 
the 2005 french rioter remain local in a partic- 
ular neighborhood of each municipality. however, the 
riot itself do travel. our data give a uniqu oppor- 
tuniti to studi thi contagion from citi to citi at the 
level of a whole country. 

We introduc here a compartment epidem model 
of the susceptible-infected-recov (sir) type[20, 
21, 22]. infect take place through contact within 
citi a well a through other short- and long-rang in- 
teract aris from either social network or medium 
coverage. these influenc interact be the key to ri- 
ot spread over the discret set of french municipal- 
ities. In particular, diffus base on geograph prox- 
imiti play a major role in gener a kind of riot 
wave around pari which we exhibit here. thi be sub- 
stantiat by the remark agreement between the 
data and the model at variou geograph scales. in- 
deed, one of our main find be that less than ten free 
paramet togeth with onli one sociolog variabl 
(the size of the popul of poorli educ young 
males) be enough to accur describ the complet 
spatio-tempor dynam of the riots. 

the qualit featur take into account by our 
model – the role of a singl trigger effect, a ‘social 
tension’ buildup, a somewhat slow and rather smooth 
relaxation, and local a well a global spread –, be 
common to mani riots. thi suggest that our ap- 
proach give a gener framework for the model of 
spontan collect uprising. 

result 

the 2005 french riot dataset 

We base our analysi here on the daili crime reports[3] 
of all incid record by the french polic at the mu- 
nicip (correspond to the french “communes”) 
under polic authority, which cover municip with 

a popul of at least 20,000 inhabitants. such data, 
on the detail time cours of riot at the scale of hour 
or days, and/or involv a larg number of cities, be 
rare. In addition, a an output of a central nation 
record procedur appli in all nation polic unit 
oper at the local level, the data be homogen 
in nature. these qualiti endow these data with a 
uniqu scientif value. We adopt a simpl methodol- 
ogi for quantifi the riot activity: we defin a a 
singl event ani rioting-lik fact, leav asid it na- 
ture and it appar intensity. thus, each one of “5 
burnt cars”, “polic offic attack with stones” or 
“stone of firemen”, be label a a singl event. We 
thu get a dataset compos of the number of riot-lik 
event for each municipality, everi day from octob 
26 to decemb 8, 2005, a period of 44 day which cov- 
er the three week of riot and extend over two week 
after. 

the top of fig. 1a show two typic exampl of the 
time cours of the number of event for municip 
(see also SI fig. s1, same plot for the 12 most activ 
île-de-fr municipalities). A strike observ be 
that there be a similar up-and-down dynam at everi 
location, show no rebound, or, if any, hardli distin- 
guishabl from the obviou stochast in the data. 
thi pattern be similar to the one observ for the US 
ethnic riots[10]. In addition, we observ the same pat- 
tern across differ spatial scale (see fig. 1 and SI 
fig. s3). moreover, thi pattern show up clearli de- 
spite the differ in amplitud (see also fig. 4a and 
4b). thi fractal-lik properti suggest an underli 
mechan for which geograph proxim matters. 
finally, the riot activ appear to be on top of a 
background level: a can be see on fig. 1, the number 
of event relax toward the veri same level that it 
have at the outset of the period. actually, in the po- 
lous data, one cannot alway discrimin riot fact 
from ordinari crimin ones, such a the burn of car 
unrel to collect uprising. for each location, we 
assum that the stationari background activ corre- 
spond to thi “normal” crimin activity. 

model framework 

We now introduc our model approach. section ma- 
terial and method provid the full model and nu- 
meric details. the model featur present below 
be base on the analysi at the scale of municipali- 
ties. however, sinc aggreg data at the scale of 
départ present a pattern similar to the data of 
municipalities, we also fit the model at the départ 
scale, a if the model assumpt be correct at the 

2 



scale of each département. A ‘site’, below, be a munici- 
paliti or a départ depend on the scale consid- 
ered. 
As the riot activ be describ by a discret set 
of events, we assum an underli point process[23] 
character by it mean value. assum statisti- 
cal independ between the riot and the crimin 
activities, the expect number of event at each site 
k (k = 1, ...,k, K be the number of sites), be the 
sum of the mean (time independent) background ac- 
tiviti λbk, and of the (time dependent) riot activ- 
ity, λk(t). In fit the model to the data, we take 
the background activ λbk a the averag number of 
event at the consid site over the last two week 
of our dataset. assum poisson statist (which ap- 
pear to be in good agreement with the data, see mate- 
rial and methods), the mean λk(t) fulli character 
the riot activities. We make the assumpt that 
thi number of event λk(t) be proport to the local 
number of rioters, ik(t): 

λk(t) = αik(t). 

We model the coupl dynam of the set of 2×k vari- 
ables, the number ik(t) of rioter (infect individu 
in the terminolog of the sir model) and the num- 
ber sk(t) of individu suscept to join the riot, 
by write an epidem sir model[21, 22] in a form 
suit for the present study. thi give the coupl 
dynam of the λk(t) and of the associ variables, 
σk(t) ≡ αsk(t). We fit the model to the data by con- 
sider a discret time version of the equat (event 
be report on a daili basis), and by optim the 
choic of the model free paramet with a maximum 
likelihood method. 

We now sketch the propos sir model. We as- 
sume homogen interact within each municipal- 
iti (a hypothesi justifi by the coarse-grain natur 
of the data, and by the absenc of displac of riot- 
ers), and influenc between sites. the model thu be- 
long to the categori of metapopul epidem mod- 
el [24]. motiv by the rel smooth of the 
time cours of events, we make the strong assumpt 
that, at each site, there be a constant rate at which riot- 
er leav the riot. thi paramet aggreg the effect 
of differ factor – arrests, stringent policing, other 
sourc of deterrence, fear, fatigue, etc. –, none of them 
be here model explicitly. In addition, sinc there 
be almost no rebound of riot activity, we assum 
that there be no flux from recov (those who left the 
riot) to suscept (and thu we do not have to keep 
track of the number of recov individuals). 

In the epidem of an infecti disease, contagion 

typic occur by dyadic interactions, so that the 
probabl for a suscept individu to be infect 
be proport to the fraction of infect individu 
– lead to equat write in term of the frac- 
tion of infect and suscept individuals. In the 
present context, contagion result from a bandwagon 
effect[25, 12, 4]. the probabl of becom a rioter 
be thu a function of the number of rioters, henc of 
the number of event give the abov hypothesis. thi 
function be nonlinear since, be a probability, it must 
satur at some valu (at most 1) for larg riot ac- 
tivities. 

singl site epidem model 

As a first step, follow burbeck et al., we ignor inter- 
action between sites, and thu specifi the sir model 
for each site separately. We consid here one singl 
site (and omit the site index k in the equations). be- 
fore a trigger event occur at some time t0, there be 
a certain number S0 > 0 of suscept individu but 
no rioters. At t0 there be an exogen shock lead 
to a sudden increas in the I population, henc in λ, 
yield an initi condit λ(t0) = A > 0. from then 
on, the riot activ at a singl (isolated) site evolv 
accord to: 

dλ(t) 

dt 
= −ω λ(t) + β σ(t)λ(t), 

dσ(t) 

dt 
= −β σ(t)λ(t), 

where β be a suscept parameter. here we work 
within a linear approxim of the probabl to be- 
come infected, which appear to provid good result 
for the singl site modeling. the condit for the 
riot to start after the shock be that the reproduct 
number[20] R0 = βσ(t0)/ω be great than 1. In such 
a case, from t = t0 onward, the number of infect 
individu increases, pass through a maximum and 
relax back toward zero. 

We obtain the initi condit σ0 = σ(t0) = αs0 
from the fit procedure. thu for each site, we be 
left with five free paramet to fit in order to best 
approxim the time cours of the riot events: ω, 
β, t0, A and σ0. 

By show exampl at differ scales, fig. 1 (b, 
red curves) illustr the remark qualiti of the re- 
sult fit (see also SI fig. s1). the obviou limit 
be that fit all the 853 municip present in the 
dataset amount to determin 853×5 = 4265 free pa- 
rameters. the fit be veri good but meaningless (over- 
fitting) for site with onli one or two events. In addi-

(b) same data (gray dots) along with the calibr

involv time, the thin dot line divid the time 
axi into one week periods, start from the date of 
the shock, octob 27, 2005. 

tion, these singl site fit cannot explain whi the riot 
start on some particular date at each location. fit- 
ting the singl site model requir one to assum that 
there be one exogen specif shock at a specif time 
at each location, wherea the trigger of the local riot 
actual result from the riot event that occur be- 
fore elsewhere. nevertheless, we see that everywher 
the pattern be compat with an epidem dynam- 
ic and that through the use of the model it be possibl 
to fill in miss data and to smooth the data (filter 
out the noise). As a result of thi filtering, the global 
pattern of propag becom more apparent. in- 
deed, look at the pari area, one observ a kind of 
wave start at clichy-sous-boi municipality, diffus- 
ing to nearbi locations, spread around paris, and 
eventu die out in the more wealthi south-west 
area (see fig. 3a and SI video 1). 

model the riot wave 

We now take into account the interact between 
sites, specifi the global metapopul sir model. 
among the K site under consideration, onli one site 
k0, the municip of clichy-sous-boi (départ 
93 when work at départ scale), undergo a 
shock at a time t0, 27 octob 2005. To avoid a num- 
ber of paramet which would scale with the number 
of sites, we choos here all free paramet to be site- 
independ (in materi and method we give a more 
gener present of the model). the result sys- 
tem of 2 ×K coupl equat write a follows: for 
t > t0, for k = 1, ...,k, 

dλk(t) 

dt 
= −ω λk(t) + σk(t) ψ(λk(t)), 

dσk(t) 

dt 
= −σk(t) ψ(λk(t)). 

here ω be the site-independ valu for the recov 
rate. for the interact term we consid that at ani 
site k the probabl to join the riot be a function Ψ 
of a quantiti λk(t), the global activ a ‘seen’ from 
site k. thi repres how, on average, suscept 
individu feel concern by riot event occur 
either locally, in neighbor cities, or anywher els 
in france. We make the hypothesi that the closer 
the events, the strong their influence. We thu write 
that λk(t) be a weight sum of the riot activ 
occur in all sites, 

λk(t) = 
∑ 
j 

wkj λj(t), 

4 



where the weight wkj be give by a decreas func- 
tion of the distanc between site k and j. We test 
sever way of choos the weight and obtain the 
best result for two type of parametrizations. one 
be a power law decay with the distance, motiv by 
sever empir observations[26, 27, 28]. the second 
option be the sum of an exponenti decay and of a 
constant term. both involv two parameters, a prox- 
imiti scale d0 and, respectively, the expon δ and the 
strength ξ of the constant term. the constant term 
may correspond to proxim perceiv in term of cul- 
tural, socio-econom characteristics. 
for the (site independent) function ψ(.), we consid 
either it linear approximation, write 

ψ(λk(t)) = β λk(t) = β 
∑ 
j 

wkj λj(t), 

with the suscept β a a site-independ free pa- 
rameter, or variou non-linear cases, involv up to 
four parameters. 

finally, we have to make the crucial choic of the 
initi valu σk,0 = σk(t0), specif to each site. By 
definition, they must be proport to the size of the 
initi suscept population. We make the hypothe- 
si that the latter scale with the size of a popul 
defin by a sociolog specification. thu we assum 

σk,0 = ζ0 nk, 

where ζ0 be a site-independ free parameter, and Nk 
be the size of a refer popul provid by insee, 
the french nation statist and econom studi in- 
stitute. the result we present here take a refer 
the popul of male age between 16 and 24 out-of- 
school with no diploma – see materi and method for 
a discuss on the choic of the refer population. 

for the whole dynamics, we be left with onli six 
free paramet in the linear case: ω, A, ζ0, d0, δ or ξ, 
and β, and up to nine free paramet in the non linear 
case: five a for the linear case, ω, A, ζ0, d0, δ or ξ, 
and, in place of β, up to four paramet character 
the function Ψ. 

the abov model, in the case of the linear approxima- 
tion, make link to the classic spatial continuous, 
non-local, sir model[29] (see section link to the orig- 
inal spatial continu sir model in materi and 
methods, and SI video 3 and 4). In dimens one, 
when the space be homogeneous, we know[30] that trav- 
ele wave can propagate, quit similar to the way the 
riot spread around pari a exhibit in the previou 
section. the new class of model we have introduc 
be howev somewhat differ and more general, and 

rais sever open mathemat questions. the next 
section show the wave gener by our global model 
and the fit to the data. 

fit the data: the wave around pari 

We first focu on the contagion around paris, charac- 
teriz by a continu dens urban fabric with de- 
prive neighborhoods. there be 1280 municip 
in île-de-france. among the one under polic author- 
iti (a total of 462 municipalities, for all of which we 
have data), 287 be mention for at least one riot-lik 
event. for all the other municipalities, which be under 
“gendarmerie” author (a militari statu forc with 
polic duties), we have no data. sinc their popu- 
lation size be small, we expect the associ number 
of riot event to be veri small if not absent, so that 
these site have littl influenc on the whole dynam- 
ics. We choos the free paramet with the maximum 
likelihood method, make use of the avail data, 
i.e. the 462 municipalities. however, the model sim- 
ulat take into account all the 1280 municipalities. 
result be present for a power law decreas of the 
weight and a non linear function Ψ character by 
3 parameters. thus, we have here a total of 8 free 
parameters: ω,a, ζ0, d0, δ, in addit to three for the 
non-linear function. 

figur 2, 3b and the SI video 2 illustr the main 
results. figur 2 compar the model and the data on 
four aspects: time cours in each départ (a), am- 
plitud of the event (b), date at which the number 
of event be maximum (c), and spatial distribut of 
the riot (d). the global model with a singl shock 
correctli reproduc the up-and-down pattern at each 
location, a illustr on fig. 2 at départ scale. 
one can note the preserv of the smooth relax 
at each site, despit the influenc of other (still active) 
sites. thi can be understood from the sir dynam- 
ics: at a give location, the relax term (−ωλk) 
domin when there be no more enough suscept 
individuals, so that the local dynam becom es- 
sential independ of what be occur elsewhere. 
quit importantly, these local pattern occur at the 
correct times. one see that the date of maximum 
activ spread over sever day and vari across lo- 
cations, which reflect the propag of the riot. 

On the SI video 2 one can see the wave gener 
by the model. figur 3b show a sketch of thi wave, 
with one imag everi 4 day – which correspond to 
the timescal found by the paramet optimization, 
1/ω ∼ 4 days. On the same figure, thi timelin have to 
be compar with the one obtain from the singl site

cation where the actual riot activ occur earli 
than predict by the global model. A most visibl ex- 
ception be argenteuil municip (north-west of pari 
on the map, see fig. 3, second imag from the top), 
where the minist of interior make a speech (octob 
25) perceiv a provoc by the banlieu residents. 
thi could potenti explain the faster respons to the

ably, search in the medium coverage, we found that 
a kindergarten have be burnt in that municip at 
that period of time (nov. 6). 

fit the data: the wave across the 
whole countri 

We now show that the same model reproduc the 
full dynam across the whole country. We appli our 
global model consid each one of the départ 
of metropolitan franc (except corsica and paris, 
henc 93 départements) a one homogen site – 
comput at municip scale would be too demand- 
ing (more than 36, 000 municipalities). the best model 
option lead to 9 free parameters: ω,a, ζ0, d0, ξ, the 
suscept β (use the linear approximation), and 
differ suscept valu at three specif locations. 
In thi case too, the result fit be veri good, a illus- 
trate on fig. 4 (see also SI fig. s3). figur 4a and 4b 
show the result for the 12 most activ départements. 
figur 4c compar model and data on the total num- 
ber of events, and fig. 4d on the date of the maximum 
activity. for the latter, the data for the île-de-fr 
municip (fig. 2c) be reported. one see that the 
wave inde spread over all france, with the dynam 
in pari area essenti preced the one elsewhere. 
remarkably, a show on fig. 5, the model also pre- 
dict correctli the time of arriv and the weak ampli- 
tude of the riot wave for site where veri few riot 
event have be recorded. 

discuss 

studi the dynam of riot propagation, a dramat 
exampl of large-scal social contagion, be difficult due 
to the scarciti of data. the present work take advan- 
tage of the access to detail nation polic data on the 
2005 french riot that offer both the timescal of the 
day over a period of 3 weeks, and the geograph exten- 
sion over the country. these data exhibit remark 
featur that warrant a model approach. We have 
show that a simpl epidemic-lik model with less than 
10 free parameters, combin contagion both within 
and between cities, allow one to reproduc the daili 
time cours of events, reveal the wave of contagion. 
A crucial model ingredi be the choic of a singl so- 
ciolog variable, take from the censu statist a a 
proxi for calibr the size of the suscept popula- 
tion. It show that the wave propag in an excit 
medium of depriv neighborhoods. sinc our analysi

figur 5: results, calibr at the scale of the

of event be veri small, the model predict the site 
to be hit by the wave, with a small amplitud and at 
the correct period of time. 

underli mechanism, have the outbreak locat 
surround by a dens continuum of depriv neigh- 
borhood make the large-scal contagion possible. 

what lesson on human behavior can we draw from 
our analysis? firstly, ‘geographi matters’[26]: despit 
the modern commun media, physic proxim 
be still a major featur in the circul of ideas, here of 
riotou ideas. secondly, strong interperson tie be at 
stake for drag peopl into action that confront so- 
cial order. the underli interpret be that inter- 
person network be relev for understand riot 
participation. human behavior be a consequ not 
onli of individuals’ attribut but also of the strength 
of the relat they hold with other individuals[31]. 
strong interperson connect to other who be al- 
readi mobil draw new particip into partic- 
ular form of collect action such a protest, and 
ident (ethnic or religi based) movements[32, 33]. 
thirdly, concentr of socio-econom disadvantag 
facilit format of a sizabl group and therefor 
involv in destruction: number of rioter in the 
model (rather than proportions) can be interpret a 
an indirect indic of risk assess befor partici- 
pat to a confront with the police[34, 5]. rioter 
seem to adopt a ration behavior and onli engag in 
such event when their number be sufficient. 

the question of parsimoni be of the essenc in our 
model approach: an outstand question be to 
understand whether a limit number of paramet 
might account for the observ phenomenon at variou 
scale and in variou locations. We answer thi ques- 
tion posit here, thu reveal the exist of a 
gener mechan at work. the similar up-and-down 
pattern observ for the US ethnic riot in differ 

citi suggest that thi process be inde common to a 
larg class of spontan riots. the 2005 riot prop- 
agat from place to place be also reminisc of the 
spread of other riots, such a the one of the food 
riot in the late eighteen centuri in the uk[35], and of 
the ethnic riot in US citi – also coin a a wave[13]. 
We thu believ that the model approach introduc 
here provid a gener framework, differ from the 
statistical/econometr approach, that may be adapt 
to the detail descript of the propag of spon- 
taneou collect upris – notably, the interact 
term in our sir model can be modifi to includ time 
delay (time for the inform to travel) or to take 
into account time integr of past events. 

materi and method 

french administr divis 

the three main french administr divis are: 
the “commune”, which we refer to a municip in 
the paper (more than 36, 000 commun in france); 
at a mid-level scale the ‘département’, somewhat 
analog to the english district (96 départ 
in metropolitan france, label from 1 to 95, with 
2A and 2B for corsica); the ‘région’ aggreg 
sever neighbor départ (12 in metropolitan 
france, a of 2016). At a give level, geograph 
and demograph characterist be heterogeneous. 
howev the typic diamet of a départ be 
∼ 100 km, and the one of a region, ∼ 250 km. 
there be two nation polic forces, the ‘police’ 
and the ‘gendarmerie’ (a civilian like polic forc 
report to the ministri of interior whose agent have 
a militari statu in charg of polic the rural part 
of the country). most urban area (cover all 
municip with a popul superior to 20000) 
be under polic authority. the more rural one be 
under gendarmeri authority. the avail data for 
the present studi onli concern the municip 
under polic authority, except paris, for which we lack 
data (but be not much affect by the riots). 
the full list of the municip be avail on the 
french govern website, 
https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/competence- 
territoriale-gendarmerie-et-police-nationales/. 

dataset 

the present analysi be base on the daili crime report 
of all incid of civil unrest report by the french 
polic at the municip under polic authority[3] 

8 



(see above). the daili report be write in natur 
language, and have be encod to allow for statist 
treatment. from the report we select onli fact re- 
late to urban violence. some fact be report more 
than onc (a first time when the fact be discovered, 
and then one or two day late e.g. if the perpetr 
have be identified). We care tri to detect and 
suppress doubl counting, but some case may have 
be missed. there be also a few miss or incom- 
plete data – notabl in the night when riot be at 
it maximum, a the polic be overwhelm and re- 
port onli aggreg facts, instead of detail citi per 
city. 

In the polic data, incid in relat with the ri- 
ot be mostli case of vehicl set on fire (about 70%), 
but also burn of public transport vehicles, pub- 
lic buildings, of wast bins, damag to bu and bu 
shelters, confront between rioter and police, etc. 
fact have be encod with the maximum precision: 
day and time of the fact, who or what be the target, 
the type of damage, the number and kind of damag 
object and the number and qualiti of person involved, 
whenev these detail be mention in the report. In 
the present work, a explain in the main text, from 
these details, we comput a daili number of event per 
municipality. We gener two differ datasets, one 
for the event (with a total of 6877 entri concern 
853 municipalities) and the other for the arrest (2563 
entries), that in forthcom work will serv to charac- 
teriz the rioter a well a the sever of the penalties. 
In futur work we also plan to explor the riot event 
beyond the sole number of event a studi here. one 
can expect to see what have be for instanc the role of 
curfew and other deterr effect (in space and time). 

In addition, we have also built a specif dataset of 
medium coverage, from both local newspap and na- 
tional TV and radio broadcasts. In ongo work we 
extend our model framework by consid the cou- 
pling between the dynam of riot event and the me- 
dia coverage. 

background activ 

the riot activ appear to be abov a constant 
level which most like correspond to crimin activ- 
iti (an averag of an order of 100 vehicl be burnt 
everi day in france, essenti due to crimin act not 
relat to collect uprising). sinc thi background 
activ have the same level befor and after the riot, we 
assum that the riot and the crimin activ be 
statist independent. In addition, we also consid- 
ere altern model where the background activ 

be an equilibrium state, the riot be a transient ex- 
cite state. such model would predict an undershoot- 
ing of the activ just after the end of the riot – more 
exactli a relax with damp oscil –, but 
the data do not exhibit such behavior. 

for the fits, the background activ λb be take a 
the mean activ over the last two week in our dataset 
(novemb 25 to decemb 8), period that we can con- 
sider a the tail of the data for which there be no longer 
ani riot activ (see fig. 1). for the site with a non 
zero number of event in the tail, we observ that thi 
base rate be proport to the size of the refer 
popul chosen for calibr the size of the sus- 
ceptibl population. for the site where the number of 
event in the tail be either zero or unknown (which be 
the case for a larg number of small municipalities, in 
particular the one under gendarmeri authority), one 
need to give a non zero valu of the correspond base 
rate in order to appli the maximum likelihood method 
(see below). We estim it from the size of the refer- 
enc popul (set a 1 when it be 0), use the latter 
proportion coeffici (with a maximum valu of 
λb set to one over the length of the tail, ie 1/14). 

poisson nois assumpt 

In order to calibr the model to the data, we assum 
poisson statistics, although we do not claim that the 
underli process be exactli of poisson nature. how- 
ever, it be a conveni work hypothesi for numeri- 
cal reason (see below free parameters: numer opti- 
mization). from a theoret point of view, thi choic 
be a priori appropri a we deal with discret valu 
(often veri small). In addition, we have see that the 
data suggest that a same kind of model be relev 
at differ scales: thi point toward infinit divisi- 
ble distributions, such a the poisson distribut – the 
sum of sever independ poisson process still be- 
ing a poisson process. We wish to emphas that we 
show that the statist of the data be compat with 
the poisson hypothesis. under such a hypothesis, the 
varianc be equal to the mean. figur 6a show that, 
for each département, if we look at the last two week 
exhibit a stationari behavior, the variance/mean re- 
lationship be inde in good agreement with a poisson 
hypothesis. figur 6b show poisson plot[36] for 
each of the 12 regions, which give addit support 
to the poisson nois property. 
for completeness, we recal the mean of a poisson- 
ness plot. one have a total number of observ n. 
each particular valu x be observ a certain number of

time nx, henc an empir frequenc of occurr

thus, in that case, the plot of the quantiti log(x!nx/n) 
(the blue circl in fig. 6b) a a function of x should 
fall along a straight line with slope log(λ) and intercept 
−λ (the red line on fig. 6b). 

singl site epidem model 

We detail here the compartment sir model when ap- 
pli to each site separ (each municipality, or, af- 
ter aggreg the data, for each département). let u 
consid a particular site (we omit here the site index 
k in the equations). At each time t there be a number 
s(t) of individu suscept to join the riot, and i(t) 
of infect individu (rioters). those who leav the 
riot becom recov individuals. sinc we assum 
that there be no flux from recov to susceptible, we 
do not have to keep track of the number of recov 
individuals. initially, befor a trigger event at some 
time t0 occurs, there be a certain number S0 > 0 of 
suscept individu but no rioters, that is, i(t) = 0 
for all t ≤ t0. At t0 there be an exogen shock and 

the number of rioter becom posit i(t0) = I0 > 0. 
from there on, neglect fluctuations, the number of 
rioter and of suscept individu evolv accord 
to the follow set of equations: 

di(t) 

dt 
= −ω i(t) + s(t)p (s→ i, t) 

ds(t) 

dt 
= −s(t)p (s→ i, t) 

(1a) 

(1b) 

let u now explain thi system of equations. In eq. 
(1a), ω be the constant rate at which rioter leav the 
riot. the second term in the right hand side of eq. (1a) 
give the flux from suscept to infect a the prod- 
uct of the number of suscept individuals, time the 
probabl P (s → i, t) for a suscept individu to 
becom infected. the second equation, eq. (1b), sim- 
pli state that those who join the riot leav the sub- 
popul of suscept individuals. 

We now specifi the probabl to join the riot, 
P (s → i, t) (to becom infect when in the suscep- 
tibl state). In line with account of other collect 
upris phenomena[5], testimoni from particip 
in the 2005 riot suggest a bandwagon effect: individu- 
al join the riot when see a group of rioter in action. 
threshold decis models[25, 12] describ thi herd 
behavior assum that each individu have a threshold. 
when the herd size be larg than thi threshold the in- 
dividu join the herd. granovetter[12] have specif 
appli such a model to riot formation, the threshold 
be then the number of rioter beyond which the in- 
dividu decid to join the riot. here we make the 
simpler hypothesi that the probabl to join the riot 
do not depend on idiosyncrat factors, and be onli an 
increas function of the total number of rioter at the 
locat (site) under consideration. It be worth empha- 
size that thi herd behavior be in contrast with the 
epidem of an infecti disease, where contagion typi- 
calli occur from dyadic interactions, in which case the 
probabl be proport to the fraction of infect 
individuals, i(t)/s0. be a probability, P (s → i, t) 
must satur at some valu (at most 1) for larg I, 
and be thu a nonlinear function of I. nevertheless, 
we will first assum that condit be such that we 
can approxim P (s → i, t) by it linear behavior: 
P (s → i, t) ∼ κi(t) (but note that κ do not scale 
with 1/s0) and discu late a differ specif 
for thi term. 

given the assumpt λ(t) = αi(t), it be conveni 
to defin 

σ(t) = αs(t) (2) 

so that the riot dynam at a singl (isolated) site be 

10 



describ by: 
dλ(t) 

dt 
= −ω λ(t) + β σ(t)λ(t) 

dσ(t) 

dt 
= −β σ(t)λ(t) 

(3a) 

(3b) 

where β ≡ κα . initi λ = 0, which be a fix point of 
thi system of equations. with σ(t0) = σ0 > 0, the riot 
start after the shock if the reproduct number[20] 
R0 ≡ βσ0/ω = κs0/ω be great than 1. In such a 
case, from t = t0 onward, the number of infect indi- 
vidual first increases, then go through a maximum 
and eventu relax back toward zero. becaus κ 
be not of order 1/s0, thi condit seem too easi to 
satisfy: at ani time, ani perturb would initi a 
riot. one may assum that the particular paramet 
valu allow one to fit the data describ the state of 
the system at that particular period. previou month 
and day of escal of tension may have lead to an 
increas in the suscept κ, or in the number of 
suscept individu s0. 

non local contagion model 

We give here the detail on the global sir model, with 
interact between sites. We have a discret number 
K of sites, with homogen mix within each site, 
and interact between sites. At each site k, there be 
a number Sk of ‘susceptible’ individuals, Ik of ‘infected’ 
(rioters), and Rk of ‘recovered’ individuals. As above, 
there be no flux from recov to suscept (henc we 
can ignor the variabl rk), and individu at site k 
leav the riot at a constant rate ωk. assum homo- 
geneou mix in each site, the dynam be give by 
the follow set of equations: 

dik(t) 

dt 
= −ωk ik(t) + sk(t)pk(s→ i, t) 

dsk(t) 

dt 
= −sk(t)pk(s→ i, t) 

(4a) 

(4b) 

with the initi condit t < t0 ik(t) = 0, sk(t) = 
sk0 > 0, and at t = t0, a shock occur at a singl 
locat k0, ik(t0) = I0 > 0. In the abov equations, 
ωk be the local recov rate, and pk( → i, t) be the 
probabl for a s-individu at locat k to becom 
a rioter at time t. 

We now write the result equat for the λk. We 
assum the riot activ to be proport to the 
number of rioters: 

λk(t) = αik(t) (5) 

note that differ hypothesi on the depend of λk

where a befor we introduc σk(t) = αsk(t). take 
into account the hypothesi on the linear depend 
of the number of event in the number of rioters, (5), 
we write P (s→ i, t) directli in term of the λs: 

pk(s→ i, t) = ψk(λk(t)) (7) 

where λk(t) be the activ ‘seen’ from site k (see main

where the weight wkj be give by a decreas func- 
tion of the distanc dist(k, j) between site k and j: 
wkj = W (dist(k, j)) (see below). the singl site case 
be recov for wkj = δk,j .

the form of these equat be analog to the one 
of the origin distribut contact continu spatial 
sir model [30] (see below) but here with a discret set 
of spatial locations. 
In the non-linear case, we choos paramet for ψk(λ) 
in order to have a function (i) be zero when there 
be no riot activity; (ii) which satur at a valu 
(smaller or equal to 1) at larg argument; (iii) with a 
monoton increas behavior give a more or less 
pronounc threshold effect (e.g. a sigmoid shape). 
thi have to be do look for the best compromis 
between qualiti of fit and number of paramet (a 
small a possible). We test sever sigmoid func- 
tions. for the fit of the pari area at the scale of the 

11 



municipalities, we make use of a variant with a strict 
threshold:{ 

Λ < λck, ψk(λ) = 0 

Λ > λck, ψk(λ) = ηk (1− exp−γk (λ− λck)) 
(11a) 

(11b) 

the fit be do with site-independ free param- 
eters, thi function thu contribut to three free pa- 
rameters, λc, η and γ. 

choic of the weight 

the best result be obtain for two options. one be 
a power law decay with the distance: 

wkj = (1 + dist(k, j)/d0) 
−δ 

(12) 

where dist(k, j) be the distanc between site k and site 
j (see below for it computation). the second option 
be the sum of an exponenti decay and of a constant 
term 

wkj = ξ + (1− ξ) exp (−dist(k, j)/d0) (13) 

In both case we normal the weight so that for everi 
site k, wkk = 1. take site-independ free parame- 
ters, both case give two free parameters, d0 and δ for 
the choic (12), d0 and ξ for the choic (13). 

link to the origin spatial continu 
sir model 

In the case of the linear approximation, the meta- 
popul sir model that we have introduc lead to 
the set of equat (10) of a type similar to the space- 
continu non local (distribut contact) sir model. 
with a view to describ the spread of infect 
in spatial distribut populations, kendall[29] intro- 
duce in 1957 thi non-loc version of the kermack- 
mckendrick sir model in the form of space-depend 
integro-differenti equations. omit the recov 
popul R, the system in the S, I variabl reads: 

 
di(x, t) 

dt 
= −ω i(x, t) + β s(x, t) 

∫ 
k(x, y) i(y, t) dy 

ds(x, t) 

dt 
= −β s(x, t) 

∫ 
k(x, y) i(y, t) dy 

(14a) 

(14b) 

where x ∈ RN , with N = 1, 2, and here i(x, t) and 
s(x, t) be densiti of immun and suscept individ- 
uals. In the particular case of dimens N = 1, and 
the space be homogeneous, mean here that k(x, y) 
be of the form k(x, y) = w(x − y), we know[30] that 
there exist travel wave of ani speed larg than or 

equal to some critic speed. furthermore, thi crit- 
ical travel wave speed also yield the asymptot 
speed of spread of the epidemic[37]. there have 
be mani mathemat work on thi system and on 
variou extensions[38, 18]. thus, at least in dimens 
N = 1 and for homogen space, thi non-loc sys- 
tem can gener travel front for the densiti of sus- 
ceptibl individuals, henc the propag of a ‘spike’ 
of infect individuals. although no proof exist in di- 
mension N = 2, numer simul show that the 
model can inde gener waves[39, 40], a illustr 
by the SI video 3 and 4, similar to the way the riot 
spread around pari give rise to the inform notion 
of a riot wave. 

however, the model we introduc here be more gen- 
eral and differ from the kendal model in certain as- 
pects. indeed, rather than continu and homoge- 
neous, the spatial structur be discret with heteroge- 
neou sites. moreover, the set of equat here (14) 
correspond to the linear approxim (10), wherea 
our gener model involv a non-linear term. the 
understand of gener travel wave and the 
speed of propag in thi gener context be inter- 
est open mathemat problems. 

more work be need to ass the mathemat 
properti of the specif famili of non local contagion 
model introduc here, that be defin on a discret 
network, with highli heterogen populations, and a 
non linear probabl of becom infected. 

date of the maximum 

figur 2c and 4b show how well the model account 
for the tempor unfold of the riot activity, thank 
to a comparison between model and data of the date 
when the riot activ peak at each location. given 
the noisi natur of the data, the empir date of that 
maximum itself be not well defined. for each site, we 
estim thi date a the weight averag of the date 
of the 3 great values, weight by those values. We 
fill in miss data valu by linear interpolation.

enc popul have a major influenc on the results. 
We find that an improp choic cannot be compen- 
sate by the optim of the free parameters. As 
an example, compar SI fig. s2, for which the refer- 
enc popul be the total population, with fig. 2a 
and 2b. 
sourc of nation french statistics: insee, the 
french nation institut carri the nation censu 
(http://www.insee.fr/). for the period under con- 
sideration, in most cases, we use relev data from 
2006 when data from 2005 be not available. 

non-fre parameters: distanc between

the geograph data be take from the collabo- 
rativ project open street map (http://osm13. 
openstreetmap.fr/~cquest/openfla/export/). 
the distanc dist(k, j) be take a the one (in km) 
between the centroid of each site. In the case of 
the municipalities, the centroid be take a the ge- 
ograph centroid comput with qgis[41]. In the 
case of départements, the centroid be comput a 
the weight centroid (weight by the size of the 
refer population) of all it municip that be 
under polic authority. 

free parameters: numer optimiza- 
tion 

the data fit make use of the maximum likelihood 
approach[42]. let u call X = {xk,i, k = 1 . . .k, i = 
1 . . . 44} the data, where each xk,i ∈ N correspond to 
the number of event for the site k at day i (i = 1 
correspond to octob 26, 2005), and let θ denot 
the set of free paramet (e.g. θ = {ω,a, ζ0, d0, δ, β} 
in the multi-sit linear case). assum condit 

independence, we have: 

p(x|θ) = 
∏

p(xk,i|θ) (15) 

under the poisson nois hypothesis, the xk,i be pois- 
son probabilist realiz with mean (λk,i(θ)+λbk): 

p(xk,i|θ) = 
(λk,i(θ) + λbk)

the log-likelihood, comput over all the site under 
consider and over the whole period (44 day long) 
for which we have data, thu writes: 

`(θ|x) = log p(x|θ)

note that the last term in the right hand side do not 
depend on the free paramet and we can thu ignor 
it. 
We perform the numer maxim of the log- 
likelihood use the interior point algorithm[43] imple- 
ment in the matlab[44] fmincon function. 

the method develop here allow one to explor 
the possibl of predict the futur time cours of 
event base on the observ of the event up to 
some date. preliminari result indic that, onc the 
activ have reach it peak in the pari area, the pre- 
diction in time and space of the riot dynam for the 
rest of franc becom quit accurate.

for the result illustr by the figur in the paper, 
we give here the free paramet numer valu ob- 
tain from the maximum likelihood method in the 
case of the fit at the scale of municip in île-de- 
france. note that thi optim be comput 
demanding: it requir to gener a larg number of

the choic of the function Ψ, we test the linear case 
and sever nonlinear choices. result be present

outliers. look at the result for differ versions, 
we observ some systemat discrep between data 
and model for three départements: 93, where the pre- 
dict activ be too low, and 13 and 62 where it be too 
high. actually, if one look at the empir maximum 
number of event a a function of the size of the ref- 
erenc popul use for calibr the suscept 
population, these three départ show up a out- 
liers: the riot intens be significantli differ from 
what one would expect from the size of the poor pop- 
ulation. outlier be here defin a fall outsid the 
mean ± 3 standard deviat rang when look at 
the residu of the linear regression. 
the case of 93 and 13 be not surprising. départ 
93 be the one where the riot started, and have the high- 
est concentr of depriv neighborhoods. inhabi- 
tant be awar of thi particular and refer to their

parametr and results. make use of the 
linear choic for Ψ, and the weight give by (13), we 
then introduc one more free paramet for each one 
of these sites, β93, β62 andβ13, allow for a differ- 
ent valu of the suscept than the one take for 
the rest of france. optim be thu do over the 
choic of 9 free parameters: ω,a, ζ0, d0, ξ, β, β13, β62 
and β93. 
the numer valu of the free paramet obtain 
after optim be a follows: ω = 0.41, A = 2.6; 
ζ0 = 190/nmax, where here nmax = 15632 be the maxi- 
mum size of the refer popul of all metropoli- 

tan départements; here the function Ψ be take lin- 
ear, β = 2. 10−3, except for three départ a ex- 
plain above. for these three départ with a 
specif susceptibility, one find about twice the com- 
mon valu for the départ 93 (where riot started), 
β93/β ∼ 1.95, and about half for the départ 62 
and 13, β62/β ∼ 0.47 and β13/β ∼ 0.42. 
for the weight chosen with an exponenti decreas 
plu a constant global value, eq. (13), d0 = 36 km, 
ξ = 0.06. when use instead the power law decrease, 
eq. (12), one find that the fit be almost a good. 
the expon valu be found to be δ = 0.80, which 
be similar to the valu δ = 0.67 found for the fit at 
the scale of municip (restrict to île-de-fr 
region). yet, these expon valu be much small 
than the ones, between 1. and 2., found in the litera- 
ture on social interact a a function of geograph 
distance[26, 27, 28]. A small valu of δ mean a veri 
slow decrease, a hint to the need of keep a non zero 
valu at veri larg distance. thi can be see a an- 
other indic that the altern choic with a long 
rang part, eq. (13), be more relevant, mean that 
both geograph proxim and long rang interact 
matter.

SI video 

• SI video 1. riot propag around paris: 
smooth data. 
thi video show the riot propag around paris. the 
map show the municip boundaries, with pari at the 
center. for each municip for which data be available, 
a circl be drawn with an area proport to the estim 
of the size of the suscept popul (see main text, 
section methods). instead of make use of the raw data, 
for each municip we replac each day valu by the 
one give by the fit with the singl site epidem model 
consid here a a tool for smooth the data. the color 
repres the intens of the riot activity: the warmer 
the color, the high the activity. the pace of the video 
correspond to three day per second. In order to improv 
the fluiditi of the video, we increas the number of frame 
per second by interpol each day with 7 new frames, 
whose valu be comput thank to a piece-wis cubic 
interpol of the origin ones. the result frame rate 
be then 24 frame per second. 
the movi be encod with the open standard h.264. 

• SI video 2. riot propag around paris: model 
with non-loc contagion. 
thi video show the riot activ a predict by the 
data-driven global epidemic-lik model. same technic 
detail a for the SI video 1. 
the movi be encod with the open standard h.264. 

• SI video 3. spatial sir: wave propag in a 
homogen medium. 
We illustr the formal continu spatial sir model 
with a video show the propag of a wave. the 
underli medium be character by a uniform densiti 
of suscept individuals. the weight w(x − y) in the 
interact term be give by a decreas exponenti 
function of the euclidean distanc ||x− y||. 
the movi be encod with the open standard h.264. 

• SI video 4. spatial sir: wave propag in a 
non-homogen medium. 
same a SI video 3, but with a heterogen densiti of 
suscept individuals, character by (1) a decreas of 
the densiti toward 0 near the boundari of the image, 
so that the wave dy befor leav the frame, (2) a hole 
at the center, which be then bypass by the wave, (3) 
a concentr of suscept individu that global 
decreas on the y-axis, so that the wave dy while go 
downward. 
the movi be encod with the open standard h.264.
