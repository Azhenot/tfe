and innovation. thi have result in signifi cant op- 
portun and prospect becom available, and 
an overwhelm amount of fanfar have spread 
across domains, areas, and events. 

A review of the relat initiatives, progress, and 
statu of data science, analytics, and big data4 and 
the diversifi ed discuss about the prospects, 
challenges, and directions5 make clear the contro- 
versi caus by the potenti confl ict of these vari- 
ou elements. there be a need for deep discuss 
about the natur and pitfal of data science, clari- 
fi cation of fundament concept and myths, and a 
demonstr of the intrins characterist and 
opportun of data science. 

thus, thi articl focu on two fundament 
issues—th natur and pitfal of data science. I 
highlight the status, intrins factors, characteris- 
tics, and featur of the era of data scienc and ana- 
lytics, a well a the challeng and opportun in 
innovation, research, and disciplinari development. 
I also summar common pitfal about the concept 
of data science, data volume, infrastructure, ana- 
lytics, and capabl and roles. build on these 
discussions, I then present the concept and possi- 
ble futur direct of data science. 

featur of the data scienc era 
identifi the featur and characterist of the 
data scienc era be critic and challenging. let’ ex- 
plore thi from the perspect of the transform 

and paradigm shift caus by data scienc and dis- 
cuss the core drive forc and the statu of sever 
typic issu confront the data scienc fi eld. 

transform and paradigm shift 
the emerg of the era of data scienc and ana- 
lytic can be highlight by three key indicators: 

• a disciplinari paradigm shift, or the shift of 
data-centr disciplinari paradigm from one to 
another; 

• technolog transformation, or the upgrad 
of data technolog from one gener to an- 
other; and 

• innov production, or the innov of tech- 
nical and practic data products. 

We can defi ne the disciplinari paradigm shift of 
data-ori and data-centr research, innova- 
tion, and profess a move from data analysi 
to data analytics, from descript analyt to 
deep analytics, and from data analyt to data 
science. the disciplinari paradigm shift promot 
data-rel technolog transform from 
large-scal data to big data, from busi opera- 
tional system to busi analyt systems, from 
the world wide web to the wisdom web, and 
from the internet to the internet of everyth (in- 
clude mobil and social network and the inter- 
net of things). 

innov product in data and analyt can 
be repres by typic indicators—for exam- 
ple, from a digit to a data economy, from close 
to open government, from e-commerc to onlin 
business, from landlin to smartphones, and from 

the era of analytics,1 data science,2 and big data3 have driven substanti governmental, in- 
dustrial, and disciplinari interest; goal and strategi 

transformation; and a paradigm shift in research

the internet to mobil and social 
networks. 

data-centr drive forc 
the transform and paradigm 
shift of data-ori discipline, tech- 
nologies, and product be dri- 
ven by core forces, includ data- 
enabl opportunities, data-rel 
ubiquit factors, and variou com- 
plexiti and intellig embed- 
ded in data-ori product and 
products. 

ubiquit data-ori factor in- 
clude the following: 

• data, which involv historical, real- 
time, and futur data; 

• behavior, which bridg the gap 
between the physic and data 
worlds; 

• complexity, which differenti 
one data system from another; 

• intelligence, which be emb in a 
data system; 

• service, which be present in variou 
form and domains; and 

• opportunities, becaus data enabl 
enorm opportunities. 

data-en opportunities, also 
call x-opportunities, be overwhelm- 
ing. they extend from research, inno- 
vation, education, government, and the 
economy, and can includ opportun 
in the follow areas: 

• research, such a invent data- 
focu breakthrough theori and 
technologies; 

• innovation, such a develop cut- 
ting-edg data-bas services, sys- 
tems, and tools; 

• education, such a innov data- 
orient cours and training; 

• government, such a enabl data- 
driven govern decis mak- 
ing and objectives; 

• economics, such a foster data econ- 
omy, services, and industrialization; 

• lifestyle, such a promot data- 
enabl smarter live and smarter 
cities; and 

• entertainment, such a creat 
data-driven entertain activi- 
ties, networks, and societies. 

A data scienc problem be a complex 
system6,7 in which comprehens sys- 
tem complexities, also call X- 
complexities,5 be embedded. these 
compris complex in the follow- 
ing areas: 

• data, includ comprehens data 
circumst and characteristics; 

• behavior, includ individu and 
group activities, evolution, utility, 
impact, and change; 

• the domain, includ domain factors, 
processes, norms, policies, knowl- 
edge, and domain expert engage- 
ment in problem solving; 

• social complexity, includ social 
networking, commun format 
and divergence, sentiment, the dis- 
semin of opinion and influ- 
ence, and other social issu such 
a trust and security; 

• the environment, includ contex- 
tual factors, interact with sys- 
tems, changes, and uncertainty; 

• learning, includ the develop 
of appropri methodologies, frame- 
works, processes, model and algo- 
rithms, and theoret foundat 
and explanations; and 

• decis making, includ the meth- 
od and form of deliverables, com- 
munications, and decision-mak 
actions. 

In a complex data scienc problem, 
ubiquit intelligence, also call X- 
intelligence,5 be often demonstr and 
must be incorpor and synergized7 in 
problem-solv process and systems: 

• data intellig highlight the in- 
terest information, insights, and 

stori hidden in data about busi- 
ness problem and drive forces. 

• behavior intellig demonstr 
the insight of activities, processes, 
dynamics, impact, and trust of in- 
dividu and group behavior by hu- 
man and action-ori organisms. 

• domain intellig includ do- 
main valu and insight that emerg 
from involv domain factors, 
knowledge, metaknowledge, and other 
domain-specif resources. 

• human intellig includ con- 
tribut make by the empir 
knowledge, beliefs, intentions, ex- 
pectations, critic thinking, and 
imaginari think of human indi- 
vidual and group actors. 

• network intellig result from 
the involv of networks, the 
web, and network mechan 
in problem comprehens and prob- 
lem solving. 

• organiz intellig includ 
insight and contribut creat 
by the involv of organization- 
orient factors, resources, com- 
petenc and capabilities, maturity, 
evaluation, and dynamics. 

• social intellig includ contribu- 
tion and valu gener by the in- 
clusion of social, cultural, and eco- 
nomic factors, norms, and regulation. 

• environment intellig can be 
embodi through other intellig 
specif to the underli domain, 
organization, society, and actors. 

all of these data-ori and data- 
driven factors, complexities, intelli- 
gences, and opportun constitut 
the natur and characterist of data 
scienc and drive the evolut and 
dynam of data scienc problems. 

data dna 
As a result of data quantification, data 
be everywhere, includ the internet; 
the iot; sensor networks; sociocul- 
tural, economic, and geograph 



68 www.computer.org/intellig ieee intellig system 

repositories; and quantifi personal- 
ize sensors, includ mobile, social, 
living, entertaining, and emot 
sources. thi form the “datalogical” 
constituent, data dna, which play 
a critic role in data organ and 
perform a similar function to biolog- 
ical dna in live organisms. 

definit 1. data dna be the 
datalog “molecule” of data, 
consist of fundament and 
gener constituents: entiti (e), 
properti (p), and relationship (r). 
here, “datalogical” mean that 
data dna play a similar role in 
data organ a biolog dna 
play in live organisms. entiti 
can be an object, instance, human, 
organiza tion, system, or part of a 
subsystem. properti refer to the 
attribut that describ an entity. 
relationship correspond to entiti 
interact and properti inter- 
actions, includ properti valu 
interactions. 

entity, property, and relationship 
present differ characterist in term 
of quantity, type, hierarchy, structure, 
distribution, and organization. A data- 
intens applic or system often 
compris mani divers entities, each 
of which have specif properties, and 
differ relationship be embed- 
ded within and between properti 
and entities. from the low to the 
high levels, data dna present 
heterogen and hierarch cou- 
pling across levels. On each level, it 
maintain consist (inherit of 
properti and relationships) a well 
a variat (mutations) across en- 
tities, properties, and relationships, 
while support person char- 
acterist for each individu entity, 
property, and relationship. 

for a give data, it entities, proper- 
ties, and relationship be instanti 
into divers and domain-specif forms, 

which carri most of the data’ ecologi- 
cal and genet inform in data 
generation, development, functioning, 
reproduction, and evolution. In the 
data world, data dna be emb in 
the whole bodi of personal8 and non- 
person data organisms, and in the 
generation, development, functioning, 
management, analysis, and use of all 
data-bas applic and systems. 

data dna drive the evolut of a 
data-intens organism. for example, 
univers data dna connect the data 
of students, lecturers, administr 
systems, corpor services, and oper- 
ations. the student data dna further 
consist of academic, pathway, librari 
access, onlin access, social media, 
mobil service, gps, and wi-fi usag 
data. such student data dna be both 
fix and evolving. 

In complex data, data dna be em- 
bed within variou x-complexi- 
tie and ubiquit x-intellig in 
a data organism.5,7 thi make data 
rich in content, characteristics, se- 
mantics, and value, but challeng 
in acquisition, preparation, presenta- 
tion, analysis, and interpretation. 

data qualiti 
data scienc task involv role and 
follow process that differ from more 
gener IT projects, becaus data 
scienc and analyt work tend to be 
creative, intelligent, exploratory, non- 
standard, unautomated, and person- 
alized, and they have the object of 
discov evid and indic 
for decision-mak actions. they in- 
evit involv qualiti issu such a 
data validity, veracity, variability, and 
reliability, and social issu such a 
privacy, security, accountability, and 
trust, which must be consid in 
data scienc and analytics. 

data qualiti be a critic problem in 
data scienc and engineering. given a 
data scienc problem, we should not as- 
sume that the data avail or give be 

perfect, the data alway gener good 
outcomes, the output (findings) gener- 
ate be alway good and meaningful, 
or the outcom can alway inform bet- 
ter decisions. these assumpt myth 
involv the qualiti of the data (input), 
the model, and the outcom (output)— 
in particular, validity, veracity, variabil- 
ity, and reliability. 

data and analyt valid deter- 
mine whether a data model, concept, 
conclusion, or measur be well- 
found and correspond accur to 
the data characterist and real-world 
facts, make it capabl of give the 
right answer. similarly, data and ana- 
lytic verac determin the correct- 
ness and accuraci of data and analyt- 
ic outcomes. both valid and verac- 
iti must be check from the perspec- 
tive of data content, representation, 
design, modeling, experiments, and 
evaluation. 

data and analyt variabl be de- 
termin by the chang and uncer- 
tain natur of data, reflect busi 
dynam (includ the problem con- 
text and problem-solv purposes), 
and thu requir the correspond 
analyt to adapt to the data’ dynam 
nature. becaus of the chang natur 
of data, the need to check the valid- 
ity, veracity, and reliabl data use 
and analyt undertaken be veri im- 
portant. data and analyt reliabl 
refer to the consistency, redundancy, 
repeatability, and trust properti 
of the data used, the analyt model 
generated, and the outcom deliv 
on the data. reliabl data and analyt- 
ic be not necessarili static. make 
data analyt adapt to the evolv- 
ing, streaming, and dynam natur of 
data, business, and decis request be 
a critic challeng in data scienc and 
analytics. 

social issu 
domain-specif data and busi 
be emb in social context and

incorpor with social issues. data 
scienc task typic involv such 
social issu a privacy, security, ac- 
countability, and trust in data, mod- 
eling, and deliverables. 

data and analyt privaci address 
the challeng of collecting, analyzing, 
disseminating, and share data and 
analyt while protect person 
identifi or other sensit infor- 
mation and analyt from improp 
disclosure. protect technology, 
regulation, and polici be requir 
to balanc protect and appropri- 
ate disclosur in the process of data 
manipulation. 

data and analyt secur pro- 
tect target object from both de- 
structiv forc and unauthor us- 
ers’ actions, such a improp use or 
disclosure. It address not onli pri- 
vaci issu but other aspect beyond 
privacy, such a softwar and hard- 
ware backup and recovery. data and 
analyt secur also involv the 
develop of regul polit or 
legal mechan and system to ad- 
dress such issues. 

data and analyt account 
refer to an oblig to compli with 
data privaci and secur legisl 
and to report, explain, trace, and 
identifi the data manipul and 
analyt conduct to maintain the 
transparency, traceability, liability, 
and warranti of both the measure- 
ment and results, a well a the effi- 
caci and verifi of the analyt 
and protection. 

data and analyt trust refer 
to the belief in the reliability, truth, 
or abil of data and analyt to 
achiev relev goals. thi involv 
the develop of appropri tech- 
nology, social norms, ethic rules, or 
legisl to ensure, measure, and 
protect trust in the data and analyt- 
ic use and confid in the corre- 
spond outcom and evalu of 
analytics. 

the extrem challeng 
differ type and level of ana- 
lytic problem troubl the exist 
knowledg base, and we be espe- 
cialli challeng by the problem in 
complex data and environments. our 
focu on data scienc research and in- 
novat concern what we call an ex- 
treme data challeng in data scienc 
and analytics. the extrem data chal- 
leng illustr in figur 1 seek to 
discov and deliv complex knowl- 
edg in complex data, take into 
account complex behavior within a 
complex environ to achiev ac- 
tionabl insight that will inform and 
enabl decis action-tak in com- 
plex busi problem that cannot 
be good handl by other methods. 

the critic futur direct of 
data scienc research and innov 
in thi case focu on the following: 

• complex data with complex charac- 
teristics5,7; 

• complex behavior with complex 
relationship and dynamics5,7; 

• complex environ in which 
complex data and behavior be 
emb and interact with5,7; 

• complex model to address the 
data and behavior complex in a 
complex environment; 

• complex find to uncov hid- 
den but technic interest and 
business-friendli observations, in- 
dicat or evidence, statements, or 
presentations; and 

• action insight to demonstr 
the next best or bad situat and 

inform the optim strategi to 
support effect busi decis 
making.9,10 

mani real-lif problem fall into thi 
level of complex and challenges, a 
the extrem data challeng shows, and 
they have not be address well. one 
exampl be understand group be- 
havior by multipl actor when there 
be complex interact and relation-

I present a statu summari of the 
disciplinari develop of data

gap between the data’ potenti 
and the state-of-the-art capabl 
to fulfil such potential, the research

the data and how much we can under- 
stand.9,10 figur 2 show empir 
the data develop gap between 
the growth of data potenti and the 
state-of-the-art capabilities. such gap 
have increas in the past 10 years, 
especi recently, owe to the imbal- 
anc between potenti exponenti 
increas and progress state-of-the- 
art capabl development. exampl 
of such gap could includ the gap 
between 

• data avail and the current 
understand data level, scale, and 
degree; 

• data complex and the current 
avail analyt theori and tools; 

• data complex and the current 
avail technic capabilities; 

• possibl valu and impact and 
current achiev outcom and 
benefits; 

• organiz need and the cur- 
rentli avail talent (that is, data 
scientists); and 

• potenti opportun and the cur- 
rent outcom and benefit achievable. 

such growth gap be driven by 
critic challeng for which there be 

a shortag of effect theori and 
tools. for example, a typic challeng 
in complex data concern intrins 
complex coupl relationship and 
heterogeneity, form data that be 
not independ and ident dis- 
tribut (iid),12 which cannot be 
simplifi in such a way that it can 
be handl by classic iid learn 
theori and systems. other exam- 
ple includ the real-tim learn of 
large-scal onlin data, such a learn- 
ing shop manipul and mak- 
ing real-tim recommend on 
high-frequ data in the “11-11” 
shop season launch by alibaba, 
or identifi suspect in an imbal- 
anc and multisourc data and en- 
viron such a fraud detect in 
high-frequ market trading. other 
challeng be high invisibility, high 
frequency, high uncertainty, high di- 
mensionality, the dynam nature, 
mix sources, onlin learn at the 
web scale, and the develop of 
human-lik thinking. 

data scienc research map 
the way to explor the fundament 
challeng and innov opportuni- 
tie face big data and data scienc be 

to conduct problem-, data-, and goal- 
driven discovery: 

• problem-driven discoveri requir 
understand the problem’ intrins 
nature, characteristics, complexities, 
and boundari and then analyz- 
ing the gap between the problem 
complex and the exist capa- 
biliti set. thi gap analysi be critic 
for origin research and break- 
through in scientif discovery. 

• goal-driven discoveri requir un- 
derstand the business, technical, 
and decis goal to be achiev by 
understand the problem and then 
conduct gap analysi of what have 
be implement and achiev and 
what be expect to be achieved. 

• data-driven discoveri requir un- 
derstand the data characteristics, 
complexities, and challeng and the 
gap between the natur of a prob- 
lem and the data capabilities. be- 
caus of the limit of exist 
data systems, project from the 
underli physic world where the 
problem sit to the data world where 
the problem be “datafied” can be bi- 
ased, dishonest, or manipulated. As 
a result, the data do not complet 
captur the problem and thu cannot 
creat a full pictur of it through ani 
type of data exploration. 

there be two way to explor major 
research challenges: to summar what 
concern the relev communities, 
and to scrutin the potenti issu 
aris from the intrins complex 
and natur of data scienc problem 
a complex systems.7 with the first ap-

more challenging, becaus we must ex- 
plore the unknown space of the com- 
plexiti and comprehens intellig 
in complex data problems. 

We list some of the data scienc com- 
munity’ main challeng in address 
the big data complex repres 
by key topic in the data a–z diction- 
ary. We categor these a challeng 
in data/busi understanding; math- 
emat and statist foundations; 
x-analyt and data/knowledg engi- 
neering; data qualiti and social issues; 
data value, impact, and usability; and 
data to decis and actions. 

x-analyt and data/knowledg 
engin encompass mani specif 
research issu that have not be ad- 
dress properly. these includ behav- 
ior and event processing; data storag 
and manag systems; data qualiti 
enhancement; data modeling, learning, 
and mining; deep analytics, learning, 
and discovery; simul and experi- 
mental design; high-perform pro- 
cess and analytics; analyt and 
comput architectur and infra- 
structure; and networking, communi- 
cation, and interoperation. 

data scienc cours framework 
data scienc and analyt educ 
aim to train and gener the data and 
analyt knowledg and profici 
requir to manag the capabl and 
capac gap in the creation of a data 
scienc profession21,22 and to achiev 
the goal of data scienc innov 
and the data economy. accordingly, 
differ level of educ and train- 
ing be necessary, from attend public 
courses, corpor training, and under- 
graduat cours to join a master’ 
or phd program in data science. 

public cours be design for the 
gener commun to lift their under- 
standing, skills, profession, and spe- 
cialism in data scienc through multi- 
level short courses. they rang from 
basic cours to intermedi and ad- 

vanc courses. the knowledg map 
consist of such compon a data sci- 
ence, data mining, machin learning, 
statistics, data management, comput- 
ing, programming, system analysi and 
design, and modul relat to case 
studies, hands-on practices, project 
management, communication, and de- 
cision support. 

corpor train and workshop 
be custom to upgrad and foster 
corpor thinking, knowledge, capa- 
bility, and practic for the entir enter- 
prise’ innov and productivity. 
thi involv offer cours and 
workshop for the workforce, from se- 
nior corpor execut to busi 
owners, busi analysts, data model- 
ers, data scientists, data engineers, and 
deploy and enterpris strategists. 
such cours cover topic such a data 
science, data engineering, analyt 
science, decis science, data and 
analyt softwar engineering, project 
management, communications, and case 
management. 

undergradu cours can be offer 
on either a gener data scienc basis, fo- 
cuse on build data scienc founda- 
tion and data and analyt computing, 
or specif area such a data engineer- 
ing, predict modeling, and visualiza- 
tion. doubl degre or major might 
be offer to train profession who 
will gain knowledg and abil across 
disciplin such a busi and analyt- 
ic or statist and computing. 

A master of data scienc and ana- 
lytic program aim to train special- 
ist and foster the talent of those who 
can conduct a deep understand of 
data and undertak analyt task in 
data mining, knowledg discovery, 
and machin learning-bas advanc 
analytics. interdisciplinari expert can 
be train from those who have a solid 
foundat in statistics, business, so- 
cial science, or other specif disciplin 
and can integr data-driven explo- 
ration technolog with disciplinari 

expertis and techniques. A critic 
area in which data scienc and analyt- 
ic should be incorpor be in mba 
courses. thi be where the next genera- 
tion of busi leader can be train 
for the new economi and a global view 
of econom growth. 

A phd in data scienc and analyt 
program aim to train high-level tal- 
ent and specialist who have indepen- 
dent thinking, leadership, research, 
innovation, and good practic for 
theoret innov to manag the 
signific knowledg and capabl 
gaps, and for substanti econom 
innov and rais productivity. 
interdisciplinari research be encour- 
age to train leader who have a sys- 
temat and strateg understand 
of the what, how, and whi of data 
and econom innovation. 

figur 3 show the level, objective, 
capabl set, and outcom of hier- 
archic data scienc and analyt

data scienc a a 
new scienc 
so, what make data scienc a new 
science? To address thi question, we 
discu data a–z, which can be use 
to captur everi aspect of data scienc 
to form a data scienc ontolog sys- 
tem built on discuss about the fea- 
tures, disciplinari development, and

data a–z 
the big data commun often us mul- 
tipl “v” to describ the characteris- 
tics, challenges, and opportun of big 
data. these includ volum (size), veloc- 
iti (speed), varieti (diversity), verac 
(qualiti and trust), valu (insight), visual- 
ization, and variabl (formality). 

In fact, these term cannot com- 
plete describ big data or the field of 
data science. therefore, it be valuabl

It be notabl that such a data a–z 
ontolog probabl cover most of the 
topic of interest to major data scienc 
communities. the exercis of con- 
struct data a–z can substanti 
deepen and broaden the understand- 
ing of intrins data characteristics, 
complexities, challenges, prospects, 
and opportunities.23 

what Is data science? 
gener speaking, data scienc be the 
scienc (or study) of data. We can defin 
data scienc a be object focused, 
process based, or disciplin oriented.5 

definit 2. from the process perspec- 
tive, data scienc be a systemat ap- 

proach to “think with wisdom,” 
“understand domain,” “manag- 
ing data,” “comput with data,” 
“mine on knowledge,” “commu- 
nicat with stakeholders,” “deliv 
products,” and “act on insights.” 

In contrast, data analyt under- 
stand data and it underli busi- 
ness, discov knowledge, deliv 
action insights, and enabl deci- 
sion making. from thi perspective, 
we can say that analyt be a key- 
stone of data science. 

from the disciplinari perspective, 
data scienc be a new interdisciplinari 
field in which to studi data and it do- 
main in term of a data-to-knowledge- 
to-wisdom think for gener 
data products.5 data scienc integr 
tradit data-ori disciplin 
such a statistics, informatics, and 
comput with tradit data- 

independ field such a communica- 
tion, management, and sociology. 

the futur of data scienc 
It be difficult at thi earli stage of data sci- 
enc to predict specif futur data sci- 
enc innov and research; thus, 
next-gener data scienc will need 
to address the unknown space that be in- 
visibl to exist scienc and creat new 
data products. We will need to deepen 
our understand of data invis 
(that is, invis data characteristics) 
in the hidden and blind spaces, under- 
stand their x-complex and x-intelli- 
gences, and strengthen our capabilities.5 
We will need to invent data representa- 
tion capabilities, includ designs, struc- 
tures, schemas, and algorithms, to make 
invis data more visibl and explicit. 
anoth task will be creat analyt 
and learn capabilities, includ origi- 
nal theories, algorithms, and models, to 
disclos the unknown knowledg in un- 
know spaces.5 new intellig system 
and servic will need to be built, includ- 
ing corpor and internet-bas collab- 
or platform and services, to support 
collabor and collect explor 
of invis and unknown challeng in 
fulli unknown spaces.5 finally, we will 
need to train a gener of qualifi 
data scienc profession in data literacy, 
thinking, competency, consciousness, 
and cognit intellig to work on thi 
data scienc agenda. 

data scienc pitfal 
At thi earli stage, it be typic to see 
differ and sometim contradictori 
view appear in variou communities. 
It be essenti to share and discu the 
myth and reality,24 memes,25 and pit- 
fall to ensur the healthi develop of 
the field. from observ about the 
relev communities, a well a expe- 
rienc and lesson learn in conduct- 
ing data scienc and analyt research, 
education, and services, sever myth 
and pitfal have emerged.

pitfal about data scienc 
concept 
typically, data scienc have be defin 
in term of specif disciplinari founda- 
tions, principles, goals, inputs, algo- 
rithm and models, processes, tools, 
outputs, applications, and professions. 
often, a fragment statement can caus 
debat and result in the phenomenon of 
“how do a blind person recogn an 
elephant?” here, we discu some com- 
mon argument and observations. 

data scienc be statistics,26,27 so one 
might argue, “whi do we need data 
scienc when we’v have statist for 
centuries?”28 or “how do data sci- 
enc realli differ from statistics?”25 
data scienc provid systematic, holis- 
tic, and multidisciplinari solut for 
learn explicit and implicit insight 
and intellig from complex and 
large-scal data and gener evid 
or indic from data by undertak 
diagnostic, descriptive, predictive, and 
prescript analytics, in addit to 
support other task on data, such a 
comput and manag 

other might ask, “whi do we need 
data scienc when inform scienc 
and data engin have be explor 
for mani years?” but consid the issu 
face in relat area by the enorm 
of the task and the parallel exampl of 
enabl a blind person to recogn an 
anim a larg a an elephant. informa- 
tion scienc and data engin alon 
cannot achiev this. other aspect may 
be learn from the discuss about 
great or few statistics.14 

anoth object ion could come 
from those who have be do data 
analysi for decad and who believ 
that data scienc have noth new to 
offer them. We would counter that 
classic data analysi and technolog 
focu mostli on explicit observ 
analysi and hypothesi test on 
small and simpler data. 

other might wonder whether data 
scienc be old wine in a new bottle, or 

what new grand challeng be fore- 
ground by data science. analysi of 
the gap between exist develop 
and data science’ potenti (see figur 2) 
show that mani opportun exist to 
fill the theoret gap when data com- 
plexiti extend significantli beyond 
the level that can be handl by state- 
of-the-art theori and systems. for ex- 
ample, classic statist and analyt 
theori and system be not design 
to handl non-iidness12 in complex 
real-lif systems. 

It be also worth note attent that 
the term big data, data science, and 
advanc analyt be often overli 
use or improperli used. most googl 
search on these keyword return re- 
sult that be irrelev to their intrins 
semant and scope, or simpli repeat 
familiar argument about the need of 
data scienc and exist phenomena. 
In mani such findings, big data be de- 
scribe a be simple, data scienc 
have noth to do with the scienc of 
data, and advanc analyt be the 
same a classic data analysi and infor- 
mation processing. there be a lack of 
deep think and explor of why, 
what, and how these new term should 
be defined, developed, and applied. 

these observ illustr that 
data scienc be still young. they also 
justifi the urgent need to develop sound 
terminology, standards, a code of con- 
duct, statement and definitions, theo- 
retic frameworks, and good practic 
that will exemplifi typic data scienc 
profession practic and profiles. 

data volum pitfal 
variou pitfal surround data volume. 
for example, what make data “big”? It be 
usual not the volum but the complexi- 
ties5,7 and larg valu that make data big. 
whi be the big of data important? 
the big (refer to data scienc com- 
plexities) of data herald new opportuni- 
tie for theoretical, technological, practi- 
cal, and econom developments. 

some assum that big data refer to 
massiv volum of data, but actually, 
it refer mainli to signific data 
complexities. from the volum per- 
spective, a dataset be big when the size 
of the data itself becom a quintes- 
sential part of the problem. 

one might argue, “I do not have 
big data, so I cannot do big data re- 
search.” most research and practi- 
tioner do not have sizeabl amount 
of data and do not have access to big 
infrastructure, either. however, sig- 
nific research opportun still 
exist to creat fundament new the- 
ori and tool to address respect 
x-complex and x-intelligence. 

anoth idea we see be to collect data 
from all sourc in order to conduct big 
data analytics. actually, onli relev 
data be requir to achiev a specif an- 
alyt goal. A relat pitfal be the idea 
that it be good to have too much data 
than too little. although more data 
gener tend to present more op- 
portunities, the data amount need to 
be relev to the data need and the 
data manipul goals. whether big- 
ger be good depend on mani aspects. 

data infrastructur pitfal 
two pitfal be relat to data infra- 
structure. first, research who do 
not have big infrastructur might think 
they cannot do big data research. al- 
though big infrastructur be use or 
necessari for some big data tasks, theo- 
retic research on signific challeng 
might not requir big infrastructure. 
second, an organ will pur- 
chase a high-perform comput to 
support big data analytics, when mani 
big data analyt task can be do 
without one. We must also differenti 
between distribut and parallel com- 
put and hpc. 

analyt pitfal 
there be mani pitfal relat to ana- 
lytics. for example, consid the idea 



74 www.computer.org/intellig ieee intellig system 

that data-analyt think be crucial 
for data science. actually, it be not onli 
import for solv a specif problem, 
it be essenti for obtain a systemat 
solution. convert an organ to 
think data analyt be a critic com- 
petit advantag in the data era. 

analyst might think that their task 
be to develop common task frame- 
work and conduct inference29 from 
the particular to the general. In the 
real world, analyt be often specific. 
focus on certain common task 
framework could trigger incomplet 
or even mislead outcomes. As we 
discuss earlier, an analyst can take 
on other roles; predict model be 
typic problem specific. 

some research might trust the 
qualiti of model built in commerci 
analyt tool alone. however, such 
tool can produc mislead or even 
incorrect outcom if the assumpt 
of their theoret foundat do 
not fit the data. 

analyst often want to show “busi- 
ness people” some of their statist 
signific findings. but a domain- 
driven data mine shows,10 mani out- 
come be often statist signific 
but be not actionable. An evalu 
of those find need to be conduct 
to discov what busi impact30 
might be gener if the find they 
gener be operationalized. analyst 
may also wonder whi they cannot un- 
derstand and interpret the outcomes. 
thi could be becaus the problem have 
be misstated, the model be invalid for 
the data, or the data use be not rele- 
vant or correct. 

anoth pitfal be when analyt 
report compris mani figur and 
tabl that summar the data min- 
ing outcomes, but the bo do not 
seem interest in them. analyt be 
not just about produc meaning- 
ful analyt outcom and reports; 
rather, it concern insights, recommen- 
dations, and commun with 

upper manag for decis mak- 
ing and action. 

finally, there be the argument that data 
scienc and analyt project be just 
other kind of IT projects. although data 
project share mani similar aspect to 
mainstream IT projects, certain distinc- 
tive featur in data, the manipul 
process, delivery, and especi the ex- 
ploratori natur of data scienc and ana- 
lytic project requir differ strategies, 
procedures, and treatments. data scienc 
project be more exploratory, ad hoc, 
decis oriented, and intellig driven. 

pitfal about capabl and role 
other pitfal concern the individ- 
ual—for example, “I be a data sci- 
entist.” lately, it seem that everyon 
have suddenli becom a data scientist. 
most data scientist simpli conduct 
normal data engin and descrip- 
tive analytics. Do not expect omnipo- 
tenc from data scientists. 

when an organ want to do 
big data analytics, it might seek rec- 
ommend of phd graduates. al- 
though data scienc and advanc 
analyt task usual benefit from 
the input of phds, an organ re- 
quir differ role and competen- 
cie accord to the matur level of 
the analyt and the organization. 

anoth organ might boast 
that it data scienc team compris 
a group of data scientists. however, 
an effect data scienc team could 
consist of statisticians, programmers, 
physicists, artists, social scientists, deci- 
sion makers, or even entrepreneurs. 

finally, there be the argument that a 
data scientist be a statist program- 
mer. although thi be true, in addit to 
the core skill of cod and statistics, 
a data scientist need to handl mani 
other matters.4 

other matter 
some addit matter requir care- 
ful consider in conduct data 

scienc and analytics. I list a few of 
the common remarks, with my com- 
ment in parentheses: 

• garbag in, garbag out. (the qual- 
iti of data determin the qualiti of 
output.) 

• more complex data and a more ad- 
vanc model lead to good outcomes. 
(good data do not necessarili 
lead to good outcomes, nor do a 
good model.) 

• analyt aim to support decision- 
make actions, not just to present 
outcom about data understand 
and analyt results. (thi address 
the need for action knowledg de- 
livery9 to recommend action from 
data analyt for decis support.) 

• mani end user be invest in 
big data infrastructur without 
project management. (do not rush 
into data infrastructur invest 
without a solid strateg plan of 
your data scienc initiatives, which 
requir the identif of busi- 
ness need and requirements, the 
definit of reason objectives, 
the specif of timelines, and 
the alloc of resources.) 

• push data scienc forward with- 
out suitabl talent. (on one hand, you 
should not simpli wait for the right 
candid to come along, but should 
activ plan and specifi the skill 
need for your organization’ initia- 
tive and assembl a team accord 
to the skillset required. On the other 
hand, get the right peopl on board 
be critical, becaus data scienc be essen- 
tialli about intellig and talent.) 

• know noth about the data be- 
fore appli a model. (under- 
stand the data be a must-do step 
befor a model be applied.) 

• Do not assum the data you be give 
be perfect. (data qualiti form the basi 
of obtain good models, outcomes, 
and decisions. poor qualiti data, the 
same a poor qualiti models, can lead 



september/octob 2016 www.computer.org/intellig 75 

to mislead or damag decisions. 
real-lif data often contain imper- 
fect featur such a incompleteness, 
uncertainty, bias, rareness, imbalance, 
and non-iidness.) 

thi be just a partial list of the re- 
main pitfal in conduct data 
scienc and analytics. 

As part of thi comprehens review 
of data science,4,5,31 I hope that the 
discuss about the natur and pit- 
fall of data scienc in thi articl will 
stimul deep and intrins discuss 
about what make data scienc a new 
scienc and what make it valuabl for 
research, innovation, the economy, ser- 
vices, and professionals.
