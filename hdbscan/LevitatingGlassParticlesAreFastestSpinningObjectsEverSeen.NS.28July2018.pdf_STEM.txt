levit glass particl be fast spin object ever 
see 

tini glass particl spun by a laser be the fast spin object we have ever seen. 

two team have use circularli polaris light to set charg particl in motion. As thi light travels, it spin 
and can impart rotat energi to matter. 

rené reimann at the swiss feder institut of technolog in zurich and team trap a silicon dioxid 
particl in a polaris laser. drag from air particl be remov by lower the pressure, let the silicon 
dioxid spin more than 1 billion time a second (arxiv.org/abs/1803.11160). 

tongcang Li at purdu university, indiana, lead anoth team do similar work. they also use glass 
nanoparticles, but two stuck togeth for strength. He and hi team measur them rotat at 1.3 gigahertz, 
or 1.3 billion time a second (arxiv.org/abs/1804.06570). 

advertis 

these rotat particl may help u detect quantum friction – drag creat by photon blink in and out of 
exist – and tell u more about the origin of the cosmos: spin particl may be the sourc of gigahertz 
signal in the cosmic microwav background left by the big bang. 

thi articl appear in print under the headlin “glass make to spin at dizzi speed”
