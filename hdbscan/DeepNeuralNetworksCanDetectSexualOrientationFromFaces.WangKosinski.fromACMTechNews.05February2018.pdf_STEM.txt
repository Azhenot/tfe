deep neural network can detect sexual orient from face

abstract 30 

We show that face contain much more inform about sexual orient than can be 31 

perceiv and interpret by the human brain. We use deep neural network to extract featur 32 

from 35,326 facial images. these featur be enter into a logist regress aim at 33 

classifi sexual orientation. given a singl facial image, a classifi could correctli distinguish 34 

between gay and heterosexu men in 81% of cases, and in 71% of case for women. human 35 

judg achiev much low accuracy: 61% for men and 54% for women. the accuraci of the 36 

algorithm increas to 91% and 83%, respectively, give five facial imag per person. facial 37 

featur employ by the classifi includ both fix (e.g., nose shape) and transient facial 38 

featur (e.g., groom style). consist with the prenat hormon theori of sexual 39 

orientation, gay men and woman tend to have gender-atyp facial morphology, expression, 40 

and groom styles. predict model aim at gender alon allow for detect gay male 41 

with 57% accuraci and gay femal with 58% accuracy. those find advanc our 42 

understand of the origin of sexual orient and the limit of human perception. 43 

additionally, give that compani and govern be increasingli use comput vision 44 

algorithm to detect people’ intim traits, our find expos a threat to the privaci and safeti 45 

of gay men and women. 46

deep neural network be more accur than human at detect sexual orient from facial 51 

imag 52 

the scienc of judg one’ charact from their facial characteristics, or physiognomy, 53 

date back to ancient china and greec (jenkinson, 1997). aristotl and pythagora be among 54 

it disciples, and the latter use to select hi student base on their facial featur (riedweg, 55 

2005). such belief have persist and grown in popular over the centuries. robert fitzroy, 56 

the captain of the beagle, believ that darwin’ nose reveal a lack of energi and 57 

determination, and be close to bar him from the histor voyag (glaser, 2002). cesar 58 

lombroso, the founder of crimin anthropology, believ that crimin could be identifi by 59 

their facial features. He claimed, for example, that arsonist have a “soft of skin, an almost 60 

childlik appearance, and an abund of thick straight hair that be almost feminine” 61 

(lombroso, 1911, p. 51). By the eighteenth century, physiognomi “wa not mere a popular fad 62 

but also the subject of intens academ debat about the promis it held for futur progress” 63 

(porter, 2003, p. 497). 64 

physiognomi be now universally, and rightly, reject a a mix of superstit and racism 65 

disguis a scienc (jenkinson, 1997). due to it legacy, studi or even discuss the link 66 

between facial featur and charact becom taboo, lead to a widespread presumpt that no 67 

such link exist. however, there be mani demonstr mechan that impli the opposite. 68 

such mechan can be arrang into three groups. first, there be much evid that charact 69 

can influenc one’ facial appear (e.g., lõhmus, sundström, & björklund, 2009; zebrowitz 70 

& collins, 1997). for example, woman that score high on extrovers earli in life tend to 71 

becom more attract with age (zebrowitz, collins, & dutta, 1998). second, facial appear 72 

can alter one’ character. facial appear drive first impress of others, influenc our 73 



deep neural network can detect sexual orient from face 

4 

expect and behavior toward them, which, in turn, shape their charact (berry, 1991; 74 

berri & brownlow, 1989; penton-voak, pound, little, & perrett, 2006; todorov, said, engell, & 75 

oosterhof, 2008; zebrowitz & collins, 1997; zebrowitz et al., 1998). good-look people, for 76 

example, receiv more posit social feedback, and thu tend to becom even more extrovert 77 

(lukaszewski & roney, 2011). finally, there be a broad rang of factor affect both facial 78 

appear and one’ traits. those includ pre- and post-nat hormon level (jone et al., 79 

2015; lefevre, lewis, perrett, & penke, 2013; whitehous et al., 2015), development histori 80 

(astley, stachowiak, clarren, & clausen, 2002), environment factors, and gene express 81 

(ferri et al., 2014). testosteron levels, for instance, significantli affect both: behavior (e.g., 82 

dominance) and facial appear (e.g., facial-width-to-height-ratio; lefevr et al., 2014). 83 

the exist of such link between facial appear and charact be support by the 84 

fact that peopl can accur judg others’ character, psycholog states, and demograph 85 

trait from their face (zebrowitz, 1997). for example, we can easili and accur identifi 86 

others’ gender, age, race, or emot state—even from a glimps of their face (brown & 87 

perrett, 1993; macra & bodenhausen, 2000; robert & bruce, 1988). peopl also judge, with 88 

some minim accuracy, others’ polit view (e.g., rule & ambady, 2010; samochowiec, 89 

wänke, & fiedler, 2010), honesti (e.g., bond, berry, & omar, 1994), person (e.g., 90 

borkenau, brecke, möttig, & paelecke, 2009), sexual orient (e.g., rule & ambady, 2008), 91 

or even the likelihood of win an elect (e.g., ballew & todorov, 2007; little, burriss, 92 

jones, & roberts, 2007; todorov, mandisodza, goren, & hall, 2005). such judgment be not 93 

veri accurate, but be common and spontaneous. importantly, the low accuraci of human when 94 

judg charact from others’ face do not necessarili mean that relev cue be not 95 

promin displayed. instead, peopl may lack the abil to detect or interpret them. It be 96 



deep neural network can detect sexual orient from face 

5 

possibl that some of our intim trait be promin display on the face, even if other 97 

cannot perceiv them. here, we test thi hypothesi use modern comput vision algorithms. 98 

recent progress in AI and comput vision have be larg driven by the widespread 99 

adopt of deep neural network (dnn), or neural network compos of a larg number of 100 

hidden layer (lecun, bengio, & hinton, 2015). dnn mimic the neocortex by simul large, 101 

multi-level network of interconnect neurons. dnn excel at recogn pattern in large, 102 

unstructur data such a digit images, sound, or text, and analyz such pattern to make 103 

predictions. dnn be increasingli outperform human in visual task such a imag 104 

classification, facial recognition, or diagnos skin cancer (esteva et al., 2017; lecun et al., 105 

2015; Lu & tang, 2014). the superior perform of dnn offer an opportun to identifi 106 

link between characterist and facial featur that might be miss or misinterpret by the 107 

human brain. 108 

We test our hypothesi on a specif intim trait: sexual orientation. We chose thi 109 

trait for three main reasons. first, it be an intim psycho–demograph trait that cannot be easili 110 

detect by others. while peopl can detect others’ sexual orient from both neutral and 111 

express face (rule & ambady, 2008; tskhay & rule, 2015), or even from a singl facial 112 

featur such a the mouth, eyes, or hair (lyons, lynch, brewer, & bruno, 2014; rule, macrae, 113 

& ambady, 2009), the accuraci of such judgment be veri limited, rang from 55 to 65% 114 

(ambady, hallahan, & conner, 1999; lyon et al., 2014; rule et al., 2009). the link between 115 

facial featur and sexual orientation, however, may be strong than what meet the human eye. 116 



deep neural network can detect sexual orient from face 

6 

recent evid show that gay men and lesbians,1 who arguabl have more experi and 117 

motiv to detect the sexual orient of others, be margin more accur than 118 

heterosexu (brambilla, riva, & rule, 2013). 119 

second, the wide accept prenat hormon theori (pht) of sexual orient 120 

predict the exist of link between facial appear and sexual orientation. accord to the 121 

pht, same-gend sexual orient stem from the underexposur of male fetu or 122 

overexposur of femal fetu to androgen that be respons for sexual differenti (allen 123 

& gorski, 1992; jannini, blanchard, camperio-ciani, & bancroft, 2010; udri & chantala, 124 

2006). As the same androgen be respons for the sexual dimorph of the face, the pht 125 

predict that gay peopl will tend to have gender-atyp facial morpholog (bulygina, 126 

mitteroecker, & aiello, 2006; rhodes, 2006; whitehous et al., 2015). accord to the pht, 127 

gay men should tend to have more feminin facial featur than heterosexu men, while lesbian 128 

should tend to have more masculin featur than heterosexu women. thus, gay men be 129 

predict to have small jaw and chins, slimmer eyebrows, longer noses, and larg foreheads; 130 

the opposit should be true for lesbians. furthermore, a prenat androgen level also drive the 131 

sexual differenti of behavior and prefer dure adulthood (meyer-bahlburg, 1984; 132 

udry, 2000), the pht predict that gay peopl may tend to adopt gender-atyp facial 133 

adornments, expressions, and groom styles. such gender-atyp behavior and prefer 134 




1 follow the apa’ recommendation, the term “gay” be use to refer to same-gend 

sexual orientation.

might also be encod in gay culture, further amplifi the effect of the prenat androgen 135 

levels. 136 

previou empir evid provid mix support for the gender typic of facial 137 

featur of gay men and women. huge and bremm (2011) studi a sampl of 60 imag of 138 

gay men and conclud that gay men had, on average, more feminin facial features. lyon et al. 139 

(2014) ask 120 human judg to rate the masculin and feminin of 80 face of men and 140 

women. they found that on average, heterosexu woman and gay men be rat a more 141 

feminin and less masculin than lesbian and heterosexu men. however, skorska, geniole, 142 

vrysen, mccormick, and bogaert (2015) use a sampl of 390 photograph of men and women, 143 

and found that both lesbian and gay men have more masculin face than heterosexu woman 144 

and men, respectively. valentova, kleisner, havlíček, and neustupa (2014, p. 353) use a sampl 145 

of facial imag of 40 gay and 40 heterosexu men, and found that on average, gay men have 146 

rel wider and shorter faces, small and shorter noses, and larg and more round jaws, 147 

or “a mosaic of both feminin and masculin features.” such mix find might be attribut 148 

to the difficulti of precis defin and measur facial femininity. they might also be 149 

attribut to the fact that the differ between gay and heterosexu face may be too subtl to 150 

be reliabl detect in the small sampl employ in these studies. thi studi aim to address 151 

those limit by use a much larg sampl size and data-driven methods, includ an 152 

algorithm-bas measur of facial femininity. 153 

finally, the predict of sexual orient could have seriou and even life-154 

threaten implic to gay men and woman and the societi a a whole. In some cultures, 155 

gay men and woman still suffer physic and psycholog abus at the hand of governments, 156 

neighbors, and even their own families. perhap due to discrimin and stigmatization, gay 157 



deep neural network can detect sexual orient from face 

8 

peopl be also at a high risk of depression, suicide, self-harm, and substanc abus (king et 158 

al., 2008). consequently, their well-b and safeti may depend on their abil to control when 159 

and to whom to reveal their sexual orientation. press report suggest that govern and 160 

corpor be develop and deploy face-bas predict tool aim at intim psycho–161 

demograph traits, such a the likelihood of commit a crime, or be a terrorist or 162 

pedophil (chin & lin, 2017; lubin, 2016). the law in mani countri crimin same-163 

gender sexual behavior, and in eight countries—includ iran, mauritania, saudi arabia, and 164 

yemen—it be punish by death (un human right council, 2015). It be thu critic to inform 165 

policymakers, technolog compani and, most importantly, the gay community, of how accur 166 

face-bas predict might be. 167 

thi work examin whether an intim psycho–demograph trait, sexual orientation, be 168 

display on human face beyond what can be perceiv by humans. We address thi question 169 

use a data-driven approach. A dnn be use to extract featur from the facial imag of 170 

35,326 gay and heterosexu men and women. these featur be enter (separ for each 171 

gender) a independ variabl into a cross-valid logist regress model aim at 172 

predict self-report sexual orientation. the result classif accuraci offer a proxi 173 

for the amount of inform relev to the sexual orient display on human faces. We 174 

also explor the featur employ by the classifi and examin whether, a predict by the 175 

pht, the face of gay men and woman tend to be gender atypical. furthermore, we compar the 176 

accuraci of the comput algorithm with that of human judges. human accuraci do not onli 177 

provid a baselin for interpret the algorithm’ accuracy, but it also help to examin whether 178 

the nonstandard facial imag use here be not more reveal of sexual orient than 179 

standard facial imag take in a control environment. finally, use an independ 180

sampl of gay men’ facial images, we test the extern predict valid of the classifi 181 

develop here. 182 

studi 1a: use deep neural network to detect sexual orient 183 

In studi 1a, we show that a dnn can be use to identifi sexual orient from facial 184 

images. previou studi link facial featur with sexual orient use either imag of 185 

neutral2 face take in a laboratori (e.g., skorska et al., 2015; valentova et al., 2014) or self-186 

take imag obtain from onlin date websit (e.g., hugh & bremme, 2011; lyon et al., 187 

2014; rule & ambady, 2008; rule, ambady, adams, & macrae, 2008). We employ the latter 188 

approach, a such imag can be collect in larg numbers, from more repres samples, 189 

and at a low cost (from the perspect of both the particip and researchers). larger and 190 

more repres samples, in turn, enabl the discoveri of phenomenon that might not have 191 

be appar in the smaller, lab-bas samples. additionally, use self-taken, easili access 192 

digit facial imag increas the ecolog valid of our results, which be particularli 193 

import give their critic privaci implications. 194 

imag take and upload by the particip have a number of potenti drawbacks. 195 

they may vari in quality, facial expression, head orientation, and background. furthermore, 196 




2 We believ that no face can be truli “neutral.” peopl may systemat differ in the 

express that they adopt when instruct to “adopt a neutral expression.” furthermore, even an 

imag of a perfectli neutral face (e.g., take under anesthesia) would still contain trace of 

typic adopt express (e.g., laugh lines), groom style (e.g., skin health), and one’ 

environ (e.g., tan).

give that they be origin post on a date website, they might be especi reveal of 197 

sexual orientation. We take sever step to mitig the influenc of such factors. first, the facial 198 

featur be extract use a dnn that be specif develop to focu on non-transi 199 

facial features, disregard the head’ orient and the background. second, studi 1b 200 

investig the area of the face employ by the classifi and show that the classifi focu 201 

on the face and do not reli on the background. third, studi 1c and 2 explor the facial 202 

featur use by the classifi and show that they be consist with the theori (pht). fourth, 203 

studi 3 and 4 show that the imag use here be not substanti more reveal of sexual 204 

orient than imag of neutral face take in a control set or imag obtain from 205

method 207 

facial images. We obtain facial imag from public profil post on a u.s. date 208 

website. We record 130,741 imag of 36,630 men and 170,360 imag of 38,593 woman 209 

between the age of 18 and 40, who report their locat a the u.s. gay and heterosexu 210 

peopl be repres in equal numbers. their sexual orient be establish base on the 211 

gender of the partner that they be look for (accord to their profiles). 212

next, we employ amazon mechan turk (amt) worker to verifi that the face 234 

be adult, caucasian, fulli visible, and of a gender that match the one report on the user’ 235

finally, we randomli remov some user to balanc the age distribut of the sexual 239

tabl 1 for details). facial imag be crop use the facial frame provid by face++ (the 242 

blue box in figur 1), and resiz to 224 x 224 pixels. 243 

extract facial featur use a deep neural network. facial featur be extract 244 

from the imag use a wide employ dnn, call vgg-face (parkhi, vedaldi, & 245 

zisserman, 2015). vgg-face be origin develop (or trained) use a sampl of 2.6 million 246 

imag for the purpos of facial recognit (i.e., recogn a give person across differ 247 

images). vgg-face be similar to tradit score key accompani psychometr tests. A 248 

tradit score key can be use to convert respons to test question into one or more 249 

psychometr scores, such a a singl IQ score, or a set of five big five person scores. vgg-250 

face translat a facial imag into 4,096 score subsum it core features. unfortunately, unlik 251 

psychometr scores, vgg-face score be not easili interpretable. A singl score might 252 

subsum differ in multipl facial featur typic consid to be distinct by human 253 

(e.g., nose shape, skin tone, or eye color). 254 

vgg-face offer two main advantag in the context of thi study. first, success facial 255 

recognit depend on the dnn’ abil to detect facial featur that be unlik to vari across 256 

images. thus, vgg-face aim at repres a give face a a vector of score that be a 257 

unaffect a possibl by facial expression, background, lighting, head orientation, imag 258 

properti such a bright or contrast, and other factor that can vari across differ imag 259 

of the same person. consequently, employ vgg-face score enabl u to minim the role 260 

of such transient featur when distinguish between gay and heterosexu faces. second, 261 

employ a dnn train on a differ sampl and for a differ purpose, reduc the risk of 262 

overfit (i.e., discov differ between gay and heterosexu face that be specif to 263 



deep neural network can detect sexual orient from face 

14 

our sampl rather than universal). We also tri train a custom dnn directli on the imag in 264 

our sample; it accuraci be somewhat higher, but it expos u to the risk of overfitting. 265 

train classifiers. We use a simpl predict model, logist regression, combin 266 

with a standard dimensionality-reduct approach: singular valu decomposit (svd). svd be 267 

similar to princip compon analysi (pca), a dimensionality-reduct approach wide use 268 

by social scientists. the model be train separ for each gender. 269 

self-report sexual orient (gay/heterosexual) be use a a depend variable; 270 

4,096 scores, extract use vgg-face, be use a independ variables. To prevent 271 

overfitting, we use a 20-fold cross-valid when estim the predictions. the sampl be 272 

split into 20 subsamples; one of the subsampl (test set) be put aside, while the remain 19 273 

subsampl (train sets) be use to train the predict model. As the number of independ 274 

variabl be rel larg (4,096) when compar with the number of number of case (7,083 275 

in the small train set), we use svd to extract n=500 dimensions4 from the independ 276 

variables. thi help to reduc the number of independ variabl and elimin redund 277 

information. 278 

A logist regress model be train to classifi sexual orient (a depend 279 

variable) use 500 singular valu extract from vgg-face score (independ variables). 280 

least absolut shrinkag and select oper (lasso; hastie, tibshirani, & friedman, 2009) 281 

be use for variabl select and regular when train the regress model. the 282 




4 dimens extract by svd be refer to a singular values; they be an equival 

of princip compon in the context of pca.

15 

lasso penalti paramet a be set to 1; the regular paramet λ be automat 283 

estim use 10-fold cross-validation. 284 

finally, the model built on the train set, combin the svd dimension reduct 285 

and logist regression, be use to predict the sexual orient of the particip in the test 286 

set. thi procedur be repeat 20 time to assign a probabl (rang from 0 to 1) of be 287 

gay to all imag in the sample. 288 

for mani users, more than one facial imag be available. thi enabl u to examin 289 

how the accuraci chang with the number of facial imag available. To produc an aggreg 290 

probabl of be gay base on n images, the probabl associ with a randomli select 291 

set of n imag (rang from 1 to 5) of a give particip be averaged.5 thus, a particip 292 

with three facial imag be describ by three probabl of be gay: one base on a singl 293 

randomli select image, one base on two randomli select images, and one base on all 294

studi 2: gender atyp of gay people’ face 396 

the qualit analysi of the composit face and averag landmarks’ locat for gay 397 

and heterosexu face present in studi 1c suggest that the face of gay men and lesbian tend 398 

to be gender atypical. We test thi hypothesi by use a data-driven measur of facial 399 

femininity: the dnn-base gender classifier. 400 

method 401 

facial images. We use facial imag and accompani probabl of be gay 402 

estim in studi 1a. 403 

facial femininity. We measur facial feminin by use a gender classifi that 404 

assign a probabl of be femal to each facial image. thi gender classifi be develop 405 

on an independ sampl of 2,891,355 facial imag of facebook user obtain from the 406 

mypersonality.org project (kosinski, matz, gosling, popov, & stillwell, 2015). We use the 407 

same approach to preprocess facial imag and train the classifier, a describ in studi 1a. thi 408 

time, however, we use gender a the depend variable. thi gender classifi be appli to 409 

all facial imag in the sampl use in studi 1a. the accuraci of thi classifier, when predict 410 

gender, equal auc = .98. 411 

result 412 

the result show that the face of gay men be more feminin and the face of lesbian 413 

be more masculin than those of their respect heterosexu counterparts. among men, the 414 

data-driven measur of facial feminin posit correl with the probabl of be gay (r 415

facial feminin alon allow for classifi gay and heterosexu face with some 418

studi 3: morphology-bas classifi 420 

studi 1c show the differ between the outlin of face and facial featur of gay 421 

and heterosexu individuals. the current studi show that such basic non-transi 422 

morpholog features, such a the outlin of the nose or facial contour, provid enough 423 

inform to accur classifi sexual orientation. 424 

method 425 

facial images. We use the same sampl a in studi 1a. 426 

extract morpholog features. We extract morpholog featur from the 427 

coordin of the 83 landmark outlin import facial featur provid by face++ (see 428 

figur 1). To subsum the shape of a give facial feature, such a the nose, we comput 429 

euclidean distanc between the landmark belong to that feature. for example, a there be 430 

10 landmark outlin the nose (see figur 1), it morpholog be subsum by a vector of 10 431 

x 9 = 90 euclidean distances. To account for the differ size of the face in facial images, the 432 

distanc be normal by divid them by the distanc between the pupils. 433 




7 pearson product-mo correl be used. probabl be logit transformed.

25 

thi approach be appli to the follow facial elements: nose, eyes, eyebrows, mouth, 434 

contour of the face, and entir face (see figur 1 for the map between landmark and facial 435 

elements). 436 

train classifiers. the classifi be trained, separ for each facial element and 437 

for all facial landmark combined, follow a procedur similar to the one use in studi 1a. 438 

here, however, we use euclidean distanc instead of the vgg-face score a independ 439 

variables. If the number of distanc describ a give facial element be high than 500, we 440 

use svd to reduc their number to 500 (in the same way a svd be use to reduc the 441 

number of vgg-face score in studi 1a). 442 

result 443 

the accuraci of the landmark-bas classifi base on five imag per person be 444 

present in figur 5. the result show that the shape of individu facial element enabl high 445 

classif accuraci for both genders. A notabl high accuraci be provid by facial contour 446 

alon (red landmark in figur 1): 75% for men and 63% for women. thi provid addit 447 

support for the link between jaw shape between gay and heterosexu face observ in studi 1c 448 

(see figur 4). while the outlin of the eyes, eyebrows, and mouth is—to some extent—affect 449 

by facial express and grooming, facial contour be rel inflexible, emphas the 450 

predict power of fix morpholog traits. 451 

the high perform of the contour-bas classifiers, and fair perform of the nose-452 

base ones, suggest that the shape of these (rel fixed) facial element be suffici to detect 453 

sexual orientation. overall, the perform of the landmark-bas classifi be remark 454 

give how littl inform from the origin imag be retain in the landmarks’ locations. 455

studi 4: human judg 461 

studi 1a show that sexual orient can be accur determin from non-462 

standard facial imag use a dnn. studi 3 show that even the most basic non-transi 463 

morpholog features, such a the shape of the contour of the face, provid suffici 464

We test thi hypothesi by employ a sexual orient classifi of know accuracy: 468 

human judges.8 We show that the accuraci of the human judges, who be present with the 469

reveal of sexual orientation. finally, it demonstr that the facial imag use in our studi 488 

be not unusu reveal of sexual orient (at least to humans). 489 

studi 5: beyond date websit facial imag 490 

thi studi show that the accuraci of the dnn-base classifi train in studi 1a be not 491 

limit to facial imag collect on a date website, but could also correctli classifi facial 492 

imag record in a differ environment: facebook. 493 

method 494 

facial images. We obtain a sampl of 14,438 facial imag of 6,075 openli gay men 495 

from the myperson databas (kosinski et al., 2015). gay male be identifi use two 496 

variables. first, we use the facebook audienc insight platform9 to identifi 50 facebook 497 

page most popular among gay men, includ page such as: “I love be gay,” “manhunt,” 498 

“gay and fabulous,” and “gay time magazine.” second, we use the “interest in” field of 499 

users’ facebook profiles, which reveal the gender of the peopl that a give user be interest in. 500 

male that indic an interest in other males, and that like at least two out of the 501 

predominantli gay facebook pages, be label a gay. among the gay men identifi in thi 502 

way, and for whom relationship data be available, 96% report that their signific other be 503 

male. unfortunately, we be not abl to reliabl identifi heterosexu facebook users. 504 

those imag be preprocess and their vgg-face score extract use the 505

match with two subsampl (of gay and heterosexu males) of facial imag use in studi 1a. 508 

those subsampl match the facebook sampl in both size and age distribution. 509 

result 510 

We appli the classifi train in studi 1a (employ the vgg-face score a an 511 

independ variable) to distinguish between the face of male gay facebook users, male 512 

heterosexu dating-websit users, and male gay dating-websit users. the classifi could 513 

accur distinguish between gay facebook user and heterosexu dating-websit user in 514 

74% of cases, but be virtual unabl to distinguish between gay facebook user and gay 515 

dating-websit user (53%). thi demonstr that the classifi train in studi 1a can 516 

correctli identifi facial imag of gay men obtain in a differ environment. It also show 517 

that thi classifi be larg insensit to the origin of the image, a it be unabl to distinguish 518 

between gay facebook user and gay date websit users. 519 

gener discuss 520 

the find report in thi work show that our face contain more inform about 521 

sexual orient than can be perceiv or interpret by the human brain. studi 1a show that 522 

facial featur extract by a dnn can be use to accur identifi the sexual orient of 523 

both men and women. studi 1b show that the predict be base on the facial area and not 524 

the background. studi 1c reveal that the face of gay men and lesbian have gender-atyp 525 

features, a predict by the pht. thi be corrobor by the result of studi 2 show that 526 

the probabl of be gay be posit correl with facial feminin among male and 527 

neg correl with femal facial femininity. the high accuraci of the classifi base on 528 

the shape of facial elements, present in studi 3, confirm that much of the inform about 529 

sexual orient be retain in fix facial features, such a the facial contour or shape of the 530 



deep neural network can detect sexual orient from face 



30 

nose. studi 4 reveal that the non-standard facial imag use in studi 1a be not 531 

especi reveal of sexual orientation—at least to human judges, whose accuraci be the 532 

same a in previou studies, some of which employ imag of neutral face take in a care 533 

control environment. studi 5 further corrobor these result by show that the dnn-534 

base classifi develop in studi 1a perform similarli when present with facial imag of 535 

gay men collect in a differ environment. 536 

our result provid strong support for the pht, which argu that same-gend sexual 537 

orient stem from the underexposur of male fetu and overexposur of femal fetu to 538 

prenat androgen respons for the sexual differenti of faces, preferences, and behavior 539 

(allen & gorski, 1992; jannini et al., 2010; udri & chantala, 2006). consist with the 540 

predict of the pht, gay men’ and gay women’ face be gender atypical—in term of 541 

both fix (e.g., nose shape) and transient facial featur (e.g., groom style). some of the 542 

differ between gay and heterosexu individuals, such a the shape of the nose or jaw, be 543 

most like driven by development factors. In other cases, natur and nurtur be like to be a 544 

intertwin a in mani other contexts. for example, it be unclear whether gay men be less 545 

like to wear a beard becaus of natur (sparser facial hair) or nurtur (fashion). If it is, in fact, 546 

fashion (nurture), to what extent be such a norm driven by the tendenc of gay men to have 547 

sparser facial hair (nature)? alternatively, could sparser facial hair (nature) stem from potenti 548 

differ in diet, lifestyle, or environ (nurture)? interestingly, femal face seem to be less 549 

reveal of sexual orientation, suggest a weaker link between sexual orient and prenat 550 

androgen level among females, or larg fluiditi of their sexual orientation. 551 

identifi link between facial featur and psycholog trait by employ 552 

methodolog similar to the one use here could boost our understand of the origin and natur 553 



deep neural network can detect sexual orient from face 



31 

of a broad rang of psycholog traits, preferences, and psycholog processes. mani of the 554 

factor that can be approxim from human faces, such a pre- and post-nat hormon level 555 

(jone et al., 2015; lefevr et al., 2013; whitehous et al., 2015), development histori (astley 556 

et al., 2002), environment factors, and gene (ferri et al., 2014), be otherwis difficult to 557 

measure. identifi link between facial featur with know link to such factor and 558 

psycholog trait or behavior could provid a conveni avenu to gener hypothesi that 559 

could be late verifi in experiment studies. We hope that futur research will explor the link 560 

between facial featur and other phenomena, such a personality, polit views, or 561 

psycholog conditions. 562 

importantly, we would like to warn our reader against misinterpret or 563 

overinterpret thi study’ findings. first, the fact that the face of gay men and lesbian are, on 564 

averag gender atypical, do not impli that all gay men be more feminin than all heterosexu 565 

men, or that there be no gay men with extrem masculin facial featur (and vice versa in the 566 

case of lesbians). the differ in feminin observ in thi studi be subtle, spread across 567 

mani facial features, and appar onli when examin averag imag of mani faces. 568 

second, our result in no way indic that sexual orient can be determin from face by 569 

humans. In fact, studi 4 confirm that human be rather inaccur when distinguish 570 

between facial imag of gay and homosexu individuals. finally, interpret classif 571 

accuraci be not trivial and be often counterintuitive. the auc = .91 do not impli that 91% of 572 

gay men in a give popul can be identified, or that the classif result be correct 91% 573 

of the time. the perform of the classifi depend on the desir trade-off between precis 574 

(e.g., the fraction of gay peopl among those classifi a gay) and recal (e.g., the fraction of 575 



deep neural network can detect sexual orient from face 



32 

gay peopl in the popul correctli identifi a gay). aim for high precis reduc 576 

recall, and vice versa. 577 

let u illustr thi trade-off in a simul scenario base on the result present in thi 578 

work. We simul a sampl of 1,000 men by randomli draw participants, and their 579 

respect probabl of be gay, from the sampl use in studi 1a. As the preval of 580 

same-gend sexual orient among men in the u.s. be about 6–7% (sell, wells, & wypij, 581 

1995), we drew 70 probabl from the gay participants, and 930 from the heterosexu 582 

participants. We onli consid particip for whom at least 5 facial imag be available; 583 

note that the accuraci of the classifi in their case reach an auc = .91. 584 

set the threshold abov which a give case should be label a be gay depend 585 

on a desir trade-off between precis and recall. To maxim precis (while sacrific 586 

recall), one should select a high threshold or select onli a few case with the high probabl 587 

of be gay. among 1% (i.e., 10) of individu with the high probabl of be gay in our 588 

simul sample, 9 be inde gay and 1 be heterosexual, lead to the precis of 90% 589 

(9/10 = 90%). thi means, however, that onli 9 out of 70 gay men be identified, lead to a 590 

low recal of 13% (9/70 = 13%). To boost recall, one need to sacrific some of the precision. 591 

among 30 individu with the high probabl of be gay, 23 be gay and 7 be 592 

heterosexu (precis = 23/30 = 77%; recal = 23/70 = 33%). among the top 100 male most 593 

like to be gay, 47 be gay (precis = 47%; recal = 68%). 594 

thi studi have a number of limitations. We use nonstandard imag character by 595 

vari quality, head orientation, or facial expression. thi provid for high ecolog 596 

valid and a larger, more repres sample, but also introduc confound (a discuss 597 

in studi 1a). additionally, a the imag be obtain from a date website, they might have 598

33 

be especi reveal of sexual orientation. We believ that we suffici address thi 599 

problem by employ a model specif train to focu on non-transi facial featur 600 

(studi 1a), by show that facial featur enabl the predict be consist with the 601 

theori (pht; studi 1c and 2), and by make sure that the imag use here be not 602 

substanti more reveal of sexual orient than imag of neutral face take in a 603 

control set (studi 4) or imag obtain from facebook (studi 5). anoth issu pertain 604 

to the qualiti of the ground truth: it be possibl that some of the user categor a heterosexu 605 

were, in fact, gay or bisexu (or vice versa). however, we believ that peopl voluntarili 606 

seek partner on the date websit have littl incent to misrepres their sexual 607 

orientation. furthermore, if some of the user were, in fact, wrongli labelled, correct such 608 

error would like boost the accuraci of the classifi examin here. additionally, despit our 609 

attempt to obtain a more divers sample, we be limit to studi white particip from 610 

the u.s. As the prejudic against gay peopl and the adopt of onlin date websit be 611 

unevenli distribut across group character by differ ethnicities, we could not find 612 

suffici number of non-whit gay participants. We believe, however, that our result will 613 

like gener beyond the popul studi here. they be consist with the pht of sexual 614 

orientation, which be support by varieti of studi of human and other mammal (hines, 615 

2010). As the exposur to gender-atyp androgen level be like to affect the face of peopl 616 

of differ race to a similar degree, it be like that their facial featur be equal reveal of 617 

sexual orientation. finally, it be possibl that individu with more discern gay face be 618 

more like to “come out.” If true, a classifi train on the face of openli gay user would be 619 

less accur when detect non-openli gay individuals. while we do not have data to test thi 620 

hypothesis, it must be note that come out depend on mani social, cultural, and legal factors. 621 



deep neural network can detect sexual orient from face 



34 

user who come out in our sampl may wish or need to maintain their privaci in mani context 622 

and places. thus, while some face might be less revealing, mani other may prevent their 623 

owner from control their privaci of sexual orientation. 624 

thi bring u to perhap the most critic nontheoret ramif of these findings: 625 

privacy. previou studi found that sexual orient can be detect from an individual’ 626 

digit footprints, such a social network structur (jernigan & mistree, 2009) or facebook like 627 

(kosinski, stillwell, & graepel, 2013). such digit footprints, however, can be hidden, 628 

anonymized, or distorted. one’ face, on the other hand, cannot be easili concealed. A facial 629 

imag can be easili take and analyz (e.g., with a smartphon or through cctv). facial 630 

imag of billion of peopl be also stockpil in digit and tradit archives, includ 631 

date platforms, photo-shar websites, and govern databases. such pictur be often 632 

easili accessible; facebook, linkedin, and googl plu profil pictures, for instance, be public 633 

by default and can be access by anyon on the internet. our find suggest that such publicli 634 

avail data and convent machin learn tool could be employ to build accur 635 

sexual orient classifiers. As much of the signal seem to be provid by fix morpholog 636 

features, such method could be deploy to detect sexual orient without a person’ consent 637 

or knowledge. moreover, the accuraci report here be unlik to constitut an upper limit of 638 

what be possible. employ imag of a high resolution, larg number of imag per person, 639 

larg train set, and more power dnn algorithm (e.g., he, zhang, ren, & sun, 2015) 640 

could further boost accuracy. 641 

some peopl may wonder if such find should be make public l they inspir the 642 

veri applic that we be warn against. We share thi concern. however, a the 643 

govern and compani seem to be alreadi deploy face-bas classifi aim at 644 



deep neural network can detect sexual orient from face 



35 

detect intim trait (chin & lin, 2017; lubin, 2016), there be an urgent need for make 645 

policymakers, the gener public, and gay commun awar of the risk that they might be 646 

face already. delay or abandon the public of these find could depriv 647 

individu of the chanc to take prevent measur and policymak the abil to introduc 648 

legisl to protect people. moreover, thi work do not offer ani advantag to those who may 649 

be develop or deploy classif algorithms, apart from emphas the ethic 650 

implic of their work. We use wide avail off-the-shelf tools, publicli avail data, 651 

and method well know to comput vision practitioners. We do not creat a privacy-invad 652 

tool, but rather show that basic and wide use method pose seriou privaci threats. We hope 653 

that our find will inform the public and policymakers, and inspir them to design 654 

technolog and write polici that reduc the risk face by homosexu commun across 655 

the world.10 656 

the grow digit of our life and rapid progress in AI continu to erod the 657 

privaci of sexual orient and other intim traits. policymak and technolog compani 658 

seem to believ that legisl and new technolog offer individu more control over their 659 

digit footprint can revers thi trend. however, the digit environ be veri difficult to 660 

police. data can be easili move across borders, stolen, or record without users’ consent. 661 

furthermore, even if user be give full control over their data, it be hard to imagin that they 662 

would not share anyth publicly. most peopl want some of their social medium posts, blogs, or 663 




10 the result report in thi paper be shared, in advance, with sever lead 

intern lgbtq organizations.

profil to be public. few would be will to cover their face while in the public. As thi and 664 

other studi show (e.g., kosinski et al., 2013), such willingli share digit footprint can be 665 

use to reveal intim traits. consequently, we believ that further eros of privaci be 666 

inevitable, and the safeti of gay and other minor who may be ostrac in some cultur 667 

hing on the toler of societi and governments. the postprivaci world will be a much 668 

safer and hospit place if inhabit by well-educated, toler peopl who be dedic to 669 

equal rights. 670
