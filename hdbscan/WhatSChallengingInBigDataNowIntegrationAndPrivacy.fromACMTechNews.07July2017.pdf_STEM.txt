what’ challeng in big data now: integr and privaci 
alex woodi 

it’ be say mani time before, but it’ worth state 

again: big data present larg opportun for 

improv busi and society, but it also involv 

sizabl comput challenges, a well a moral 

challenges. A panel of renown professor in the 

field expound on the obstacl block big data’ 

path forward dure a recent meet of the 

associ of comput machineri (acm). privaci 

and integr issu lead the way. 

In celebr of the 50th anniversari of the a.m. 

ture award, which be sometim call the “nobel prize of computing,” the acm conven a 

gather of some of the brightest mind in computing, includ michael stonebraker, an adjunct 

professor at mit’ comput scienc and artifici intellig laboratori (csail) and the 2014 

winner of the ture award. 

when ask what challeng big data repres in a super-connect world with 25 billion data- 

gener devices, stonebrak comment that two of the three “vs” have basic be 

solved. 

“if you have a volum problem and you’r interest sole in run sql-style busi 

intellig on a lot of data, in the data warehous market, there be at least a few dozen 

product petascal warehous that do exactli thi day in and day out,” say stonebraker, who 

creat the vertica mpp databas now sell by hpe. “[t]he volum problem be basic solv 

and shouldn’t get much harder in the future.” 

similarly, the data veloc problem be under control. “if you 

want to process a million messag a second, current stream 

process engin can do thi quit easily,” he said. “i’m not 

awar of anybodi that want to go faster than that….i don’t 

consid the veloc issu to be all that difficult.” 

but the third “v,” the one that pertain to variety, be a potenti 

deal-breaker, accord to stonebraker, who label it the 

800-lb. gorilla in the corner of the room. 

“a near a I can tell, [data variety] be what be caus 

problem for nearli everi major enterpris on the planet,” he 

said. “I think what be go to kill everybodi isn’t necessarili 

the number of connect devices, but the varieti of 

independently-construct data sourc that enterpris be 

go to want to put together. whether you’r talk about 

healthcare, manufacturing, or financi services, all of these 

independ structur databas be go to be a killer.” 

david blei, a professor at columbia univers and a winner 

of the acm-infosi 2013 foundat award, say there be 

great opportun to benefit from big data, but also some 

unmet challenges. 

“if you take the exampl of gene and diseases, it’ an import comput scienc and statist 

problem that’ unsolved,” blei said. “data scientist be look to answer how we take data that 

we observ from the world and use it to identifi causal connect between two variables.” 

deal with the uncertainti and bia that can aris from base conclus around 

correl be someth that all big data practition must tackle. it’ also someth that 

daphn koller, an adjunct professor of comput scienc at stanford univers and an acm- 

infosi 2007 foundat award, brought up dure the panel. 

“bia will alway be a challenge, and there isn’t a single, magic 

solution,” koller said. “the big question is, how do we 

disentangl correl from causation?…i’l turn to healthcar for 

an example: the gold standard in the medic state be that of 

random case control. In the case of web data, it’ call a/b 

testing—bas tech industri jargon for the same type of 

control.” 

although a/b test be not perfect a a random case control, 

it’ “about a good a tool a we’v be abl to develop for 

address some of the confounders,” she continued. 

“unfortunately, thi type of control be not feasibl in all cases.” 

where a/b test be not feasible, practition must take pain to 

ensur that “process [are] care scrutin to check for 

differ confound and to look for ani and all correl that 

give rise to the phenomenon be viewed,” she continued. “it’ a 

process that requir a lot of thought and a lot of care and cannot 

be overst in it importance.” 

while there be mani challeng with the data scienc and technic aspect of big data, there 

be also moral questions, a well a question of privacy. vipin kumar, the regent professor and 

william norri chair in larg scale comput at univers of minnesota, say these challeng 

come to a head in healthcare.

concern about possibl misus of these kind of 

information, such a discrimin in hire or in 

purchas health insurance, if thi inform be not 

handl properly. the healthcar commun be on the 

front line in thi area, but, give the complex of 

issu involved, progress in address these concern 

be veri slow.” 

big data have the potenti to help societi in massiv 

ways, but it will requir solv thorni privaci question 

that go right to the heart of the matter, stonebrak says. 

“privaci be a realli good big data question,” he says. 

“imagin thi simpl example: you show up at your 

doctor’ offic and have an x-ray do and you want the 

doctor to run a queri that show who els have x-ray 

that look like yours, what be their diagnosi and what 

be the morbid of the patients. that requir 

integr essenti the country’ entir onlin medic databas and presum would 

extend to multipl countri a well. 

“while that be a daunt data integr challenge, becaus 

everi hospit chain store it data with differ formats, 

differ encod for common terms, etc., the social valu 

gain from solv it be just huge,” stonebrak continues. 

“but that also creat an incred difficult privaci problem, 

one that I believ be not a technic issue. becaus by and 

large, if you’r look for an interest medic query, you’r 

not look for common events; you’r look for rare events, 

and at least to my knowledge, there aren’t ani technic 

solut that will allow access to rare event without indirectli 

disclos who in fact the event belong to.” 

We must find the right balanc between make data public 

and respect people’ privacy. it’ a question of “how public 

be too public,” say professor blei. 

“to me, we get the most bang for our buck if we make 

everyth public; however, that’ go to have some seriou 

secur and moral issu with it, so we shouldn’t do that,” 

the acm fellow said. “but make everyth complet 

privat and not benefit from that data also doesn’t seem 

like a great option. I think thi be a difficult, thorni issue. It life 

at the intersect of policy, philosophy, morality, comput 

science, data science, and machin learning.” 

there be no simpl answer to question like these. but consid the societ good that will 

come from solv them, it’ a challeng that must be undertaken.
