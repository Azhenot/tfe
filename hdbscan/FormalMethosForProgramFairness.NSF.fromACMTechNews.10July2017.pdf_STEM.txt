abstract 

As softwar permeat our person lives, corpor world, and bureaucracy, more and 
more of our critic decis be be deleg to opaqu algorithms. these algorithm 
have thu becom power arbitr of a rang of signific decis with far-reach 
societ impact. however, an algorithm carri out a sensit task could potenti 
discrimin ? advert or inadvert ? against certain groups. the overarch goal 
of thi project be to enabl autom reason about fair of such decision-mak 
programs. the result from thi project be integr in teach curricula, thu rais 
awar about fair in autom decis making. the project train graduat 
student in a uniqu and inter-disciplinari environment. 

thi project investig variou notion of fairness, inspir by the law and recent work 
in the area, and cast them through the formal len of program verification. the project 
develop techniqu for certifi that a program be fair under a give population, and 
techniqu for automat repair unfair program to make them fair. from a technic 
viewpoint, thi project develop novel probabilist program verif and synthesi 
technolog that, while focu on the problem of fairness, be gener and expand the 
reach of current technologies. specifically, the project develop novel probabilist
