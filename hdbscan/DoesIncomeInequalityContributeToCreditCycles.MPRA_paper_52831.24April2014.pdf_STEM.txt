abstract 

recent literatur have present argument link incom inequ on 
the financi crash of 2007 - 2009. one propos channel be expect to work 
through bank credit. We analyz the relationship between incom inequ 
and bank credit in panel cointegr framework, and find that they have a 
long-run depend relationship. result show that incom inequ have 
contribut to the increas of bank credit in develop economi after the 
second world war.

histor the most promin factor behind financi crisi have be the ab- 

normal growth of bank credit or leverag (gorton 2012; schularik and taylor 

2012). after the financi crisi of 2007-2009, the relat between incom in- 

equal and financi crisi have also becom under scrutiny. rajan (2010) argu

that rise inequ in develop economi caus redistribut in the form 

of subsid hous finance, which lead to a boom in mortgag and late to a 

crash with know consequences. iacoviello (2008) show that incom inequal- 

iti be the main driver of increas household debt in the unit state dure 

the 1980 and 1990 use a simul theoret model. kumhof and rancièr 

(2010) argu in their theoret model that there be a a long-run relationship be- 

tween inequ and credit, where high inequ lead to high level of bank 

loans. inequ rais the indebted of middle-incom and poor household 

a a result of consumpt smoothing. thi articl show that there be a long-run 

steady-st relationship between incom inequ and bank loan in develop 

economies, where inequ lead to high level of bank credit. 

In a recent article, bordo and meissner estim the effect of chang in in- 

come inequ on the growth of bank loan and find "veri littl evid link 

credit boom and financi crisi to rise inequality" (bordo and meissner 2012, 

p. 2148). atkinson and morelli (2011) find that there seem to be onli an ambigu- 

ou causal relat of chang in incom inequ on econom crises. atkin- 

son and morelli (2011, p. 48) conclud that "we have not investig whether 

inequ level be rel high befor identifi macroeconom shocks. 

therefore, the level hypothesi cannot be rule out at thi stage." 

atkinson and morelli (2011) refer to the hypothesis, where bank take high 

risk in extent to high incom inequ through securitization. but, the level 

of incom inequ also play a role in the model by kumhof and rancièr 

(2010). In the model investor (the top 5% of incom earners) own the whole 

stock of physic capit and deriv their incom from the physic capit and 

from interest on loan to workers. the bargain power between investor and 

worker determin the distribut of incom in the economy. In thi setup, de- 

2 



creas in the bargain power of worker lead to high incom inequ by 

lower the wage of workers, which induc high lend from investor a 

they have surplu fund to invest. the more the real incom of the worker drops, 

the more they have to borrow to maintain their level of consumption. thi cre- 

ate a trend relat between incom inequ and bank credit, where high 

incom incom inequ lead to high level of credit. however, incom in- 

equal tend to grow veri rapidli in the face of the decreas bargain power 

of workers, wherea leverage, or the debt-to-r incom ratio of worker tend 

to grow more steadily. the process of leverag be gradual becaus borrow 

match the decreas real incom of worker a they do not increas their con- 

sumption, but just tri to maintain their origin level consumption. that be whi 

short-run chang in incom inequ may not have an effect on the growth of 

bank credit. what matter for bank credit be the long-run, trend relationship 

between credit and incom inequality.1 

the analysi of thi possibl long-run relationship be complic by the fact 

that bank loan tend to grow over time, wherea the gener use measur of 

incom inequality, like the top 1% incom share, be bound from above. thi 

creat a problem, becaus it be not possibl for someth that be not trend 

to have a long-run equilibrium relat with someth that be upward trending, 

in the first two moment at least. there be two way around thi problem: the 

trend seri can be detrend or it can be bound use some suitabl trans- 

formation. detrend of the seri be problematic, becaus it will remov the veri 

thing under interest, that is, the trend. fortunately, there be a natur candid by 

which the seri can be transformed. the top 1% incom share measur the share 

of nation incom concentr on the hand of the high percentil of incom

incom inequ and financi stability.

earners. As gdp is, in practice, the nation incom of a country, the share can 

be present a incom of the top 1%gdp . therefore, it would be natur to convert bank 

loan the same way, i.e., bank loansgdp . thi transform would make the mea- 

sure comparable, a both would be express a a percentag of total income, 

or gdp, without remov the possibl long-run relationship that may exist be- 

tween inequ and credit. As explain above, household leverag be model 

a worker debt-to-incom ratio in the theoret model by kumhof and rancièr 

(2010). thus, credit-to-gdp ratio be also a more accur statist approxima- 

tion of the measur of leverag use by kumhof and ranciér than the level or the 

first differ of bank credit. 

In thi article, we test and estim the relationship of incom inequ and 

credit a ratio to real gdp. We use data on the incom share of top 1% incom 

earner and bank loan on eight develop economies. result indic that both 

the top 1% incom share and the share of credit be driven by stochast trends. 

the two seri be also found to be cointegr of order one impli that they 

have a long-run equilibrium relation. the long-run elast of the share of bank 

loan with respect to incom inequ be estim with panel dsur and it be 

found to be positive. top 1% incom share be also found to predict the share of 

credit, but not the other way around, use a granger non-caus test. 

the rest of the paper be organ a follows. section 2 present the data and 

give the result of panel unit root tests. result of estimations, cointegr and 

granger non causal test be report in section 3, and section 4 concludes. 

2 data and unit root test 

the annual data on bank loan includ end-of-year amount of lend by domest 

bank to domest household and nonfinanci corpor in domest currenc

exclud lend within the financi system (schularik and taylor 2012). bank 

be defin a monetari institut and they includ save banks, postal banks, 

credit unions, mortgag associations, and build associations. the data on bank 

loan come from the dataset of schularik and taylor (2012). 

We use the top 1% incom share of the popul to proxi the incom in- 

equality. leigh (2007) have demonstr that the top 1% incom share seri have 

a high correl with other measur of incom inequality, like the gini index, 

which make the seri a compar measur of incom inequality. the data on 

top incom share be obtain from the world top incom databas (atkinson et 

al. 2011). In addit to incom concentr we use sever macroeconom 

aggreg attribut a factor behind credit growth a control variables. these 

includ real gdp per capita, invest a a share of gdp, short-term interest 

rates, and broad money (m2) a a share of gdp (bordo and meissner 2012; borio 

and white 2003; mendoza and terron 2008). the data on invest a a share 

of gdp, short-term interest rates, and broad money (m2) a a share of gdp be 

obtain from the dataset of schularik and taylor (2012). the data on real gdp 

be take from the maddison dataset of the groningen growth and develop 

centre. 

leverag be model a a debt to real incom ratio in the theoret model 

by kumhof and rancièr (2010). thus, to test the hypothesi by kumhof and 

ranciere, we use bank loan to real gdp a our depend variable. descript 

statist of the data be present in appendix I. 

due to limit of the data on top 1% incom share, we be abl to construct 

a balanc panel on eight countries.2 the baselin dataset span from 1959 to 

2008, wherea the dataset includ short-term interest rate span from 1972 to 

2countri includ in the panel are: australia, canada, france, japan, norway, sweden, the 
unit kingdom and the unit states.

of the top 1% decreased, but at the same time the share of bank loan increased, 

although onli marginally. dure that period incom inequ decreas the 

most in sweden and in france. after 1980 the share of incom earn by the 

top 1% and the share of bank loan to real gdp grow at a veri similar pace in 

all countries. thi period after 1980 give some evid in favor of the level

bank loan diminish onli in japan, which suffer from a decad long recess 

that begin in 1991. becaus of the countri relat heterogeneity, the best way 

to analyz the possibl relationship between the two variabl be to test be the 

differ trend process driven by the same factor(s). 

the data on bank loan be extrem heterogeneous, a describ by schu- 

larik and taylor (2012). credit, money and bank institut differ profoundli 

across countri and in some case histor data on credit cover onli commer- 

cial banks. As schularik and taylor, we tackl the issu of heterogen by use 

country-rel constants. there be few yearli observ miss from the top 

1% incom share data, which we replac by averag of the valu preced and 

follow the miss observation. 

We start by test the time seri properti of the data. As the time seri 

extent of the data (50 annual observations) be too short for a countri relat time 

seri testing, we use two set of panel unit root test to test for the possibl 

stochast trends. the first two be the so call first-gener tests, by Im et al. 

(2003) (ips) and the fisher type adf test by maddala and Wu (1999). these test 

assum that there be no cross-sect correl between the unit of the panel. 

the second gener panel unit root test by pesaran (2007) and phillip and sul 

(2003) allow for cross-sect correl within the panel. In all test the null 

hypothesi be that the seri be trend-stationary. A more detail introduct on 

the use test be provid in the appendix ii. tabl 1 present the result of panel 

unit root test for the six includ variables. 

accord to result present in tabl 1, all panel unit root test find the share 

of credit to real gdp to be an unit root process, i.e., test cannot reject the null 

hypothesi of an unit root. three out of four test find the top 1% incom share 

and the share of broad money to gdp to be unit root processes. two out of the

propos by pedroni (2004) and by banerje and carrion-i-silvestr (2011) (from 

now on bc). the big differ between these test be that while pedroni’ 

test assum uncorrel residu structure, bc’ test allow for cross-sect 

correl through common factor and it also control for possibl structur 

break in the cointegr relation. appendix iii give more detail descript 

of the use tests. 

the model for test for cointegr between inequ and credit is: 

credit/rgdpit = αi +γitop1%it + �it, (1) 

where the level of bank loan be explain by the level of inequality, and (1,−γi) 

be the country-specif cointegr vector between bank loan and the top 1% 

incom share. under the null hypothesi γi = 1 ∀ i impli that variabl be not 

cointegrated. We includ individu constant due to heterogen of the data on 

bank loan discuss in the previou section. result of panel cointegr test 

base on the model (1) be present in tabl 2.4 15 out of the 19 test statist 

in tabl 2 find that the seri of top 1% incom share and credit to real gdp be 

cointegr of order one at the 5% signific level. result present in the last 

four row give some indic that determinist trend may need to be incorpo- 

rat in the estim model. still, the overal conclus from cointegr test 

be clear: the top 1% incom share and credit to real gdp seem to be cointegr 

indic that the two seri have a long-run steady-st relation.

expect posit and statist signific signs. the coeffici of invest 

a a share of gdp have an unexpect neg and statist signific sign. 

however, thi may be due to the possibl correl between invest and 

interest rate. higher demand for invest may increas the short term interest 

rates, but high interest rate be like to diminish the demand for bank loan 

and investments. therefore, the neg effect of interest rate to bank loan may 

be reflect to investments.9

3.3 granger causal test 

roin et al. (2009) have show that financi development, measur a the share 

of bank deposit and stock market capitalization, can have an effect on the incom 

of the top 1%.13 If the same appli to bank credit, there would be a revers effect 

from credit to incom inequality. panel dsur estim by mark et al. (2005) 

control for thi possibl endogen by includ the lead and lag of the ex- 

planatori variabl to the estim model. the drawback of thi method be that 

it be sensit to the select of lead and lags. If some or all of the explanatori 

variabl be endogenous, and if the number of lead and lag have not be suffi- 

cient to elimin the correl between them and the error term, estim will 

not be asymptot unbiased. 

test for thi possibl bia without strictli exogen instrument be diffi- 

cult. however, granger non-caus test can be use to ass whether incom 

inequ help to forecast the share of credit and vice versa. although thi be 

not an actual test for causality, it will show the direct of the flow of statist 

(predictive) information, which can be use to ass whether there be reason to 

suspect a revers effect or causal run from bank credit to incom inequality. 

We use the granger non-caus test by emirmahmutoglu and kose (2011) 

develop for heterogen cointegr panels. It conduct N separ time 

seri test and then calcul fisher test statist by fisher (1932) use the 

obtain individu p-values. cross-sect correl be control by use 

bootstrap method for obtain the empir distribut of the fisher statist 

and associ critic values. tabl 6 present result for granger non-caus

accord to the result present in tabl 6, there be no inform on the

share seri at the 5% level of significance. however, the inform contain 

into the top 1% incom seri do help to forecast the share of credit to rgdp 

with 1% level of significance. result thu indic that the flow of inform 

would run from incom inequ to bank credit. thi diminish the endogen 

problem and show that the estim result present in previou section be 

not driven by mere statist correlation. that is, result indic that incom 

inequ have a posit long-run effect on the share of credit to real gdp. 

4 conclus 

schularik and taylor (2012, p. 1031) have describ the period after the second 

world war a the "age of unpreced risk and leverage". iacoviello (2008) 

show that incom inequ have contribut to the rise of household debt in the 

unit state dure thi era. kumhof and rancièr (2010) argu that there be 

a more general, long-run relationship between these variables, where incom in- 

16 



equal will lead to increas leverag in the economy. In thi study, we have 

test the exist of such a long-run relationship. 

accord to our results, there be a long-run steady-st relationship between 

incom inequ and bank credit in develop economies. the long-run elastic- 

iti of credit with respect to incom inequ be found to be positive. incom 

inequ be also found to have a one-way granger causal relationship to 

bank credit. these result indic that incom inequ have contribut to the 

increas of leverag in accord with the theori by iacoviello (2008), kumhof 

and rancièr (2010), and rajan (2010). 

due to the pioneer natur of these findings, direct of futur research be 

ample. the analysi present herein concentr on develop economies, but 

the relationship between inequ and credit may differ, for example, in develop- 

ing economies. more importantly, futur research should includ the examin 

of the effect of incom inequ on the probabl of financi crises.15 By dis- 

entangl the effect of incom inequ and credit a predictor of financi 

crises, the channel through which incom inequ may increas the probabil- 

iti of crisi would be make clearer. futur research will also defin the possibl 

need of equal of the distribut of incom a a mean for achiev financi 

stability.

appendix ii: panel unit root test 

all the use test allow for individu unit root processes. that is, they allow 

the coeffici of unit root to differ across countries. 

the tradit panel unit root tests, be base on the follow regression: 

4yit = ρiyi,t−1 +ηit +αi + θt + �it, (4) 

where αi be individu constants, ηit be individu time trends, and θt be the 

common time effects. the test reli on the assumpt that e[�it� js] = 0 ∀ t, s and 

i , j, which be requir for calcul common time effects. thus, if the differ 

seri be correlated, the last assumpt be violated. 

the second gener test be base on the regress 

4yit = ρyi,t−1 +ηit +αi +δiθt + �it, (5) 

where αi be the individu constants, ηit be the individu time trends, and θt be 

the common time effect, whose coefficients, δi, be assum to be non-stochastic, 

21 



measur the impact of the common time effect of seri i, and �it be assum to 

be normal distribut with mean zero and varianc of σ2 and independ of 

� j and θs for all i , j and s, t. cross-sect depend be allow through 

the common time effect, which gener the correl between cross-sect 

units. the matrix δi give the non-random factor load coeffici that deter- 

mine the extent of the cross-sect correlation. 

the null hypothesi in all test be that ρi = 0 ∀ i, i.e. that the process in i(1) 

nonstationary. the altern hypothesi are: 

H1 : ρi < 0, i = 1,2, ...,n1, ρi = 0, i = N1 + 1,n1 + 2, ...,n. (6) 

for consist of panel unit root test it be also requir that, under the alterna- 

tive, the fraction of the individu process that be stationari be non-zero, for- 

malli limn→∞(n1/n) = γ, 0 < γ ≤ 1 (im et al. 2003). 

appendix iii: panel cointegr test 

panel cointegr test develop by banerje and carrion-i-silvestr (2011) 

be base on the normal bia and the pseudo t-ratio test statist by pedroni 

(2004). the data gener process behind pedroni’ test statist be give by: 

yit = fi(t) + x′it + eit, 

4xit = vit, 

eit = ρiei,t−1 + �itζit = (�it,vit)′, 

(7) 

where fi(t) includ member specif fix effect and determinist trends. 

the data gener process be describ a a partit vector z′it ≡ (yit, xit) 

where the true process be gener a zit = zi,t−1 + ζit, ζ′it = (ζ

the statist pool the between dimens of the panel and they be construct 

by comput the ratio of the correspond convent time seri statist 

and then by comput the standard sum of the N time seri of the panel. 

pedroni (1999, 2004) show that under the null of no cointegr the asymptot 

distribut of the two statist present abov converg to normal distribut 

with zero mean and varianc of one a N and T sequenti converg to infinity. 

banerje and carrion-i-silvestr (2006) extend the model by pedroni (2004) 

to includ common factors: 

yi,t = fi(t) + x′i,t + ui,t, 

4xi,t = vi,t, 

fi(t) = µi +βit 

uit = f′tπi + eit, 

(8) 

where ei,t = ρiei,t + �i,t and f′t :s be the common factor which be use to account 

for the possibl cross-sect dependence. 

appendix iv: panel dsur estim 

23 



the data gener process in mark et al. (2005) dsur estim be of the 

form 

yit = αi +λit + θt +β′xit + uit, (9) 

4xit = eit (10) 

where there be n cointegr regress each with T observations, (1− β′) be 

the cointegr vector between yit and xit, and xit and eit be k× 1 dimension 

vectors. panel dsur elimin the possibl endogen between explanatori 

variabl and the depend variabl by assum that uit be correl at most 

with pi lead and lag of 4xit (mark et al. 2005). the possibl endogen can 

be control by project uit onto these pi lead and lags: 

uit = 
pi∑ 

s=−pi 
δ′i,s4xi,t− + uit∗ = δ′izit + u∗it. (11) 

the project error u∗it be orthogon to all lead and lag of 4xit and the estim 

equat becomes: 

yit = αi +λit + θt +β′xit +δizit + u∗it, (12) 

where δ′izit be a vector of project dimensions. panel dsur estim a long- 

run covari matrix that be use in estim of equat (9). thi make 

panel dsur more effici when cross-sect be dependent. the effici 

of panel dsur actual improv a the correl between cross-sect in- 

creases. asymptot properti of the estim be base on T −→ ∞ with N 

fixed.
