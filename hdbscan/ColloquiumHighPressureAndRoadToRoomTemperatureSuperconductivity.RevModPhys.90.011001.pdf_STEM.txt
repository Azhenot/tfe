thi colloquium be concern with the superconduct state of new high-tc compound contain 
hydrogen ion (hydrides). recent superconduct with the record-set transit temperatur 
of Tc ¼ 203 K be report for sulfur hydrid under high pressure. In general, high pressur serf 
a a path find tool toward novel structures, includ those with veri high tc. the field have a rich 
and interest history. currently, it be broadli recogn that superconduct in sulfur hydrid 
owe it origin to the phonon mechanism. however, the pictur differ from the convent one in 
import ways. the phonon spectrum in sulfur hydrid be both broad and have a complex structure. 
superconduct aris mainli due to strong coupl to the high-frequ optic modes, although 
the acoust phonon also make a notic contribution. A new approach be described, which 
gener the standard treatment of the phonon mechan and make it possibl to obtain an 
analyt express for Tc in thi phase. It turn out that, unlik in the convent case, the valu of 
the isotop coeffici (for the deuterium-hydrogen substitution) vari with the pressur and reflect 
the impact of the optic modes. the phase diagram, that be the pressur depend of tc, be rather 
peculiar. A crucial featur be that increas pressur result in a seri of structur transitions, 
includ the one which yield the superconduct phase with the record Tc of 203 K. In a narrow 
region near P ≈ 150 gpa the critic temperatur rise sharpli from Tc ≈ 120 to ≈ 200 K. It seem 
that the sharp structur transition, which produc the high-tc phase, be a first-ord phase transit 
caus by interact between the order paramet and lattic deformations. A remark featur of 
the electron spectrum in the high-tc phase be the appear of small pocket at the fermi level. 
their presenc lead to a two-gap spectrum, which can, in principle, be observ with the futur use 
of tunnel spectroscopy. thi featur lead to nonmonoton and strongli asymmetr pressur 
depend of tc. other hydrides, e.g., cah6 and mgh6, can be expect to display even high 
valu of Tc up to room temperature. the fundament challeng lie in the creation of a structur 
capabl of display high Tc at ambient pressure.

I. introduct 

In a recent development, superconduct with a critic 
temperatur Tc ¼ 203 kwa observ in sulfur hydrid under 
high pressur (drozdov et al., 2015). thi develop be the 
most signific breakthrough sinc the discoveri of the high- 
Tc oxid (bednorz and mueller, 1986). there be everi reason 
to anticip even high valu of Tc for other hydrides, 
which mean that achiev superconduct at room tem- 
peratur now appear perfectli realistic.

We focu here on theoret aspects, which can provid a 
clue to understand the specif of the new superconduct- 
ing state. It should be emphas that in mani respect the 
system be quit unusual. As will be discussed, the observ 
phenomenon can be explain by the phonon mechanism. 
nevertheless, a number of key featur reveal that the pictur 
differ from the convent one. In thi colloquium we 
devot particular attent to these features. one of them be the 
peculiar pressur depend of the critic temperature. not 
onli do extern pressur result in metal and the 
appear of superconductivity, but also the valu of Tc 
grow dramat with a further rise in pressure. moreover, 
thi variat turn out to be nonmonotonic. It should also be 
note that while cooper pair format be mediat by 
phonons, the complex structur of the phonon spectrum 
and it broad rang (all the way up to Ω ≈ 2000 K, where 
Ω be the phonon frequency) make it necessari to modifi the 
convent treatment. while the strong isotop effect affirm 
the action of the phonon mechanism, the valu of the isotop 
coeffici turn out to vari with pressure. next we discu 
all these interest aspect of the new develop in 
superconductivity. 
despit it rich and interest prehistory, the discoveri 

come a a surprise, especi for those who accept the notion 
that electron-phonon interact cannot give rise to such a 
high tc. the background of thi notion will be discuss 
late (sec. iii.a). one also should not lose track of the fact that 
thi impress discoveri come about thank to the remark 
progress in high-pressur techniqu and to experiment 
innov by the M. eremet group (max planck 
institute, mainz, germany). note that the studi of the 
hydrid have attract the attent of mani theoret 
group (see sec. iii). and special credit should be give to 
the group of Y. Ma and also to D. duan, T. cui, and their 
collabor (julin university, changchun, china) (see 
secs. iii and vii). their remark studi brought special 
attent to the sulfur hydrid and motiv the key 
experiment studies. 
A few remark on the histor perspect be in order. 

the phenomenon of superconduct be discov more 
than 100 year ago by onn (1911). while measur the 
temperatur depend of the electr resist rðtþ of 
mercuri he observ that at the temperatur of 4.2 K the 
resist suddenli vanishes. the dissipationless (R ¼ 0) 
state which emerg be name the superconduct state. 
subsequ superconduct be discov in mani other 
materials. moreover, it be soon realiz that the loss of 
resist be onli one facet of the superconduct state; 
hence, the latter correspond to a qualit new state of 
matter. it most fundament feature, the so-cal meissner 
effect (meissner and ochsenfeld, 1933), be manifest in the 
expuls of the magnet field from the bulk of the sampl 
(anomal diamagnetism). 
the microscop theori of superconduct be creat 

by bardeen, cooper, and schrieffer (1957), almost 50 year 
after the experiment discovery. accord to the bc 
theory, the key microscop factor behind the phenomenon 
be the attract between electron mediat by the exchang 
of phonons, such that below Tc within the electron system 

there form a macroscop manifold of bound electron pair 
(known a the cooper pairs). thu the attract have it 
origin in the ionic system; qualit the effect may be 
relat to the dielectr function chang it sign at low 
frequencies. 
the well-known express for the critic temperatur be 

Tc ≈ ~Ω exp 
� 
− 1 
λ − μ� 

� 
. ð1:1þ 

here ~Ω be the characterist phonon frequenc (typic on 
the order of the deby temperature), λ be the electron-phonon 
coupl constant, and μ� be the so-cal coulomb pseudo- 
potenti which character the direct electron-electron 
repuls (usual μ� ≈ 0.1–0.15). equat (1.1) be valid in 
the weak coupl approxim (λ ≪ 1). note that the 
specif valu of the preexponenti factor be determin by 
the renorm effect (see sec. iii.a). 
the search for superconduct materi with high 

critic temperatur have be ongoing. figur 1 show 
how the maximum transit temperatur within differ 
superconductor famili have grown with time. In the first 
75 year progress be rather modest (from Tc ¼ 4.2 K for 
mercuri up to Tc ≈ 23 K in nb3ge). A breakthrough come in 
1986 when bednorz and mueller discov a new famili of 
superconduct materials, the copper oxid (cuprates), and 
observ a Tc close to 40 K in the la-sr-cu-o compound. 
subsequ research on cuprat rais their Tc all the way up 
to 130 K in the hgbacacuo compound (schill et al., 
1993). for what follows, it be noteworthi that under pressur 
Tc be rais up to ≈160 K (gao et al., 1994). until recently, 
thi remain the high critic temperatur ever observed. 

fig. 1. increas in tc;max with time. dure the next 75 year 
sinc the discoveri the increas be δtc ≈ 18 K; the main focu 
be on the nb-base materials. the high Tc for the cuprat at 
ambient pressur (tc ≈ 130 K) be rais under pressur up to 
Tc ≈ 160 K. At present, the curv be extend up to tc;max ¼ 
203 K observ for sulfur hydrid under high pressure.

ii. hydrid 

A. metal hydrogen 

As note in the introduction, recent work on sulfur hydrid 
under high pressur lead to the observ of a superconduct- 
ing state with the record valu of Tc ¼ 203 K. thi achieve- 
ment be preced by developments, which start almost 50 
year ago (ashcroft, 1968). accord to the bc theory, Tc 
be proport to the characterist phonon frequenc ~Ω ∝ 
1= 

ffiffiffiffiffi 
M 

p 
[see eq. (1.1)]. one may expect, therefore, that 

metal hydrogen should have a high valu of tc: for such 
a light metal the characterist phonon frequenc in the 
prefactor of eq. (1.1) be high and (ignor for the moment 
the magnitud of the exponenti factor) Tc may also turn out 
to be rather high. however, thi predict can be verifi onli 
under veri high pressure. indeed, hydrogen first must becom 
metallic, but the transit from the molecular phase into the 
metal state be know to requir high pressur (wigner and 
huntington, 1935). thi be the dissoci transit to an 
atom lattice, which occur through compress of solid 
molecular hydrogen. 
A conduct (probably, semimetalic) state of hydrogen 

be observ by eremet and troyan (2011) at room temper- 
atur under the pressur of 260–270 gpa (recal that 100 gpa 
correspond to 1 × 106 atmospheres). 
the phase diagram for hydrogen be rather complic 

(fig. 2), and the determin of thi diagram be a nontrivi 
task. the main complic deriv from the fact that the usual 
techniqu for structur determination, which underli the phase 
diagram of materials, namely, x-ray diffract (xrd), be not 
conclus becaus scatter by hydrogen be veri weak. the 
diagram in fig. 2 be base on raman and infrar measur 
along with resist data. the low temperatur phase i–iii 
be observ at rel low pressur (≤150 gpa); see the 
review by mao and hemley (1994). 

recent eremets, troyan, anddrozdov (2016) and eremet 
et al. (2017) observ a new phase (phase VI in fig. 2) at 
pressur ≳360 gpa and temperatur <200 K. thi phase 
display a drastic drop in resistivity, characterist featureless 
raman spectra, and the absenc of a photoconduct response. 
these properti be characterist of the metal state. 
concern the superconduct state of metal hydrogen, 

theoret calcul (mcmahon et al., 2012) show that a 
high Tc state of pure metal hydrogen requir pressur on 
the order of ≈500 gpa. hopefully, thi phenomenon will be 
observ in the near future. 

B. hydrides: high-tc superconduct 

the reason for an elev valu of Tc appli not onli to 
pure hydrogen but also to hydrides, that is, to materi 
contain hydrogen a one of their compon (ashcroft, 
2004;wang andma, 2014). the presenc of hydrogen result in 
the appear of high-frequ optical-phonon modes, 
wherea heavi ion provid addit acoust modes, which 
also contribut to the pairing.at the same time, themetal 
of such compound do not requir extraordinarili high 
pressures. In fact, hydrid be even more promis materi 
than pure metal hydrogen. indeed, the presenc of more than 
one ion in the unit cell, in thi case an addit hydrogen ion, 
lead to an appear of high-frequ optic mode which, 
in addit to high frequency, be character by a high densiti 
of states. the latter be benefici for superconductivity. 
A number of density-funct theori studi support the 

high promis of hydrid compounds. for example, calcul 
(gao et al., 2008) suggest that gah3 at P ≈ 160 gpa would 
display Tc ≈ 140 K and si2h6 at ≈275 gpa would display 
Tc ≈ 73–86 K (jin et al., 2010). the most thermodynam 
stabl structur be establish by calcul the enthalpy- 
differ curves. among others, the minimum hop method 
be employ (goedecker, 2004). 
initi experi on sih4 (eremet et al., 2008) demon- 

strate that hydrid can inde support a superconduct 
state, although the critic temperatur be a rel modest 
≈17 K. later, follow the discoveri of the record high Tc in 
sulfur hydrides, a high-tc state (≈100 K) in coval hydrid 
phosphin (p-h) be also observ (drozdov, eremets, and 
troyan,2015).theoreticalanalysi (flores-livas,amsleretal., 
2016) suggest that the ph1;2;3 system inde have a rather 
high tc, but the materi be probabl in a metast state. 
Li et al. (2014) make the predict that metal sulfur 

hydrid would becom superconduct with Tc ≈ 80 K 
under the rel low pressur P ≈ 100 gpa. follow 
the first experiment observ of such a superconduct 
state, eremet and collabor continu increas the 
pressur and discov that Tc go up significantli all 
the way to Tc ≈ 203 K (drozdov, eremets, and troyan, 2014; 
drozdov et al., 2015); see also the review by eremet and 
drozdov (2016). such a remark observ be 
explain by a mix valenc of S and the format of 
sulfur hydrid with a high hydrogen content. thi 
assumpt be in agreement with an interest independ 
theoret studi by duan et al. (2014) more specifically, an 
increas in pressur be accompani by the format of h3 
structur unit [fig. 3(a)] via the follow transformation: 

fig. 2. the phase diagram of hydrogen. letter i–vi indic 
domain for differ phases. phase i–iii correspond to a 
molecular state of pure hydrogen. their boundari can be 
determin from raman and infrar measurements. phase IV 
be a mix atomic-molecular phase, phase V be an atom liquid 
phase. recent observ phase VI correspond to the metal 
state. from eremets, troyan, and drozdov, 2016.

3h2 → 2h3sþ S. ð2:1þ 

the transform h2 → h3 have also be confirm by 
detail calcul of bernstein et al. (2015) and errea 
et al. (2015). 
sulfur hydrid at the pressur P ≈ 90 gpa have Tc ≈ 90 K. 

As mentioned, the subsequ increas in pressur lead to a 
larg increas in the valu of the critic temperatur up to 
Tc ≈ 200 K. thi pressur depend impli that the 
presenc of hydrogen be necessari but not suffici by itself 
for reach the high Tc values. indeed, the sampl at 
90 gpa contain hydrogen and consequ high-frequ 
modes. the Tc of 90 K be veri high and be sensat 
30 year ago, but it be much below the 203 K that be achiev 
under high pressure. therefor the pressur increas bring 
in some addit factors. As mentioned, drozdov, eremets, 
and troyan (2014) and drozdov et al. (2015) suggest that 
the rise in Tc be due to the format of new compound with 
high valenc state of sulfur. 
As will be described, the pressur increas chang the 

crystal structur of sulfur hydride, therebi signifi a 
structur phase transition. the structur transform play 
the crucial role in the observ behavior. 
next we focu on the two phase with the high valu of 

Tc (fig. 3). one of them [figs. 3(a) and 3(b)] have the crystal 
structure, which correspond to r3m symmetri (massa, 2004). 
increas the pressur further leads, at P ≈ 150 gpa, to the 
appear of a differ phase [fig. 3(c)]. It be thi new 
structur that display the record-high tc. the symmetri group 

of the lattic be cubic Oh ðim-3mþ. the theoret predict 
structur be in agreement with x-ray data (einaga et al., 2016; 
goncharov et al., 2016, 2017). 
the usual x-ray spectroscopi do not allow one to 

determin the structur of the hydrid with a high accuracy, 
becaus the light H ion do not provid strong scattering. In 
addition, the multiphas natur of the studi sampl 
(goncharov et al., 2016) also repres a seriou complica- 
tion. recently, advanc spectroscopi have be employ to 
monitor how the structur evolv with pressur (goncharov 
et al., 2017). more specifically, the synthesi perform out of 
S and molecular hydrogen along with the cyclotron xrd 
techniqu and raman spectroscopi do allow the research 
to studi all structur form with an increas in pressure. It 
turn out that the transform (2.1) occur at pressur 
P > 40 gpa. It have also be demonstr that the phase at 
P≲ 110 gpa (tc ≈ 120 K) have r3m symmetri [figs. 3(a) 
and 3(b)]. As for the most interest high-tc phase, it 
structur [fig. 3(c)], indeed, be character by the im-3m 
symmetry. 
the transform (2.1) support the suggest by 

drozdov et al. (2015); see the previou discuss on the 
mix valenc state of sulfur. the latter factor turn out to be 
essenti (see sec. iv.c). 

C. superconduct in hydrides: main properti 

experimentally, the onset of the high-tc superconduct 
state in sulfur hydrid (drozdov et al., 2015) be detect by 
the drastic resist drop near tc. A sharp transit be 
observ in anneal samples. the measur resist be at 
least 2 order of magnitud below that of pure copper. 
the critic temperatur shift downward in the presenc of 

an extern magnet field. magnet suscept measure- 
ment reveal an abrupt transit into the diamagnet state 
(the meissner effect). thi key result be also confirm by a 
direct observ (troyan et al., 2016) of magnet field 
expuls a detect by the respons of a thin Sn film place 
insid the bulk sample. the meissner effect be also observ 
late by huang et al. (2016) by mean of ac magnet 
suscept measurements. 
next we concentr on the two phase with the high tc. 

one of them (r3m) [figs. 3(a) and 3(b)] have Tc ≈ 120 K, and 
the other (im-3m [fig. 3(c)] have the high Tc of ≈200 k.we 
refer to the former structur a the “low-tc phase” (although 
thi name sound iron for Tc ≈ 120 k), and to the second 
structur a the “high-tc phase.” 
the question of the mechan of superconduct with 

such a record Tc be of fundament interest. the strong isotop 
effect indic that pair be provid by phonon exchange. 
the main contribut come from the high-frequ optic 
modes. nevertheless, a stress in the introduction, the 
pictur be far from conventional. 
the phase diagram, that is, the pressur depend of tc, 

be veri peculiar. indeed, fig. 4 demonstr that Tc be strongli 
depend on the appli pressur (einaga et al., 2016). It 
increas from ≈100–120 K up to the record ≈200 K over the 
rel narrow pressur interv 125–150 gpa. We argu 
that such a rapid Tc chang be a fingerprint of a first-ord 
structur transition.

note that onc Tc reach it maximum value, it decreas 
upon further rise in appli pressure. the declin be rather 
slow, so that the Tc depend be strongli asymmetr 
rel to tc;max. such a depend be unusu and requir 
an explanation. We interpret thi featur (see sec. vii.d) a 
deriv from the impact of the superconduct order 
paramet on the main fermi surfac and on small pockets, 
with the latter appear in the electron spectrum of the 
high-tc phase in the cours of a first-ord phase transition. 
note also that becaus of the complex structur and the 

width of the phonon spectrum evalu of Tc and of the 
isotop coeffici (whose valu turn out to be pressur 
dependent) must be carri out with consider care. 
the next section contain a gener descript of the 

phonon mechan with emphasi on the strong coupl 
case. subsequ section focu on the challeng previous 
described. 

iii. electron-phonon interaction: 
critic temperatur 

A. main equations: coupl constant and Tc 

our main goal be to evalu the valu of the critic 
temperatur for the hydrides. the usual bc model be 
not applic here, becaus it have be develop in a 
weak coupl approxim (λ ≪ 1 and correspondingly, 
2πtc ≪ ~ω). the equat describ strong-coupl super- 
conductor (migdal, 1958; eliashberg, 1960) contain the so- 
call phonon propag [see eq. (3.1)], and therefor the 
phonon frequenc Ω. 
the equat for the pair order paramet δðωnþ have the 

follow form (at T ¼ tc): 

δðωnþz ¼ πtc

be the phonon propagator, Ω be the phonon frequency, and 
ωn ¼ ð2nþ 1þπtc (the method of thermodynam green’ 
function be employed) [see, e.g., abrikosov, gor’kov, and 
dzyaloshinski (1975)]; one should also add the coulomb 
pseudopotenti μ�. the factor Z be the renorm 
function determin by

dðω;ωn−ωmþ ωmjωmj . 
ð3:3þ 

the renorm function describ the “dressing” of 
electron move through the ionic lattice. 
equat (3.1) and (3.3) contain the import quantity, the 

function α2ðωþfðωþ. here fðωþ be the phonon densiti of 
states, α2ðωþ describ the electron-phonon interact and 
contain the correspond matrix element (scalapino, 1969; 
grimvall, 1981; wolf, 2012). 
In addition, one can introduc an import parameter, the 

so-cal coupl constant λ, defin by 

λ ¼ 
Z 

dΩ 
α2ðωþfðωþ 

Ω 
. ð3:4þ 

note that eqs. (3.1) and (3.3) do not explicitli contain the 
coupl constant λ. indeed, gener speaking, thi constant 
cannot be factor out, becaus the phonon frequenc enter 
not onli in the factor α2ðωþfðωþ but also in the phonon 
propag dðω;ωn − ωmþ, which, in addition, depend on 
ωn − ωm [see eq. (3.2)]. It be appar from eq. (3.1) or (3.3) 
that the coupl constant can be factor out, if eq. (3.1) do 
not contain a phonon propag function (e.g., D ≈ 1 for the 
weak coupl case) or if the phonon propag D slowli 
depend on the frequencyω, so that Ω ind can be replac by 
it averag value. 
when the function α2ðωþfðωþ be known, the valu of 

the critic temperatur can be evalu from the nonlinear 
equat similar to eq. (3.1) with the replac jωnj → 
½ω2n þ δ2ðωnþ�1=2 in the denomin of the integrand 
(gor’kov, 1958). such an equat describ the order 
paramet at ani temperatur [then ωn ¼ ð2nþ 1þπt]. the 
calcul can be perform numerically, without invok 
the coupl constant concept. We discu the correspond 
method in sec. iv.a while focu on the sulfur hydrides. 
At the same time the possibl to introduc the coupl 

constant λ be benefici for the analysis. the concept of 
a coupl constant be commonli use to studi usual 
superconductors. It allow one to deduc the analyt expres- 
sion for Tc and interpret it depend on other para- 
meter in the problem. such an approach be justified, becaus 
usual the function α2ðωþfðωþ be character by the peak 
structur in phonon densiti of state fðωþ [see, e.g., wolf 
(2012), and also fig. 5(b)]. the latter structur correspond

mode dispers be weak. the phonon propag chang 
slowli on the scale correspond to the peak structure, 
and thi permit the replac of Ω in the phonon 
propag by it averag valu ~ω; the latter can be take 
either a ~Ω ¼ hω2i1=2 [see, e.g., louie and cohen (1977), and 
the review by grimval (1981) and kresin and wolf (2009)], 
or a ~Ω ¼ hωlogi which be close to ~Ω ¼ hω2i1=2 (allen and 
dynes, 1975; carbotte, 1990). the averag hfi be defin by 
hfðωþi ¼ ð2=λþ R dωfðωþα2ðωþfðωþω−1. If ~Ω ¼ hωlogi, 
then f ¼ logω. We have chosen ~Ω ¼ hω2i1=2, so that 
hω2i ¼ ð2=λþ R dωωα2ðωþfðωþ; λ be defin by eq. (3.4). 
As a result, eqs. (3.1) and (3.3) can be write in the form 

δðωnþz ¼ πtcλ

m 

Dð ~ω;ωn − ωmþδðωmþjωmj ; ð3:5þ 

Z ¼ 1þ ðπtc=ωnþλ

here 

Dð ~ω;ωn −ωmþ ¼ ~ω2=½ðωn −ωmþ2 þ ~ω2�; ~ω¼ hω2i1=2. 
ð3:7þ 

As be known, the solut of eq. (3.5) can be write in 
analyt form and the explicit express depend on the 
strength of the electron-phonon interact [see the review by 
kresin, morawitz, and wolf (2014)]. for the weak coupl 
case (λ ≪ 1; then 2πtc ≪ ~ω), D ≈ 1, Z ≈ 1, and we obtain a 
well-known bc expression, eq. (1.1). for the intermedi 
coupl one should take into account the renorm of 
the coupl constant, sinc Z ≈ 1þ λ, and Tc be describ by 
the correspond equat (nakajima and watabe, 1963; 
grimvall, 1981). note that even in the weak coupl case the 
renorm function affect the valu of the preexponen- 
tial factor (karakozov, maksimov, and mashkov, 1976; wang 
and chubukov, 2013), which appear to be approxim 
a ≈ 0.25 ~ω; see eqs. (4.5) and (7.1). awell-known mcmillan- 
dyne express (mcmillan, 1968; dynes, 1972) be wide 
use in the literature: 

Tc ¼ ð ~ω=1.2þ exp 
� 
− 1.04ð1þ λÞ 
λ − μ�ð1þ 0.62λþ 

� 
. ð3:8þ 

thi express be valid for λ≲ 1.5. note that for small λ 
eq. (3.8) can be write in a form similar to eq. (1.1) with 
a ≈ 0.3 ~ω, which be close to the valu alreadi mentioned. for 
larg valu of λ one should use a differ expression, which 
be obtain by numer modif of eq. (3.8) (allen 
and dynes, 1975); see sec. iv.a. one can also use the 
express valid for ani λ (kresin, 1987); see eq. (7.1). note 
that for the case of veri strong coupl (λ≳ 5; then πtc ≳ ~ω) 
the depend of Tc on λ be entir differ from eqs. (1.1) 
and (3.8) (we omit μ� for simplicity) and have the follow 
form: 

Tc ¼ 0.18λ1=2 ~Ω ð3:9þ 

[see allen and dyne (1975) and kresin, gutfreund, and 
littl (1984)]. 
In addition, one can introduc the follow import 

relat (mcmillan, 1968): 

λ ¼ hii2ν=m ~ω2 ð3:10þ 

(I describ the electron-phonon scattering, and ν be the 
electron densiti of states). 
the import question be whether there exist an upper 

limit of the valu of tc. A “myth,” which persist even today, 
claim that the phonon mechan be unabl to provid the 
valu of the critic temperatur high than ∼30 K. for some 
scientist the argument be base on eqs. (3.8) and (3.10). 
indeed, neglect μ� for simplic and calcul ∂tc=∂ ~ω, 
one can easili find the maximum valu of tc; thi valu 
correspond to λ ≈ 2. however, the mcmillan equat be 
valid onli for λ≲ 1.5. thi limit be mention below 
eq. (3.8). In connect with this, note that the macmillan- 
dyne equat (3.8) be obtain by take into consid- 
erat the renorm function Z ≈ 1þ λ [see eqs. (3.1) 
and (3.3)] and by fit the coeffici to describ the data on 
nb. the same limit be obtain by geilikman, kresin, 
and masharov (1975), who analyt deriv the equat 
similar to (3.8) [see eq. (4.6)]; the deriv be valid for

λ≲ 1.5 [then ðπtc= ~ωþ2 ≪ 1]. therefore, the valu λ ≈ 2 be 
outsid the rang of the applic of the macmillan-dyn 
equation. one can see from eq. (3.9) that the mention upper 
limit for Tc do not exist. 
anoth erron restrict be impos not on the 

depend of Tc on λ (see above), but on the limit valu 
of the coupl constant λ itself. In the framework of the so- 
call froelich hamiltonian Ĥ ¼ ĥel þ ĥph þ ĥint, where 
ĥph contain the phonon frequenc ω0ðqþ and ĥint describ 
the electron-phonon interaction, one obtain for the frequenc 
~ω, renorm by the electron-phonon interaction, that 
~Ω ¼ ω0ð1 − 2λþ1=2. one conclud that the lattic becom 
unstabl at a valu of the coupl constant λ ¼ 0.5, and 
therefor the valu Tc ≤ 0.1 ~Ω [see eq. (1.1), ~Ω ≈ ωd] 
provid the upper limit of the critic temperature. At the 
same time, there exist mani superconductor with λ > 0.5 
(e.g., sn, pb, hg). To clarifi thi point, an analysi base on 
rigor adiabat theori be carri out (browman and 
kagan, 1967; geilikman, 1971). It be show that the use 
of the experiment observ acoust law for ω0ðqþ be not 
self-consistent. the electron-ion interact particip in the 
format of the phonon spectrum in the system, so that one be 
deal with a doubl counting. 
start from the adiabat theori with the hamiltonian 

Ĥ ¼ t̂r⃗ þ t̂r⃗ þ vðr⃗; r⃗þ [t̂r⃗ and t̂r⃗ be kinet energi oper- 
ator for electron and ions, and vðr⃗; r⃗þ be the sum of the 
coulomb interactions] one can evalu the electron-phonon 
interact and the phonon spectrum rigorously. the electron- 
phonon interaction, indeed, lead to the format of the 
experiment observ phonon spectrum, and the afore- 
mention limit on the valu of the coupl constant be 
absent. 
there be superconductor with larg valu of the coupl 

constant (e.g., λ ≈ 2.6 for am-pb0.45bi0.55) (wolf, 2012). 
the combin of high characterist phonon frequenc 
and larg coupl constant can provid the high temperatur 
superconduct state. thi be the case for the sulfur hydrides, 
where such combin lead to a high valu of Tc (see 
sec. iv). 
note also that the complex structur of the phonon spectrum 

requir a modif of the usual method a discuss in 
sec. iv.b. 

B. function α2ðωþfðωþ: tunnel spectroscopi 

tunnel spectroscopi of ordinari metal be the uniqu 
power tool allow u to obtain import inform 
about the energi spectrum of a superconductor. To be more 
concrete, with the use of thi technique, one can measur 
the valu of the energi gap, which includ the case of the 
multigap structur of the spectrum (the case be relev to the 
hydrides, see sec. vi.d). moreover, it allow one to evalu 
such an import quantiti a the function α2ðωþfðωþ; see 
eqs. (3.1)–(3.4). 
the tunnel contact contain two electrod separ by 

a barrier. for the most interest case of the s-i-n system 
(S stand for a superconductor, N for a normal metal, and I for 
an insulator), one can obtain the follow relat [schrieffer, 

scalapino, and wilkins, 1963; see also the review by 
scalapino (1969)]: 

σs=σn ¼ jωj½jωj2 − δ2ðωþ�−1=2. ð3:11þ 
here σs be the tunnel conductivity, σs ¼ ∂j=∂v, j be the 
tunnel current, and V be the appli voltage. δðωþ 
correspond to the analyt continu of δðωnþ to the 
real axis, and σN be the conduct for the n-i-n junction. 
the valu of the energi gap ε0 be determin by ω ¼ δðiωþ. 
the quantiti σs=σn can be measur experiment [see 

eq. (3.11)]. sinc thi quantiti have a sharp peak at ω ¼ ε0, the 
tunnel can be use for measur the valu of the energi 
gap that correspond to the peak in the densiti of states. note 
that the observation, say, of two peak would manifest the 
presenc of the two energi gap (see sec. vi.d). 
the special invers procedure, allow one to recon- 

struct the function α2ðωþfðωþ and the valu of μ� be 
develop by mcmillan and rowel (1965) [see rowel 
(1969) and wolf (2012)]. usual the function α2ðωþfðωþ 
contain peaks; they correspond to peak in phonon densiti of 
states. note that, in turn, the function fðωþ can be measur 
independ by the neutron scatter technique. the 
coincid of the peak obtain by these two method 
(i.e., tunnel spectroscopi and neutron scattering) be crucial 
evid of the fact that the pairing, indeed, be caus by the 
phonon mechanism. 
for the sulfur hydrid the tunnel spectroscopi have not 

be perform yet. It would be interest to develop 
tunnel spectroscopi and determin the import function 
α2ðωþfðωþ for these new materials. 
note that the tunnel measur under pressur be 

perform by zavaritskii, itskevich, and voronovskii (1971) to 
studi properti of pb. asmentioned, thi method have not be 
use so far for sulfur hydrid and the function α2ðωþfðωþ and 
the energi gap have not be determin experimentally. In 
what follow we be use the result of sever theoret 
paper describ the calcul of α2ðωþfðωþ perform 
with use of the density-funct formal (see sec. iv.a). 

iv. sulfur hydrid 

A. phonon spectrum and the electron-phonon interact 

let u now turn our attent to the materi of interest, 
sulfur hydride. As noted, the cooper pair in the super- 
conduct state be provid by the electron-phonon inter- 
action and the main role be play by high-frequ optic 
modes. thi mechan be manifest in the larg valu of the 
isotop coeffici for substitut of deuterium for hydrogen 
(see sec. v). 
In principle, the valu of the critic temperatur can be 

evalu with the help of eqs. (3.1) and (3.3), which contain 
the function α2ðωþfðωþ. As mentioned, the tunnel mea- 
surement allow one to reconstruct thi function have not 
be perform yet. instead, we use result of the calcul 
carri out by sever groups. for example, fig. 6 show the 
function α2ðωþfðωþ calcul by duan et al. (2014) both for 
the high-tc phase (tc ¼ 203 K) and for the structur with the 
low valu of the critic temperatur (tc ≈ 120 k). for

rev. mod. phys., vol. 90, no. 1, january–march 2018 011001-7 



comparison, one can see the pictur for pb, the convent 
superconductor (fig. 5). the lattic dynam and super- 
conduct properti be treat with use of the density- 
function theori ( baroni et al., 2001) and the quantum 
expresso code (paolo, 2009). result for the function 
α2ðωþfðωþ be also give by durajski, szczesniak, and Li 
(2015), errea et al. (2015), and sano et al. (2016). As 
mentioned, all these calcul be base on the density- 
function formalism, but becaus of use differ code 
they differ in details, which lead to some spread in the 
numer results. nevertheless, the calcul densiti of 
state fðωþ and the function α2ðωþfðωþ be rather similar. 
one can see from fig. 6 that for sulfur hydrid the function 

α2ðωþfðωþ have a rather complic structure. indeed, in 
addit to acoust modes, it contain a number of optic 
phonons. moreover, becaus of high frequenc of optic 
modes, the phonon spectrum be broad and extend up to 
200 mev [fig. 5(c)]. 
As mention in sec. iii.a, the valu of the critic 

temperatur can be found without invok the coupl 
constant concept (akashi et al., 2015; errea et al., 2015; 
flores-livas, sanna, and gross, 2016; sano et al., 2016). such 
a program be carri out in the framework of the super- 
conduct density-funct theori (luder et al., 2005). 
errea et al. (2015) use the equation, similar to eq. (3.1) with 
the replacementjωnj → ½ω2n þ δ2ðωnþ�1=2 in the denomin 
of the integrand. thi equat be valid at ani temperature. the 
valu of Tc be calcul from such a nonlinear equat by 
success approximations. with each iter the valu of 

order paramet δðωnþ decreases, and Tc be identifi a the 
point (after up to 512 iterations) where the order paramet 
approach zero. 
accord to errea et al. (2015) and sano et al. (2016), an 

import role be play by anharmonicity. for example, 
take anharmon into account notic shift the valu 
of Tc by a much a up to ∼60 K: from Tc ≈ 260 K to Tc ≈ 
200 K in the high-tc phase. the role of anharmon and 
quantum effect be analyz with the use of the so-cal 
stochast self-consist harmon approximation, develop 
by errea, calandra, and mauri (2014). the impact of the zero 
point motion be analyz by bianconi and jarlborg (2015a) 
and sano et al. (2016). the effect of anharmon and zero 
point motion could be essential, becaus of the small mass of 
the hydrogen ions. the problem rais in the aforement 
paper deserv further study. 
As notic in the previou section, the concept of the 

coupl constant be fruit for studi convent 
superconductors. A similar approach be use by Li et al. 
(2014) and papaconstantopoulo et al. (2015) to calcul Tc 
for sulfur hydrides. sinc the valu of the total coupl 
constant be larg λ ≳ 2 (see fig. 6), they do not use eq. (3.8), 
but a more gener express (allen and dynes, 1975): 

Tc ¼ 
f1f2 ~ωlog 

1.2 
exp 

� 
− 1.04ð1þ λÞ 
λ − μ� − 0.62λμ� 

� 
. ð4:1þ 

equat (4.1) be similar to eq. (3.8), but the preexponenti 
factor be multipli by the product f1f2; the function f1 and 
f2 be numer fit for the solut valid at larg λ and have 
the follow form: 

f1 ¼ ½1þ ðλ=λ1þ3=2�1=3; 
f2 ¼ 1þ λ2ð ~ω=ωlog − 1þðλ2 þλ22þ−1; 
Λ1 ¼ 2.46ð1þ 3.8μ∗þ; 
Λ2 ¼ 1.82ð1þ 6.3μ∗þð ~ω=ωlogþ. 

the larg valu of the constant for the coupl to character- 
istic phonon frequenc lead to a high Tc close to that 
observ experimentally. 
the phonon spectrum of the sulfur hydrid be broad and 

rather complex: it contain a number of optic and acoust 
branches. On the other hand, these branch be well sepa- 
rated, and thi separ allow u to develop a differ 
approach, which will be describ in the next section. 

B. gener equat and two coupl constant 

In a more gener approach (gor’kov and kresin, 2016) the 
valu of Tc be evalu analytically. As will be shown, it 
allow u to compar the rel contribut of the optic 
and acoust mode for differ part of the phase diagram. 
the phonon spectrum contain two well-separ fre- 

quenci interv for the optic and acoust branches. let 
u introduc the coupl constant λopt and λac for each of 

these region and the correspond averag frequenc ~ωopt 
and ~ωac. then the equat for the order paramet at T ¼ Tc 
take the follow form [cf. eq. (3.5)]:

phonon coupl constant λðωþ (dash lines) for the low-tc and

limit: (a) the function α2ðωþfðωþ and λðωþ for the low-tc 
phase. (b) the function α2ðωþfðωþ and λðωþ for the high-tc 
phase. units: dimensionless quantiti α2ðωþfðωþ and λðωþ 
(horizont axis) and the phonon frequenc (vertic axis). the 
acoust and optic branch be separ at ∼15 thz. from 
duan et al., 2014.

the critic temperatur must be calcul with the use of 
eq. (4.2). thi equat be the gener of eq. (3.5) for 
the presenc of two phonon groups, the acoust and opti- 
cal modes. 

C. critic temperatur for differ phase 

let u assum that in the high Tc phase (im-3m) λopt ≫ λac. 
We also suppos that λopt ≲ 1.5. As will be shown, these 
condit be inde satisfied. from eqs. (4.2) and (4.2’) one 
can obtain express for Tc in an analyt form and, hence, 
evalu the valu of the critic temperatur for the sulfur 
hydrides. 
let u write Tc a 

Tc ¼ t0c þ δtacc ; t0c ≡ toptc ; ð4:3þ 
and assum that δtacc ≪ t0c. base on eq. (4.2), with the use 
of these assumptions, one can obtain the follow analyt 
express for the critic temperatur of the high-tc phase 
(gor’kov and kresin, 2016): 

Tc ¼ 
� 
1þ 2 λac 

λopt − μ�

1þ ðπt0c=ωacþ2 
� 
t0c. ð4:4þ 

for t0c, one can use the mcmillan-dyn express 
[eq. (3.8)], which be valid for λopt ≲ 1.5: 

t0c ¼ ð ~ωopt=1.2þ exp 
� 
− 1.04ð1þ λoptþ 
λopt − μ�ð1þ 0.62λoptþ 

� 
. ð4:5þ 

one can use the close expression, obtain analyt by 
geilikman, kresin, and masharov (1975), valid also for 
λopt ≲ 1.5: 

t0c ≈ ~ωopt exp 
� 
− 1þ 1.5λopt 
λopt − μ�ð1þ 0.5λoptþ 

� 
. ð4:6þ 

As be know the coeffici in eq. (4.5) be select to fit 
the data for nb. As for eq. (4.6), it be obtain use the 
analyt solut of eq. (3.5). note that these express be 
rather similar. indeed, by neglect μ� for simplicity, one can 
write eqs. (4.5) and (4.6) in the form Tc ≈ A expð−1=λoptþ, 
with close valu of the preexponenti factor. 

for ordinari superconductor the valu of the coupl 
constant and μ� (usual μ � ≈0.1–0.15) can be determin 
from tunnel spectroscopi measur ( wolf, 2012). for 
sulfur hydride, we deduc the coupl constant λopt and λac 
from sever theoret calcul of α2ðωþfðωþ. although 
the correspond theoret result differ somewhat, they be 
rel close. the valu of λopt and λac can be directli 
determin from λðωþ (fig. 6).we estim λopt ≈ 1.5 and 
λac ≈ 0.5; see fig. 6(b). We assum that λopt ≲ 1.5 and 
λopt ≫ λac. one can see that the obtain valu be consist 
with these approximations. use these coupl constant 
and take the valu ~ωopt ¼ 1700 K and ~ωac ¼ 450 K 
[μ� ≈ 0.14, which be close to that for usual superconductor 
and be also calcul by flores-livas, sanna, and gross 
(2016)], we obtain t0c ≡ toptc ¼ 170 K and δtacc ¼ 45 K, so 
that in total Tc ≈ 215 K, in quit good agreement with the 
valu of Tc ≈ 203 K observ by drozdov et al. (2015). the 
main contribut come from the optic phonons; thi 
confirm the self-consist of our approach. 
the fact that the coupl constant λopt in the cubic phase be 

so larg be the key factor underli the observ high 
Tc ≈ 203 K. qualitatively, thi come about due to the abil 
of sulfur to retain sever hydrogen atom in it proximity, that 
is, to the presenc of mani light ligand near the S atoms. 
there be six ligand in the high-tc phase [see fig. 3(c)]. 
To demonstr the import of thi point, let u evalu 

the valu of Tc for the low-tc phase (r3m structure). one can 
see from fig. 6(a) (duan et al., 2014) that the coupl 
constant for thi phase be λopt ≈ λac ≈ 1. It be interest that 
in thi case the valu of the total coupl constant λT ¼ 
λopt þ λac ≈ 2 and be close to that in the high-tc phase. 
however, the rel contribut be shift toward low 
frequencies; the valu of λac be larg for the low-tc phase. In 
thi case Tc < ~ωac ≪ ~ωopt, and one can estim Tc within the 
usual bc logarithm approxim while add the 
renorm function Z ≈ 1þ λT into the expon 
(grimvall, 1981) 

Tc ≈ ð ~ωoptþλopt=λt ð ~ωacþλac=λt exp 
� 
− 1þ λT 
λT − μ� 

� 
. ð4:7þ 

with ~ωopt ≈ 105 mev, ~ωac ≈ 26 mev (duan et al., 2014), we 
obtain Tc ≈ 120 K. 
the transit into the high-tc phase be accompani by the 

redistribut of the interact of electron with optic 
phonon and their interact with acoust branches. thi 
redistribut be manifest in an increas in a number of 
hydrogen ligands, caus by the structur transition. thi be a 
key factor determin a record high valu of tc. 
divid the phonon spectrum and, correspondingly, the 

electron-phonon interact into two part turn out to be 
rather fruitful. first, the valu of λopt be within the rang of 
applic of eq. (4.5). moreover, one can evalu the 
rel contribut of the optic and acoust branch of 
the phonon spectrum to tc. for the high-tc phase the 
contribut from the optic phonon compris ∼80% and 
onli ∼20% be due to the acoust part. the impact of acoust

phonon be notic small than that of optic branch 
(45 v 170 k), but still be essential. 
the method propos can be of relev for other 

materi a well. A promis exampl be calcium hydrid 
cah6 (see sec. vii.a). 
It be know that for a number of superconductor the valu of 

the electron-phonon coupl constant be large, among them Pb 
(λ ≈ 1.55), Hg (λ ≈ 1.6), and ampb0.45bi0.55 (λ ≈ 2.6); see, 
e.g.,wolf (2012). however, becaus of low valu of character- 
istic phonon frequencies, the valu of the critic temperatur 
for them be not large. A uniqu of the hydrid be that they 
combin the strong coupling, especi to optic modes, with 
high valu of the characterist frequencies. 

V. isotop effect 

accord to drozdov et al. (2015), the substitut of 
deuterium for hydrogen notic affect the valu of the 
critic temperature. observ of thi isotop effect be of 
fundament importance, sinc it prof (a) that the high-tc 
state be caus by the electron-phonon interaction, and (b) that 
the high frequenc hydrogen mode determin the valu of tc. 
indeed, the optic mode be mainli due to the motion of 
hydrogen, wherea for the acoust mode the particip of 
sulfur ion prevails. therefor the magnitud of the isotop 
shift for the deuterium for hydrogen substitut indirectli 
reflect the rel contribut of each group (the optic 
versu acoust ones) into the observ tc. defin the 
isotop coeffici via Tc ∝ m−α one can obtain the follow 
express for α (gor’kov and kresin, 2016): 

α ¼ −ðm=tcþð∂tc=∂ ~ωþð∂ ~ω=∂mþ. ð5:1þ 
sinc the deuterium substitut affect the optic modes, 

one can write eq. (5.1) in the follow form (in the harmon 
approximation, ~Ω ∝ m−1=2): 

α ¼ 0.5ð ~ωopt=tcþð∂tc=∂ ~ωoptþ. ð5:2þ 
the valu of the isotop coeffici in the high-tc phase can 
be calcul with the use of eqs. (4.4) and (5.2). As a result, 
we obtain 

α ≈ 
1

�

� 
. ð5:3þ 

here ρ¼ ~ωac=πt0c. with λopt≈1.5, λac≈0.5, and ~ωac≈450k, 
we obtain α ≈ 0.35, in a good agreement with the exper- 
iment data in fig. 4. 
one should use a differ expression, eq. (4.7), for Tc in 

the low-tc phase. then, with the use of eq. (5.2), one can find 
α ≈ 0.25, which be notic small than that for the high-tc 
phase. note that the agreement between the valu obtain 
from eq. (5.3) and the experiment data be rather good for the 
high-tc phase. As for the low-tc phase, the data be not so 
well determined. It would be interest to perform the 
measur at low pressures, at the valu more distant 
from the region of the transit into the high-tc phase. As 
mention in sec. ii.b, at low pressur a format of the 
h3 phase occur [see eq. (2.1)]. accord to akashi et al. 
(2016), the transform occur through intermedi 

structures. In other words, we be deal with the coexist 
of phase and the percol scenario, so the percol 
threshold correspond to the format of the so-cal infinit 
cluster, that is, to the metal state. As a result, the r3m phase 
contain some inclusions. then one can expect the pressur 
depend of the isotop coeffici insid of the r3m phase. 
note that the usual analyt deriv of the valu of the 

isotop coeffici be carri out under the assumpt that 
the ionic mass be a continu variable. It be essenti that the 
obtain valu of α appear to be independ of M. It allow 
one to use it for differ valu of the ionic mass, even though 
the late have discret values. qualit thi mean that the 
shift in the valu of Tc stay the same within the phase, so that 
the depend Tc (p) for differ isotop be parallel to 
each other. for example, in our case the shift be describ by 
thc =tdc ¼ ðmd=mhþα. In the high-tc phase α ≈ 0.35, and, 
therefore, thc =tdc ≈ 1.25. sinc thc ¼ 203 K, we obtain 
tdc ≈ 165 K. thi valu be in rather good agreement with 
the measur by drozdov et al. (2015). 
the valu of the isotop coeffici in the high-tc phase be 

rel larg and it reflect the fact that the pair in thi 
phase be domin by the optic H modes, wherea in the 
low-tc phase the contribut of the optic and acoust 
mode be comparable. the impact of the isotop substitut 
in the region of small Tc be weaker than in the high-tc phase. 
A small α be in agreement with the larg role play by the 
optic phonon in the cubic high-tc phase 
note that the valu of α can be affect by the anharmo- 

niciti (errea et al., 2015) and by the depend of μ� on ~ωopt, 
although the last contribut be of the order of ðμ�=λoptþ2 and 
be small. however, the main conclus that the valu of the 
isotop coeffici depend on pressur and be differ in 
differ phase remain valid and reflect the rel con- 
tribut of the optic and acoust modes. 

vi. energi spectrum OF the high-tc phase: 
two-gap structur and nonmonoton 
depend OF Tc 

A. structur transition: high-tc phase 

asmentioned, the pressur depend be highli asymmetr 
rel to it maximum valu tc;max ¼ 203 K. the valu of 
Tc ≈ 120 K atp ≈ 125 gpa sharpli increas totc ≈ 200 K at 
P ≈ 150 gpa (drozdov et al., 2015; einaga et al., 2016). 
A rapid increas in Tc be follow by a slow decreas at 
P > pcr ≈ 150 gpa (fig. 4). remarkably, the structur tran- 
sition into the high Tc phase take place somewher in the same 
pressur interv where it be accompani by a sharp increas in 
the valu of the critic temperature. currently, it be gener 
accept that the bravai lattic of the high Tc and low Tc 
phase belong to differ symmetri (the im-3m group for the 
high-tc cubic phase and the trigon r3m symmetri group for 
the low Tc phase) and that the structur phase transit 
between them occur at a pressur somewher in between 
P ≤ 150 and P ≥ 125 gpa. the sharp of the increas 
prompt the question whether transit into the high Tc phase 
could be a first-ord transition. thi scenario be discuss by 
gor’kov and kresin (2017) with the use of the group theori and 

lev P. gor’kov and vladimir Z. kresin: colloquium: high pressur and road to room … 

rev. mod. phys., vol. 90, no. 1, january–march 2018 011001-10 



take into consider the impact of lattic deformations. 
the pictur be similar to those consid by larkin and pikin 
(1969) and late by barzykin and gor’kov (2009): the coupl 
to lattic can transform the second-ord transit into the 
transit of the first order. the idea of the first-ord transit 
allow u to explain self-consist the slow decreas in Tc 
with an increas in pressur abov the pressur pcr correspond- 
ing to the maximum of Tc ¼ 203 K. the appear of the 
two-gap spectrum be an import ingredi of the pictur (see 
sec. vi.d). 
accord to the band structur calcul (duan et al., 

2014; akashi et al., 2015; errea et al., 2015, 2016; heil and 
boeri, 2015; flores-livas, sanna, and gross, 2016), the high- 
Tc compound be character by broad energi band (larg 
fermi surface) and strong interact between electron and 
high-frequ optic phonons. the calcul valu of Tc 
and the isotop coeffici be in good agreement with the 
experiment data (see secs. iv.c and v). 
meanwhile, the calcul also reveal the presenc in 

the high Tc phase of small fermi pockets. the import of 
their exist be emphas by bianconi and jarlborg 
(2015a, 2015b), who suggest that the pocket play a special 
role in increas tc. note, however, that the analysi of the 
electron-phonon mediat pair on pocket should be 
carri out with consider care. let u discu thi point 
in more detail. 

B. migdal adiabat criterion and small pocket 

the complex structur of the fermi surfac with small 
pocket emerg in addit to sever larg fermi sheet be 
not uncommon for mani novel superconductor such, for 
instance, a the high Tc oxides, low-dimension organ 
conductors, the so-cal heavi fermion (gor’kov, 2012). 
here we focu on the possibl impact of small pocket on the 
superconduct in hydrides. 
the main equation, eq. (3.1) be valid if the so-cal 

adiabat paramet ð ~ω=efþ be small ( ~ω=ef ≪ 1) [migdal 
(1958), see also the review by scalapino (1969)]. then one 
can neglect all high order correct (the so-cal “vertex 
corrections”), contain the product of the matrix element 
of the electron-phonon interaction. then the right-hand side of 
the equat for the order paramet be linear in the coupl 
constant λ [see eq. (3.5) and also eq. (3.6)].the valu of the 
coupl constant be express by eq. (3.10). accord to 
migdal (1958), the correct to eq. (3.1) contain an addi- 
tional term ∝ λ3ð ~ω=efþ. 
therefore, the inequ ~Ω ≪ EF allow u to neglect the 

high order corrections. If ~ω≳ ef, one should includ the 
contribut of all high terms. but the rigor calcul 
of even the second term (grimaldi, pietronero, and strassler, 
1995) appear to be a nontrivi task. At thi point we meet with 
the problem, which at the present time remain unresolved. 
the case of the weak electron-phonon coupl (λ ≪ 1) be 

the except (gor’kov, 2016). becaus of the small of λ, 
the vortex correct can be neglected. 
the condit ~ω=ef ≪ 1 be satisfi for most convent 

superconductors, sinc usual in metal the fermi energi be 
larg compar with the deby energi EF ≫ ~Ω ∼ ωd. 

however, thi be not the case for pocket in the sulfur 
hydrides, sinc for these materi the characterist frequenc 
of optic mode ~ωopt ≈ ð1.5–2þ100 mev, wherea the fermi 
energi of a pocket be of the order of ≈40–50 mev. the 
electron-phonon interact on the pocket can be rigor 
treat onli in the case of weak coupling, that is, if the 
correspond coupl constant λP ≪ 1. 

C. wide energi band and pocket 

the calcul spectrum of electron display small pocket 
onli insid of the high Tc phase and it may be tempt to 
relat the high valu of Tc to the appear of the pocket 
(bianconi and jarlborg, 2015a, 2015b; quan and pickett, 
2016). In thi scenario, the major pair interact occur on 
the pockets. As for the electron-phonon interact on the 
larg bands, it be weak and play onli a secondari role. 
At thi point it be worth note that the calcul of Tc 

perform assum the prevail role of the larg band and 
suffici strong coupl be in good agreement with the 
experiment data (see sec. iv), so that there be no special need 
for modifi the picture. besid that, if one be tri to 
assign the lead role to pockets, then it be clear that the on- 
pocket interact should be rather strong in order to provid 
high tc. however, in thi case the rigor treatment be not 
known, becaus of the violat of the migdal theorem. On the 
other hand, if the main contribut into the interact be 
come from the larg bands, then the contribut of the 
pocket could be assum weak, and the case could be 
analyz self-consistently. 
note also, and thi be a strong argument, that if the lead 

role of pocket be due to a peak in their densiti of states, 
thi would produc a prefactor in the express for Tc of an 
electron origin. however, such a prefactor cannot depend on 
the ionic mass in strong contradict with the observ 
isotop effect (drozdov et al., 2015). 

D. two-gap spectrum: slow decreas in Tc at P > pcr 

In the superconduct state the pocket be character 
by the energi gap in their electron spectrum. next we 
consid such a two-gap model with one gap correspond to 
the wide band and the second gap describ the excit 
on the pocket. 
the two-gap model be introduc shortli after the 

creation of the bc theori (suhl, matthias, and walker, 
1959; moskalenko, 1959). from what follows, we stipul 
that under the notion of the two-gap spectrum we mean the 
presenc of two peak in the densiti of states. 
each band have it own set of cooper pairs. sinc a singl 

pair be form by two electron with equal and opposit 
momenta, one can neglect pair between electron belong- 
ing to differ bands. indeed, in general, the electron on the 
fermi level, which belong to differ bands, have differ 
valu of the momenta. however, in the two-band model, the 
absenc of the interband pair do not mean that the pair 
within each band be insensit to the presenc of the other 
band. indeed, the presenc of the second band give rise to an 
addit pair channel. namely, the electron origin 
locat on the first band can radiat a phonon and make the 

lev P. gor’kov and vladimir Z. kresin: colloquium: high pressur and road to room … 

rev. mod. phys., vol. 90, no. 1, january–march 2018 011001-11 



virtual transit into the second band. the second electron 
can absorb the phonon and also make a transit into the 
second band form the pair with the first electron. 
therefore, owe to the interband electron-phonon scatter 
the on-the-pocket electron can form the cooper pair on the 
larg fermi surfac and vice versa. 
let u stress one import point. As noted, the two-gap 

model be introduc shortli after the creation of the bc 
theory. nevertheless, the two-gap phenomenon have not be 
essenti for the convent superconductors. thi be due to 
the larg coher length; more specifically, the inequ 
l ≪ ξ (l be the mean free path), which hold for the usual 
superconductors, lead to the averag caus by the inter- 
band impur scattering. As a result, the two-gap pictur be 
wash out and the usual one-gap pictur be applicable. 
the two-gap spectrum be observ for the first time in the 

nb-dope srtio3 system (binnig et al., 1980) with the use of 
the scan tunnel microscop technique. the second gap 
appear a a result of dope and fill the second gap. At 
present, the two-gap pictur be an import featur of the 
novel superconduct systems, and thi be due to their short 
coher length. It be observ in the cuprat (geerk, 
xi, and linder, 1988), in mgb2 (uchiyama et al., 2002; 
tsuda et al., 2003); see the review by kresin, morawitz, and 
wolf (2014). 
At the formul of the two-gap model for the high-tc 

phase of sulfur hydrid one can introduc three coupl 
constants: λl, respons for strong electron-phonon inter- 
action on the larg band, λP ≪ 1 (weak coupl on the 
pockets), and λlp ≪ 1, describ the transit from larg 
band electron to the pair state on the pockets. the 
coupl constant λl, λp, and λlp be describ by 
eq. (3.10); the constant λlp contain the matrix element 
describ the interband transit caus by the electron- 
phonon interaction. note also that, becaus of the interband 
transitions, the system have the common temperatur of the 
superconduct transit tc. In addition, their presenc be 
benefici for superconductivity. 
perform the calcul (gor’kov and kresin, 2016), 

one can show that the shift in Tc caus by the presenc of 
pocket be proport to the densiti of the state on the 
pocket δtc ∝ νpðefþ 
We now return to the problem of the strong asymmetri in 

the pressur depend of Tc rel to the posit of it 
maximum valu at tc;max ≃ 203 K (at pcr ≃ 150 gpa) pose 
in sec. ii.c. assum that the sharp increas in Tc (from Tc ≈ 
120 K to tc;max ≈ 200 K) be the result of the first-ord 
structur transit into the high-tc cubic phase. thi phase 
be character by the coexist of wide band (respons 
for the larg part of the fermi surface) and small pockets. 
As mentioned, the interact between the larg band and 

the pocket lead to the shift in the temperatur of transit 
δtc ¼ Tc − tc0, which be proport to the densiti of state 
on the pocket νpðefþ ∝ mppf;poc, where mP and pf;poc be 
the effect mass and momentum for the pocket’ states, and 
tc0 be the valu of the critic temperatur in the absenc of the 
pockets. It be essenti that the pocket appear instantly, a a 
result of the discontinu first-ord transit or the tran- 
sition into the high-tc phase either be of the second order or be 

of a topolog natur at which the pocket’ size would grow 
continu with the further increas in pressure. 
We have give argument in favor of the first-ord tran- 

sition, which be accompani by the emerg singular in the 
densiti of state in the form of pockets. the further increas in 
pressur lead to shrink of the pocket with an effect 
decreas in their fermi momentum pf;poc and the correspond- 
ing depress of the two-gap picture. sinc the two-gap 
scenario be benefici for superconductivity, such a depress 
lead to a decreas in tc. thi explain the observ slow 
decreas in Tc after the transition; the small scale of the 
decreas intc atp > pcr be relat to small valu of λP and λlp 
the two-gap spectrum and it evolut with pressur 

includ the decreas in the amplitud of the second gap 
at P > pcr must be confirm by futur tunnel experi- 
ments. the presenc of the second energi gap will be 
manifest a the second peak in the densiti of states. 

vii. other hydrid 

the s-h system appear to be the first hydrid which 
display a record high valu of tc. We describ (sec. ii) the 
develop of the field. let u discu here sever other 
studi hydrides, which display interest and promis 
properties. 
As be emphas in the introduct and sec. iv, 

the theoret studi contain predict of specif 
hydrid along with valu of Tc and the pressur deserv 
special credit. In thi section we will be talk about 
promis compounds. As mentioned, the group of Y. Ma 
make a veri import predict relat to sulfur hydrid 
(li et al., 2014). thi group make sever other interest 
predictions, which be wait their futur confirm 
[peng et al., 2017; see the review by zhang et al. (2017)]. 
they predict the high-tc superconduct state for calcium 
hydrid (tc ≈ 240 K) (wang et al., 2012; wang and ma, 
2014) and for yh6 (tc ≈ 264 K) (li et al., 2015). note that 
the compound mgh6 similar to cah6 be also studi (feng 
et al., 2015) and the valu of Tc ≈ 260 K at P≳ 300 gpa 
be predicted. even high valu of Tc be obtain by 
szczesniak and durajski (2016). the next section contain the 
descript of the calcium hydrid and mgh6; these be 
exampl of the futur high-tc compounds. 

A. calcium hydride, mgh6 

calcium hydrid cah6 be analyz by wang et al. (2012) 
and look veri promising. wang et al. evalu it structur 
and the function α2ðωþfðωþ (fig. 7). base on the numer 
solut of eqs. (3.1) and (3.3), they predict that at 
pressur P ≈ 150 gpa the valu of Tc will be high than 
that for h3s. 
the valu of Tc for cah6 can be evalu with use of 

eqs. (4.2) and (4.4). indeed, in accord with an approach 
describ in sec. iv.b, the electron-phonon interact can be 
separ into two parts. from fig. 7 one can determin that 
λopt ≈ 2.1, λac ≈ 0.6, ~ωac ¼ 350 sm−1, and ~ωopt ¼ 820 sm−1. 
correspondingly, one can write Tc ¼ t0c þ δtacc , where 
t0c ≡ toptc be determin by the contribut of the optic 

lev P. gor’kov and vladimir Z. kresin: colloquium: high pressur and road to room … 

rev. mod. phys., vol. 90, no. 1, january–march 2018 011001-12 



modes. however, becaus of the larg valu of λopt, the 
macmillan-dyn express for t0c [eq. (4.5)] be not appli- 
cabl (it be valid for λopt ≲ 1.5). one can use the modifi 
macmillan equation, eq. (4.1), valid for larg λ. anoth 
option be to use the analyt expression, valid for ani valu of 
the coupl constant (kresin, 1987; kresin and wolf, 2009): 

t0c ¼ 
0.25 ~ωopt 

½e2=λeff − 1�1=2 ; 
λeff ¼ ðλopt − μ�þ½1þ 2μ� þ λoptμ�tðλoptþ�−1; 
tðxþ ¼ 1.5 expð−0.28xþ. ð7:1þ 

with the use of eq. (7.1) and the paramet for cah6, we 
obtain Tc ≈ 230 K. thi valu contain the contribut of 
the optic (t0c) and acoust (δtc) modes: t0c ≈ 180 K and 
δtc ≈ 50 K. therefore, the optic and acoust mode 
contribut 78% and 22% to the total valu of the critic 
temperature, correspondingly. As for the isotop coefficient, 
one can obtain from eq. (5.3) the valu α ≈ 0.36; it be close to 
that for the high phase of the sulfur hydrides. 
the hydrid mgh6 studi by feng et al. (2015) and 

szczesniak and durajski (2016) have properti similar to those 
for the calcium hydride. the structur contain the sodalitelik 
hydrogen cage with interstiti Ca (mg) atom (fig. 7). thi be 
not occasional, sinc the Mg and Ca atom have similar 
chemic properties. As mentioned, the predict valu of Tc 
be even high than for sulfur hydrides. 

B. palladium hydrid 

In principle, palladium hydrid (pd-h) be not a new 
superconductor. It be discov by stritzer and buckel 
(1972); it Tc ≈ 8–10 K. thi hydrid be know by the valu 
of the isotop coefficient, which appear to be negative. 
thi phenomenon be explain by strong anharmon 
(ganzuly, 1973; klein and cohen, 1992), namely, by the 
peculiar depend of the phonon frequenc on ionic mass. 

accord to the studi by sy et al. (2016), one can 
observ the superconduct state of pd-h at high temper- 
atur (tc ≈ 54 K for pd-h and Tc ≈ 60 K for pd-d; the 
isotop coeffici be negative, a for the usual compound). It 
be import that such an increas in Tc have be observ at 
the ambient pressure. It occurs, thank to a special sampl 
preparation, namely, becaus of fast cool of the hydride. 
the result look interesting, becaus the superconduct 

state persist up to high temperatur at ambient pressure. they 
observ a drastic drop in resistance. however, the meissner 
effect have not be demonstr yet, a well a the impact of 
the magnet field on tc. Of course, it would be interest if 
futur experi confirm the presenc of superconduct 
at elev temperatures. 

C. transit of ice under high pressur and by dope 

In general, the transit of an insul into a metal state 
can proceed through two channels: either via dope (e.g., 
high-tc cuprates, fullerides) or by an increas in pressur 
(e.g., hydrides). the recent paper by flores-livas, sanna et al. 
(2016) be interesting, becaus they consid theoret the 
transition, caus by a combin of these channels. they 
studi the properti of h2o, which can be transfer into a 
solid phase (ice) by appli pressur (up to P ≈ 150 gpa). 
the crystal continu to be an insul at thi pressure. It be 
propos that the sampl in the solid phase can be dope by 
nitrogen. the calcul demonstr that, a a result of such 
a dope under pressure, the materi becom metal and 
even superconduct with a rather high valu of Tc ≈ 60 K. 
note that at ambient pressur and also at low pressur (up to 

P ≈ 110 gpa) the oxygen ion have four hydrogen neighbor 
(so-cal phase i). two of these neighbor be coval 
bond with oxygen and form the h2o molecule, and the 
other two ion form addit hydrogen bonds. the length 
of the bond be differ and the structur be asymmetric. 
however, at high pressur (of the order of P ≈ 300 gpa) 
the so-cal ice X phase be form and it be character by 
symmetr o-h bond (goncharov et al., 1999). 
As noted, at P ≈ 150 gpa the ice crystal be still in the 

insul state. To prompt a transit into a metal state one 
need to use dope and it turn out that nitrogen be the best 
dopant. the nitrogen for the oxygen substitut lead to the 
hole conductivity. moreover, the transit into a metal state 
be accompani by chang in the phonon spectrum. all these 
chang provid the transit into a superconduct state. 
the calcul show that the best valu of the superconduct- 
ing paramet correspond to rel low dope (4%–6%). 
the calcul α2ðωþfðωþ function lead to the valu 
of Tc ≈ 60 K. Of course, thi valu be below Tc ≈ 203 K 
observ for the h3 phase of sulfur hydride, but still be rather 
high. 
the idea of combin high pressur and dope be eleg 

and look promising. one have to wait and see whether the 
futur experi will confirm thi interest prediction. 

D. organ hydrid 

the presenc of hydrogen and correspond high vibra- 
tional frequenc be benefici for the format of the 

fig. 7. superconduct calcium hydride: (a) structur of 
cah6; (b) the spectral function α2ðωþfðωþ for cah6. from

superconduct state. As note in the previou section, 
it can be manifest even at ambient pressure. In conne- 
ction with this, the recent discoveri of superconduct 
in the organ compound, consist of C and H elements, 
so-cal poly(p-phenylene) and dope with potassium 
(wang et al., 2017) look promising. the valu of Tc be 
rather high (tc ≈ 120 k); thi valu be the high among 
organ superconductors. organ be a rel young 
famili of superconduct materials. the first organ 
superconductor be discov by jerom et al. (1980): 
the complex materi ðtmtsfþ2pf6 display the properti 
at Tc ≈ 0.9 K under the pressur of around 9 kbar. the 
recent discoveri be make by wang et al. in the high- 
pressur laboratory, but the effect be observ at ambient 
pressure. the mechan of superconduct in thi new 
materi and an impact of the hydrogen bond and high- 
frequenc mode should be studi in full detail. As a 
whole, thi new class of organ hydrid look import 
and deserv further study. 

viii. main challeng 

the recent discoveri of the record-break high-tc com- 
pound, sulfur hydride, signifi the arriv of a novel famili of 
high temperatur superconductors: the hydrides. even high 
valu of Tc can be expected. that is, it final becom 
realist to envis the detect of superconduct at room 
temperatures. the search for novel hydrid with still high 
valu of Tc (includ cah6, yh6) be an import direct 
of futur research. 
more detail x-ray diffract of sulfur hydrid will 

establish the posit of the sulfur atom with high accuraci 
and clarifi the natur of the phase transit between the 
low-tc and high-tc phases. 
develop of tunnel spectroscopi of the high-tc 

hydrid be anoth import forthcom task. becaus of 
the larg valu of Tc and the energi gap, the tunnel iðvþ 
characterist need to be measur for a wider energi interv 
a compar to that for convent superconductors. but 
similar measur have be perform for the high-tc 
cuprat by aminov et al. (1994) and ponomarev et al. (1999) 
with the use of the break junction technique, and by lee et al. 
(2006) with scan tunnel spectroscopy; see the review 
by kresin and wolf (2009). therefor tunnel spectroscopi 
should be success applic for sulfur hydrid a well. 
As a result, it will be possibl to reconstruct the α2ðωþfðωþ 
function a well a to determin the coulomb pseudopotenti 
μ�. tunnel spectroscopi can also be employ for meas- 
ure other import paramet of the system, includ the 
energi gap, and for observ the multigap structur and it 
evolut with pressur (see sec. vi). 
and, of course, follow detail studi of the structur of 

the high-tc phase under pressure, there remain the most 
intrigu question: Is it possibl to creat analog struc- 
ture stabl at ambient pressure? 

ix. conclud remark 

the discoveri of pressure-induc superconduct in the 
hydrid famili open new prospect in research on high 

temperatur superconductivity. In thi colloquium we 
focu mainli on the theoret aspect of thi new 
development. 
from a fundament point of view, it be remark that the 

high-tc superconduct state manifest itself under such 
extrem experiment conditions. sulfur hydrid offer a 
remark combin of strong electron-phonon coupl 
and high optical-phonon frequencies. As long a the 
migdal adiabat criterion be not violated, observ of 
superconduct at even high temperatur now can be 
anticipated. 
there are, however, novel featur which necessit 

signific deviat from the convent migdal- 
eliashberg approach. first, the hydrid phonon spectrum be 
quit broad (up to 200 mev) and contain both optic and 
acoust modes. We propos that the electron-phonon inter- 
action can be treat with the use of the gener equat (4.2) 
by employ two coupl constant λopt and λac togeth 
with two correspond averag frequencies. thi lead to an 
analyt express for Tc applic to a number of case 
and permit analysi of other relev factor for differ 
phases, eq. (4.4). 
the experiment observ isotop effect (deuterium- 

hydrogen substitution) turn out to be not univers in the 
sens that the isotop coeffici depend on the pressur and 
have distinct valu for differ phases. We show that thi 
reflect the rel contribut of optic and acoust 
modes. 
We point out that the sharp increas in Tc (from ≈120 up to 

≈200 K over a narrow pressur interv near ≈150 gpa) be a 
signatur of a first-ord structur transit into the high-tc 
phase. thi pictur also explain the curious slow decreas 
in Tc at P > pcr. 
It be predict in a number of theoret paper that the 

transit into the high-tc phase be accompani by the 
appear of addit small fermi pockets. As a conse- 
quence, a two-gap structur appears. It should be observ 
by tunnel spectroscopy, which also will be use for 
determin of the characterist function α2ðωþfðωþ. 
It may be expect that there should exist other hydrid 

capabl of display a high-tc superconduct state under 
pressure, possibl with even high valu of Tc all the way up 
to room temperature. but the most challeng question 
relat to the possibl of creat superconduct structur 
stabl at ambient pressure. In thi regard, we be encourag 
by the recent observ by sy et al. (2016) of the 
superconduct state of pd-h at temperatur ≈ 54 and 
≈60 K for pd-d.
