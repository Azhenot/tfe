abstract 

traffic wave be phenomenon that emerg when the vehicular densiti exce a critic threshold. consid the 
presenc of increasingli autom vehicl in the traffic stream, a number of research activ have focu on the 
influenc of autom vehicl on the bulk traffic flow. In the present article, we demonstr experiment that 
intellig control of an autonom vehicl be abl to dampen stop-and-go wave that can aris even in the absenc of 
geometr or lane chang triggers. precisely, our experi on a circular track with more than 20 vehicl show 
that traffic wave emerg consistently, and that they can be dampen by control the veloc of a singl vehicl in 
the flow. We compar metric for velocity, brake events, and fuel economi across experiments. these experiment 
find suggest a paradigm shift in traffic management: flow control will be possibl via a few mobil actuat (less 
than 5%) long befor a major of vehicl have autonom capabilities.

1.1. motiv 

the dynam of traffic flow includ instabl a densiti increases, where small perturb amplifi and grow 
into stop-and-go wave that travel backward along the road [1, 2, 3, 4]. these so-cal phantom traffic jam be an 
experiment reproduc phenomenon, a demonstr in differ experi [2, 5, 6]. common wave trigger 
includ lane chang [7, 8, 9], but they can even be gener in the absenc of ani lane changes, bottlenecks, merges, 
or chang in grade [2, 5]. moreover, these wave can be captur in microscop model of individu vehicl motion 
[10, 11, 12] (see also the review [13, 14, 15]) and macroscop model describ via solut to continuum problem 
[3, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. sinc these wave emerg from the collect dynam of the driver on the road, they be in 
principl avoid if one could affect the way peopl drive. recogn the rapid technolog innov in traffic 
state estim and control, thi work provid experiment evid that these wave can be reduc by control 
a small number of vehicl in the traffic stream.

A necessari precursor to dissip traffic wave be to detect them in real-time. advanc in traffic state 
estim [21, 22, 23] have facilit high resolut traffic monitoring, through the advent of gp smartphon 
sensor [24, 25, 26, 27] that be part of the flow—term lagrangian or mobil sensors. now commerci by 
sever major navig services, the use of a small number of gp equip vehicl in the traffic stream have 
dramat chang how traffic be monitor for consumer-fac mobil services, which previous reli on 
predominantli fix sens infrastructure. 

currently, traffic control be domin by control strategi that reli on actuat at fix locat or be cen- 
tralized. such system includ variabl speed advisori (vsa) or variabl speed limit (vsl) [28, 29, 30, 31, 32], 
which be commonli implement through sign on overhead gantries, and ramp meter [33, 34, 35], which reli 
on traffic signal on freeway entranc ramps. more recently, coordin system to integr both ramp meter and 
variabl speed limit have be propos [36, 37, 38, 39]. A common challeng of vsl and ramp meter system be 
the small flexibl of the system due to the high cost of instal of the fix infrastructure, which consequ 
limit the spatial resolut of the control input. 

recent advanc in vehicular autom and commun technolog provid new possibl and 
opportun for traffic control in which these smart vehicl act a lagrangian actuat of the bulk traffic steam. 
when a seri of adjac vehicl on a roadway be connect and automated, it be possibl to form dens platoon 
of vehicl which leav veri small gaps. A key challeng for vehicl platoon be to design control law in which the 
vehicl platoon remain stable, for which signific theoret and practic progress have be make [40, 41, 42, 
43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48]. In contrast to the vehicl platoon setting, in which all vehicl be controlled, or the variabl 
speed limit and ramp meter strategi which actuat the flow at fix locations, thi research aim to dissip 
congestion-bas stop-and-go traffic wave use onli a spars number of autonom vehicl alreadi in the flow, 
without chang how the other, human-driven, vehicl operate. 

the notion to dissip stop-and-go wave via control vehicl in the stream repres a shift from stationari 
to lagrangian control, mirror the transit to lagrangian sens that have alreadi occurred. the key advantag 
in mobil sens project [24, 26, 27] be that a veri small number of vehicl be measur (3-5%) suffic to 
estim the traffic state on larg road network [25]. In the same spirit, our research experiment demonstr that 
a small number of lagrangian control suffic to dampen traffic waves. 

the abil of connect and autom vehicl to chang the properti of the bulk traffic flow be alreadi rec- 
ogniz in the transport engin community. for example, the work [49, 50, 51, 52] directli address the 
set where a subset of the vehicl be equip with autom and/or connect technologies, and then ass via 
a stabil analysi or simul the extent to which the total vehicular flow can be smoothed. recently, sever work 
have explor extens to the variabl speed limit control strategi in which connect or autom vehicl be 
use to actuat the traffic flow [53]. for example, the work [54] develop a vsl strategi that be implement in sim- 
ulat with connect vehicl where the traffic evolv accord to the kinemat wave theory. It follow a similar 
strategi propos in [55], where a coordin vsl and ramp meter strategi be implement via actuat of the 
entir vehicl fleet (i.e., 100% penetr rate). although not explicitli design a a variabl speed limit controller, 
the articl [56] advoc a “slow-in, fast-out” drive strategi to elimin traffic jams, use a microscop model 
also in line with kinemat wave theory. the work [57] propos a similar jam absorb strategi a [56] base on 
newell’ car follow theory, and it effect be assess in simulation. 

interestingly, an experiment test of the “slow-in, fast-out” strategi [56] be provid in [58], in which five vehicl 
be driven on a close course. the lead vehicl in the platoon of five vehicl drive initi at a constant speed, then 
deceler a if drive through a congest wave, and then acceler back to the cruis speed. the third vehicl 
in the platoon initi leaf a larg gap, and due to the extra gap it be abl to maintain the cruis speed and 
effect absorb the jam. In contrast to the experi [58], the present work fulli replic the setup of sugiayama 
et al. [2, 5], in which the stop-and-go wave be gener natur from the human driver in the experiment, without 
an extern cause. moreover, the control propos in the present work be distinct. 

We also note some preliminari field experi to harmon speed via connect vehicl be recent report 
in [59, 60], in part to measur the impact of connect vehicl follow an infrastructure-gener advisori speed 
on the traffic stream behind the connect vehicles. In the present article, we instead dampen wave on a close ring, 
which simplifi the experiment setup, and facilit detail data collect on the perform of the controllers.

1.2. problem statement and contribut 

the present articl be inspir by the work of sugiyama et al. [2, 5] which be the first work to demonstr via 
experi that traffic wave can emerg without infrastructur bottleneck or lane changing. A seri of experi 
be conduct where approxim 20 vehicl drive in a ring of fix radiu with each driver follow the vehicl 
in front of them. the experi [2, 5] be foundat becaus they demonstr the emerg of traffic wave 
caus (unintentionally) by human drive behavior. however, they do not offer a solut for dampen these waves. 

To address thi gap, we design and execut a seri of ring-road experi which show that an intellig 
control autonom vehicl be abl to dampen stop-and-go waves. the experiment setup (describ in section 2) 
follow the set of sugiyama et al. [2, 5], with the modif that one vehicl be an autonomous-cap vehicl 
which can run a varieti of longitudin control laws. similar to the sugiyama et al. [2] experiment, the posit and 
veloc of each vehicl be track via a 360 degre camera. We addit instrument each vehicl in the 22-car 
fleet (see tabl 5 in appendix 5.1 for a detail descript of the vehicl fleet) with an obd-ii scanner to log the 
real-tim fuel consumpt of each vehicle, such that the impact of the traffic wave and control on the bulk fuel 
consumpt can be recorded. 

We present three experi (label a A, B, and C in section 4) and two distinct control strategi (detail 
in section 3) that can be use to dampen stop-and-go wave creat by human drivers. the first control strategi 
be to follow a fix averag veloc (select base on observation) a close a possibl without collisions. It 
be implement in experi A via an automat control algorithm (call followerstopper) and in experi B 
via a care train human driver. the second type of control strategi be a proportional-integr (pi) control 
with saturation, which be a natur extens of the PI controller, a simpl and wide use control in industri 
applications. the control be onli base on the knowledg of the autonom vehicl speed over a time horizon. the 
control action be satur at small gap to avoid collisions, and long gap to avoid slow down of traffic. compar 
to the averag veloc control (experi A and b), the PI control with satur directli estim the 
averag veloc and thu need no extern input. 

the result of each of the three experi be present and compar in section 4. In each experiment, stop- 
and-go wave aris dynam when all vehicl be under human control. onc one vehicl be activ to be 
autonom (with the control algorithm describ in section 3), the traffic wave be dissipated. compar to when 
wave be present, the lagrangian control result in up to 40% less fuel consumption, and a throughput increas of up 
to 15%. futur perspect for lagrangian vehicular control be provid in section 5. 

2. experiment methodolog 

We briefli describ the experiment set in which stop-and-go wave be observ to develop and subsequ 
dampen via control of a singl vehicl in the experi (mimick a low penetr rate on a long freeway 
stretch). the experi follow the ring set sugiyama, et al. [2, 5]. A key advantag of the ring road experiment 
setup [2, 5] be that it remov other effect like boundari conditions, merg lanes, or intersections. To aid in 
interpret of trajectori and fuel consumpt dataset make avail with thi work, we concis describ the 
experiment design and data collect method in section 2.1. the protocol for each experiment, includ the 
specif instruct give to the driver be present in section 2.2. 

2.1. experi design 

We consid a single-lan circular track of radiu 41.4 meter to the center of the lane (260 meter circumference) 
with 21 to 22 vehicl depend on the experi (see figur 1). small modif to the sugiyama et al. [2, 5] 
setup includ a larg circumfer of the circl and drive in counter-clockwis direction, to account for the larg 
averag US vehicl size and the locat of the steer wheel. An asphalt track be mark with small circular cones, 
and be otherwis nearli flat and uniform (no marking, light poles, park barriers, or other potenti obstacles). short 
(3 cm) orang indic be place to mark the insid of the track ring. 

A fleet of 22 passeng vehicl equip with data acquisit hardwar be use in the experiment. one of the 22 
vehicl be the univers of arizona self-driv capabl cognit and autonom test (cat) vehicle, which can 
be transit between manual veloc control and autonom veloc control. A train human driver control 
the steer wheel of the cat vehicl at all time dure all experiments. We underscor that onli one vehicl be ever

(b) align of vehicl 93 second into experi A when wave be present in back right. 

(c) align of vehicl 327 second into experi A when the cat vehicl be activ dampen the wave.

control to dampen the traffic wave, either via autom of the vehicl veloc or through the train driver. thi 
set in which a singl vehicl be control on a ring road mimic a low penetr rate of autom vehicl on a 
long stretch of highway. all other vehicl be driven by univers of arizona employe that have complet safe 
driver train but receiv no other special drive training. driver be instruct to drive safe and be request to 
attempt to close ani widen gap between their vehicl and the vehicl ahead (see section 2.2 for the precis driver 
instructions). 

data from each experi be collect via a video camera and obd-ii data loggers. the 360 degre camera be 
place at the center of the track and use to record each experiment. the result video be process via comput 
vision techniqu to identifi the center of each vehicl in each frame, which be then smooth to gener the vehicl 
trajectories, follow the approach describ in [61]. data from the in-vehicl devic be gather through the obd- 
II standard interfac avail on all US car start in 1996 [62]. the in-vehicl devic measur the instantan 
fuel consumpt of each vehicle. 

2.2. experi mechan 

each experi last between 7–10 minut to limit driver fatigu and begin with all vehicl uniformli space 
around the track accord to the posit of their front-left tire. the cat vehicl begin each experi in manual 
mode, and be switch into a control mode dure the experiment. traffic wave appear in all experiments, and the 
unsteadi traffic be allow to persist for at least 45 second befor a control be activated. for some controllers, a 
desir averag veloc be commun from an extern observer. 

precisely, each experi consist of the follow phases: (i) setup; (ii) evacuation; (iii) initialize; (iv) drive; (v) 
stop; and (vi) conclusion, summar below. 

i. setup: vehicl be distribut equal accord to the space of their front-left tire. driver be individu 
instruct to turn on their in-vehicl data recorders. addit driver instruct (if any) be deliv to 
individu driver through the window. 

ii. evacuation: the central camera be switch on. all research team personnel evacu the track. 
iii. initialize: An air horn sound to instruct all driver to switch gear from park to drive, without moving. 
iv. drive: An air horn sounds, to instruct all driver to begin driving. 
v. stop: An air horn sounds, instruct driver to come to a safe stop and switch gear into park. 

vi. conclusion: experi personnel enter the track after all vehicl have stopped. driver be individu 
instruct to turn off their in-vehicl recorders. the central camera be switch off.

the follow instruct be provid to each driver prior to the start of the experiments. “drive a if you be 
in rush hour traffic. follow the vehicl ahead without fall behind. Do not pa the car ahead. Do not hit the car 
ahead. drive safe at all times. Do not tailgate. but put an emphasi on catch up to the vehicl ahead, if a gap 
start open up.” the purpos of these instruct be to explicitli prevent the human driver from intent 
smooth out traffic wave themselves. thi be important, so that the wave-smooth effect sole caus by the 
cat vehicl can be studied. 

In the event of an unsaf scenario, the driver be instruct to steer out of the circle, at which the experi 
coordin will sound the air horn and the experi will stop. all driver be instruct that the cat vehicl would 
be switch back and forth between autonom and manual mode, and that they should focu on their drive rather 
than attempt to guess what mode the vehicl be in at ani give time. the vehicl directli follow the cat vehicl 
be told to drive a if the cat vehicl be in the same lane, and that the cat vehicl will be drive at a larg radiu 
(1/2 vehicl width) to facilit evas emerg maneuvers. 

3. descript of control of the autonom vehicl 

thi section present the veloc control implement on the cat vehicl to dampen traffic wave on the 
ring track. the control be gener motiv by the fact that mathemat model of vehicular traffic can be 
stabil via the control of a small number of vehicles, see for exampl [49, 50, 51, 52, 63]. one import notion 
that can help stabil the overal flow be to have a subset of vehicl drive with a smooth drive profil rel to the 
traffic conditions, which be the basi of the work [55, 56, 57]. 

one possibl way to creat a smooth drive profil be to follow the averag speed of the vehicl ahead, which 
drive faster then the averag speed befor a stop-and-go wave, and slow than the averag speed dure the wave. 
By simpli drive at the averag speed, a vehicl cover the same distanc in the same amount of time, but with 
less acceler and breaking. addit logic be necessari to prevent extrem small gap (unsafe) situat from 
appearing, or larg gap that may induc lane chang on multi-lan roadways. with these idea in mind, we propos 
two possibl control law and show experiment that they be abl to stabil the flow on the ring. 

the gener structur of the control be a follows. the cat vehicl continu track it veloc vav, and 
measur (at a sampl rate of 30hz) the gap ∆x, defin a the distanc from it front bumper to the rear bumper of 
it lead vehicl ahead. thi signal, suitabl smoothed, be use to calcul the veloc differ ∆v = ddt∆x between 
the lead vehicl and the av. the lead vehicle’ (i.e., the car ahead of the av) veloc be estim on-board the cat 
vehicl a vlead = vav + ∆v. moreover, a desir veloc U be defin (obtain in variou ways, see below), which, 
when chosen correctly, can stabil the traffic flow. from the desir velocity, the gap, and the veloc of the cat 
vehicl and lead vehicle, a command veloc vcmd be determined. the command veloc be then pass to a 
low-level control on the cat vehicl that translat it into an actuat of the acceler or brake. note that all 
of these quantiti be function of time; but the time argument be frequent omit for notat efficiency. below, 
we describe: strategi to defin a desir velocity, the followerstopp control and a PI control with saturation, 
the low level controls, and a control law implement by a train human driver. 

3.1. the followerstopp control 
the premis of thi control be to command exactli the desir veloc U whenev safe (i.e., a in a standard 

cruis controller), but to command a suitabl low veloc vcmd < U whenev safeti requires, possibl base on 
the lead vehicle’ velocity. 

use the gap ∆x and the veloc differ ∆v = ddt∆x = v 
lead− vav , the ∆x–∆v phase space be divid into 

region (see also figur 2): 

i. a safe region, where vcmd = U ; 
ii. a stop region, where a zero veloc be commanded; and an 

iii. an adapt region (two parts), where some averag of desir and lead vehicl veloc be commanded. 

the boundari between the region be parabola in the ∆x–∆v phase space (trajectori that the av/lead vehicl 
pair would travers when deceler at constant rates), defin a 

∆xk = ∆x 
0 
k + 

1 

2dk 
(∆v−) 

2 , for k = 1, 2, 3 . (1) 

5 



figur 2: region defin in followerstopp controller. 

here ∆x0k be a paramet that defin the intercept in the ∆x–∆v phase space, and dk control the curvatur and be 
interpret a a deceler rate. moreover, ∆v− = min(∆v, 0) be the neg arm of veloc difference, i.e., the 
case of the cat vehicl fall behind be treat just like the case vav = vlead. 

use the region boundari defin in (1), the command veloc be 

vcmd = 

 
0 if ∆x ≤ ∆x1 
v ∆x−∆x1∆x2−∆x1 if ∆x1 < ∆x ≤ ∆x2 
v + (U − v) ∆x−∆x2∆x3−∆x2 if ∆x2 < ∆x ≤ ∆x3 
U if ∆x3 < ∆x . 

(2) 

In (2), the veloc v = min(max(vlead, 0), U) be the lead vehicl veloc (if positive) or the desir velocity, 
whichev be smaller. In the adapt region (∆x1 < ∆x ≤ ∆x3), the command veloc transit contin- 
uousli from stop (vcmd = 0, for short gaps) to safe drive (vcmd = U , for larg gaps), via a transit involv 
the lead vehicle’ velocity. 

As implemented, in (1) and (2) we set ∆x01 = 4.5 m, ∆x 
0 
2 = 5.25 m, and ∆x 

0 
3 = 6.0 m, and the deceler 

rate be d1 = 1.5 ms2 , d2 = 1.0 
m 
s2 , and d3 = 0.5 

m 
s2 . note that the ∆xk boundari of the region depend strongli on 

the veloc differ between the cat vehicl and the lead vehicle. for instance, if the cat vehicl be catch up 
rapidli at ∆v = −3 m , then ∆x1 = 7.5 m, ∆x2 = 9.75 m, and ∆x3 = 15 m. 

3.2. the PI with satur control 

the idea behind thi control be that the cat vehicl may estim the averag speed of the vehicl in front, 
and then drive accord to the averag speed. when stop-and-go wave be present, it allow a gap to open up in 
front of the cat vehicl when the lead vehicl accelerates, which be then close when the lead vehicl decelerates. 
An estim of the averag speed requir by the control be obtain by measur the cat vehicl speed over a 
larg enough time horizon. 

the control determin a command veloc vcmd follow a standard proport integr control logic [64], 
where the deviat from the averag speed be treat a the error signal in the PI controller. thi simpl idea need 
to be pair with saturation: for small gap the cat vehicl should follow the lead vehicl speed to avoid danger 
situations, while for larg gaps, the cat vehicl should catch up to the lead vehicle. 

more precisely, thi control estim the desir velocity, U , a a tempor averag of the cat vehicle’ own 
veloc over an interval. let vav1 , . . . , v 

AV 
m denot the cat vehicl veloc over the last m measurements, the 

desir veloc be comput a the tempor averag U = 1m 
∑m 
j=1 v 

AV 
j . In practice, we choos m correspond to 

a 38 second interval, which be approxim the time requir to travel one lap around the ring. 
the desir averag veloc be then translat into a target veloc depend on the current gap between the 

6 



cat vehicl and lead vehicle: 

vtarget = U + vcatch ×min(max(∆x−glgu−gl , 0), 1) , (3) 

which be up to vcatch abov U . thi allow the cat vehicl to drive faster than the averag veloc and catch up to the 
lead vehicle, should it face a gap abov the low threshold gl, while at low gap the target veloc reduc to the 
averag U . At gap abov the upper gap limit gl, cat vehicl vehicl should close the gap by travel vcatch abov 
U . 

the command veloc sent to the low level cat vehicl control be updat via the rule 

vcmdj+1 = βj(αjv 
target 
j + (1− αj)v 

lead 
j ) + (1− βj)vcmdj , (4) 

where the subscript j denot the time step. thi rule (4) choos the new command veloc a a weight averag 
of the prior command velocity, the target velocity, and the lead vehicle’ velocity. the weight αj and βj depend 
on the gap a follows: β = 1− 12α, and 

α = min(max(∆x−∆x 
s 

γ , 0), 1) . (5) 

In (5), the distanc ∆x be a safeti distance. We have α = 0 if ∆x ≤ ∆x and α = 1 if ∆x ≥ ∆x + γ, mean 
that for rel short gaps, onli the lead vehicle’ veloc matters, while for rel larg gaps, onli the target 
veloc be averag with the command velocity. the paramet γ control the the rate at which α transit from 0 
to 1, and be set to γ = 2 m in the current implementation. thi mean that when the gap be short, the cat vehicl have 
the same speed of the lead vehicle, while when the gap be larg the cat vehicl speed tend toward the target vehicle, 
which allow the cat vehicl to reduc the gap with the lead vehicle. the paramet β determin how rapidli the 
control adjust to new situat (with more rapid adjust occur in more safety-crit situations). At it 
core, thi be a PI controller, but with a satur at small gap (for safeti purposes), and a satur at larg gap (so 
that the cat vehicl close gaps). 

the model paramet for both control be determin via test in a simul environ (with a data- 
fit human-driv model), a well a via car-follow field test (befor the actual experiments). As a result we set 
the low gap limit gl = 7 m, the upper gap limit a gu = 30 m and vcatch = 1 m/s. the safeti distanc be implement 
a ∆x = max(2 s×∆v, 4 m). the term 2 s×∆v repres the recommend follow distanc accord to the 
2 second rule, with a low bound of 4 m. 

3.3. low level vehicl control 
the command veloc produc by the two control describ abov be translat to the actual vehicl 

control (i.e., ga and brake signals) via a multi-mod controller. the use of a multi-mod control permit differ 
gain to be use for acceler or for braking, to enabl faster brake when need while avoid chatter at 
steady-st velocities. 

each mode be a pid controller, with gain determin through system identif of the cat vehicl at constant 
veloc repres of those record in the experiment, use a similar structur a in [65]. the cat vehicl 
plant be simplifi a a first-ord model base on constant acceler inputs. the controller’ design be thus: 

aj+1 = 

 
h1(vj , v 

cmd 
j ) if v 

cmd 
j − vj > −0.25 m 

h2(vj , v 
cmd 
j ) if v 

cmd 
j − vj ≤ −0.25 m 

0 otherwis , 

in which aj+1 ∈ [−100, 100] repres the next command “acceleration” value, where 100 be the maximum 
depress of the accelerator, and -100 be the maximum depress of the brake. moreover, vj be the current speed 
of the cat vehicle, and vcmdj be the desir speed. when a < 0 the brake be depressed, and when a > 0 the 
acceler be depressed. control h1 be design to acceler to the desir refer speed and maintain that 
desir speed primarili through control of the vehicle’ accelerator, and control h2 be design to effect more rapid 
speed reduct via the brake. thu when the desir speed be less than 0.25 m of the current speed, the brake be used, 

7 



and otherwis the acceler be use to control speed (a in normal drive when releas the acceler reduc 
speed). these control be provid sampl data at 20 Hz and be permit to send new updat to the cat 
vehicl at 20hz. 

the perform characterist of each control be provid for a chang of input a a step function of 1 m/ 
(-1 m/ for braking). the control h1 have a rise time of approxim 1.6 s with an overshoot of 5% and a settl 
time of approxim 5.52 s. the control h2 have a rise time of approxim 0.8 s, with an 11% overshoot and 
settl time of approxim 1.94 s. 

given the dynam of the cat vehicle, a tradeoff must be perform on the comfort of the ride and the physic 
dynam for a chang in refer speed. the switch natur of the control provid robust to nois in 
sampl speed, sinc the acceler be primarili use to control speed at steadi state. finally, the pid control be 
reset at 0 velocity, and standard approach for windup avoid be use to prevent unsaf acceler [66]. 

3.4. human driver control 
the driver who implement human control of the cat vehicl (coauthor M. bunting) be instruct to attempt to 

maintain a desir velocity, but to slow down to avoid collis with the vehicl ahead. thi be similar to the control 
law use in experi A, with the notabl except that the desir veloc be give in miles/hour (the primari 
readout of the speedomet in the cat vehicle). the driver receiv train from the univers of arizona on safe 
drive of high-occup vehicles, and have extens practic to drive in thi way, befor the actual experi be 
performed. 

4. experiment results: dampen traffic wave with a singl vehicl 

the experiment result be present in thi section. To be abl to effect compar the result of the exper- 
iments, it be import to defin metrics, which be consist across the experiments. To thi end, we present the 
metric use to describ the traffic flow in section 4.1. with the metric fulli defined, we present the result of the 
three experi conduct in section 4.2.

At each time step, we have the follow data. from the imag processing, we have the posit x, the veloc

4.2. experiment result 

experi A contain 21 vehicles, includ the cat vehicle. the cat vehicl be initi under human control, 
and the first traffic wave be observ 79 second into the experiment. the followerstopp wave-dampen control 
be activ 126 second into the experiment, and set with a desir veloc of U = 6.50 m/s. over the next sever 
minutes, the desir veloc be vari step by step to test the depend of the traffic condit on the set point. It be 
chang to 7.00 m/ (222 second into the experiment), 7.50 m/ (292 second into the experiment), and final 8.00 
m/ at 347 second into the experiment. At 415 seconds, the desir veloc be reduc to 7.50 m/s, where it remain 
for 48 seconds. At 463 second into the experiment, the human driver resum control of the cat vehicl speed. the 
experi be end at 567 seconds. 

experi B also involv 21 vehicl and follow a similar design a experi A. the main differ be that 
in experi B, after the wave initi appears, a train human driver implement the control strategi describ 

9 



in experi A but without the aid of automation. the human-execut control strategi be to maintain a desir 
velocity, calcul by an extern observ a the averag veloc of the previou lap, without collid with the 
vehicl ahead. the cat vehicl be alway under human control, but the driver switch from initi follow the 
instruct give to all human driver to mimic the control strategi in experi A after a wave appears. A 
traffic wave be first observ 55 second from the start of experi B, and the activ control to dampen the wave 
begin after 112 second at a desir veloc of 6.25 m/ (14 mph in the unit display in the cat vehicl dashboard) 
with the command to “drive with an averag speed of 14 mile per hour, unless safeti requir slow speeds.” after 
202 seconds, the cat vehicl oper be instruct to increas the desir speed “to 16 mile per hour,” (7.15 m/s) 
which be maintain for 98 second befor revert to typic human drive behavior. the experi be end after 
409 seconds. 

experi C be conduct with 22 vehicles. note that one vehicl be add for thi experiment, to demonstr 
that instabl and wave damp be not specif to have exactli 21 vehicl on the ring. At 161 second into 
the experiment, a traffic wave appears. At 218 seconds, the PI control with satur wave damp control 
be activated, and remain activ until the end of the experi at 413 seconds. becaus the control directli 
determin the desir veloc a part of the control algorithm, there be no extern paramet that be chang 
dure the experiment. 

after conclus of the experiments, the data gather through a 360◦ camera place at the center of track, in- 
vehicl devices, and cat vehicl control comput be analyz to character the perform of each experi 
with respect to dampen traffic waves. 

displac data describ each vehicle’ distanc travel from their initi posit on the ring at the begin 
of the experiment. these data be extract from the central camera use standard comput vision techniqu to 
track vehicl posit along the ring. veloc data be deriv through discret differenti of displac data 
(likewise, acceler from veloc data) [61], which be valid against the cat vehicl control comput and 
the in-vehicl devices. the full data set and code use to gener the plot can be found in [67]. 

notabl event in each experi defin time interv over which to evalu the state of traffic. In each analysi 
we quantifi the traffic state accord to (a) the standard deviat of traffic velocity; (b) the fuel consumpt [68]; (c) 
the rate of excess brake events; and (d) the traffic throughput. A detail descript of how these calcul be 
performed, a well a the specif definit of common metric of fuel consumption, veloc (averag and standard 
deviation), and excess brake be avail in section 4.1. 

In experi A, the traffic state be quantifi over eight time interv throughout the experiment. In each interval, 
the fuel consumption, veloc standard deviation, excess braking, and throughput be report in tabl 1. the 
posit of each vehicle’ center over time be show in figur 3a, with the cat vehicl be show in red and all other 
vehicl be show in gray. In figur 3b, the veloc profil of the cat vehicl be show in red, and all other vehicl 
veloc be plot in gray. for each interval, the black dash line denot the averag veloc of traffic over that 
interval, and the blue dash line denot the averag veloc plus/minu one standard deviation. 

when the cat vehicl be initi under human control, a wave begin to appear. after the control be activ 
the wave be notic affected, but not fulli removed, through the interv when the cat vehicl control be activ 
at a desir veloc of 6.50 m/s. the wave-dampen effect of the control be observ in the veloc profil 
(figur 3b), which exhibit a low magnitud of oscil from the mean after control begins. when the cat 
vehicl desir speed set in the followerstopp be increas to 7.00 m/ 222 second into the experiment, further 
wave dampen be observed, and at a desir speed of 7.50 m/s, the best perform of the control be achieved. 
compar to the initi period where a wave be present under human control, the veloc standard deviat be 
reduc by 80.8%, the fuel consumpt be reduc by 42.5%, and the excess brake event be reduc from 8.58 
event per vehicl per kilomet to 0.12 event per vehicl per kilometer. becaus the averag veloc of traffic on 
the ring be also increased, the throughput on the roadway increas by 14.1%. 

At 7.50 m/s, the cat vehicle’ speed match the averag traffic speed almost precisely, and consequ it 
do not need to slow down. however, at 347 seconds, the cat vehicl desir veloc be increas further to 8.00 
m/ and the cat vehicl is, on average, faster than the flow of traffic—which inevit induc a wave again. the 
reappear of a wave have the effect of increas fuel consumpt rel to the slow desir velocities, but still 
repres a benefit of the control compar to the uncontrol traffic. At 415 second the cat vehicle’ desir 
veloc be reduc to 7.50 m/s, and the wave be onc again dampened. the followerstopp control be deactiv 
after 463 seconds, and the traffic wave reappears.

the control of the cat vehicl have the impact of reduc the total fuel consumpt of the traffic, a show in 
tabl 1. the low fuel consumpt of 14.13 `/100km be observ when the followerstopp be oper with the 
set point of 7.50 m/s. thi be also the low fuel consumpt amongst all experi conducted. A video of of 
experi A be provid in movi S1 in the supplementari materials. 

In experi B, the cat vehicl oper initi drive accord to the same instruct a the other vehicl 
oper and a traffic wave appear at 55 seconds. At 112 second into the experiment, the cat vehicl oper 
begin to drive at a desir veloc of 6.26 m/ without collid with the vehicl in front. later the desir veloc 
be increas befor return to the gap close instruct follow by all other human drivers. the trajectori be 
show in figur 4 and the traffic state be quantifi in each interv in tabl 2. 

the dampen effect of the human-impl control be quantifi by the standard deviat of the veloci-

brake be reduc by 76.2% when control be applied. 
the desir speed give to the cat vehicl driver also influenc the reduct in the veloc variability. when 

the desir speed of the cat vehicl be increas to 16 mph (7.15 m/s), the standard deviat reach the minimum 
valu for the experiment. the throughput be also high dure thi period compar to when the traffic be uncontrol 
(2008 veh/hr vs. 1828 veh/hr). onc the cat vehicl return to a typic gap close behavior (i.e., no longer under 
human control to maintain a desir speed), the traffic wave reappears, and the veloc standard deviat increases. 

when the cat vehicl be under wave dampen control by a human, the control reduc the overal fuel con- 
sumption when compar to the uncontrol case (tabl 2), where averag fuel consumpt (`/100km) be record 
for each period of the experiment. the result be a decreas in fuel consumpt when the cat vehicl begin to 
dampen the traffic wave (a decreas from 21.8 `/100km to 17.9 `/100km, (17.9%)). A further decreas in fuel con- 
sumption (to 17.0 `/100km, a decreas of 22.0% compar to when a wave be present initially) be observ when the 
desir veloc be increas from 14 mph (6.25 m/s) to 16 mph (7.15 m/s). finally, when the cat vehicl return to 
human-driven behavior and stop activ dampen the traffic wave, fuel consumpt increas again and return 
to a level similar to the pre-control fuel consumpt (21.8 `/100km) befor control start compar to (21.6 `/100km) 
after control end and the traffic wave reappears). 

finally, in experi C, an addit vehicl be add to the track, bring the total number of vehicl to 22.

tabl 4: summari metric over all vehicl by interv with correspond start time, for experi C. 

As in other experiments, the cat vehicl begin the experi in human control. the traffic be rel smooth 
until the first strong wave occur at 161 seconds. compar the traffic condit under no control befor the strong 
wave appear to when it be observed, the traffic wave result in a 37.7% increas in the averag veloc standard 
deviation, a 63.8% increas in fuel consumption, and a 18.8% reduct in throughput. 

At 218 seconds, the PI control with satur wave damp traffic control be activated, and the wave be 
substanti reduced. compar to the interv when the wave be present, the control result in a reduct of the 
speed variabl (54.7% reduct in standard deviat see tabl 4). It also reduc the fuel consumpt by 27.9%, 
and the rate of excess brake be reduc by 74.4%. the throughput be also slightli reduc by 2.5%. note that 
thi control onli us inform directli measur by the cat vehicl itself, and it do not requir ani extern 
information. one consequ of thi more local natur be that the wave dampen be not a perfect a in experi 
A. In particular, the control slightli reduc the averag velocity. nevertheless, the veloc standard deviation, 
excess braking, and fuel consumpt be substanti reduc compar to when uncontrol traffic wave be 
present. 

By examin the trajectori (figur 5), it be appar that the control law be abl to elimin the initi present 
wave, but anoth wave be gener dure the control period. the second wave be also damp by the control law, 
but it presenc for a period of the activ control account for the differ rel to the period where no wave 
occur in the uncontrol period at the start of the experiment. 

To conclude, these experi demonstr that traffic flow control via low penetr rate autom vehicl 
be in fact possible. moreover, the data collect quantifi the benefit of conduct control via the av. specifically, 
under proper control, (a) the veloc standard deviat reduc noticeably; (b) the fuel consumpt be reduc by 
a signific margin; (c) brake event be substanti reduced; and (d) in some experiments, even the averag 
veloc (and thu the throughput) be increas (tabl 3). 

veloc standard deviation: the veloc standard deviat be reduc in all experiments, rang between 49.5% 
for experi B, 54.7% for experi C, and a high of 80.8% for experi A. 

fuel consumption: the fuel consumpt in all experi be reduc from when wave be present and under 
human control compar to when the autonom car be active. the improv includ a reduct of 42.5%, 
22.1%, and 28.1% in experi A, B, and C, respectively. 

excess braking: the number of excess brake event be also substanti reduced, from 8.58 to 9.66 
excess brake events/veh/km down to 2.47 events/veh/km in the bad perform control and nearli complet 
elimin (0.12 events/veh/km) in the best perform controller. 

throughput: chang in throughput for each experi be +14.1% for experi A, and +9.8% for experi 
B, with a −2.5% chang in experi C. 

5. conclus 

av can revolution the control of traffic flow. they offer the potenti to shift from local control measures, 
like ramp metering, and central ones, a variabl speed limit gantries, to lagrangian actuat immers in the 
traffic stream. strikingly, it be not necessari for all vehicl to be autom in order to benefit from mobil actuation. 
A singl autonom vehicl can control the flow of at least 20 human-control vehicl around it, with substanti 
reduct in veloc standard deviation, excess braking, and fuel consumption.

figur 5: trajectori and standard deviat in veloc for experi C. 

moreover, thi studi demonstr that these benefit can be achiev via structur veri simpl control strategies, 
base onli on the av’ velocity, it spatial gap between the vehicl immedi in front, and some estim of the 
averag veloc of traffic flow. the PI with satur control (experi C) be a fulli automat control, while 
the followerstopp (experi A) and the human-impl control (experi B) have an extern input 
(depend on observ traffic conditions). thi simpl structur impli that a notic impact on congest traffic 
flow can in principl be achiev by mean of adapt cruis control system that be alreadi in place in certain new 
vehicles, and the use of intellig infrastructur and/or connect vehicl to provid the requir extern inputs. 

most contemporari traffic control strategi (implement in practice, and/or propos in the literature) be base 
on central interventions, such a ramp-metering, variabl speed limits, and traffic light controls. for example, a 
success variabl speed limit control may yield a 5% increas in capac [28]. however, those tradit control 
approach will alway have limit effect on the traffic dynam that emerg between the fix control points. In 
contrast, the control of traffic flow via a spars set of lagrangian actuat (av or train human drivers) enabl 
new opportun for control, with a direct posit effect on the dynam of traffic flow, and without the need of a 
dedic actuat infrastructure. 

the present ring experi repres a stretch of single-lan roadway. however, the theori extend also to 
multi-lan freeways, on which lane chang can serv a an addit trigger of stop-and-go waves. the lane chang 
can also open up gap in the vacat lane, which can serv to dampen wave in that lane. the central challeng in the 
multi-lan set be to have control that dynam dampen waves, but without leav too larg gaps, becaus 
larg gap may trigger addit lane changing, which may reduc the effect of the strategy. the result of 
experi A demonstr that the control do in fact not leav a larg gap onc the wave have be damped. To 
fulli quantifi the benefit of lagrangian actuat on urban freeways, futur multi-lan experi be needed. 

the control of complex multi-ag system have impact beyond vehicular traffic flow, includ coordin 
robot [69], social network [70], anim swarm [71, 72], and mani other applications. however, in contrast 
to mani applic in robot or fleet control, the human agent play a crucial role in traffic flow dynamics. more- 
over, in contrast to other human-in-the-loop cyber-phys systems, the autom control and the human agent 
be spatial separated, and they do not work cooperatively. rather, the av counteract the humans’ tendenc to
