higher-level inform 

process occur in the neocortex, neural tissu that 

form the outer layer of the cerebr cortex. In it 

intric folds, brain cell work togeth to interpret 

sensori inform and to form thought and plans. 

the neocortex be divid into region that take the 

lead on differ type of processing. however, much 

of today’ neurosci research focu on map 

the connectome: the neural connect between 

regions.
