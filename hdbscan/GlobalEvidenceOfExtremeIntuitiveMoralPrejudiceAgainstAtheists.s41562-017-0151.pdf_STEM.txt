mount evid support long-stand claim that reli- 
gion can extend cooper networks1–9. however, religi 
prosoci may have a strongli parochi component5. 
moreover, aspect of religion may promot or exacerb 
conflict with those outsid a give religi group, promot- 
ing region violence10, intergroup conflict11 and tacit preju- 
dice against non-believers12,13. anti-atheist prejudice—a 
grow concern in increasingli secular societies14—affect 
employment, elections, famili life and broader social inclu- 
sion12,13. preliminari work in the unit state suggest that 
anti-atheist prejudic stems, in part, from deepli root intu- 
ition about religion’ put necessari role in morality. 
however, the cross-cultur preval and magnitude—a 
well a intracultur demograph stability—of such intuitions, 
a manifest in intuit associ of immor with 
atheists, remain unclear. here, we quantifi moral distrust of 
atheist by appli well-test measur in a larg global 
sampl (N = 3,256; 13 divers countries). consist with cul- 
tural evolutionari theori of religion and morality, peopl in 
most—but not all— of these countri view extrem moral 
violat a repres of atheists. notably, anti-atheist 
prejudic be even evid among atheist particip around 
the world. the result contrast with recent poll that do not 
find self-report moral prejudic against atheist in highli 
secular countries15, and impli that the recent rise in secular 
in western countri have not overwritten intuit anti-atheist 
prejudice. entrench moral suspicion of atheist suggest 
that religion’ power influenc on moral judgement per- 
sists, even among non-believ in secular societies. 

specul about whether moral depend on religi belief 
have a long history. the ancient chines philosoph mozi claim 
that belief in ghost be essenti for moral restraint16. In plato’ 
euthyphro17, socrat debat whether moral can even be prop- 
erli defin without refer to divin preference. dostoevsky18 
famous question whether moral prohibit could carri 
weight without belief in a deity. modern investig reflect thi 
perceiv link between belief in god(s) and morality, a recent small 
sampl studi in north america suggest deep moral suspicion of 
individu who do not believ in god(s)13,19. 

evolutionari theori of religion predict that prejudic against 
atheist may persist even in secular cultures, either a part of a 
suit of adapt link belief to within-group cooperation20 or 

a a consequ of cultur transmitted21 and entrench pro- 
religi norms5. indeed, recent studi suggest religion evolv in 
part by support trust and cooper among coreligionists15,22,23. 
signal of religios can even extend trust across religion among 
believers, though not to non-believers24. In contrast, classic social 
psycholog work25 predict that onli believ will be prejudic 
against atheist and that distrust of atheist would not be appar 
in secular societies. To date, these two perspect have not be 
directli contrasted, and the global preval of intuit anti- 
atheist prejudic and it persist among atheist themselv be 
current unknown. A recent pew survey suggest a relationship 
between country-wid level of religi belief and explicit judge- 
ment that moral requir religion15. however, peopl often 
lack introspect access to their intuitions, and respond to appear 
social desirable. As such, littl be know about the potenti cross- 
cultur ubiqu of intuit link religion and morality. 

here, we rigor test a predict deriv from a cultur 
evolutionari model of religion5: that anti-atheist prejudic remain 
global prevalent, even in secular societi and among atheists. In 
contrast to previou studies, we quantifi level of anti-atheist dis- 
trust use well-test measur of intuit inform process 
that can be adapt for studi prejudic in a larg and divers 
cross-cultur sample, while adjust for individu differ in 
level of religi belief, demograph covari and country-level 
depend in responses. our sampl be drawn from 13 countri 
on 5 continents. We chose these countri becaus they: (1) exhibit 
substanti country-level variabl in averag religi belief 
includ both highli secular societi (for example, netherlands, 
czech republic, finland, china) and highli religi one (for 
example, unit arab emirates, mauritius, india; supplementari 
tabl 3 show averag belief in god(s) across countries); (2) rep- 
resent divers domin religion and religi histories, includ 
countri with christian, muslim, hindu, buddhist and secular 
majorities; and (3) repres divers cultural, political, socioeco- 
nomic, histor and geograph contexts. thi divers sampl 
allow u to extend our investig well beyond the weird 
(western, educated, industrialized, rich, democratic) sampl that 
predomin the social sciences26. 

We develop a measur to ass extrem anti-atheist prejudic 
by use a simpl experiment design that target intuit biases19.

then, particip be judg whether it be more probabl that the vil- 
lain be (a) a teacher or (b) a teacher who either (manipul between 
subjects) be a religi believ or do not believ in god(s). thus, 
no individu particip be directli ask whether they think the 
perpetr be or be not a believer. instead, the conjunct fallacy27 
rate (choos option b—a logic incorrect answer) between 
condit can be use to infer indirectli the degre to which a 
descript of a serial murder be intuit see a more represen- 
tativ of religi peopl or atheists, respectively. full stimulu appear 
in the supplementari information. In our preregistr of meth- 
od and hypothesi befor data collect commenc (https://osf. 
io/f6tcr/), we hypothes both univers and variabl across 
countries, such that moral distrust of atheist would be evid in 
all sites, but the strong intuit religion–mor link would be 
observ in the most strongli religi samples. 

We conduct ident experi in all 13 sites. We target 
at least 100 particip per experiment condit (anti-atheist 
bia versu anti-religi bias). after filter out inattent par- 
ticip (13%) and incomplet responses, there be a total of 
3,256 particip for final analysi (69% female, age 16–70 years: 
mean = 25.07, s.d. = 7.84), with a median of 162 particip per 
countri (range: 129–993). particip come from divers societ- 
y and includ both student and gener popul sampl 
(supplementari information). 

becaus our data repres a share experiment design across 
site with particip nest within countries, we use a multilevel 
(hierarchical) model approach. specifically, our hierarch 
bayesian model28 quantifi the extent to which peopl view gross 
immor (anim torture, serial murder and mutilation) a more 
repres of atheist than of believers, both overal and within 
each country, adjust for individu level of belief in god, gen- 
der, age and perceiv socioeconom statu (all standardized). 

additionally, the model adjust for country-level depend by 
model the intercept and slope of anti-atheist prejudic a random 
across countri (supplementari information). full model coeffi- 
cient appear in tabl 1. We observ substanti heterogen in 
overal conjunct fallaci perform across countries. becaus 
our primari focu be on degre of intuit moral distrust of athe- 
ist (in contrast to believers) across countries, we do not specul 
further about sourc of heterogen in overal performance, and 
instead focu on experiment condit differ within countries. 

our result offer strong evid of extrem intuit moral 
prejudic against atheists. our model predict an overal conjunc- 
tion error rate probabl of 0.58 for atheist target (95% high 
posterior densiti interv (hpdi) 0.48, 0.68), but onli 0.30 (95%

hpdi 1.53, 2.37) (posterior probabl of atheist target error 
exceed religi target error (henceforth ‘posterior probability’) 
exce 0.999). thus, peopl overal be roughli twice a like 
to view extrem immor a repres of atheists, rel 
to believers. importantly, the effect hold even after adjust for 
countri variabl in the strength of intuit moral prejudic and 
individual-level variabl in demographics. figur 1 and tabl 2 
summar model-predict conjunct error probabl across 
site for atheist and religi targets. consist with predictions, 
extrem intuit moral distrust of atheist be both global evid 
and variabl in it magnitud across countries. 

surprisingly, after adjust for substanti latent country-level 
depend between sites, the within-countri interact between 
individu belief in god and conjunct error rate across target be 
weak (posterior probabl = 0.88; tabl 1). thus, while anti-atheist 
prejudic vari strongli by country, such prejudic be larg robust 
across the spectrum of particip religios within countries; both 
high and low believ be about twice a like to commit con- 
junction error for atheist target than for religi target (fig. 2). 
furthermore, we examin posterior model predict for atheist 
(those rate their belief in god at 0 out of 100). among atheists, our 
model predict an overal conjunct error rate probabl of 0.52 
for atheist target (95% hpdi 0.40, 0.64), but onli 0.28 (95% hpdi 
0.22, 0.33) for religi targets; rel risk be 1.91 (95% hpdi 1.41, 
2.48) (posterior probabl > 0.999). effect hold even in highli 
secular countri such a australia, china, the czech republic, the 
netherland and the unit kingdom: even atheist be predict 
to intuit associ serial murder more with atheist than with 
believ in these countri (all posterior probabl exceed 
0.98). indeed, onli in finland (posterior probabl = 0.48) and to 
a lesser extent new zealand (posterior probabl = 0.90) be the evi- 
denc of intuit anti-atheist prejudic among atheist less conclu- 
sive. (full infer at both minimum and maximum belief appear 
in the supplementari information.) To check robust of intuit 
moral distrust of atheist among atheists, we conduct a second 
analysi isol all particip across site who rat their belief 
in god at zero (N = 553) and explor overal atheist intuit moral 
distrust of atheist (experiment condit treat a fixed) across 
site (vari intercept of country). again, atheist particip 
show high conjunct error rate for atheist targets, 0.61 (95% 
hpdi 0.23, 0.95), than for religi targets, 0.50 (95% hpdi 0.12, 
0.88) (posterior probabl = 0.999). thus, consist with theoreti- 
cal predictions, even atheist intuit associ immor more 
with atheist than with believers. 

To address potenti methodolog confound and altern 
explan for our findings, we conduct three addit exper- 
iment (note that, although our primari cross-cultur investig 
be preregistered, the follow-up studi be not). full detail of 
all three studi appear in the supplementari information, but they 
be briefli summar here. first, our cross-cultur experimen- 
tal manipul test onli extrem moral violat and pit a 
target who ‘doe not believ in god(s)’ against a ‘religi believer’, 
perhap confound notion of belief in god(s) and the broader 
construct of religiosity. supplementari studi S1 found that, even 
when the experi more symmetr manipul belief ver- 
su disbelief in god(s) and test a more minor moral violat (for 
example, not pay for dinner in a restaurant), peopl still associ 
immor more with atheist than with believ (posterior prob- 
abil = 0.981). 

second, our primari cross-cultur test pit a disbeliev in 
god(s) against a religi believer. It be possible, however, that peo- 
ple be moral distrust of disbeliev in general, rather than of 
peopl who disbeliev in god(s) specifically. supplementari studi 
S2 use the same extrem moral violat a our main analysi 
and found that peopl be more like to assum intuit that a 

perpetr of moral evil be someon who disbelief in god than 
someon who disbelief in evolution, the accuraci of horoscopes, 
the safeti of vaccin or the realiti of global warm (all posterior 
probabl between 0.956 and 0.9997). 

finally, it be possibl that peopl may intuit associ certain 
specif moral violations, such a child molestation, with religi 
individu rather than with atheists. however, supplementari 
studi S3 found that peopl intuit assum that a priest who 
molest young boy for decad be more like to be a priest who 
do not believ in god than a priest who do believ in god (pos- 
terior probabl = 0.998). 

In summary, particip intuit assum that the perpetra- 
tor of immor act be probabl atheists. these effect appear 
across religi divers societies, includ countri with 
buddhist, christian, hindu, muslim and non-religi majorities, 
show that intuit moral prejudic against atheist be not exclu- 
sive to abraham or monotheist major societies. To the con- 
trary, intuit anti-atheist prejudic gener to larg secular 
societi and appear global evid even among atheists. notably, 
our primari experiment paradigm use extrem exampl of 
immor where anti-atheist prejudic would presum be less 
explicitli defensible. We test moral prejudic use viciou act 
of cruelti (anim torture, serial murder and mutilation), which 
participants—includ atheist participants—nonetheless intui- 
tive associ with atheists. combined, these result show that 
across the world, religi belief be intuit view a a necessari 
safeguard against the temptat of grossli immor conduct, and 
atheist be broadli perceiv a potenti moral deprav and 
dangerous. view differently, peopl perceiv belief in a god a a 
suffici moral buffer to inhibit immor behaviour. 

our result highlight a stark diverg between lay and scien- 
tific percept of the relationship between religion and morality.

classic version of thi task, particip be give a descript of a polit 
liber singl woman. when ask whether it be more like that she be (a) a bank 
cashier or (b) a bank cashier who be activ in the feminist movement, particip 
tend erron to pick option B. although logic incorrect (there be

By independ vari the content of the descript and the ident impli

We gener a repres heurist task to quantifi the degre to
