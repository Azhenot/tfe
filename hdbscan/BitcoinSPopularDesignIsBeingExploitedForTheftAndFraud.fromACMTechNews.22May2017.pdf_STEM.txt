problemat bitcoin design featur include: 

the risk of lose a password – a lose or forgotten password cannot be recov so all bitcoin from an electron wallet could be render 
unrecoverable. 

insecur password can lead to bitcoin be steal – for exampl through phish scams.

experienc by bitcoin user be the risk of insecur transact and in particular that of deal with dishonest traders.

a trader do not fulfil their side of a transact – by pay an agre price in convent currencies, or goods, for bitcoins. If thi 
happens, then honest trader be not abl to recov their bitcoins.

regulation, mostli becaus of the challeng of deal with dishonest trader which, they believe, could be address by de-anonymis 
trade parties. bitcoin provid freedom over one’ assets, but at the same time it no longer provid the secur that tradit regul 
financi institut provide.” 

the researchers, who interview 20 bitcoin users, have suggest design improv to support trust:

bitcoin be recorded, and the offlin transfer of fiat currenc or good be not, open up opportun for fraud. 

A reput manag system built on top of the blockchain would motiv trader to keep the same wallet to build their reputation, 
provid more stable, though still private, identities. 

new tool to reveal the ident of the owner of one-us onli bitcoin wallets, to deter dishonesti 
the use of third parti to arbitr and sign-off transactions.
