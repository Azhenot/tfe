abstract 

recidiv predict instrument (rpi’s) provid 
decis maker with an assess of the likelihood 
that a crimin defend will reoffend at a futur 
point in time. while such instrument be gain 
increas popular across the country, their use 
be attract tremend controversy. much of the 
controversi concern potenti discriminatori bia in 
the risk assess that be produced. thi paper 
discu a fair criterion origin in the field 
of educ and psycholog test that have re- 
centli be appli to ass the fair of recidi- 
vism predict instruments. We demonstr how 
adher to the criterion may lead to consider 
dispar impact when recidiv preval differ 
across groups. 

1 introduct 

risk assess instrument be gain increas 
popular within the crimin justic system, with 
version of such instrument be use or consid- 
ere for use in pre-trial decision-making, parol de- 
cisions, and in some state even sentenc [1, 2]. 
In each of these cases, a high-risk classification— 
particularli a high-risk misclassification—may have 
a direct advers impact on a crimin defendant’ 
outcome. If rpi’ be to continu to be used, it be 
import to ensur that they do not result in uneth- 
ical practic that dispar affect differ groups. 

within the psychometr literature, there exist 
wide accept and adopt standard for assess 
whether an instrument be fair in the sens of be 
free of predict bias. these standard have recent 
be appli to the compa [3] and pcra [4] in- 
struments, with initi find suggest that there 

be evid of predict bia when it come to gen- 
der, but not when it come to race [5, 6, 7]. 

In a recent wide popular investig of the 
compa rpi conduct by a team at propublica, 
a differ approach to assess instrument bia told 
what appear to be a contradictori stori [8]. the au- 
thor found that the likelihood of a non-recidiv 
black defend be assess a high-risk be nearli 
twice that of white defendants. while thi analysi 
have met with much criticism, it have also make head- 
lines. there be no doubt that it be now emb in 
the nation convers on the use of rpi’s. 

In thi paper we show that the differ in fals 
posit and fals neg rate cite a evid of 
racial bia in the propublica articl be a direct con- 
sequenc of appli an instrument that be free from 
predict bias1 to a popul in which recidiv 
preval differ across groups. our main contri- 
bution be twofold. (1) first, we make precis the 
connect between the psychometr notion of test 
fair and error rate in classification. (2) next, 
we demonstr how use an rpi that have differ- 
ent fals postiv and fals neg rate between 
group can lead to dispar impact when individ- 
ual assess a high risk receiv stricter penalties. 
throughout our discuss we use the term dispar 
impact to refer to set where a penalti polici 
have unintend disproportion advers impact on 
a particular group. 

It be import to bear in mind that fair 
itself—along with the notion of dispar impact— 
be a social and ethic concept, not a statist one. 
An instrument that be free from predict bia may 
nevertheless result in dispar impact depend on 
how and where it be used. In thi paper we consid

hypothet use case in which we be abl to di- 
rectli connect statist quantifi featur of 
rpi’ to a measur of dispar impact. 

1.1 data descript and setup 

the empir result in thi paper be base on 
the broward counti data make publicli avail 
by propublica [9]. thi data set contain com- 
pa recidiv risk decil scores, 2-year recidi- 
vism outcomes, and a number of demograph and 
crime-rel variables. We restrict our attent to 
the subset of defend whose race be record a 
african-american (b) or caucasian (w). 

2 assess fair 

We begin by with some notation. let S = s(x) 
denot the risk score base on covari X = x, 
with high valu of S correspond to high level 
of assess risk. let R ∈ {b, w} denot the group 
that the individu belong to, which may be one of 
the compon of X. lastly, let Y ∈ {0, 1} be the 
outcom indicator, with 1 denot that the give 
individu recidivates. In thi notation, we can think 
of the psychometr test fair condit roughli 
a follows. 

definit 2.1 (test fairness). A score S = s(x) be 
test-fair (well-calibrated)2 if it reflect the same like- 
lihood of recidiv irrespect of the individual’ 
group membership, R. that is, if for all valu of s, 

p(i = 1 | S = s,r = b) = p(i = 1 | S = s,r = w). 
(2.1) 

figur 1 show a plot of the observ recidiv 
rate across all possibl valu of the compa score. 
We can see that the compa rpi appear to adher 
well to the test fair condition. In their respons 
to the propublica investigation, flore et al. [10] fur- 
ther verifi thi adher use logist regression. 

2.1 impli constraint on the fals pos- 
itiv and fals neg rate 

To facilit a simpler discuss of error rates, we 
introduc the coarsen score sc, which be obtain 

2depend on the context, we may further desir that 
thi criterion be satisfi when we condit on some of the 
covariates. our analysi extend to thi case a well.

(2.2) 

the coarsen score simpli ass each defen- 
dant a be at high-risk or low-risk of recidivism. 
for the purpos of our discussion, we will think of 
Sc a a classifi use to predict the binari outcom 
Y . thi allow u to summar Sc in term of a 
confus matrix, a show below. 

Sc = low-risk Sc = high-risk 

Y = 0 TN FP 
Y = 1 FN TP 

It be easili verifi that test fair of S impli 
that the posit predict valu of the coarsen 
score Sc do not depend on R. more precisely, it 
impli that that the quantiti 

ppv(sc | R = r) ≡ p(i = 1 | Sc = hr, R = r) 
(2.3) 

do not depend on r. equat (2.3) thu form a 
necessari condit for the test fair of S. We 
can think of thi a a constraint on the valu of the 
confus matrix. A second constraint—on that 
we have no direct control over—i the recidiv 
preval within groups, which we denot here by 
pr ≡ p(i = 1 | R = r). 

given valu of the ppv ∈ (0, 1) and preval 
p ∈ (0, 1), it be straightforward to show that the fals 
neg rate fnr = p(sc = LR | Y = 1) and fals 
posit rate fpr = p(sc = HR | Y = 0) be relat 

2 



via the equat 

fpr = 
p 

1− p 
1− ppv 

ppv 
(1− fnr). (2.4) 

A direct implic of thi simpl express be that 
when the recidiv preval differ between two 
groups, a test-fair score Sc cannot have equal fals 
posit and neg rate across those groups.3 

thi observ enabl u to good understand 
whi the propublica author observ larg discrep- 
anci in fpr and fnr between black and white 
defendants.4 the recidiv rate among back defen- 
dant in the data be 51%, compar to 39% for white 
defendants. sinc the compa rpi approxim 
satisfi test fairness, we know that some level of im- 
balanc in the error rate must exist. 

3 assess impact 

In thi section we show how differ in fals pos- 
itiv and fals neg rate can result in dispar 
impact under polici where a high-risk assess 
result in a stricter penalti for the defendant. such 
situat may aris when risk assess be use 
to inform bail, parole, or sentenc decisions. In 
the state of pennsylvania, for instance, statut per- 
mit the use of rpi’ in sentencing, provid that 
the sentenc ultim fall within accept guide- 
lines. We use the term “penalty” somewhat loos 
in thi discuss to refer to outcom both in the 
pre-trial and post-convict phase of legal proceed- 
ings. even though pre-trial outcom such a the 
amount at which bail be set be not punit in a le- 
gal sense, we nevertheless refer to bail amount a a 
“penalty” for the purpos of our discussion. 

there be notabl case where rpi’ be use for 
the express purpos of inform risk reduct ef- 
forts. In such settings, individu assess a high 
risk receiv what may be view a a benefit rather 
than a penalty. the pcra score, for instance, be 
intend to support precis thi type of decision- 
make at the feder court level. our analysi in 
thi section specif address use case where 
high-risk individu receiv stricter penalties. 

3thi observ be also make in independ concurr 
work by kleinberg et al. [11]. 

4black: fpr = 45%, fnr = 28%. 
white: fpr = 23%, fnr = 48% 

To begin, consid a set in which guidelin 
indic that a defend be to receiv a penalti tL ≤ 
T ≤ tH . A veri simpl risk-bas approach, which 
we will refer to a the minmax policy, would be to 
assign penalti a follows: 

tminmax = 

{ 
tL if Sc = low-risk 

tH if Sc = high-risk 
. (3.1) 

In thi simpl setting, we can precis character- 
ize the extent of dispar impact in term of rec- 
ogniz quantities. defin tr,i to be the penalti 
give to a defend in group R = r with observ 
outcom Y = y ∈ {0, 1}, and let ∆ = ∆(y1, y2) = 
e(tb,y1 − tw,y2) be expect differ in sentenc 
between defend in differ groups. ∆ be a mea- 
sure of dispar impact. 

proposit 3.1. the expect differ in penalti 
under the minmax polici be give by 

∆ ≡ eminmax(tb,y1 − tw,y2) 
= (th − tl) 

[ 
p(sc = HR | R = b, Y = y1) 
− p(sc = HR | R = w, Y = y2) 

] 
We will discu two immedi corollari of thi 
result. 

corollari 3.1 (non-recidivators). among individ- 
ual who do not recidivate, the differ in averag 
penalti under the minmax polici be 

∆ = (th − tl)(fprb − fprw) (3.2) 

corollari 3.2 (recidivators). among individu 
who recidivate, the differ in averag penalti un- 
der the minmax polici be 

∆ = (th − tl)(fnrw − fnrb) (3.3) 

when use a test-fair rpi in popul where 
recidiv preval differ across groups, it will 
gener be the case that the high recidiv 
preval group will have a high fpr and low 
fnr. from equat (3.2) and (3.3), we can see 
that thi would result in great penalti for defen- 
dant in the high preval group, both among 
recidiv and non-recidiv offenders. 

An interest special case to consid be one where 
tL = 0. thi could aris in sentenc decis for 

3 



offend convict of low-sever crime who have 
good prior records. In such cases, so-cal restora- 
tive sanction may be impos a an altern to 
a period of incarceration. If we further take tH = 1, 
then ET = p(t 6= 0), which can be interpret a 
the probabl that a defend receiv a sentenc 
impos some period of incarceration. 

it’ easi to see that in such set a non- 
recidiv defend in group b be fprb/fprw 
time more like to be incarcer compar to 
a non-recidiv defend in group w.5 thi nat- 
ural rais the question of whether overal differ- 
enc in error rate be observ to persist across 
more granular subgroups. 

one might expect that differ in fals posi- 
tive rate be larg attribut to the subset of 
defend who be charg with more seriou of- 
fen and who have a larg number of prior ar- 
rests/convictions. while it be true that the fals posi- 
tive rate within both racial group be high for de- 
fendant with bad crimin histories, consider 
between-group differ in these error rate persist 
across low prior count subgroups. figur 2 show 
a plot of fals posit rate across differ rang 
of prior count for defend charg with a misde- 
meanor offense, which be the low sever crimin 
offens category. As one can see, differ in fals 
posit rate between black defend and white 
defend persist across prior record subgroups. 

3.1 connect to measur of effect size 

A natur question to ask be whether the level of dis- 
parat impact, ∆, be relat to some measur of ef- 
fect size commonli use in scientif reporting. with 
a small gener of the % non-overlap measure, 
we can answer thi question in the affirmative. 

the % non-overlap of two distribut be gener- 
alli calcul assum both distribut be nor- 
mal, and thu have a one-to-on correspond to 
cohen’ d [12].6 figur 3 show that the compa 
decil score be far from be normal distributed. 
A more reason way to calcul % non-overlap 
be to note that in the gaussian case % non-overlap 

5we be overload notat in thi expression: here, 
fprr = p(hr | R = r, tL = 0), similarli for fnrr.

4 discuss 

the primari contribut of thi paper be to show 
how dispar impact can result from the use of a 
recidiv predict instrument that be know to 
be free from predict bias. our analysi focu 
on the simpl set where a binari risk assess 

4 



be use to inform a binari penalti policy. while 
all of the formula have natur analog in the non- 
binari score and penalti setting, we find that all of 
the salient featur be alreadi present in the anal- 
ysi of the simpler binary-binari problem. 

our analysi indic that there be risk assess- 
ment use case in which it be desir to balanc 
error rate across differ groups, even though thi 
will gener result in risk assess that be not 
free from predict bias. however, balanc er- 
ror rate overal may not be sufficient, a thi do 
not guarante balanc at finer level of granularity. 
that is, even if fprb = fprw, we may still see 
differ in error rate within prior record score 
categori (see e.g., figur 2). one need to decid 
the level of granular at which error rate balanc 
be desir to achieve. 

In closing, we would like to note that there be a 
larg bodi of literatur show that data-driven risk 
assess instrument tend to be more accur 
than profession human judgement [13, 14], and 
investig whether human-driven decis be 
themselv prone to exhibit racial bia [15, 16]. 
We should not abandon the data-driven approach 
on the basi of neg headlines. rather, we need 
to work to ensur that the instrument we use be 
demonstr free from the kind of quantifi bi- 
as that could lead to dispar impact in the spe- 
cific context in which they be to be applied.
