It be sometim assum that one face appear more 
attract than anoth becaus of it physic attributes, 
not becaus of when, where, or with whom it be seen. 
indeed, classic decision-mak theori assum ratio- 
nal agent who assign valu to decis option (luce, 
1959) and assum that these valu be fixed, regardless 
of ani other altern that be encount (i.e., 
regardless of context). these assumpt may contribut 
to the dearth of theori predict context effect on facial 
evalu (e.g., facial attractiveness). one candid 
theori for predict context effects—normalization— 
draw support from decision-mak studi show 
context effect (rangel & clithero, 2012). for decis 
among multipl options, divis normal represen- 
tation of option valu can be obtain by divid each 
option’ valu (assess without context) by the sum of 
all avail option valu (louie & glimcher, 2012; 
louie, khaw, & glimcher, 2013). for example, when an 
option have a valu of 3 be present togeth with 

option have valu of 2 and 1, it valu after divis 
normal be 0.5 (i.e., 3/(3 + 2 + 1)). 

normal may mediat context effect on attrac- 
tive decisions. It typifi neural respons through- 
out the brain and can be consid a put canon 
neural comput (carandini & heeger, 2012). normal- 
izat prolifer in the brain becaus it ensur that 
neural fire rate optim span prevail stimulu 
ranges. divis normal be well-studi for vision 
and explain nonlinear neural responses, includ pho- 
toreceptor normal to light intens (boynton & 
whitten, 1970), contrast normal and satur

abstract 
Do peopl appear more attract or less attract depend on the compani they keep? A divisive-norm 
account—in which represent of stimulu intens be normal (divided) by concurr stimulu intensities— 
predict that choic prefer among option increas with the rang of option values. In the first experi report 
here, I manipul the rang of attract of the face present on each trial by vari the attract of an 
undesir distractor face that be present simultan with two attract targets, and particip be ask 
to choos the most attract face. I use normal model to predict the context depend of prefer 
regard facial attractiveness. the more unattract the distractor, the more one of the target be prefer over 
the other target, which suggest that divis normal (a potenti canon comput in the brain) influenc 
social evaluations. I obtain the same result when I manipul faces’ averag and particip chose the 
most averag face. thi find suggest that divis normal be not restrict to value-bas decis (e.g., 
attractiveness). thi new applic to social evalu of normalization, a classic theory, open possibl for 
predict social decis in naturalist context such a advertis or dating.

and neural respons to motion (simoncelli & heeger, 
1998) and multipl object (zoccolan, cox, & dicarlo, 
2005). normal outsid vision includ nonlinear 
neural respons to auditori contrast (rabinowitz, 
willmore, schnupp, & king, 2011) and cross-mod 
normal in multisensori integr (ohshiro, 
angelaki, & deangelis, 2011). 

represent of reward valu be also normalized. 
brain respons encod the valu of choic option 
adapt to the rang of option valu (cox & kable, 2014; 
padoa-schioppa, 2009; rangel & clithero, 2012). thi 
normal affect human choic behavior, too. An 
undesir option modul the choic between two 
other option (soltani, De martino, & camerer, 2012), for 
example, when monkey choos among juic reward 
and human choos among snack food (louie et al., 
2013). In louie et al. (2013), lower-valu distractor item 
(i.e., a wider rang of option values) increas prefer- 
enc for the good of two desir options, a find 
predict by comput simul of divis normaliza- 
tion. thus, divis normal effect expand or 
contract the dynam rang of valu represent to 
match the rang of option values. 

normal could mediat similar context effect in 
the social domain too, but a theori to predict context 
effect for social evalu be lacking. In an attractive- 
ness experiment, I test whether normal predict 
facial attractiveness. particip evalu facial attrac- 
tive without context in a first phase; in a second 
phase, they perform a trinary-choic task to ass 
attract preferences. when two highli attract 
target and a low-attract distractor be choic 
options, participants’ choic should becom more sensi- 
tive to differ in attract of the two targets. In 
a control experi (i.e., averag experiment), I 
test for the same effect use a task in which partici- 
pant chose the most average-appear face. these 
averag choic may share some perceptu base 
with attract choic (langloi & roggman, 1990) 
but have no overt value-bas connotation. thi control 
task could therefor show whether normal be 
restrict to value-bas judgment such a attract 
or affect high-level facial judgment in general. 

method 

particip 

I enrol two sampl of 40 particip each, select 
a sampl size equival to that use by louie et al. 
(2013). for the attract experiment, all 40 (age 
rang = 18−23; 25 women) contribut data for analysis. 
for the averag experi (approxim age 

rang = 18−55, 28 women), data for 1 particip be 
remov from analysi becaus her respons suggest 
that the instruct be not followed. particip be 
student or staff at royal holloway, univers of london, 
and have normal or corrected-to-norm vision. 

for the attract experiment, particip be 
enter into a draw for one £25 amazon voucher. for 
the averag experiment, particip be compen- 
sate £8. the attract experi be approv by 
the psycholog depart ethic committee, and the aver- 
agen experi be approv by the colleg ethic 
committee, both at royal holloway, univers of london. 

procedur 

stimuli includ color photograph of 15 male and 15 
femal neutral face sampl from the karolinska 
direct emot face (kdef) face set (lundqvist, 
flykt, & öhman, 1998). In phase 1 (fig. 1a, left), partici- 
pant rat either the attract or the averag of 
the 30 faces, two time each, sequenti and in a pseu- 
dorandom order. 

On each trial, particip saw a face and below that a 
horizont line repres a continuum of valu 
(between 0 and 1). they use the mous to choos a 
value. the next trial appear after the mous click. the 
two rate record for each face dure phase 1 be 
averag for each participant. these averag phase 1 
rate be take a estim of each participant’ judg- 
ment without context or normalization. In the attractive- 
ness experiment, face be select for phase 2 base 
on each participant’ attract ratings. In the aver- 
agen experiment, face be select for phase 2 
base on each participant’ averag ratings. On the 
basi of these averages, the lowest-r (least attract 
or least average) 10 male face and 10 femal face be 
select a distractor (fig. 1b), and the highest-r 5 
male face and 5 femal face be select a target 
(fig. 1c) for phase 2. 

In each trial of phase 2, three face (two target and a 
distractor) appear on the screen at the left, center, and 
right (fig. 1a, right). the face be present in pseudo- 
random order, and the faces’ screen locat be 
assign randomly. the face come from the 10 possibl 
pair of five target for each gender, match to the 10 
same-gend distractors. the particip indic which 
of the face be most attract or most averag by press- 
ing a button on a comput keyboard, which trigger the 
next trial. I measur which target be chosen on each 
trial and whether the chosen target be the more attrac- 
tive target (or more averag target) accord to the rat- 
ing from phase 1. each particip complet 200 trials.

result 

attract and averag rate in phase 1 be 
submit to an analysi of varianc (anova) with fac- 
tor of distractor, face’ gender, and participant’ gender. 
attract rate (fig. 1b) be significantli great 
for target than for distractors, f(1, 38) = 320.06, p < .001, 
ηp2 = .89, and for femal face than for male faces, f(1, 
38) = 40.52, p < .001, ηp2 = .52. there be no effect of 
participant’ gender or ani interact among the three 
factors. averag rate (fig. 1c) be also signifi- 
cantli great for target than for distractors, f(1, 37) = 
349.78, p < .001, ηp2 = .90. neither the effect of face’ 
gender (p = .08) nor ani other effect reach signific 
for averag ratings. becaus the distractor be 
alway give low rate compar with the targets, dis- 
tractor be never chosen a the most attract or most 
averag face in phase 2. 

A divisive-norm account would predict that 
distractor face that receiv low phase 1 rate would 
be associ with great differ in the proport 
of choic between the two target face in phase 2. 
becaus each particip provid hi or her own rat- 
ings, I standard rate across particip by rank 
the distractor (attract experiment, fig. 2a; aver- 
agen experiment, fig. 2c); the lowest-r distractor 
of each gender have the low rank (i.e., a 1). visual 
inspect of figur 2 reveal that distractor with a low 
rank be associ with more choic of the more 
attract target (fig. 2a) and with more choic of the 
more averag target (fig. 2c). for the attract 
experiment, an unexpect result be that male partici- 
pant be more like to choos the more attract tar- 
get face when it be male than when it be female, 
wherea femal particip show thi pattern to a 
lesser degre (fig. 2b). 

sever analysi focu on the hypothes effect 
of distractor rate confirm these patterns. for the attrac- 
tive experiment, an anova on the proport of 
choic of the more attract target, with distractor’ rank, 
face’ gender, and participant’ gender a factors, show 
a signific main effect of distractor’ rank, f(9, 342) = 
3.79, p < .001, ηp2 = .09, and face’ gender, f(1, 38) = 15.03, 
p < .001, ηp2 = .28, and a signific interact between 
face’ gender and participant’ gender, f(1, 38) = 4.22, p = 
.047, ηp2 = .10. the averag experi replic the 
signific main effect of distractor’ rank, f(9, 333) = 4.27, 
p < .001, with a similar effect size, ηp2 = .10, although there 
be no other signific effect for thi anova. 

the effect of distractor’ rank in both the attractive- 
ness and the averag experi be confirm 
by multipl linear regression. separ for each partici- 
pant, I quantit test for the predict neg 
direct of the effect of distractor’ rank on choic 
behavior. the predictor in these model be distrac- 
tor’ rank, face’ gender, and their interaction, and the 
outcom be the proport of choic of the higher- 
rat (more attract or more average) target. the result- 
ing participant-specif β valu be test for 
signific across the sampl in the second level of a 
hierarch analysi that treat particip a a random 
effect. for the attract experiment, a neg rela- 
tionship between distractor’ rank and the proport of 
choic of the more attract target be confirm by a 
signific left-sid t test, mean β = −0.006, confid 
bound = −0.003, t(39) = −4.02, p < .001. the same analy- 
si replic thi effect for the averag experiment, 
mean β = −0.01, confid bound = −0.007, t(39) = 
−5.30, p < .001. thi shift in proport of high target 
rate be associ with an effect size convent 
regard a larg (attractiveness: cohen’ d = 1.29; aver- 
ageness: cohen’ d = 1.72), and the shift in rel choic

a a function of distractor valu be within the rang of 
previou report of other decision-mak paradigm (for 
an exampl that investig domin effect for visual 
stimulu dimensions, see trueblood, brown, heathcote, 
& busemeyer, 2013). 

further confirm for influenc of distractor rate 
on choic behavior be provid by an analysi that 
directli predict the choic on each trial (a oppos to 
proport of choic in differ conditions) use a 
binomi gener linear model with a logist link 
function (for a similar analysis, see louie et al., 2013). for 
each participant, a gener linear model predict a 
binari variabl encod whether the particip chose 
the high rat (more attract or more average) target 
on each trial using, a regressors, the phase 1 rate of 
the leftmost target, the phase 1 rate of the rightmost 
target, the phase 1 rate of the distractor, the gender of 
the face, and the interact between distractor rate and 
face gender. again, magnitud of the participant-specif 
β valu for distractor attract be test for sig- 
nific across the sampl at a second level, treat 
particip a a random variable. for the attract 
experiment, the hypothesi be confirm by a neg 
relationship between distractor’ attract and fre- 
quenci of choic of the more attract target, mean 
β = −1.65, 95% confid interv (ci) = [−2.46, −0.50], 
t(39) = −2.9, p = .006, cohen’ d = 0.93. thus, on a give 
trial, the more attract the distractor, the less like it 
be that one target would be chosen over the other. the 
averag experi replic thi neg relation- 
ship between the distractor’ rate and proport of 
choic of the high rat target (more average, in thi 
case), mean β = −1.37, 95% CI = [−1.916, −0.819], t(38) = 
−5.0, p < .001, cohen’ d = 1.64. 

louie et al. (2013), use the same paradigm that we 
use in the current study, show that the psychometr 
function that predict the probabl of choos a par- 
ticular target on the basi of differ between the val- 
ue of the two target exhibit a larg slope for distractor 
with low reward values. thi psychometr function 
can have a sigmoid shape. when target 2 be consider 
more valuabl than target 1 (i.e., target-valu differ 
be negative), particip never choos target 1. As the 
valu of target 1 increas rel to target 2, the pro- 
portion of target 1 choic will increase. when target 1 
becom consider more valuabl than target 2, par- 
ticip will alway choos target 1. the slope of thi 
sigmoid function measur how sensit choic prefer- 
enc be to differ between the two targets. In the 
current study, target valu be measur a phase 1 
rate and so we assess choic a a function of target- 
rate differences. If attract or averag repre- 
sentat be divis normalized, then low-rat 
distractor should increas participants’ sensit to 

target-r differ in attract or averag 
and therebi increas the slope of the sigmoid function. 
hence, a divisive-norm account predict that dis- 
tractor rank will be neg relat to the slope of the 
psychometr function. 

thi predict be test by fit to the data the 
logist curv y = 1/(1 + exp(−β1 × (x − β2))), where y val- 
ue be the predict proport of target 1 choic (taken 
in the current studi a the leftmost target on the screen), x 
valu be the target-r differences, β1 repres the 
slope parameter, and β2 repres the inflection-point 
parameter. becaus target-r differ and distractor 
rate be differ for each participant, there be no 
fix valu across participants. To facilit summar 
data over particip (fig. 3) and to ensur a suffici 
number of averag trial for fitting, I bin the distrac- 
tor rank (5 bins) and target-rating-differ rank (12 
bins) and then fit logist function to data in these 
bins. thi yield separ logist function paramet 
(nlimfit.m in matlab; the mathworks, natick, ma) for 
each particip and distractor bin. although logist 
slope valu be comput from individu particip 
logist fits, for visual purposes, figur 3a, 3b, 3d, 
and 3e show function fit to group data. A reduct in 
slope that chang continu across distractor bin be 
appar for both attract and averag choices. 

for analysi of logist slopes, poor curv fit 
occur on occasion. for the attract experiment, 
2 outli slope out of 200 (40 particip × 5 distractor 
bins) be remov becaus they be more than 6 stan- 
dard deviat from their distractor-bin mean and be 
great than 30 although all other valu be less than 
1. for the averag experiment, 8 out of 195 slope 
be remov becaus they be more than 2.5 standard 
deviat from their distractor-bin mean and be 
great than 14 although all other valu be less than 
1. next, I use linear regress to ascertain whether dis- 
tractor bin be neg associ with logist slope, 
by fit a line to the five logist slope separ for 
each particip (figs. 3c and 3f). these participant- 
specif linear regress β valu be submit to a 
second-level, one-sampl t test. becaus we have an a 
priori hypothesi predict a decreas in slope a a 
function of distractor bin, and becaus a similar decreas 
have be report by previou research (louie et al., 
2013), we test for decreas slope by implement 
left-sid t tests. the result confirm the predict of 
normal for both the attract and the average- 
ness experiments. across participants, logist slope 
be neg relat to distractor’ attractiveness, 
mean β = −0.02, confid bound = −0.003, t(39) = 
−2.00, p = .027, cohen’ d = 0.32, and to distractor’ aver- 
ageness, mean β = −0.02, confid bound = −0.001, 
t(38) = −1.8, p = .04, cohen’ d = 0.38.

the attract experi show that particip 
be more like to find one target more attract than 
another, depend on the unattract of the dis- 
tractor (fig. 2a), even though distractor be too unat- 
tractiv to be chosen (fig. 1b). moreover, less attract 
distractor increas participants’ choic sensit to dif-

from divis normal (carandini & heeger, 2012), 
in which neural fire rate adapt to span the rang of 
options. for the attract experiment, less attract 
distractor widen the attract rang of options, 
and so normal to thi wider rang pull apart the 
represent of the two targets. the result be an 
increas in choic frequenc of the more attract target 
(fig. 2) and more sensit of choic to differ in 
target attract (fig. 3). these find support the 
notion that normal prolifer throughout the ner- 
vou system, give that similar effect aris for monkey’ 
prefer for juic reward and humans’ prefer for 
snack food (louie et al., 2013). divis normalization, 
moreover, explain neural respons throughout the 
visual and auditori system and contribut to sensori 
integr and decis make (carandini & heeger, 
2012). the attract and averag experi 
demonstr that normal affect people’ choic 
and percept in higher-level social domain a well. 

although the normal account provid a basi 
for predict context effect on social evaluations, tim- 
ing effect still need to be explained. context can also be 
manipul use repetit present of stimuli. 
adapt (prolong exposure) to facial distortions, for 
example, increas attract of similarli distort 
face (rhodes, jeffery, watson, clifford, & nakayama, 
2003; winkler & rhodes, 2005). assimil effect for 
sequenti face can occur for attract (taubert, 
van der burg, & alais, 2016) and ident (liberman, 
fischer, & whitney, 2014) and may aris from process 
that maintain visual continuity. A differ finding, the 
contrast effect, occur when success present of 
attract face render face less attract (wedell, 
parducci, & geiselman, 1987) and have be associ 
with range-frequ normal (parducci, 1965; 
wedel et al., 1987). I found that rang frequenc theori 
be not a viabl altern to divis normal 
use a simul of the trinary-choic paradigm follow- 
ing method report in louie et al. (2013). although thi 
simul replic the result of louie et al. for divi- 
sive normalization, range-frequ theori produc an 
opposit result: rel choic between target becom 
more confusable, not more distinct, for low distractor 

values. whether instantan present and repeti- 
tive success present draw on differ mecha- 
nism remain to be tested. 

although contrast adapt to sequenc and 
normal share the goal of adjust neural fire to 
match prevail stimulu condit (webster, kaping, 
mizokami, & duhamel, 2004), in trinari choice, the con- 
text chang on each trial more quickli than in adapta- 
tion experiments. In addition, in the brain, some type of 
normal be best observ after block mani tri- 
al (rangel & clithero, 2012). thi slow time cours may 
be good suit for measur adapt and contrast 
effect than the faster context chang associ with 
trinary-choic tasks. louie and glimcher (2012) have 
alreadi note a distinct between normal by 
more immedi spatial context versu a tempor con- 
text, which be depend instead on the histori of previ- 
ou stimuli. result from the attract and averag 
experi therefor highlight the time scale of context 
effect a a variabl requir further study. 

compar with sequence-depend rate tasks, 
trinary-choic task have an advantag feature. mul- 
tipl target option reveal addit effect of stretch 
or contract to adjust to stimulu rang by show 
how distractor pull target choic apart or push them 
together, a find difficult to infer from sequenti likert 
ratings. trinari choic also form the basi for mani deci- 
sion-mak effect (kowal & faulkner, 2016) includ 
the similar effect (tversky, 1972), the attract effect 
(huber, payne, & puto, 1982) and the compromis effect 
(simonson, 1989). these effect involv select 
manipul a distractor’ similar to the target along 
specif stimulu attributes. such studi be use to 
examin multiattribut decis make and be often 
couch a commod purchas (rather than a social 
evaluations) in which multiple-valu attribut can be 
experiment manipul (e.g., choos between 
use car that vari in both mileag and price). the cur- 
rent experi use photograph of natur face and 
manipul onli overal attract (or averageness) 
rather than select attributes. however, facial attribut 
could, in principle, be manipul in trinary-choic 
task to studi multiattribut decision-mak phenomenon 
in social contexts. 

the attract and averag experi also 
engend new research question about which repre- 
sentat be normalized. mani potenti normal 
represent could contribut to attract deci- 
sions, includ visual represent of facial attributes. 
If attract decis aris from evalu of visual 
information, then they will be influenc when visual 
represent be normalized. for example, wedel and 
pettibon (1999) manipul the rang of eye and nose 
width on schemat face to induc contrast effect on 



1386 furl 

eye- and nose-width perception, and they found corre- 
spond shift in judgment of face pleasantness. the 
averag experi explor a similar possibl by 
examin a high-level facial judgment that might resem- 
ble some of the perceptu assess involv in attrac- 
tive perception, although averag choic lack 
the same overt reward-bas assess a attract 
choices. the find of normal for averag 
decis suggest that normal be not limit to 
reward-bas judgment (louie et al., 2013) and might 
oper on high-level visual assessments. however, mani 
potenti visual contribut to attract decis 
could be normalized. evid alreadi exist for normal- 
izat of low-level visual respons to luminance, con- 
trast, and motion in the visual cortex (carandini & heeger, 
2012), and imag evid exist for normal in 
visual area for object represent (zoccolan et al., 
2005). behavior and brain-respons measur be 
still need to fulli ass the role of visual normaliza- 
tion in social evalu of faces. 

attract decis be also decis about 
potenti rewards, and the averag experi can- 
not exclud the possibl of addit normal of 
reward-bas represent (louie et al., 2013). more- 
over, the situat be further complic by evid of 
multipl brain represent of reward-rel value, 
ani of which might be suscept to normalization. for 
faces, sever brain area (e.g., amygdala, prefront 
areas, ventral striatum) be associ with reward valu 
(bzdok et al., 2012; kampe, frith, dolan, & frith, 2001; 
pegors, kable, chatterjee, & epstein, 2015; smith et al., 
2010; winston, o’doherty, kilner, perrett, & dolan, 2007). 
moreover, ventromedi prefront cortex may map dif- 
ferent scale valu from differ stimulu domain 
onto a singl reward-valu represent (i.e., a common 
currency; pegor et al., 2015; smith et al., 2010; vessel, 
stahl, purton, & starr, 2015). In the monkey, a similar area 
in the orbitofront cortex have alreadi be show to 
exhibit normal respons to reward (cox & kable, 
2014; padoa-schioppa, 2009). behavior and brain- 
respons measur be need also to fulli ass 
the role of normal of reward-bas representa- 
tion in social evalu of faces. 

normal theori (e.g., divis normalization) 
motiv new quantit predictions, such a those 
test here. the fact that normal explain prefer- 
enc in the social domain suggest new applic to 
appli or naturalist settings. the abil to predict 
social evalu in context might gener to adver- 
tising, web site design, consum behavior, and so forth. 
context effect on social decis also challeng com- 
mon assumptions, includ those of classic econom- 
ics, that rel values, such a attractiveness, be 
constant over time. although peopl alter their face 

through makeup, hairstyles, and the like to appear attrac- 
tive, in fact, face appear more or less attract depend- 
ing on context. indeed, peopl may even social 
evalu a person differ depend on who be stand- 
ing nearby.
