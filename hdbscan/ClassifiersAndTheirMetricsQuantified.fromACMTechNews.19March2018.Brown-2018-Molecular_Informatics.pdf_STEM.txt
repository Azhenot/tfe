tion of an invers cumul distribut function take 
over a metric surface. the propos distribut analysi 
can aid in the select of metric when formul studi

1 introduct 

comput model for molecular phenomenon have 
becom a mainstream tool in the academ and industri 
research communities.[1,2] asid from pure experiment 
medicin chemist who often priorit their experi 
and intuition, mani team consid the result of computa- 
tional predict when proceed to experiment valida- 
tion.[3] perhap the most common comput model be 
the discret classif model, and within discret 
classification, the two-class discrimin be frequent. In these 
models, the object be to fit a mathemat function to 
discrimin between exampl with “yes”/”positive”/”ac- 
tive”/”true” label and exampl with “no”/”negative”/”in- 
active”/”false” labels. In molecular informatics, exampl of 
the two-class discrimin includ predict if compound 
have a specif properti or not (e.g, chemic stabil under 
a give set of conditions), if protein interact with each 
other or not, or if ligand and receptor have a strong 
interact or not a measur by ic50 , ec50 , Ki , Kd , etc. 

In mani cases, model be comput from some 
descriptor or fingerprint represent of the molecules, 
and the model’ abil to discrimin between the two 
class be evalu by consid the result of predict 
on an addit dataset. for two-class problems, thi yield 
four type of results, a the predict exampl be pre- 
label with their know class and addit have a label 
result from prediction. the four result type be true 
posit (tp), fals posit (fp) know a fals discoveri 
or type-i errors, true neg (tn), and fals neg (fn) 
know a miss discoveri or type-ii error (see figur 1). 
the collect of all four result type be often refer to a 
the confus matrix. 

while the raw count of these four primari outcom 
be informative, research often summar a confus 
matrix by a single, real-valu metric, to decid on the 
qualiti of a model, to facilit rank of method or 
datasets, and so forth. two common, and potenti most 
intuitive, metric be the true posit rate (tpr) and 
accuraci (acc) metrics: 

tpr ¼ TP 
tpþ FN acc ¼ 

tpþ TN 
tpþ fpþ tnþ FN : 

the former gaug how well posit instanc be in 
fact classifi by the model, and the latter gaug how well 
both posit and neg instanc be jointli classified. 
hit find team may refer to the tpr when they wish to 
forecast the virtual screen of a larg chemic library, and 
hit-to-lead and lead optim team might refer to acc 
when consid the select of a molecule, that is, the 
molecule’ charact to onli interact with the target 
intend by the molecul develop team. 

studi that have execut prospect experiment 
valid of comput predict molecular proper- 
tie often report low to medium success rate despit 
moder to high model metric performance.[4–6] while it be 
true that our understand of the exact molecular under-

pin of process be a continu evolv process and 
therefor we cannot build a perfect discrimin (model) of 
a phenomenon, a more fundament problem exist in the 
metric we often use to evalu our results. In fact, metric 
such a tpr and acc often overestim the “true” model 
performance. action base on the mislead metric incur 
a risk to a project which can lead to misfortune, typic a 
a result of overconfid in the discrimin computed. 

In the remaind of thi article, we illustr the concern 
around metric such a tpr and acc by shift analysi 
away from single-point numer estim to metric valu 
surfac (heatmaps) and consid some statist prop- 
erti of the metrics. while some previou attempt to 
objectifi metric exist,[7–16] thi articl is, to the best of our 
knowledge, the first to gener ass metric surfac 
and their interplay with data balance. further, we also 
propos a method to quantit cross-compar metrics, 
and examin a practic case studi in chemogenom virtual 
screening.

from the confus matrix, mani metric be possible. In 
addit to the tpr and acc introduc earlier, here we 
consid the balanc accuraci (ba), posit predict 
valu (ppv), f-measur and it deriv f1-score (f1), true 
neg rate (tnr), and the matthew correl coef- 
ficient (mcc). these be defin mathemat a follows:

ðtpþ fpþðtpþ fnþðtnþ fpþðtnþ fnþ 
p : 

one fact we can immedi note from these defini- 
tion be how mani type of result from the confus 
matrix be includ in each metric. tpr, tnr, and ppv 
includ two type of results, and BA and F1 includ three 
type of results. mcc and acc includ all four result type 
in their formulations, though onli mcc includ both type-i 
error and type-ii error in it numerator, and in a multi- 

plic manner. the rang of valu for the metric be 
[�1,1] for the mcc, and [0,1] for all others. 

let u consid a simpl exampl of two predict 
experiments, and the result metric valu for mcc and 
acc. In the first experiment, we have TP = 1000, TN = 2100, 
FP = 150, FN = 650. We might consid thi to be a rather 
success prediction. the result acc be 0.80 and 
result mcc be 0.58. immediately, we notic that the mcc 
penal the type-i and type-ii error more than the acc 
metric. 

In the second experiment, let u assum that there be 
few posit in the dataset, and that TP = 500, with tn, 
fp, and FN the same a above. We might also consid thi 
to be success base on the low fals discoveri rate (fpr), 
and when we evalu the experi by acc the valu be 
0.76. 

thi be where we have deceiv ourselves. despit the 
high valu of acc, a re-examin of the data would 
reveal that we make more type-ii error than we correctli 
detect the positives. while the metric differ in the 
experi for acc be onli 0.04, the latter experiment’ 
mcc be 0.44, a metric differ of 0.14. We come to 
understand that the mcc be a more challeng metric to 
score high on, and that over-expect can be easili 
born when use the acc without consid the back- 
ground data. 

the addit issu we must be awar of be the ratio of 
data between the two classes. In mani machin learn 
scenarios, equal number of posit and neg instanc 
be use for model calcul and evaluation. however, in 
molecular informatics, thi be a skew of reality. for 
example, in experimentally-bas drug discoveri and 
chemic biology, hit molecul be typic found at rate 
of 1 %.[17,18] even in less extrem exampl where 10 %–25 % 
of the data belong to the ‘positive’ (hit) class, metric such 
a acc can yield high valu even if the model predict 
everyth a a neg (see below). 

We can enhanc our understand of each metric’ 
implic by consid the entir space of valu it can 
take a a consequ of all possibl type-i and type-ii error 
rates, or altern and perhap more intuitively, a a 
consequ of all possibl tpr and tnrs. As note above, 
these rate be impact by the ratio of data classes, and so 
should also be a factor in our interpretations. 

We begin by visual the mcc and consid the 
impact of data ratio (figur 2, left). We immedi note

that have either high tpr or tnr be not a suffici 
condit for high mcc. extrem optim on either 
posit or neg can yield mcc valu close to 0. 
rather, both error rate must be low in order to achiev a 
high mcc. the situat in practical, imbalanc data be 
even more extrem (figur 2, right); the region of the mcc 
surfac which be at or abov 0.6 be consider reduc 
compar to the surfac for balanc data. 

when we consid the same pair of data ratio condit 
but evalu use acc a show in figur 3, it becom 
clear to u whi acc can trigger high expectations. though 
extrem optim on one class yield mcc valu of 0, it 
yield acc valu of 0.5 in balanc datasets. even worse, in 
hit and lead discoveri applic with discoveri rate of 
10 % or less, a model can achiev a suggest strong acc 

of 0.8 or high without even predict a positive/act 
entity. 

As an addit way of analyz the metrics, we might 
consid the distribut of valu within the metric space 
show in figur 2 and figur 3. thi would yield a 
probabl distribut function (assum a small toler 
or bandwidth parameter), and we could comput the 
correspond cumul distribut function. instead, let 
u consid the “invers cumul distribut function 
(icdf)”, defin a the fraction of valu in the metric space 
that be great than or equal to a give metric valu 
threshold. our motiv for thi be that we might ask, 
what be the probabl of get at least the valu X for a 
particular metric? We can sampl the perform matrix 
for the fraction of valu that be at least a give value, and

take over the valu domain of the metric, thi yield a 
continu plot and subsequ visual interpret of the 
odd of obtain a particular valu or good of a metric. 
the result mirror imag of a classic cumul distribu- 
tion function suggest the prefix “inverse”. just a with the 
metric space visualization, the icdf inher depend on 
the class ratio. 

the icdf analog of figur 2 and 3 be show in 
figur 4. It confirm that the probabl of obtain 
metric valu of 0.6 or 0.8 be mani fold high for acc 
than for mcc, regardless of data ratio. the icdf curv 
reinforc whi misfortun may occur when base decis 
on model acc values; the probabl of achiev an acc 
of 0.8 actual increas with a trend toward an imbalanc 
dataset. In contrast, one can feel more confid in a model 
that achiev mcc of 0.8, for the probabl of such be 
rather low a an effect of it formulation. 

herein we have assum that the prior probabl of 
obtain ani particular valu in the metric surfac space be 
uniform. yet in practic applications, thi assumpt will 

not hold, and prior will be influenc by datasets. there- 
fore, we can argu that the icdf give in figur 4, notabl 
for mcc, be optimist estimates, and in reality, the gap 
between mcc and auc icdf may in fact be even larg in 
practice. 

the surfac of the acc, tnr, ba, f1, ppv, and mcc 
metric be place togeth in figur 5 for a balanc ratio 
of data. for balanc data, we see that the F1 score also 
penal a high type-ii error rate and yield a metric valu 
close to 0. thi be a consequ of use the ppv and tpr 
in tandem. however, it be possibl to over-optim on 
posit and score high with f1, so some caution be 
recommended. for balanc datasets, acc and BA be 
synonymous. 

turn to imbalanc dataset domin by nega- 
tives/inact (figur 6), we see the rough correl 
between the acc and tnr surfaces, which reiter the 
caution involv in use acc. A predictor yield an acc 
of 0.9 on a strongli imbalanc dataset might potenti 
be a predictor of neg and otherwis littl more than

chance. the BA metric be unchang with respect to the 
data ratios. the clearest effect a a function of data ratio be 
on the F1 and ppv metrics. much like mcc, the probabl 
of obtain high F1 and ppv score be strongli 
diminish when data be imbalanced, so model with high 
valu under these condit could be constru to be 
legitim predict in prospect applications. 

here a well, it be help to consid the icdf of the 
metrics. In figur 7, an overlay of the icdf of the six 
metric be shown, with separ view for balanc and 
imbalanc data. for balanc data, it be clearli more 
challeng to achiev a mcc valu of 0.6 compar to 
other metrics. when data be imbalanced, acc, ba, and tnr 
have high odd of achiev 0.6 or 0.8 than f1, mcc, or

ppv, and thu the former three statist must be use with 
caution, particularli if the statist will be a part of select 
model that will guid prospect applications. 

figur 5 and 6 demonstr the clear shift in metric 
surfac a a result of data imbalance, and figur 7 
objectifi the metric surfac by icdf analysis. An 
expand analysi be still further possibl by continu 
vari the positive-neg data ratio and connect the 
per-ratio snapshots. In the supplementari data, the inter- 
est reader can find anim of the shift in metric 
surfac and icdf. what do we learn from such animations? 
they provid u a good understand of the depend 
of a metric on the data ratio, and we gain skill in 
interpret the signific of a give two-class model 
experiment. also, these anim expand our perspect 
for prepar prospect studi design, by select metric 
appropri to the studi context (vide supra). 

We addit provid pseudocod for the reader to 
develop visual of new metric approach base on a 
confus matrix. code use the python program 
languag style, the numpi matrix library,[19] and the 
matplotlib visual library[20] be given. first, the under- 
lie surfac matrix must be comput a follows. 

list 1 – code for surfac matrix 

“metric” be a calcul function use the argument tp, tn, 
fp, and fn. 
“npos” and “nneg” refer to the number of posit and 
neg repres the data. 

In the scheme in list 1, it be recommend to enforc 
that the “gridsize” paramet will be a valu that evenli 
divid 100. the paramet will control the granular of 
visual and amount of memori requir to comput 
the metric matrices. 

second, the matrix gener be to be visualized. use 
the matplotlib library, thi be rel trivial. We add code 
to handl the case where a metric cannot be comput in 
extrem case such a all exampl predict into the same 
class. thi be handl in list 1 by the try-except claus 
for error caus by divis by zero. 

list 2 – code for metric matrix visual 

“fig” be a matplotlib figur object, and “axes” be a matplotlib 
axe object whose parent be “fig”. the “mat” be gener by 
list 1. A matplotlib colormap object “cmap” be provid 
to standard the same color scheme across the metrics. 
addit argument store in the “args” key-valu map- 
ping control the final visual rendered.

3 metric and the receiv oper 
characterist curv 

anoth highli common method for assess the perform- 
anc of a model method be the gener of a receiv 
oper characterist (roc) curve, and the area under 
such a gener curve. roc curv be most commonli 
built by use cross-valid techniqu that perform 
multipl round of dataset splitting, such that each round 
of predict valu can be includ in a more comprehen- 
sive list of threshold which will yield a per-threshold pair of 
valu for tpr and type-i error rate (the tpr and type-i 
error will be comput use the entir collect of 
predict span all round of dataset splitting). thresh- 
old valu could be, to name onli a few, distanc from 
hyperplan when use the svm algorithm[21] or the 
percentag of tree vote when use a random forest 
algorithm.[22] A plot of all tpr and type-i error rate use all 
threshold then result in a curv indic the tradeoff 
between optim on the two metrics. If a threshold can 
be found such that it can discrimin all or most of the 
posit from the negatives, then it will result in an area 
under the roc curv close to 1. for further explanation, see 
the literatur on roc and extens to roc.[15] 

To analyz the auc in the same metric surfac frame- 
work, one modif be needed. In the case of acc, mcc, 
and similar metrics, fix count of posit and neg 
(and henc their ratio) complet determin the result 
surfac (becaus we can iter the grid of tpr and tnr 
independ of an actual model). however, in the case of 
auc, a rang of threshold obtain from cross-valid 
model and predict be requir for metric calculation. 
therefore, instead of gener a grid of tpr/tnr, we must 
gener a grid of posit and neg dataset sizes, and 
execut cross-valid with accompani auc calcula- 
tion at each point. repeat execut and comput 
of averag auc minim outlier valu that may occur. 

We execut two auc calcul and surfac analysi 
experiments. In the first, we use artifici stochast classifi 
function (random selector base on underli distribu- 
tions) a surrog of model comput from real data. In 
the second, we appli the svm algorithm to large-scal 
public gpcr glass[23] and kinas sarfari[24] ligand-target 
bioactiv datasets, where the active/inact threshold 
be set to 100nm/1-10um, and intermedi strength 
interact be discard (for further data process 
details, see reker et al.[25]); the human-based, filter data- 

set contain 49815 activ (71 %) versu 20145 inact for 
glass, and 19231 activ (48 %) versu 20475 inact for 
sarfari, with compound and protein respect repre- 
sent by their macc key and dipeptid frequenc 
representations. experi for the artifici classifi use 
200 iter for auc averaging, and experi for 
gpcr/kinas bioactiv classif comput averag 
auc over 20 iter of 3-fold cross-validation. In addit 
to auc calculation, a subset of data be held out for extern 
predict when use the real datasets. A diagram of 
execut flow be provid a supplementari data. 

for the artifici classifiers, we find that averag auc 
be not influenc by the size of posit and neg 
(see supplementari data). rather, the surfac be domi- 
nate by the paramet of the stochast select process 
(e. g., mean and standard deviat of a random gaussian 
variable). 

In contrast, however, we find that auc valu in the real 
dataset be influenc by positive/neg size, and they 
be simultan influenc by model paramet (e. g., 
toler factor “c” and radiu paramet g for svm use 
radial basi function kernels). importantly, we find that the 
auc grow in proport to the size of data avail for 
cross-validation, and that it be possibl to obtain similar auc 
valu for dataset with opposit positive/neg ratios. In 
extrem case with mani data in one class, we return to an 
argument similar to acc on a dominantli neg dataset 
(figur 3 and 6); it may be rel trivial to build even a 
linear classifi that separ the domin class from the 
infrequ class. such result again suggest that care 
interpret of model perform be required, and 
that comparison of auc valu on dataset of differ 
sourc or size requir caution. 

In addit to cross-valid auc, it be possibl to 
consid cross-valid mcc or F1 score. In the case of 
the latter metrics, they requir the pre-specif of a 
threshold valu which be compar against the raw output 
of the classifier, at which raw predict result be 
discretized, and the metric be calcul from the result 
confus matrix. We perform thi addit analysi by 
set the threshold for mcc and F1 to the obviou valu 
of 0, which mean to simpli use the sign of the raw output 
correspond to which side of the svm hyperplan an 
exampl be classifi on. 

for both the glass and sarfari datasets, we comput 
a singl model use a fix ratio of subsampl data at a 
give grid point, and evalu extern predict on the 
remain portion. experi be do use ratio of 
0.33, 0.5, and 0.7, respect reflect scenario where a 
major of data be use for cv, where data be evenli 
split for CV and extern prediction, and where data be 
reduc such that predict perform on a much larg 
extern set could be evaluated. As an example, at an 
extern data ratio of 50 %, where the imbalanc grid point 
contain 234 activ and 1234 inact ligand-target pair 
subsampl from the larg database, 117 activ and 617

inact form the extern predict set, and the 
remain data (of equal size) be use for 3-fold cross- 
validation. henc each round of 3-fold CV could build 
model use 117*(2/3) = 78 activ and 411 inactives, and 
predict on the remain 206 a well a obtain their raw 
valu to use a threshold in roc curv generation. model 
use to evalu the extern set would be built on the full 
117 activ and 617 inactives. where the extern ratio be 
0.7, for example, the model build be on 70 activ and 
370 actives, with extern predict on 164 activ and 864 
inactives. 

In the upper half of figur 8, the cross-valid auc 
and cross-valid mcc/f1 be evalu over the grid of 
data size for the svm with an rbf kernel, where the 
extern split ratio be 0.5. the trend of auc to grow with 
imbal be clear, a well a a further increas in averag 
auc a the number of posit and neg exponen- 
tialli grow. the mcc also grow a the data avail for 
cross-valid grows, but unlik auc, mcc perform 
at extrem be 0, and it be not until a moder number of 
sampl from both class be avail that the mcc climb 

to a posit number. interestingly, we see a dichotomi in 
f1-cv metric surfac behavior, where F1 be potenti over- 
estim for model with disproportion number of 
actives, and like mcc, at or close to 0 for dominantli 
inact datasets. like mcc and auc, F1 perform be 
appropri high when both larg number of activ 
and inact be included. 

next, we consid how well each metric perform in 
cross-valid set versu extern predict settings. 
the results, show in the bottom-left panel of figur 8, 
suggest that cross-valid train perform accu- 
rate estim extern predict performance, though 
admittedly, experi suggest that extern perform 
be often low than train performances, which be 
observ for other paramet set tested. It may be the 
case that repeat trial nullifi the effect of ani one poor 
extern prediction, and that the random sampl select 
ligand-target pair from similar distributions. 

In practic situat of prospect prediction, a singl 
threshold must be appli to gener the list of prospec- 
tive valid to execute, and so while auc be comput

in a retrospect setting, it be not transferr to prospec- 
tive settings. To address this, we check the correl 
between cross-valid auc and mcc at the baselin 
threshold of 0. No correl be observed, a show in 
the bottom-middl panel of figur 8. thi be concord 
with anoth recent studi examin correl on 
artifici gener data.[16] 

We further considered, however, that it be possibl to 
select a singl point on the roc curv which contain a 
permiss fals discoveri rate, and use that threshold a 
the criterion for mcc or F1 evaluation. In other words, if we 
determin by cross-valid the threshold that maxim 
the true posit rate up to the extent we toler error, 
then that could serv a the threshold in our prospect 
application. solv the threshold valu for a toler fals 
discoveri rate of 10 %, we then appli the F1 and mcc 
metric with such threshold, and again examin the 
relationship between cross-valid auc and extern 
prediction. As show in figur 8 (bottom-middle), thi 
correl be also weak, though the threshold mcc 
slightli good correl to auc than default-threshold 
mcc. hence, gener expect of success base on 
multi-threshold auc may fail to correl with single- 
threshold acc/mcc/etc in post-experiment, prospect 
perform analyses. 

finally, at a larg scale, we ask what the correl 
of cross-valid auc would be with extern auc, of cv– 
mcc with extern mcc, of cv-auc with extern mcc, and 
of cv-auc with threshold mcc, by iter test over a 
small paramet grid and across both dataset (4 svm 
paramet set * 3 extern ratio * 2 datasets), and ask 
what the correl of these pair be at each grid point. 
that is, correl metric be use to ass the fit 
between a pair of metric use all point of the positive/ 
neg subsampl grid and result metrics. correla- 
tion be comput not onli by pearson correl but 
also by altern forc the regress line to pa 
through the origin, a propos previous by golbraikh 
and tropsha.[26] 

As can be expected, the distribut of pearson 
correl be high than the origin-fit correlations, 
a show in the bottom-right panel of figur 8. importantly, 
we see that when base decis on the correl 
obtain in the more stringent correl fit, the auc-auc 
and mcc–mcc metric pair emerg with the strong 
correlation. yet, a argu above, use the entir rang of 
raw predict valu for the extern set to gener an 
auc be onli applic in retrospect scenarios. therefor 
by elimination, it would appear that cross-valid mcc be 
the most reliabl method to estim prospect perform- 
anc on a similar-s extern prediction. 

4 conclus and futur outlook 

use the tandem of metric surfac and icdfs, we can 
improv our understand of the consequ of select- 
ing a particular metric in order to evalu predict 
perform of two-class discriminants. We find that tpr, 
tnr, or acc alon run the risk of deception; the physicist 
richard feynman onc remark that “… you must not fool 
yourself, and you be the easi person to fool.” 

metric such a mcc or F1 score provid more realist 
estim of real-world model performance, and in imbal- 
anc dataset skew toward neg data, ppv might be 
indic of expect discoveri rates. the practic chemo- 
genom virtual screen experi show a lack of 
correl between mcc and f1, and between auc and 
mcc. taken together, the best advic we can suggest be to 
take a multi-metr view of molecular modeling, and place 
the model task context at the center of metric interpreta- 
tion. 

though the mcc might appear to be the “best” metric 
avail by includ all four type of result from the 
confus matrix, sever predict problem do not lend 
themselv to use of the metric. for example, evalu 
predict of dna sequenc variant from next-gener 
sequenc frequent lead to focu on tp, fp, and FN 
results; though it be technic possibl to count the total 
number of nucleotid that be correctli not call 
variants, thi number would be cosmolog compar to 
the other three raw count in the confus matrix, and it 
therefor stand to reason to use tpr, ppv, or their 
combin in the form of the F1 score or more gener F- 
measure. 

what can the scientif commun do in order to close 
the gap between comput predict expect and 
experiment valid success rates? the thorough consid- 
erat of metric prior to the execut of a studi be 
certainli a crucial element. If a new classif evalu 
metric be suggested, then it surfac should be visual 
and it icdf should be compar to other such a the 
one give in thi report. A high probabl of obtain a 
particular metric valu a assess by icdf should be cross- 
refer with it surfac visual to determin if 
there be a risk or element of decept result from mani 
possibl way to arriv at the metric valu in question (i. e., 
there be mani way to achiev acc of at least 0.6 in 
inbalanc data). comput experi may consid 
the philosophi discuss herein to perform repeat 
execut of a model-predict experi such that less 
than half of the data per class be subsampl for model 
select with the major remaind use for prediction. 
recent model method have show that often onli a 
fraction of a dataset be suffici to build a predict 
model.[25,27,28] As in the prior studies, if distribut of 
predict perform can be show to be normal 
distribut by the kolmogorov-smirnov test, we can

consid use such a fact to forecast the chanc of success 
in a true prospect experiment. 

finally, we remark that the discuss here be contain 
to two-class prediction, while some molecular informat 
model task may need to classifi an instanc amongst 
three or more class (i. e., protein sequenc secondari 
structur prediction, or predict of ligand a strong/ 
weak/intermediate). In these cases, the visual might 
be expand to a 3D voxel representation, but for four or 
more classes, view of subspac of the metric space be 
required. A well-known metric for the multi-class discrim- 
inant be cohen’ kappa coefficient.[29] the icdf concept 
introduc herein could be appli by shift from a 
matrix (2-tensor) to a gener tensor yield by the 
comput of all per-class predict rates. the icdf 
would be continu to be influenc by the data ratio, 
where in the gener case a partit of data class 
ratio must be provided.
