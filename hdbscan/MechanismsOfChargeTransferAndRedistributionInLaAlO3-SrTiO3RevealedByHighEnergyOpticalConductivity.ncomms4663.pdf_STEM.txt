In condens matter physic the quasi two-dimension electron ga at the interfac of two 

differ insulators, polar laalo3 on nonpolar srtio3 (laalo3/srtio3) be a spectacular and 

surpris observation. thi phenomenon be laalo3 film thick depend and may be 

explain by the polar catastroph model, in which a charg transfer of 0.5e� from the 

laalo3 film into the laalo3/srtio3 interfac be expected. here we show that in conduct 

sampl (z4 unit cell of laalo3) there be inde a b0.5e� transfer from laalo3 into the 

laalo3/srtio3 interfac by studi the optic conduct in a broad energi rang 

(0.5–35 ev). surprisingly, in insul sampl (r3 unit cell of laalo3) a redistribut of 
charg within the polar laalo3 sublay (from alo2 to lao) a larg a b0.5e� be 

observed, with no charg transfer into the interface. hence, our result reveal the differ 

mechan for the polar catastroph compens in insul and conduct 

laalo3/srtio3 interfaces.

S 
ome of the most excit condens matter physic 
problem be found at the interfac of dissimilar materials1. 
the behaviour of electron at these interfac would be 

govern by electron reconstruct mechanisms2 lead to a 
varieti of exot quantum phenomena1. In conjunct with 
x-ray and electron spectroscopi techniques3–7 with their 
inher advantag and constraints, an experiment techniqu 
that can directli reveal hidden quantum phenomenon at buri 
interfac be highli desirable. In thi paper we demonstr the 
potenc of high-energi optic reflect coupl with 
spectroscop ellipsometri and studi an interfac consist of 
two dissimilar insulators: polar laalo3 and nonpolar srtio3 
reveal the detail of the charg (electron) transfer among and 
within the layer that govern the conduct of the buri 
interface. 

the quasi two-dimension electron ga (2deg) at the the 
buri interfac of two differ insul oxid heterostructure, 
polar laalo3 on nonpolar srtio3 (laalo3/srtio3)8 have show 
mani interest phenomenon rang from metal–insul 
transition9, superconductivity10 and magnetism11–14. accord 
to the controversi but compel polar catastroph 
model, the polar sublay of laalo3 ((lao)þ and (alo2)� ) 
give rise to a polar field insid laalo3 that caus an 
electron potenti build-up a the laalo3 film thick 
increases. To counter this, a charg transfer of 0.5e� per unit 
cell (uc) (b3� 1014 cm� 2) from laalo3 into the laalo3/srtio3 
interfac be required15,16. variou techniqu have show a charg 
transfer much less than this. for example, x-ray-bas 
techniques5,6 have estim up to 1.1� 1014 cm� 2 while 
transport measurements9–11 yield substanti small number 
of carrier of b1013 cm� 2. It have be suggest that charg 
local effect might limit the number of mobil charg that 
can be measur by transport7,17, and thu if a techniqu can 
measur and quantifi both the local and deloc charges, 
one might be abl to evalu the actual charg transfer5–7. 

anoth unresolv import issu be the insul case of 
laalo3/srtio3 (r3 uc of laalo3). transport measurements9 
have show that the conduct interfac onli exist abov a 
certain critic thick of laalo3, typic Z4 uc (although 
cation stoichiometry, for exampl the la/al ratio of laalo3 
film, may also affect the interfac conductivity, with conduct 
laalo3/srtio3 observ to have slightli al-rich laalo3 film18). 
thi mean that the charg transfer into the interfac requir for 
counter the polar catastroph do not happen when 
the thick of laalo3 be below 4 uc. accord to the preval 
polar catastroph model, thi mean the polar field 
should be present for r3 uc of laalo3. one way to verifi the 
model be to measur thi polar potenti build-up in 
insul laalo3/srtio3, which be predict to be 0.24 V Å� 1 

(or b0.9 V per uc of laalo3)19. however, attempt to measur 
thi have not be success use core-level x-ray 
photoemiss spectroscopi (xps)20,21, in which the measur 
core-level shift in laalo3 be onli b0.1 eV per uc of laalo3, 
much less than expected. If the chang in the band structur be 
predominantli near the valenc band and the fermi level, then 
the appropri techniqu should directli probe state near the 
valenc band and the fermi level. 

let u approach the problem from a differ angle. anoth 
way to overcom the polar potenti be by charg redis- 
tribut within the laalo3 layers. In a gedankenexperiment, we 
hypothes an extrem case of charg redistribut of 1e� 

between the alo2 and lao sublay of laalo3, which be also 
adequ to compens the polar potential, although the 
actual amount of charg redistribut might be restrict by 
electrostatics. hence, instead of measur the potenti build-up 
in the layers, one can measur the charg redistribut within 

the layer directly. thi can be do by measur the optic 
conduct involv state below and abov the valenc bands, 
the conduct band and the fermi level, and then use the f-sum 
rule, which repres charg conservation, to quantifi the charg 
redistribution. 

furthermore, recent band structur calcul and surfac 
x-ray diffract measur suggest that distort of the 
laalo3 lattic (buckling) may partli compens the polar 
field in insul laalo3/srtio3 (ref 22–25). interestingly, 
when the interfac becom conduct at laalo3 thick Z4 
uc, thi distort decreas and ultim vanishes24,25, 
indic that the buckl mechan be uniqu to the 
insul case of laalo3/srtio3. thi rais anoth import 
question: sinc the buckl be a structur change, will the 
electron structur chang appropriately, and manifest a a 
charg redistribut within the laalo3 layer itself? thus, it be 
again critic to be abl to measur these intralay charg 
redistributions. 

As mention earlier, a direct way to probe the electron band 
structur and charg (local and delocalized) redistribut 
mechan be to measur the complex dielectr respons of the 
materi from which the optic conduct can be extract in a 
broad energi range26–28. here we use a combin of 
spectroscop ellipsometri and ultraviolet–vacuum ultraviolet 
(uv-vuv) reflect to probe the intrins properti of the 
laalo3/srtio3 interfac use photon with energi between 0.5 
and 35 ev. owe to a stabil kramers–kronig 
transformation29,30, the strength of thi experiment approach 
allow one to measur the charg transfer of both deloc and 
local charg accur use the optic f-sum rule. sinc 
local electron be inaccess to electr transport 
measurements, but be access by photons, we overcom a 
sever constraint. In particular, the optic transit involv 
alo2 sublay of laalo3 be veri distinct and well separ from 
the one involv lao sublayer, so that the intern charg 
redistribut within the laalo3 sublay can be clearli identified. 
the same be also true for the tio2 and sro sublay of srtio3. 

here we show that in conduct laalo3/srtio3 (4 and 6 uc of 
laalo3 film on srtio3), there be inde a charg transfer from 
laalo3 into the interface, and that the amount of charg transfer 
be b0.5e� . In the insul case (2 and 3 uc of laalo3 film on 
srtio3), we surprisingli observ b0.5e� charg redistribut 
from alo2 to lao sublayers, within the laalo3 layers. thi 
suggest that for the insul case the polar catastroph 
could be partli overcom by the above-ment charg 
redistribution, which may be a consequ of the buckl of 
the laalo3 lattice.

optic measurements, show consist that 2 and 3 uc sampl 
be insul with carrier densiti and conduct below the 
measur limit, while 4 and 6 uc one be conduct with 
carrier densiti of 4–6� 1013 cm� 2 and conduct of 
4–8� 10� 5o� 1, consist with previou transport results9–11. 

the perovskit laalo3 uc (fig. 1f) can be divid into two 
sublayers: lao and alo2, in which theoret calcul have 
show that the band structur of these discrimin sublay 
be inde different19,22, lead to distinct optic transitions. To 
accommod the assign of these optic transitions, we 
defin ola a the O in the lao plane and oal a the O in the alo2 
plane. similarly, srtio3 also have similar layer perovskit 
structur and thu can also be divid into two sublayers: sro 
and tio2. then osr be defin a O that belong to sro sublayer, 
while oti be defin a the one in tio2. similarly, the O in the 
differ plane of srtio3 can also lead to distinct optic 
transitions. thi discrimin be important, a discuss later, 
becaus it can reveal the intra- and interlay charg transfer 
mechan in laalo3/srtio3 for both the insul and 
conduct samples. 

spectroscop ellipsometri and high-energi reflectivity. our 
main observ be the high-energi reflect of laalo3/srtio3 
at differ thick of laalo3 a compar with bulk laalo3 
and srtio3 a show in fig. 2a. note that, becaus of the 
challeng in make optic measur over such a broad 
energi range, in thi studi we have onli measur a select set 
of sampl a repres of insul (2 and 3 uc) and 
conduct (4 and 6 uc) laalo3/srtio3. thus, further mea- 
surement on a larg set of sampl may be import in further 
deepen our analyses. It can be see that the reflect spectrum 
of the insul 2 and 3 uc laalo3/srtio3 be similar, and the 
same be true for the conduct 4 and 6 uc laalo3/srtio3. 
surprisingly, there be huge differ between reflect of 
insul and conduct samples. these differ occur more 
significantli at high photon energies, particularli in the energi 
rang of 9–14 eV and 14–21 ev. In the 9–14-ev range, the 
reflect of conduct sampl be low than insul sam- 
ples, while in the 14–21-ev rang the opposit occurs. In contrast, 
between 4 and 9 ev, the differ be less, and below 4 eV they 
be negligible. thi signifi whi go beyond convent (up

to B5 ev) spectroscop ellipsometri be important. (note that the 
spectroscop ellipsometri data be crucial for the normal 
of the deriv dielectr function from the reflect measure- 
ment make up to 35 eV a show in supplementari methods.) 
the electron band structur of the insul and conduct 
laalo3/srtio3 be veri differ at high energy, and these dif- 
ferenc be critic in reveal the true natur of laalo3/srtio3 
interface. furthermore, sinc reflect and spectroscop ellip- 
sometri be sensit to unpercol cluster of charges31, the 
similar of the reflect of insul 2 and 3 uc laalo3/ 
srtio3 also impli that there be no evid of precursor of 
percol effect in the insul samples, especi the 3 uc 
laalo3/srtio3 (ref. 32). 

discuss 
for detail analysis, we turn our discuss to optic 
conductivity, s1, becaus it fulfil the optic f-sum rule, which 

be relat to number of charg excit by the photons. for bulk 
materi like bulk laalo3 and bulk srtio3, s1 can be extract 
directli from reflect use the kramers–kronig analysis29,30. 
On the other hand, laalo3/srtio3 be layer along the o0014 
direct (perpendicular to the (001) surfac of the sample) owe 
to it heterostructur natur a well a the presenc of the 
conduct layer at laalo3/srtio3 interface. for thi reason, the 
reflect of laalo3/srtio3 be analys base on standard 
theori of wave propag in a stratifi media33,34. the analysi 
natur lead to a three-lay structur for the conduct 
laalo3/srtio3: laalo3 film layer on top, bulk srtio3 substrat 
at the bottom and an interfac layer sandwich in between, 
repres the 2deg of the conduct samples. 

A self-consist iter procedur be use to extract the 
thick and dielectr function of each layer, and a long a the 
iter be convergent, the start assumpt of these 
paramet should have littl effect, if any, on the final obtain 
valu (see supplementari method for details). from the 
analysis, it be found that the thick of thi interfac layer be 
B5 nm, consist with previou observ use hard xps5, 
cross-sect conduct tip afm35 and the upper limit for the 
superconduct layer thick of laalo3/srtio3 (ref. 10). thi 
result also suggest that the high-energi reflect can be use to 
measur the thick of interfac layer. for insul laalo3/ 
srtio3, the analysi natur converg into an effect two- 
layer structur instead. thi mean for insul laalo3/ 
srtio3 the s1 at interfac be veri similar to that of bulk srtio3 a 
discuss later. thi can be easili understood owe to the 
absenc of the conduct interfac layer. 

now, s1 of each individu layer can be extract separately, so 
that we can analys the concomit evolut of each individu 
layer of laalo3/srtio3 a the interfac chang from insul 
to conducting. spectra of s1 for each layer be show in fig. 2b,c. 
It should be note that the plot for 2 and 3 uc laalo3/srtio3 be 
the same owe to the natur of the iter process (see 
supplementari methods), and the same be true for the 4 and 6 uc 
laalo3/srtio3. 

for laalo3, one can, base on band structur calculations36,37, 
divid s1 into three main optic regions, while s1 of srtio3 can 
be divid into five main optic regions38–40. everi transit be 
uniqu and origin from differ orbit in each layer and 
sublayer, and these be summar in tabl 1. furthermore, the 
polar of the incid light be also take into account in 
assign the optic transitions. sinc the incid light be linearli 
polar parallel to the sampl surface, the major of the optic 
transit occur in the in-plan direct within each sublayer, 
allow u to studi spectral weight transfer between the 
differ sublayers. for example, in A1 region of laalo3, the 
transit be from ola-2p to la-4d, 5f, both of which resid within 
the lao sublay of laalo3. the other transit also follow thi 
convention. 

figur 2b show that s1 of laalo3 film of insul and 
conduct laalo3/srtio3 be dramat differ a compar 
with bulk laalo3. particularly, s1 in A1 region of laalo3 film in 
the insul sampl be high than the bulk value, while for the 
conduct sampl it be lower. meanwhile, the revers be true in 
A2 region. It be veri clear that there be spectral weight transfer 
occur between these three region when the thick of 
laalo3 film increas and the interfac go from insul to 
conduct state. 

It can be see (fig. 2c) that s1 of the interfac layer to a 
signific extent resembl s1 of the bulk srtio3. thi indic 
that the electron interfac layer be srtio3-like, and that the 
conduct layer mostli resid in srtio3 side rather than 
laalo3. the most signific chang in s1 happen at B3 region 
when the interfac becom conducting. In bulk srtio3, that

region correspond to a valley with no main optic transition. 
interestingly, for the conduct sampl a complet new peak 
emerg in that region. thi impli that when the interfac 
becom conducting, a new characterist interfac state emerg 
repres the presenc of the 2deg. accord to previou 
reports3–7,17,19,22, the 2deg resid in the ti-3d-t2g state of 
srtio3, so thi new interfac state should also have ti-3d-t2g 
characteristic. thus, base on the optic select rules, the 
optic transit at B3 region may be assign to origin from 
thi new interfac state to unoccupi state of high O orbit 
(see tabl 1). one should note that the s1 spectrum of the interfac 
layer of conduct laalo3/srtio3 do not show drude 
response, consist with previou infrar spectroscop 
ellipsometri experiment41. 

the s1 analysi be veri import becaus it can be link to

where e be the elementari charge, m be the electron mass and V be 
the unit volume. the E1 and E2 indic the energi boundari of 
that particular transit in the s1 plot. We then defin neff a the 
N of each layer rel to either bulk laalo3 (for laalo3 film) or 
bulk srtio3 (for interfac layer) values. the advantag of thi 
definit be that ani chang in N in laalo3 film or the interfac 
layer can be distinguish from the bulk properties. 

In laalo3/srtio3 (and thin film in general), the thick of 
the laalo3 film and interfac layer be finite, so neff distribut 
over thi finit thickness. If we assum that the distribut be 
uniform over each uc, the neff per uc, nuc, can be defin such that 

neff ¼

where d be the thick in uc. In thi case, the unit volum V 
becom the volum occupi by each sublay (lao and alo2 
for laalo3 and sro and tio2 for srtio3), so that the unit of nuc 
be the number of charg per sublayer. thus, neff, which be the total 
amount of charg redistribut and transfer correspond to a 
particular optic transition, can be obtain by integr nuc 

over the layer thickness, a show in fig. 3. (the procedur to 
obtain neff be further explain in methods). 

We start our discuss with insul samples. As show 
in fig. 3a, neff of A1 region of laalo3 film increas by b0.5e� , 
while for A2 region it decreases, also by b0.5e� . the net 
amount of the charg transfer in laalo3 film be thu (þ 0.5e� ) 
þ (� 0.5e� )¼ 0. thi indic a redistribut of b0.5e� 
from oal-2p (alo2 sublayer) to ola-2p (lao sublayer), a 
show in tabl 1. On the basi of f-sum rule, thi directli impli 
that there be no net charg transfer into the laalo3/srtio3 
interface. As a result, the laalo3/srtio3 interfac remain 
insulating. sinc the laalo3 film (and the system a a whole) 
remain insulating, the b0.5e� charg redistribut do not 
result in the creation of electron and hole in the lao and alo2 
sublay but rather an increas of coval between the lao 
and alo2 sublayers, lead to the measur charg 
redistribution. 

one way to interpret these data be by consid that the

and observ earli use surfac x-ray diffraction24,25 and 
second harmon generation32, what we be measur in term 
of charg redistribut may aris from such a mechanism. 

anoth possibl scenario that can be consid to interpret 
the data be that, instead of involv the whole laalo3 layers, the 
charg redistribut onli happen at the topmost (that is, 
surface) laalo3 layer. In thi case, the coval of surfac alo2 
becom modifi from � 1 to � 0.5 and the coval of surfac 
lao from þ 1 to þ 0.5, but the deeper laalo3 layer remain 
unchanged, sinc the charg redistribut be confin onli in the 
surfac (that is, surfac reconstruction). In thi scenario, the 
surfac charg redistribut be still abl to partial compens 
the polar catastrophe, but it be in less of an agreement with 
the buckl effects, sinc the buckl be observ experimen- 
tally, and support by theoret calculations22–25, to affect the 
whole laalo3 film, and not onli the surface. 

On the other hand, for conduct sampl we observ a 
differ phenomenon. the neff of both A1 and A2 region of 
laalo3 film decreas (fig. 3a). for A1 region it decreas by 
b0.3e� � 0.4e� , while for A2 region it decreas by b0.2e� , 
lead to an overal b0.5e� decreas of neff in the laalo3 film. 
At the same time, for the interfac layer the most signific 
chang that happen when laalo3/srtio3 becom conduct be 
the increas of neff of B3 region by b0.5e� (fig. 3b). the total 
charg transfer within the whole laalo3/srtio3 sampl be thu 
again 0, with the decreas of b0.5e� in laalo3 film 
compens by the increas of b0.5e� at the interface. On 
the basi of f-sum rule, thi clearli indic that there be a charg 
transfer of b0.5e� from the laalo3 film into the interfac to 
form the 2deg (fig. 4b), consist with the polar 
catastroph model15,16. On the basi of the definit of neff, 
thi b0.5e� extra charg at the interfac be distribut over the 
B5 nm thick of the interfac (which mostli resid in the 
srtio3 side). 

moreover, it can be see from fig. 2c that the B3 peak, which 
involv the transit from the new interfac state that contain 
thi b0.5e� extra charge, be veri broad (b4 eV wide), which 
mean that the b0.5e� be distribut over a rather wide energi 
range. thi may be one of the reason whi transport experi 
can onli measur a fraction of thi b0.5e� , sinc onli a small 
portion of the charg be deloc and thu abl to contribut to 
electr conductivity. 

furthermore, fig. 3b also show that the neff of B1 and B5 
regions, both of which involv transit into the unoccupi 
ti-3d-t2g states, decreas by b0.05e� (that is, b10% of 0.5e� ). 
thi impli that the new interfac state of conduct laalo3/ 
srtio3 have ti-3d-t2g characteristic3–7,17,19,22, so the extra 
b0.5e� also partial fill the previous unoccupi ti-3d-t2g 
state of srtio3. thi decreas be consist with previou 
observ use x-ray absorpt spectroscopi experi- 
ments3,6. In x-ray absorpt spectroscopi at ti-l3,2 edg of 
conduct laalo3/srtio3, the excit to the unoccupi 
ti-3d-t2g state also decreas compar with bulk srtio3. 
intriguingly, these decreas be much small if one assum that 
all of the b0.5e� extra charg partial fill the ti-3d-t2g- 
unoccupi densiti of state (dos). thi be because, base on thi 
assumption, one would expect to observ the decreas of 
ti-3d-t2g-unoccupi do (and thu the neff of B1 and B5 
regions) in conduct laalo3/srtio3 also by an equival of 
b0.5e� . however, thi be not the case, which impli that the 
b0.5e� extra charg contain within the new interfac state 
do not onli reduc the number of unoccupi ti-3d dos, but 
surprisingli also other state at even high energies, impli the 
import of strong correl and hybrid effect in 
explain the interlay charg transfer in conduct laalo3/ 
srtio3 (ref 26,42,43). 

anoth interest observ to note be that in the 
conduct samples, the neff of A3 region of laalo3 film also

decreas by b0.2e� . the transit in thi region correspond 
to o-2 state, which be strongli local and directli correspond 
to the avail of oxygen in the laalo3 film. thus, the 
decreas of o-2 do can indic the presenc of oxygen 
vacanc in the laalo3 film of the conduct samples. for 4 uc 
laalo3/srtio3, there be 24e� in o-2 state of laalo3; thus, 
the b0.2e� decreas be equival to b1% oxygen vacancy. 
thi be interest becaus it have be suggest that the presenc 
of oxygen vacanc in laalo3 film may enhanc the charg 
transfer from laalo3 film into laalo3/srtio3 interface7,44,45. 
becaus of the charg transfer into the interface, the laalo3 film 
lack b0.5e� (that is, have addit b0.5 holes), so the extra 
e� creat by the oxygen vacanc may partial compens 
these hole and stabil the charg transfer. interestingly, in 
insul laalo3/srtio3, thi oxygen vacanc signatur be not 
observed. 

It be noteworthi to reconcil our result with photoconduct 
effect observ in laalo3/srtio3. previou transport results46,47 

have show that when laalo3/srtio3 be illumin by 
photon with energi high than the srtio3 bandgap, it 
conduct could increas becaus of the presenc of photo- 
gener carriers. On the basi of hard xp data5, the amount of 
these photo-gener carrier be estim to be 2.1� 1013 cm� 2 
(b0.03e� ), which be much small than the number of e� 

contribut to the charg transfer and charg redistribut 
observ in our result (b0.5e� ). thus, the photoconduct 
effect might onli influenc the estim neff by b6%, and do 
not affect our analysi adversely. 

recent observ have also indic that the cation 
stoichiometry, for example, the la/al ratio in laalo3 film, may 
affect the electr properti of laalo3/srtio3 (ref 18,48,49). 
how thi cation stoichiometr effect would influenc the high- 
energi optic conduct of insul and conduct laalo3/ 
srtio3 be an import open question. thus, it interplay with the 
charg transfer and redistribut phenomenon a observ in 
high-energi optic conduct still remain to be answered. 

In summary, we have show that high-energi reflect and 
spectroscop ellipsometri studi of laalo3/srtio3 have 
reveal signific differ between the charg redistribut 
of insul (2 and 3 uc of laalo3) and charg transfer 
mechan of conduct (4 and 6 uc of laalo3) laalo3/ 
srtio3. In insul laalo3/srtio3, b0.5e� charg 

redistribut be observ between the alo2 and lao sublay 
and partial compens the polar catastrophe. In the 
conduct samples, b0.5e� be measur to be transfer from 
laalo3 film into the interface, which be consist with the 
polar catastroph model. We believ that thi studi reveal 
the natur of the intra- and interlay charg redistribut and 
charg transfer in laalo3/srtio3, and henc open a path to 
understand the variou electron reconstruct involv the 
interfac of complex oxid heterostructures. furthermore, the 
use of high-energi reflect coupl with spectroscop 
ellipsometri could be extend to other similar polar and 
nonpolar oxid interfac systems.

film on top of (001) srtio3 substrat obtain from crystec use puls laser 
deposition12. befor the growth, the srtio3 substrat be treat use HF and 
be anneal at 950 �C for 2 h in O2 flow to achiev the desir tio2 surfac

the deposit temperatur be 750 �c, with cool rate of 10 �C min� 1 at the 
deposit pressure. the laser puls frequenc be 1 hz. four sampl with vari 
thick of 2, 3, 4 and 6 uc of laalo3 film be made, a monitor use

topographi measur show that the atom flat surfac with uc step and 
terrac structur of srtio3 be preserved, with surfac rough of B1 Å (see 
fig. 1c,d). 

optic measurements. the optic conduct be obtain use a combi- 
nation of spectroscop ellipsometri (0.5–5.6 ev) and uv–vuv reflect (3.7– 
35 ev) measurements26–28. the detail of the optic measur be a follow. 
the spectroscop ellipsometri measur be perform in the spectral rang 
between 0.5 and 5.6 eV by use an SE 850 ellipsomet at room temperature51. 
three differ incid angl of 60�, 70� and 80� from the sampl normal be 
used, and the incid light be 45� linearli polar from the plane of incident. 
for reflect measur in the high-energi rang between 3.7 and 35 ev, we 
use the superlumi beamlin at the dori storag ring of hasylab 
(desy)52. the incom photon be incid at the angl of 17.5� from the sampl 
normal with linear polar parallel to the sampl surface. the sampl chamber 
be outfit with a gold mesh to measur the incid photon flux after the slit of 
the monochromator. the measur be perform in ultrahigh vacuum 
environ (chamber pressur of 5� 10� 10 mbar) at room temperature. befor 
these measurements, the sampl be heat up to 400 K in ultrahigh vacuum to 
ensur that there be no addit adsorb layer on the surfac of the samples.

these as-measur uv–vuv reflect data be further normal by use 
the self-norm reflect extract from spectroscop ellipsometry34,51, and 
the two normal data be append to obtain the combin reflect from 
0.5 to 35 eV (see supplementari fig. 1). 

analysi of optic data. both the spectroscop ellipsometri and the combin 
reflect data be analys use a combin of the drude–lorentz oscil 
multilay fitting33,34 and self-consist iter method (see supplementari 
methods). owe to it multilay nature, the laalo3/srtio3 samples, especi 
the conduct cases, be consid to have the follow three layers: the laalo3 
film on top, the srtio3 substrat at the bottom and the interfac layer in between 
(see supplementari fig. 2), consist with previou observ use cross- 
section conduct tip afm35. sinc the spectroscop ellipsometri data be 
take at three differ incid angl of 60�, 70� and 80�, it be fit use angle- 
depend iter method (see supplementari methods), and the fit result 
be show in supplementari fig 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7. supplementari figur 4 also 
show that the thick of the conduct interfac layer be B5 nm, consist 
with previou observations5,10,35. furthermore, from these variabl angl 
spectroscop ellipsometri results, the absenc of absorb layer and the absenc 
of signific anisotropi can also be inferred. On the other hand, the normal 
uv–vuv reflect data be fit use thickness-depend iter method 
(see supplementari methods), and the result of the fit be show in 
supplementari fig. 8. 

complex dielectr function of laalo3/srtio3. from the analysi describ 
above, the complex dielectr function, e(o), of each layer of laalo3/srtio3 can be 
extract from the high-energi reflect of laalo3/srtio3 (fig. 2a), a present 
in fig. 5. In turn, thi e(o) can be convert into optic conduct s1 use 
s1(o)¼ e0e2(o)o, a present in fig. 2b,c. In fig. 5a,b, it can be see that the e(o) 
of the laalo3 film layer for both insul and conduct laalo3/srtio3 be veri 
differ than that of bulk laalo3, which show that the band structur of laalo3 
film be veri differ than bulk laalo3. meanwhile, the e(o) at the interfac of the 
insul sampl (2 and 3 uc laalo3/srtio3, see fig. 5c) be veri similar to that of 
bulk srtio3, which can be explain by the absenc of the 2deg in the insul 
samples. interestingly, for the conduct sampl (4 and 6 uc laalo3/srtio3, see 
fig. 5d) there be new featur around 8–12 eV for e1 and 11–16 eV for e2, which, 
on further analysi (see discussions), be relat to the presenc of the conduct 
interfac in those sample. 

estim of charg transfer and redistribution. from equat (1) and (2), 
we can extract the nuc, which be the amount of charg redistribut and transfer 
per uc associ with a particular optic transit rel to the bulk values. To 
get the accur number, we need to care consid within what volum V in the 
uc the electron reside. both laalo3 and srtio3 crystal structur can be thought 
of a an altern layer structure. laalo3 consist of altern polar (lao)þ 

and (alo2)� sublayers, while srtio3 consist of altern nonpolar sro and 
tio2 sublay (see fig 1d and 4). owe to thi layer structure, in a first 
approxim each cation (la and Al for laalo3, Sr and Ti for srtio3) onli 
occupi a volum of half uc (instead of the full one uc). for example, the La of 
laalo3 have to share the space of one uc with Al (with each get half), and 
similarli the Sr of srtio3 have to share with ti. furthermore, for laalo3, the 
valenc electron of the O atom that belong to the two differ sublay (lao 
and alo2) contribut to two differ optic transit in the s1 spectrum (fig. 2b

and tabl 1). for simplicity, ola be defin a the O in the lao plane and oal a 
the O in the alo2 plane. thus, ola also have to share the space of one uc with oal, 
with each get the space of half uc. the same be true for srtio3, where the osr in 
the sro plane also have to share the space of one uc with the oti in the tio2 plane. 
thi impli that the valenc electron belong to the differ ion can also be 
approxim to resid in a volum of half uc. for thi reason, to obtain the nuc the 
volum V be chosen to be the volum of half uc of laalo3 (lattic constant 
a0¼ 3.81 Å) or srtio3 (a0¼ 3.905 å), whichev applicable. thi consider

thickness, a show in fig. 3. 

the error bar in fig 3 and 6 be estim a follows. It be assum that there 
be two main sourc of random error in the data: from the resolut limit 
of the optic measur (estim to be b2%) and from the error introduc 
in the normal process (estim to be b5%). these error affect the 
reflect data (that is, dr), and to obtain the correspond error for s1 (ds) 
and thu neff, the error be propag use

laalo3 band structur calculation. unlik srtio3 that have be studi veri 
thoroughly38–40, previou report that studi the band structur and high photon- 
energi properti of laalo3 in a detail and comprehens manner remain quit 
scarce36,37. becaus of this, we perform our own band structur calcul of 
laalo3 to complement those previou studies. the result can be use a a tool to 
determin the high photon-energi optic transit assign of laalo3, a 
list in tabl 1. 

the detail of the calcul be a follows. cubic laalo3 have a space group 
of pm3m with an experiment lattic paramet of a¼ b¼ c¼ 3.8106 Å at 821 K 
(ref. 53). the calcul be perform use castep code54. geometri 
optim have be carri out with local densiti approxim function 
use cutoff energi of 1,500 eV and a 15� 15� 15 monkhorst–pack grid55 that 
correspond to 120 k-point in the irreduc brillouin zone. the cutoff energi 
and k-point mesh have be test and converg to energi differ of 
1� 10� 5 and 4� 10� 5 eV per atom, respectively. ultrasoft pseudopotenti 
be gener ‘on the fly’ with valenc state 4f, 5s, 5p, 5d, 6 for la, 3s, 3p for Al 
and 2s, 2p for O. the electron minim method use for the self-consist 
field calcul be densiti mixing56 with a self-consist field toler of 
2.0� 10� 6 eV per atom. the geometri optim be carri out by the 
broyden–fletcher–goldfarb–shanno algorithm57 with energy, forc and 
displac toler of 5.0� 10� 6 eV per atom, 1.0� 10� 2 eV Å� 1 and 
5.0� 10� 4 Å, respectively. the optim lattic paramet be found out to be 
3.73 Å. converg do calcul be carri out with a k-mesh of 20� 20� 20 
and consist with previou calculations36,37. the calcul result be 
display in fig. 7.
