abstract 

predict model deploy in the real world may assign in- 
correct label to instanc with high confidence. such error 
or unknown unknown be root in model incompleteness, 
and typic aris becaus of the mismatch between train 
data and the case encount at test time. As the model be 
blind to such errors, input from an oracl be need to iden- 
tifi these failures. In thi paper, we formul and address the 
problem of inform discoveri of unknown unknown of ani 
give predict model where unknown unknown occur due 
to systemat bia in the train data. We propos a model- 
agnost methodolog which us feedback from an oracl to 
both identifi unknown unknown and to intellig guid 
the discovery. We employ a two-phas approach which first 
organ the data into multipl partit base on the fea- 
ture similar of instanc and the confid score assign 
by the predict model, and then util an explore-exploit 
strategi for discov unknown unknown across these par- 
titions. We demonstr the efficaci of our framework by 
vari the underli caus of unknown unknown across 
variou applications. To the best of our knowledge, thi pa- 
per present the first algorithm approach to the problem of 
discov unknown unknown of predict models. 

introduct 
predict model be wide employ in a varieti of do- 
main rang from judiciari and health care to autonom 
driving. As we increasingli reli on these model for high- 
stake decisions, identifi and character their unex- 
pect failur in the open world be critical. We categor 
error of a predict model as: know unknown and un- 
know unknown (attenberg, ipeirotis, and provost 2015). 
known unknown be those data point for which the model 
make low confid predict and errs. On the other 
hand, unknown unknown correspond to those point for 
which the model be highli confid about it predict 
but be actual wrong. sinc the model lack awar of 
it unknown unknowns, approach develop for address- 
ing know unknown (e.g., activ learn (settl 2009)) 
cannot be use for discov unknown unknowns. 

unknown unknown can aris when data that be use for 
train a predict model be not repres of the sam- 
ple encount at test time when the model be deployed. 
thi mismatch could be a result of unmodel bia in the 
collect of train data or differ between the train 

figur 1: unknown unknown in an imag classif 
task. train data compris onli of imag of black dog 
and of white and brown cats. A predict model train on 
thi data incorrectli label a white dog (test image) a a cat 
with high confidence. 

and test distribut due to temporal, spatial or other factor 
such a a subtl shift in task definition. To illustrate, consid 
an imag classif task where the goal be to predict if a 
give imag correspond to a cat or a dog (figur 1). let 
u assum that the train data be compris of imag of 
black dogs, and white and brown cats, and the featur set 
includ detail such a nose shape, presenc or absenc of 
whiskers, color, and shape of the eyes. A predict model 
train on such data might learn to make predict sole 
base on color despit the presenc of other discrimin 
featur becaus color can perfectli separ the two class 
in the train data. however, dure test time, such a model 
would classifi an imag of a white dog a a cat with high 
confidence. the imag of white dog are, therefore, un- 
know unknown with regard to such a predict model. 

We formul and address the problem of inform dis- 
coveri of unknown unknown of ani give predict model 
when deploy in the wild. more specifically, we seek to 
identifi unknown unknown which occur a a result of sys- 
temat bia in the train data. We formul thi a 
an optim problem where unknown unknown be dis- 
cover by queri an oracl for true label of select 
instanc under a fix budget which limit the number of 
queri to the oracle. the formul assum no knowl-

edg of the function form or the associ train data of 
the predict model and treat it a a black box which out- 
put a label and a confid score (or a proxy) for a give 
data point. these choic be motiv by real-world sce- 
nario in domain such a healthcar and judiciary, where 
predict model be be deploy in set where end 
user have no access to either the model detail or the asso- 
ciat train data (e.g., compa risk assess tool for 
sentenc (brennan, dieterich, and ehret 2009)). identify- 
ing the blind spot of predict model in such high-stak 
set be critic a undetect unknown unknown can be 
catastrophic. In crimin justice, bia and blindspot can 
lead to the inappropri sentenc or incarcer of peo- 
ple charg with crime or unintent racial bia (craw- 
ford 2016). To the best of our knowledge, thi be the first 
work provid an algorithm approach to address thi 
problem. 

develop an algorithm solut for the discoveri of 
unknown unknown introduc a number of challenges: 1) 
sinc unknown unknown can occur in ani portion of the 
featur space, how do we develop strategi which can ef- 
fectiv and effici search the space? 2) As confid 
score associ with model predict be typic not 
inform for identifi unknown unknowns, how can we 
make use of the feedback from an oracl to guid the dis- 
coveri of unknown unknowns? 3) how can we effect 
manag the trade-off between search in neighborhood 
where we previous found unknown unknown and exam- 
ine unexplor region of the search space? 

To address the problem at hand, we propos a two-step 
approach which first partit the test data such that in- 
stanc with similar featur valu and confid score 
assign by the predict model be group together, and 
then employ an explore-exploit strategi for discov un- 
know unknown across these partit base on the feed- 
back from an oracle. the first step, which we refer to a de- 
scriptiv space partit (dsp), be guid by an object 
function which encourag partit of the search space 
such that instanc within each partit be maxim sim- 
ilar in term of their featur valu and confid scores. 
dsp also provid interpret explan of the gener- 
ate partit by associ a comprehens and compact 
descript with each partition. As we late demonstr in 
our experiment results, these interpret explan be 
veri use in understand the properti of unknown un- 
known discov by our framework. We show that our ob- 
jectiv be np-hard and outlin a greedi solut which be a 
ln N approximation, where N be the number of data point 
in the search space. the second step of our methodolog 
facilit an effect explor of the partit gener- 
ate by dsp while exploit the feedback from an oracle. 
We propos a multi-arm bandit algorithm, bandit for un- 
know unknown (uub), which exploit problem-specif 
characterist to effici discov unknown unknowns. 

the propos methodolog build on the intuit that un- 
know unknown occur due to systemat bia be of- 
ten concentr in certain specif portion of the featur 
space and do not occur randomli (attenberg, ipeirotis, and 
provost 2015). for instance, the exampl in figur 1 illus- 

trate a scenario where systemat bia in the train data 
caus the predict model to wrongli infer color a the dis- 
tinguish feature. consequently, imag follow a spe- 
cific pattern (i.e., all of the imag of white dogs) turn out 
to be unknown unknown for the predict model. anoth 
key assumpt that be crucial to the design of effect algo- 
rithmic solut for the discoveri of unknown unknown be 
that avail evidenti featur be inform enough to 
character differ subset of unknown unknowns. If such 
featur be not avail in the data, it would not be pos- 
sibl to leverag the properti of previous discov un- 
know unknown to find new ones. consequently, learn 
algorithm design to discov unknown unknown would 
not be abl to perform ani good than blind search (no free 
lunch theorem (wolpert and macreadi 1997)). 

We empir evalu the propos framework on the 
task of discov unknown unknown occur due to a 
varieti of factor such a bia train data and domain 
adapt across variou divers tasks, such a sentiment 
classification, subject detection, and imag classifica- 
tion. We experi with a varieti of base predict mod- 
els, rang from decis tree to neural networks. the re- 
sult demonstr the effect of the framework and it 
constitu compon for the discoveri of unknown un- 
known across differ experiment conditions, provid 
evid that the method can be readili appli to discov 
unknown unknown in differ real-world settings. 

problem formul 
given a black-box predict modelm which take a input 
a data point x with featur F = {f1, f2, · · · fl}, and re- 
turn a class label c′ ∈ C and a confid score s ∈ [0, 1], 
our goal be to find the unknown unknown ofmw.r.t a give 
test setd use a limit number of queries,b, to the oracle, 
and, more broadly, to maxim the util associ with 
the discov unknown unknowns. the discoveri process 
be guid by a util function, which not onli incentiv 
the discoveri of unknown unknowns, but also account for 
the cost associ with queri the oracl (e.g., monetari 
and time cost of label in crowdsourcing). recal that, 
in thi work, we focu on identifi unknown unknown 
aris due to systemat bia in the train data. It be im- 
portant to note that our formul not onli treat the pre- 
dictiv model a a black-box but also assum no knowledg 
about the data use to train the predict model. 

although our methodolog be gener enough to find un- 
know unknown associ with all the class in the data, 
we formul the problem for a particular class c, a critic 
class, where fals posit be costli and need to be dis- 
cover (elkan 2001). base on the decis of the system 
design regard critic class c and confid threshold 
τ , our search space for unknown unknown discoveri con- 
stitut all of those data point in D which be assign the 
critic class c by modelm with confid high than τ . 

our approach take the follow inputs: 1) A set of N 
instances, X = {x1, x2 · · ·xn} ⊆ D, which be confi- 
dentli assign to the critic class c by the modelm, and 
the correspond confid scores, S = {s1, s2 · · · sn}, 
assign to these point bym, 2) An oracl o which take 



a input a data point x and return it true label o(x) a well 
a the cost incur to determin the true label of x, cost(x) 
3) A budget B on the number of time the oracl can be 
queried. 

our util function, u(x(t)), for queri the label of 
data point x(t) at the tth step of explor be defin as: 

u(x(t)) = 1{o(xt)6=c} − γ × cost(x(t)) (1) 

where 1{o(xt)6=c} be an indic function which return 
1 if x(t) be identifi a an unknown unknown, and a 0 
otherwise. cost(x(t)) ∈ [0, 1] be the cost incur by the 
oracl to determin the label of x(t). both the indic and 
the cost function in equat 1 be initi unknown and 
observ base on oracle’ feedback on x(t). γ ∈ [0, 1] be a 
tradeoff paramet which can be provid by the end user.

methodolog 
In thi section, we present our two-step framework design 
to address the problem of inform discoveri of unknown 
unknown which occur due to systemat bia in the train- 
ing data. We begin thi section by highlight the assump- 
tion requir for our algorithm solut to be effective: 

1. unknown unknown aris due to bia in train data 
typic occur in certain specif portion of the featur 
space and not at random. for instance, in our imag clas- 
sific example, the systemat bia of not includ 
white dog imag in the train data result in a specif 
categori of unknown unknown which be all clump 
togeth in the featur space and follow a specif pat- 
tern. attenberg et. al. (attenberg, ipeirotis, and provost 
2015) observ thi assumpt to hold in practic and 
leverag human intuit to find systemat pattern of 
unknown unknowns. 

2. We also assum that the featur avail in the data 
can effect character differ kind of unknown 
unknowns, but the bia in the train data prevent 
the predict model from leverag these discrimin 
featur for prediction. If such featur be not avail 
in the data, it would not be possibl to util the char- 
acterist of previous discov unknown unknown 
to find new ones. consequently, no learn algorithm 
would perform good than blind search if thi assump- 
tion do not hold (no free lunch theorem (wolpert and 
macreadi 1997)). 

below we discu our methodolog in detail. first we 
present descript space partit (dsp), which in- 
duce a similar preserv partit on the set X . then, 
we present a novel multi-arm bandit algorithm, which we 
refer to a bandit for unknown unknown (uub), for sys- 
temat search for unknown unknown across these 
partit while leverag feedback from an oracle. 

descript space partit 
our approach exploit the aforement intuit that 
blind spot aris due to systemat bia in the data do 
not occur at random, but be instead concentr in specif 
portion of the featur space. the first step of our approach, 
dsp, partit the instanc in X such that instanc which 
be group togeth be similar to each other w.r.t the fea- 
ture space F and be assign similar confid score 
by the model M. partit X enabl our bandit algo- 
rithm, uub, to discov region with high concentr of 
unknown unknowns.

6: P = P ∪ p , Q = Q \ p , E = E \ cover by(p) 
7: end while 
8: return P 

the intuit behind our partit approach be that two 
instanc a and a′ ∈ X be like to be judg use a sim- 
ilar logic by model M if they share similar featur valu 
and be assign to the same class c with compar confi- 
denc score bym. In such cases, if a be identifi a an un- 
know unknown, a′ be like to be an unknown unknown a 
well1. base on thi intuition, we propos an object func- 
tion which encourag group of instanc in X that be 
similar w.r.t the criterion outlin above, and facilit sep- 
arat of dissimilar instances. the propos object also 
associ a concise, comprehens descript with each 
partition, which be use for understand the explor 
behavior of our framework and the kind of unknown un- 
known ofm (detail in the experiment evalu sec- 
tion). 

dsp take a input a set of candid pattern Q = 
{q1, q2, · · · } where each qi be a conjunct of (feature, op- 
erator, value) tupl where oper ∈ {=, 6=,≤, <,≥, >}. 
such pattern can be obtain by run an off-the-shelf 
frequent pattern mine algorithm such a apriori (agrawal, 
srikant, and other 1994) on X . each pattern cover a set of 
one or more instanc in X . for each pattern q, the set of 
instanc that satisfi q be repres by cover by(q), the 
centroid of such instanc be denot by x̄q , and their mean 
confid score be s̄q . 

the partit object minim dissimilar of in- 
stanc within each partit and maxim them across

section. 



partitions. In particular, we defin good of each pat- 
tern q in Q a the combin of follow metrics, where 
d and d′ be standard distanc measur defin over featur 
vector of instanc and their confid score respectively: 

intra-partit featur distance: 

g1(q) = 
∑ 

{x∈x : x ∈ cover by(q)} 

d(x, x̄q) 

inter-partit featur distance: 

g2(q) =

{x∈x : x ∈ cover by(q)}

{q′∈q: q′ 6=q}

g3(q) = 
∑ 

{si: xi∈x ∧xi ∈ cover by(q)} 

d′(si, s̄q)

g4(q) = 
∑ 

{si: xi∈x ∧ 
xi ∈ cover by(q)} 

∑ 
{q′∈q: q′ 6=q} 

d′(si, s̄q′) 

pattern length: g5(q) = size(q), the number of 
(feature, operator, value) tupl in pattern q, includ to 
favor concis descriptions. 

given the set of instanc X , correspond confid 
score S, a collect of pattern Q, and weight vector λ 
use to combin g1 through g5, our goal be to find a set of 
pattern P ⊆ Q such that it cover all the point in X and 
minim the follow objective: 

min 
∑ 
q∈q 

fq(λ1g1(q)− λ2g2(q) + λ3g3(q) 

−λ4g4(q) + λ5g5(q)) (2) 

s.t. 
∑ 

q: x∈cover by(q) 

fq ≥ 1 ∀x ∈ X , where fq ∈ {0, 1} 

∀q ∈ Q 

where fq correspond to an indic variabl associ 
with pattern q which determin if the pattern q have be 
add to the solut set (fq = 1) or not (fq = 0). 

the aforement formul be ident to that of 
a weight set cover problem which be np-hard (johnson 
1974). It have be show that a greedi solut provid a ln 
N approxim to the weight set cover problem (john- 
son 1974; feig 1998) where N be the size of search space. 
algorithm 1 appli a similar strategi which greedili se- 
lect pattern with maximum coverage-to-weight ratio at 
each step, thu result in a ln N approxim guaran- 
tee. thi process be repeat until no instanc in X be left 
uncovered. If an instanc in X be cover by multipl parti- 
tions, tie be broken by assign it to a partit with the 
closest centroid. 

our partit approach be inspir by a class of clus- 
tere techniqu commonli refer to a conceptu clus- 
tere (michalski and stepp 1983; fisher 1987) or de- 
scriptiv cluster (weiss 2006; li, peng, and Wu 2008;

We make the follow contribut to thi line of research: 
We propos a novel object function, whose compon 
have not be jointli consid before. In contrast to pre- 
viou solut which employ post process techniqu or 
use bayesian frameworks, we propos a simple, yet eleg 
solut which offer theoret guarantees. 

multi-arm bandit for unknown unknown 
the output of the first step of our approach, dsp, be a set 
of K partit P = {p1, p2 · · · pk} such that each pj cor- 
respond to a set of data point which be similar w.r.t the 
featur space F and have be assign similar confid 
score by the modelm. the partit scheme, however, 
do not guarante that all data point in a partit share the 
same characterist of be unknown unknown (or not be- 
ing unknown unknown). It be import to note that share 
similar featur valu and confid score do not ensur 
that the data point in a partit be indistinguish a far 
a the model logic be concerned. thi be due to the fact that 
the modelm be a black-box and we do not actual observ 
the underli function form and/or featur import 
weight be use by M. consequently, each partit 
have an unobserv concentr of unknown unknown in- 
stances. the goal of the second step of our approach be to 
comput an explor polici over the partit gener 
by dsp such that it maxim the cumul util of the 
discoveri of unknown unknown (a defin in the problem 
formul section). 

We formal thi problem a a multi-arm bandit prob- 
lem and propos an algorithm for decid which partit 
to queri at each step (see algorithm 2). In thi formaliza- 
tion, each partit pj correspond to an arm j of the ban- 
dit. At each step, the algorithm choos a partit and then 
randomli sampl a data point from that partit without 
replac and queri it true label from the oracle. sinc 
queri the data point reveal whether it be an unknown un- 
known, the point be exclud from futur steps. 

In the first K steps, the algorithm sampl a point from 
each partition. then, at each step t, the explor decis 



be guid by a combin of ūt(i), the empir mean 
util (reward) of the partit i at time t, and bt(i), which 
repres the uncertainti over the estim of ūt(i). 

our problem set have the characterist that the ex- 
pect util of each arm be non-stationary; queri a data 
point from a partit chang the concentr of unknown 
unknown in the partit and consequ chang the ex- 
pect util of that partit in futur steps. therefore, sta- 
tionari mab algorithm such a ucb (auer, cesa-bianchi, 
and fischer 2002) be not suitable. A variant of ucb, dis- 
count ucb, address the non-stationari set and can 
be use a follow to comput ūt(i) and bt(i) (garivi and 
moulin 2008). 

ūt(i) =

the main idea of discount ucb be to weight recent ob- 
servat more to account for the non-stationari natur of 
the util function. If ϑij,t denot the discount factor 
appli at time t to the reward obtain from arm i at time 
j < t, ϑij,t = γ 

t−j in the case of discount ucb, where 
γ ∈ (0, 1). garivi et. al. establish a low bound on the 
regret in the presenc of abrupt chang in the reward dis- 
tribut of the arm and also show that discount ucb 
match thi low bound upto a logarithm factor (garivi 
and moulin 2008). 

the discount factor of discount ucb be design to 
handl arbitrari chang in the util distribution, wherea 
the way the util of a partit chang in our set have a 
certain structure: the util estim of arm i onli chang 
by a bound quantiti when the arm be queried. use thi 
observation, we can custom the calcul of ϑij,t for our 
set and elimin the need to set up the valu of γ, which 
affect the qualiti of decis make by discount ucb. 
We comput ϑij,t a the ratio of the number of data point in 
the partit i at time j to the number of data point in the 
partit i at time t: 

ϑij,t = (ni −

the valu of ϑij,t be invers proport to the number of 
pull of arm i dure the interv (j, t). ϑij,t be 1, if the arm i 
be not pull dure thi interval, indic that the expect 
util of i remain unchanged. We refer to the version of 
algorithm 2 that us the discount factor specif to our 
set (eqn. 3) a bandit for unknown unknown (uub).

tire pipeline. 

dataset and natur of biases: We evalu the perfor- 
manc of our methodolog across four differ data set 
in which the underli caus of unknown unknown vari 
from bia in train data to domain adaptation: 
(1) sentiment snippets: A collect of 10k sentiment snip- 
pets/sent express opinion on variou movi (pang 
and lee 2005). each snippet (sentence) correspond to a 
data point and be label a posit or negative. We split the 
data equal into train and test sets. We then bia the train 
data by randomli remov sub-group of neg snippet 
from it. We consid posit sentiment a the critic class 
for thi data. 
(2) subjectivity: A set of 10k subject and object snip- 
pet extract from rotten tomato webpag (pang and 
lee 2004). We consid the object class in thi dataset 
a the critic class, split the data equal into train and test 
sets, and introduc bia in the same way a describ above. 
(3) amazon reviews: A random sampl of 50k review of 
book and electron collect from amazon (mcauley, 
pandey, and leskovec 2015). We use thi data set to studi 
unknown unknown introduc by domain adaptation; we 
train the predict model on the electron review and 
then test them on the book reviews. similar to the sentiment 
snippet data set, the posit sentiment be the critic class. 
(4) imag data: A set of 25k cat and dog imag (kaggl 
2013). We use thi data set to ass whether our framework 
can recogn unknown unknown that occur when seman- 
tical meaning sub-group be miss from the train 
data. To thi end, we split the data equal into train and test 
and bia the train data such that it compris onli of im- 
age of dog which be black, and cat which be not black. 
We set the class label cat to be the critic class in our ex- 
periments. 
experiment setting: We use bag of word featur to 
train the predict model for all of our textual data sets. 
As the featur for the images, we use super-pixel ob- 
tain use the standard algorithm (ribeiro, singh, and 
guestrin 2016). imag be repres with a featur vec- 
tor compris of 1’ and 0’ indic the presenc or ab- 
senc of the correspond super pixels. We experi 
with multipl predict models: decis trees, svms, lo- 
gistic regression, random forest and neural network. due 
to space constraints, thi section present result for deci- 
sion tree a modelm but detail result for all the other 
model be includ in the appendix. We set the thresh- 
old for confid score τ to 0.65 to construct our search 
space X for each data set. We consid two set for 
the cost function (refer eqn. 1): the cost be set to 1 for 
all instanc (uniform cost) in the imag dataset and it be

of the object function defin in eqn. 2. We set the bud- 
get B to 20% of all the instanc in the set X through out 
our experiments. further, the result present for uub be 
all averag across 100 runs. 

evalu the partit scheme 
the effect of our framework reli on the notion that 
our partit scheme, dsp, creat partit such that 
unknown unknown be concentr in a specif subset of 
partit a oppos to be evenli spread out across them. 
If unknown unknown be distribut evenli across all the 
partitions, our bandit algorithm cannot perform good than a 
strategi which randomli choos a partit at each step of 
the explor process. we, therefore, measur the qualiti 
of partit creat by dsp by measur the entropi of 
the distribut of unknown unknown across the partit 
in P . for each partit p ∈ P , we count the number of 
unknown unknowns, Up base on the true label which be 
onli know to the oracle. We then comput entropi of P a 
follows: 

entropy(p) = − 
∑ 
p∈p 

up∑ 
p′∈p 

up′ 
log2( 

up∑ 
p′∈p 

up′ 
) 

smaller entropi valu be desir a they indic high 
concentr of unknown unknown in few partitions. 

figur 2 compar the entropi of the partit gener 
by dsp with cluster gener by k-mean algorithm us- 
ing onli featur in F (kmeans-features), onli confid 
score in S (kmeans-conf) and both (kmeans-both) by first 
cluster use confid score and then use features. 
the entropi valu for dsp be consist small com- 
par to altern approach use kmean across all the 
datasets. thi can be explain by the fact that dsp jointli 
optim inter and intra-partit distanc over both fea- 
ture and confid scores. As show in figur 2, the en- 
tropi valu be much high when k-mean consid onli 
featur or onli confid score indic the import 
of jointli reason about them. 

We also compar the entropi valu obtain for dsp a 
well a other k-mean base approach to an upper bound 
comput with random partitioning. for each of the algo- 
rithm (dsp and other k-mean base approaches), we de-

sign a correspond random partit scheme which 
randomli re-assign all the data point in the set X to parti- 
tion while keep the number of partit and the number 
of data point within each partit same a that of the cor- 
respond algorithm. We observ that the entropi valu 
obtain for dsp and all the other baselin be consist 
small than those of the correspond random partit 
schemes. also, the entropi valu for dsp be about 32- 
37% low compar to it random counterpart across all of 
the datasets. 

evalu the bandit algorithm 
We measur the perform of our multi-arm bandit al- 
gorithm uub in term of a standard evalu metric in the 
mab literatur call cumul regret. cumul regret 
of a polici π be comput a the differ between the total 
reward collect by an optim polici π∗, which at each step 
play the arm with the high expect util (or reward) 
and the total reward collect by the polici π. small val- 
ue of cumul regret indic good policies. the util 
function defin in eqn. 1 determin the reward associ 
with each instance. 

We compar the perform of our algorithm, uub, 
with that of sever baselin algorithm such a random, 
greedy, �-greedi strategi (chapel and Li 2011), ucb, 
ucbf (slivkin and upfal 2008), slide window and dis- 
count ucb (garivi and moulin 2008) for variou val- 
ue of the discount factor γ = {0.2, 0.5, 0.8}. all al-

gorithm take a input the partit creat by dsp. fig- 
ure 3(a) show the cumul regret of each of these algo- 
rithm on the imag data set. result for the other data set 
can be see in the appendix. the figur show that uub 
achiev the small cumul regret compar to other 
baselin on the imag data set. similarly, uub be the best 
perform algorithm on the sentiment snippet and subjec- 
tiviti snippet data sets, wherea discount ucb (γ = 0.5) 
achiev slightli small regret than uub on the amazon 
review data set. the experi also highlight a disadvan- 
tage of the discount ucb algorithm a it perform be 
sensit to the choic of the discount factor γ, where a 
uub be paramet free. further, both ucb and it variant 
ucbf which be design for stationari and slowli chang- 
ing reward distribut respect have high cumul 
regret than uub and discount ucb indic that they 
be not a effect in our setting. 

evalu the overal methodolog 
In the previou section, we compar the perform of 
uub to other bandit method when they be give the same 
data partit to explore. In thi section, we evalu the 
perform of our complet pipelin (dsp + uub). due 
to the lack of exist baselin which address the problem 
at hand, we compar the perform of our framework to 
other end-to-end heurist method we devis a baselines. 
due to space constraints, we present result onli for the im- 
age dataset. result for other data set can be see in the 
appendix. 

We compar the cumul regret of our framework 
to that of a varieti of baselines: 1) random sampling: 
randomli select B instanc from set X for queri the 
oracle. 2) least averag similarity: for each instanc in X , 
comput the averag euclidean distanc w.r.t all the data 
point in the train set and choos B instanc with the 
larg distance. 3) least maximum similarity: comput 
minimum euclidean distanc of each instanc in X from 
the train set and choos B instanc with the high 
distances. 4) most uncertain: rank the instanc in X 

in increas order of the confid score assign by 
the model M and pick the top B instances. the least 
averag similar and least maximum similar baselin 
be relat to research on outlier detect (chandola, 
banerjee, and kumar 2007). furthermore, the baselin 
titl most uncertain be similar to the uncertainti sampl 
queri strategi use in activ learn literature. note 
that the least averag similar and the least maximum 
similar baselin assum access to the data use to train 
the predict model unlik our framework which make no 
such assumptions. figur 3(b) show the cumul regret 
of our framework and the baselin for the imag data. It 
can be see that uub achiev the least cumul regret 
of all the strategi across all data sets. It be interest to 
note that the least averag similar and the least maximum 
similar approach perform bad than uub in spite 
of have access to addit inform in the form of 
train data. 

qualit analysi figur 4 present an illustr ex- 
ampl of how our methodolog explor three of the par- 
tition gener for the imag data set. our partit 
framework associ the super pixel show in the figur 
with each partition. examin the super pixel reveal that 
partit 1, 2 and 3 correspond to the imag of white chi- 
huahua (dog), white cats, and brown dog respectively. the 
plot show the number of time the arm correspond to 
these partit have be play by our bandit algorithm. 
the figur show that partit 2 be chosen few time com- 
par to partit 1 and 3 — becaus white cat imag be 
part of the train data use by the predict model and 
there be not mani unknown unknown in thi partition. On 
the other hand, white and brown dog be not part of the 
train data and our bandit algorithm explor these parti- 
tion often. figur 4 also indic that partit 1 be ex- 
plore often dure the initi play but not late on. thi be 
becaus there be few data point in that partit and the 
algorithm have exhaust all of them after a certain number 
of plays. 

relat work 
In thi section, we review prior research relev to the 
discoveri of unknown unknowns. 

unknown unknown the problem of model incom- 
plete and the challeng of grappl with unknown 
unknown in the real world have be come to the fore a a 
critic topic in discuss about the util of AI technolo- 
gy (horvitz 2008). attenberg et. al. introduc the idea 
of har human input to identifi unknown unknown 
but their studi left the task of explor and discoveri 
complet to human without ani assist (attenberg, 
ipeirotis, and provost 2015). In contrast, we propos an 
algorithm framework in which the role of the oracl be 
simpler and more realistic: the oracl be onli queri 
for label of select instanc chosen by our algorithm 
framework. 



dataset shift A common caus of unknown unknown be 
dataset shift, which repres the mismatch between train- 
ing and test distribut (quionero-candela et al. 2009; 
jiang and zhai 2007). multipl approach have be 
propos to address dataset shift, includ import 
weight of train instanc base on similar to 
test set (shimodaira 2000), onlin learn of predict 
model (cesa-bianchi and lugosi 2006), and learn 
model robust to adversari action (teo et al. 2007; 
graepel and herbrich 2004; decost and schölkopf 2002). 
these approach cannot be appli to our set a they 
make one or more of the follow assumpt which limit 
their applic to real-world settings: 1) the model be not 
a black box 2) the data use to train the predict model be 
access 3) the model can be adapt retrained. further, 
the goal of thi work be differ a we studi the problem 
of discov unknown unknown of model which be 
alreadi deployed. 

activ learn activ learn techniqu aim to build 
highli accur predict model while requir few 
label instances. these approach typic involv 
queri an oracl for label of certain select instanc 
and util the obtain label to adapt retrain the 
predict model (settl 2009). variou queri strate- 
gy have be propos to choos the instanc to be 
label (e.g., uncertainti sampl (lewi and gale 1994; 
settl 2009), queri by committe (seung, opper, and som- 
polinski 1992), expect model chang (settles, craven, 
and ray 2008), expect error reduct (zhu, lafferty, and 
ghahramani 2003), expect varianc reduct (zhang and 
ole 2000)). activ learn framework be design 
to be employ dure the learn phase of a predict 
model and be therefor not readili applic to our set 
where the goal be to find blind spot of a black box model 
which have alreadi be deployed. furthermore, queri 
strategi employ in activ learn be guid toward 
the discoveri of know unknowns, util inform 
from the predict model to determin which instanc 
should be label by the oracle. these approach be not 
suitabl for the discoveri of unknown unknown a the 
model be not awar of unknown unknown and it lack 
meaning inform toward their discovery. 

outlier detect outlier detect involv identifi in- 
dividu data point (global outliers) or group of data point 
(collect outliers) which either do not conform to a tar- 
get distribut or be dissimilar compar to major of 
the instanc in the data (han, pei, and kamber 2011; 
chandola, banerjee, and kumar 2007). sever parametr 
approach (agarw 2007; abraham and box 1979; eskin 
2000) be propos to address the problem of outlier de- 
tection. these method make assumpt about the under- 
lie data distribution, and character those point with 
a small likelihood of be gener from the assum 
distribution, a outliers. non-parametr approach (es- 
kin 2000; eskin et al. 2002; fawcett and provost 1997) 
which make few assumpt about the distribut of the 
data such a histogram base methods, distanc and densiti 

base method be also propos to address thi problem. 
though unknown unknown of ani give predict model 
can be regard a collect outlier w.r.t the data use to 
train that model, the aforement approach be not ap- 
plicabl to our set a we assum no access to the train 
data. 

discuss & conclus 
We present an algorithm approach to discov un- 
know unknown of predict models. the approach as- 
sume no knowledg of the function form or the associ- 
ate train data of the predict models, thus, allow 
the method to be use to build insight about the behavior of 
deploy predict models. In order to guid the discoveri 
of unknown unknowns, we partit the search space and 
then use bandit algorithm to identifi partit with larg 
concentr of unknown unknowns. To thi end, we pro- 
pose novel algorithm both for partit the search space 
a well a sift through the gener partit to discov 
unknown unknowns. 

We see sever research direct ahead, includ op- 
portun to employ alern object functions. for in- 
stance, the budget B could be defin in term of the total 
cost of queri the oracl instead of the number of queri 
to the oracle. our method can also be extend to more 
sophist set where the util of some type of un- 
know unknown decreas with time a suffici exampl 
of the type be discov (e.g., after inform the engineer- 
ing team about the discov problem). In mani settings, 
the oracl can be approxim via the acquisit of la- 
bel from crowdworkers, and the label nois of the crowd 
might be address by incorpor repeat label into 
our framework. 

the discoveri of unknown unknown can help system 
design when deploy predict model in numer 
ways. the partit scheme that we have explor pro- 
vide interpret descript of each of the gener par- 
titions. these descript could help a system design 
to readili understand the characterist of the discov 
unknown unknown and devis strategi to prevent error 
or recov from them (e.g., silenc the model when a 
queri fall into a particular partit where unknown un- 
known be discov previously). discov unknown 
unknown can further be use to retrain the predict model 
which in turn can recogn it mistak and even correct 
them. 

formal machineri that can shine light on limit of 
our model and system will be critic in move AI solu- 
tion into the open world–especi for high-stakes, safeti 
critic applications. We hope that thi work on an algo- 
rithmic approach to identifi unknown unknown in pre- 
dictiv model will stimul addit research on incom- 
plete in our model and systems.
