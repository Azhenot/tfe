ultra-compact, dens integr optic compon manufactur on a cmos-foundri 

platform be highli desir for optic inform process and electronic-photon co- 

integration. however, the larg spatial extent of evanesc wave aris from nanoscal 

confinement, ubiquit in silicon photon devices, caus signific cross-talk and scat- 

tere loss. here, we demonstr that anisotrop all-dielectr metamateri open a new 

degre of freedom in total intern reflect to shorten the decay length of evanesc 

waves. We experiment show the reduct of cross-talk by great than 30 time and the 

bend loss by great than 3 time in dens integrated, ultra-compact photon circuit 

blocks. our prototyp all-dielectr metamaterial-waveguid achiev a low propag loss 

of approxim 3.7±1.0 db/cm, compar to those of silicon strip waveguides. our 

approach mark a departur from interference-bas confin a in photon crystal or 

slot waveguides, which util nanoscal field enhancement. it abil to suppress evanesc 

wave without substanti increas the propag loss shall pave the way for all- 

dielectr metamaterial-bas dens integration.

one of the long-stand goal of nanophoton be theintegr of electron and photon circuitri on asingl cmo chip for applic rang from infor- 
mation process and data center to massiv parallel sen- 
sing1–11. thi necessarili requir miniatur with low power 
consumpt in optic interconnects, activ a well a passiv 
photon devices. there be two major figur of merit in 
design photon devic for a dens integr circuit. one be 
the cross-talk, which occur due to the field overlap of two 
adjac photon waveguides, and the second be the radiat 
loss at sharp bend which limit the integr density6. 

plasmon waveguid can strongli reduc cross-talk and 
bend loss owe to the sub-diffract natur of light coupl 
to the free electron of metals12–19. however, the larg ohmic loss 
of metal restrict the applic of plasmon structur for 
photon integration20,21. over the last decade, mani effort have 
be make to miniatur photon compon use all- 
dielectr structures22–36. figur 1 illustr a few class of 
dielectr waveguid for light confin in photon chips. 
strip waveguides, the most common type of waveguid for 
rout light in a silicon chip, be compos of a silicon channel 
surround by silicon oxide6 (fig. 1a). owe to the high contrast 
between the refract index of the core and the cladding, light be 
confin insid the core a a result of total intern reflect 
(tir). however, the mode size be see to increas a we reduc 
the core size which hamper the use of strip waveguid to further 
miniatur photon circuits37. photon crystal waveguid can 
confin light insid a line defect due to bragg reflection40 

(fig. 1b). these waveguid perform effici at veri sharp 
bends41, however, the integr densiti be limit a the peri- 
odic of bragg reflector be on the order of the wavelength and it 
cannot be perturb by anoth waveguid nearby42. addition- 
ally, slot waveguid have be propos to confin light insid a 
sub-wavelength low-index gap surround by high-index 

dielectr rods43 (fig. 1c). To satisfi the continu of the normal 
compon of the displac current at the high-contrast 
interface, the electr field peak insid the gap, lead to light 
confin but at the cost of skin-depth expans in the 
cladding. thi caus cross-talk between adjac waveguid and 
radiat loss at sharp bend in dens photonic-integr 
circuits. 

sever altern approach inspir from atom phy- 
sics44,45, transform optics46, and invers design algo- 
rithms47,48 have also be propos to minim the cross-talk 
and the bend loss. however, these techniqu add design 
complex and often requir modif of the core a well a 
cladding46. they be not implement on a large-scal and 
caus propag loss fundament limit devic perfor- 
mance. thus, a new low-loss and scalabl platform be need for 
cmos-foundri compat dens photon integr with low 
cross-talk and reduc bend loss. 

In thi paper, we demonstr a platform that be fundament 
differ from the exist approach for design cmo 
compatible, ultra-compact, and low-loss waveguid use all- 
dielectr anisotrop metamaterials. our approach work base 
on photon skin-depth engin of evanesc wave in the 
clad use a recent propos degre of freedom in tir37,49. 
To describ the light confin mechan in our waveguides, 
first, we experiment demonstr the phenomenon of relax 
tir in anisotrop metamaterials. these relax condit allow 
the control of evanesc wave decay, which be the fundament 
origin of cross-talk and bend loss in silicon photon devices. 
As illustr in fig. 1d, we use these anisotrop metamateri a 
a clad for on-chip dielectr waveguid fabric on a 
monolith silicon-on-insul (soi) platform. As a result, cross- 
talk be reduc down to −30 dB in the photon circuit. fur- 
thermore, we use a transform optic approach to show that 
the radiat loss at sharp bend be strongli influenc by the 
skin-depth in the cladding. We experiment show that the 
anisotrop metamateri clad can simultan reduc the 
bend loss at sharp bend up to three time compar with 
convent silicon strip waveguides. We clarifi the counter- 
intuit natur of light confin in our approach compar 
with exist photon crystal, slot waveguide, and grade index 
waveguid methods38,43,50–53. our work show that all-dielectr 
anisotropi on-chip present a scalabl rout to simultan 
improv cross-talk and bend loss with propag loss a low 
a ≈3.67 db/cm. for completeness, we show the improv in 
figur of merit of our achiev platform with recent state-of-the- 
art photon design (see tabl 1).

the skin-depth of evanesc waves. If ε2z � 1, evanesc wave

As ρ deviat from 0 and 1, the multilay display effect

the effect permitt of the multilay structur (extract

on-chip e-skid waveguides. To impact the field of silicon pho- 
tonics, the one-dimension e-skid waveguid (fig. 2d) have to be 
implement on an soi platform. thi place stringent restric- 
tion on monolith fabrication, minimum featur sizes, and 
deviat in field profil due to quasi-2d behavior. our design 
to adapt relax tir and skin-depth engin δ � λð Þ on- 
chip be show in fig. 3. here the convent quasi-2d strip 
waveguid be surround by a clad make of altern 
vacuum-silicon sub-wavelength ridg which achiev strong 
anisotropi (ε2x<εcore and ε2z � 1). our goal be to confin the te- 
like mode (it domin electr field compon be ex) use in 
convent silicon strip waveguides. sinc the tm-like mode be 
polar in the y direction, the electr field do not probe/feel 
the anisotropi of the cladding. hence, the metamateri clad 
do not play ani role in TM mode confinement. for more detail 
about the polar effect, see supplementari figur 6 and 7.

figur 3a emphas the counterintuit natur of the 
confin caus by anisotrop medium which beat the 
confin of convent high index-contrast interfac 
consist of silicon surround by vacuum (blue curv in 
fig. 3a). As it be see in fig. 3a, if we increas the index of the 
clad onli in the z direction, wherea the index in the other 
direct be fixed, the evanesc wave decay faster in the 
clad and the skin-depth reduc drastically. note, the averag 
clad index increas but the mode decay length decreases. 
thi behavior be in fundament contrast to confin in 
convent strip waveguid with isotrop clad or grade 
index claddings53 where decreas the contrast between the core 
index and clad index result in slow decay of evanesc 
waves, not faster decay49. 

figur 3b show the field profil of a practic e-skid waveguid 
with the multilay metamateri clad Λ � λð Þ. We can see 
the practic multilay clad show strong effect aniso- 
tropi to ensur the fast decay of the evanesc wave in the 
cladding. the 2D field profil in a plane perpendicular to the 
propag direct and comparison of the practic e-skid 
waveguid with a homogen anisotrop clad be show 
in figs. 3c and 3d. A good agreement with the effect medium 
approxim be seen. figur 3e-h illustr the effect modal 
index and the decay constant in the clad for a wide rang of 
core size and the fill fraction of silicon in the multilay 
cladding. first, a strong agreement be see between emt and 
practic multilay structures, indic that the clad inde 
achiev effect all-dielectr anisotropy. second, the effect 
modal index be below the core index indic of relax tir a 
the mechan of confinement. As expected, simul prove 
that the primari role of the on-chip multilay clad be to 
increas the decay constant of evanesc wave kx′′=k0ð Þ, a 
show in figs. 3f, h, and it do not significantli chang the 
effect modal index of propag wave kz′=k0ð Þ, a show in 
figs. 3e, g. It be see that the larg decay constant be achiev at 
ρ � 0:5 where the strong anisotropi be attained. note that ρ= 

0 correspond to the case of no cladding. We also emphas that 
the power in the core be not compromis by the presenc of the 
skin-depth engin clad and increas anisotropi caus 
an enhanc in power confinement. 

thi light confin strategi in e-skid waveguid be 
fundament differ from that in photon crystal waveguides. 
our multilay structur function in the deep subwavelength 
limit Λ � λð Þ, not the photon crystal limit Λ � λð Þ and the 
perform of the e-skid waveguid be independ of the 
multilay period or disord (see supplementari note 2). 
furthermore, there be no dyakonov wave solut in e-skid 
waveguid a the optic axi of the anisotrop clad be 
perpendicular to the interfac and the direct of propaga- 
tion22,61–65. It be also import to note that the main goal of the 
anisotrop multilay clad be to control the decay constant of 
evanesc wave on-chip, not to achiev birefring in the 
effect modal index of propag wave a achiev previous 
in sub-wavelength grate structures26,50,51,66, multi-slot 
waveguides52, or nonlinear phase match applications67. 

cross-talk in e-skid waveguides. the skin-depth of evanesc 
wave be the fundament origin of cross-talk between waveguid 
that hinder dens photon integration. cross-talk, or power 
coupl between photon devices, aris owe to the pertur- 
bation of the optic mode when the evanesc tail of one 
waveguid overlap with a nearbi waveguide. however, if we 
control the skin-depth in the cladding, we can reduc the per- 
turbat due to the adjac waveguide, subsequ reduc 
the cross-talk to surpass the integr limit in current silicon 
photonics. 

We now demonstr thi drastic reduct in the cross-talk 
make possibl with the anisotropi in the clad (fig. 4a). the 
top view imag of coupl e-skid waveguid fabric on an

fig. 4 cross-talk in e-skid waveguides. a schemat of coupl e-skid waveguid on an soi platform. the waveguid height, center-to-cent separ 
between the two waveguid (s), and Λ be 220 nm, 1000 nm, and 120 nm, respectively. A clad oxid be also add on the top of the waveguides. the 
number of ridg between the waveguid be dictat by the waveguid core size. b top view sem imag of the coupl e-skid waveguides. c the 
experiment setup to measur the cross-talk between the two waveguid at the telecommun wavelength (λ=1550 nm). light be in-coupl to the 
first waveguid through the middl grate coupler. the second waveguid be coupl to the first waveguid for a length of L. In thi experiment, the 
bend radiu be 5 μm, hence, we can ignor the bend loss. d the ratio between the measur output power for strip waveguid and e-skid waveguid 
vs. L at the telecommun wavelength. the ratio for the e-skid waveguid be two order of magnitud lower, indic that far less power be coupl to 
the second waveguide. the inset show the ratio for the waveguid without the top clad oxide. In thi case, the metamateri clad can increas 
the coupl length up to 30 time or reduc the cross-talk -30 db. see supplementari figur 8 for more details. e comparison of the simul and

standard deviat of the fit curves. the optimum match between the simul and experi be achiev when ρ= 0.6 for the clad of e-skid 
waveguides. the coupl length for e-skid waveguid be an order of magnitud larg in comparison with strip waveguid (shade region). the coupl 
length for strip waveguid with larg core size decreas becaus the overlap between the evanesc tail be increas although more power be confin

where I0 be the input power, L be the distanc for which the two

defin such that if the waveguid be coupl for a distanc 
l=lc, complet power transfer occur from the first waveguid to 
the adjac waveguide. figur 4c illustr the experiment 
setup to measur the coupl length. light be in-coupl to the 
first waveguid through the grate coupler68 and the second 
waveguid be coupl to the first waveguid over a distanc of L. 
the center-to-cent separ between the two waveguid be 
onli 1000 nm. the output power of the two waveguid be out- 
coupl by the two grate coupler at the end of each 
waveguide. note that we can ignor the propag loss in thi 
experi a the total length do not exceed a few hundr 
microns, wherea the propag loss be 3.67 db/cm at the 
oper wavelength λ=1550 nm (see supplementari note 6 for 
detail about the character of the propag loss). the 
ratio between the measur power for strip waveguid and e- 
skid waveguid be show in fig. 4d. thi highlight that the 
analyt express i2=i1 ¼ tan2 πl=2lcð Þð Þ match the experi- 
mental data. It be clearli see that the coupl power to the 
second waveguid be almost two order of magnitud low for 

the e-skid waveguide. the measur and simulated69 coupl 
length normal to the wavelength for differ core size be 
plot in fig. 4e for waveguid with the same separ 
distanc of 1000 nm. It be see that the coupl length for the 
te-lik mode of e-skid waveguid be an order of magnitud 
high than that for strip waveguid allow miniatur of 
photonic-integr circuit without consider cross-talk 
between the waveguides. note that increas the core size in 
convent strip waveguides, which correspond to high 
power confin insid the core, do not guarante the 
reduct in cross-talk (unshad region fig. 4e) a the 
evanesc tail be not controlled. these drastic increas 
Lc be due to the reduc skin-depth with a high anisotropy, 
reduc the waveguid cross-talk significantli in comparison 
with other dielectr structures, which have be propos to 
reduc the cross-talk (tabl 1). note that a the tm-like mode 
have a neglig electr field compon in the x direction, it do 
not probe/feel the dielectr anisotropi of the cladding. As 
expected, thi result in high cross-talk for tm-mode 
compar with strip waveguid (see supplementari figur 6 
and 7 for more detail about the polar effect and the 
propos design to control the skin-depth of the tm-like mode). 

bend loss in e-skid waveguides. the critic phenomenon of 
bend loss70–72 can also be reduc by add the anisotrop 
metamateri cladding. the counterintuit connect of 
bend loss and skin-depth be reveal by an approach adapt 
from transform optics70,73. here, we consid a curv 
waveguid in the xz plane with a 90° bend and a bend radiu of 
R R � δð Þ. the center of the curv waveguid be at the origin 
(figs. 5b, d (inset)). If we appli the transformation: 
uþ iw ¼ rln xþizr ; v ¼ y70,73, the curv waveguid be map to 
a straight waveguid in the uw plane (figs. 5b, d). thi caus the 
refract index of the transform waveguid to becom inho- 
mogen in the new coordin system as70,73: 
n′ uð Þ ¼ n xðuþð þeu=r, where n x uð Þð Þ be the refract index of the 
straight waveguid a show in figs. 5a, b. bend loss or 
radi power leakag from the core occur in thi straight 
inhomogen index waveguid when the local index of the 
clad exce the effect modal index (neff). hence, if we 
suppress the field near and beyond thi radiat condit point 
(figs. 5b, d), we can reduc the bend loss. note that due to the 
spatial transform of coordinates, the electromagnet field 
be also transform caus the expans of the skin-depth (δ) 
on the right-hand side of the waveguid and shrinkag of it on the 
left-hand side (figs. 5b, d): 

δright � δ þ 2δ2=r; 

δleft � δ � 2δ2=r: ð4þ 

however, if we add the anisotrop metamateri cladding, we can 
reduc the skin-depth. As a result, less power will be radiat at 
the radiat condit point, lead to reduc bend loss. 

To confirm the effect of the anisotrop metamateri clad 
on the bend loss, we have investig the bend loss of 
the e-skid and strip waveguides, both experiment and 
numerically74. To character the bend losses, we have 
cascad 90° bent waveguid sequenti with differ number 
of turn (fig. 6a and supplementari note 4), then character 
the bend loss per turn by compar the transmissions. 
figur 6b, c show the measur bend loss vs. the core size 
and the bend radius. In all cases, the bend loss with the e- 
skid waveguid be low than that with the strip waveguide, which 
be due to the reduc skin-depth with the anisotrop

metamateri claddings. note that if the fabric advanc 
on the cmo platform allow u to reduc the featur size and 
approach an ideal anisotrop clad Λ ! 0ð Þ, we would 
achiev further reduct of the bend loss for te-lik mode in 
e-skid waveguid (see supplementari note 4 for more detail a 
well a the bend loss calcul for tm-like modes). our 
simul account for all sourc of bend loss includ 
radiat and mode-mismatch. 

discuss 
In summary, we have introduc a photon platform that can 
add the critic but overlook function of control eva- 
nescent wave to the cmo foundry. We have show that high- 
index contrast grate structur in the deep sub-wavelength limit 
can act a an all-dielectr metamateri clad for simulta- 
neousli achiev tir and control the skin-depth of eva- 
nescent waves. the coupl length be improv more than an 
order of magnitud and the bend loss be improv three time 
compar with convent on-chip waveguid with an averag 
propag loss of 3.67 db/cm at telecommun wave- 
lengths. the decreas photon skin-depth regim have not be 
realiz till date but have be attempt in initi studies75. thi be 
becaus an anisotrop all-dielectr metamateri respons 
requir more than one period of the unit cell to control eva- 
nescent wave decay37,49,54. although we use electron-beam 
lithographi (ebl) a a conveni prototyp techniqu for 
the sub-wavelength structures, these devic can in principl be 
fabric use deep ultraviolet cmo foundries; specifically, 
advanc 193 nm immers lithographi technolog have be 
use to fabric silicon photon devic with featur size down 
to 50 nm76. our work pave the way for all-dielectr metama- 
terial to enter the practic realm of cmos-foundri photon to 
achiev improv photonic-integr circuits.

resolution. after the develop of the resist, the top silicon layer be etch by 
cl2/o2 base reactive-ion plasma etch tool (panason p610) to transfer the 
waveguid pattern from the resist to the silicon layer.
