blind quantum comput protocol allow a user to deleg a comput to a remot quantum comput 
in such a way that the privaci of their comput be preserved, even from the devic implement the 
computation. To date, such protocol be onli know for set involv at least two quantum devices: either 
a user with some quantum capabl and a remot quantum server or two or more entangl but 
noncommun servers. In thi work, we take the first step toward the construct of a blind quantum 
comput protocol with a complet classic client and singl quantum server. specifically, we show how a 
classic client can exploit the ambigu in the flow of inform inmeasurement-bas quantum comput 
to construct a protocol for hide critic aspect of a comput deleg to a remot quantum computer. 
thi ambigu aris due to the fact that, for a fix graph, there exist multipl choic of the input and output 
vertex set that result in determinist measur pattern consist with the same fix total order of 
vertices. thi allow a classic user, comput onli measur angles, to drive a measurement-bas 
comput perform on a remot devic while hide critic aspect of the computation.

I. introduct 

large-scal quantum comput offer the promis of 
quit extrem comput advantag over convent 
comput technolog for a rang of problem span 
cryptanalysi [1], simul of physic system [2], and 
machin learn [3]. recently, however, a new applic 
have emerg for quantum computers: secur deleg 
comput [4]. 
consid a user wish to have a comput perform 

on a remot server. two main secur concern aris for 
the user relat to the privaci and the correct of the 
computation. the privaci concern be that the descript of 
their computation, both the program and ani input data, 
remain hidden even from the server. the correct 
concern be that a malici server might tamper with their 
computation, send them a mislead result; hence, 
ideal such behavior would be detectable. quantum proto- 
col have be propos that can mitig both of these 
concerns. In the literature, protocol that allow for program 
and data privaci be know a blind quantum comput 
protocols, while protocol that allow for correct to be 

ensur with high probabl be know a verifi 
quantum comput protocol [5]. 
the first blind quantum comput protocol be propos 

by child [6]. while functional, thi scheme put a rather 
heavi burden on the client’ side in term of resources, with 
the client requir to control a quantum memori and to 
perform swap gates. A subsequ protocol, from arrighi 
and salvail [7], introduc mechan for both verif 
and blind for a limit rang of function and can be 
see a the start of an intim link between blind 
and verifiability. thi link be further establish with the 
discoveri of the univers blind quantum comput 
(ubqc) protocol [8], which allow a client, equip onli 
with the abil to produc single-qubit states, to deleg an 
arbitrari quantumcomput to a univers quantum server 
while make it blind with uncondit security. 
thi schemehasbeenmodifi andextend sever time 

in the last few years, with work investig robust 
[9–11], optim [12–14], and issu relat to physic 
implement [15,16]. importantly, the blind comput 
protocol have proven a power tool in the construct of 
verifi quantum comput protocols, with a number of 
protocol emerg in recent year base on the ubqc 
protocol [17–19] and on an altern blind protocol from 
morima and fujii [20] in which the client perform single- 
qubit measur rather than state prepar [21–23]. 
the rel low overhead in such scheme have make it 
possibl to implement both blind and verifi quantum 
comput protocol in quantum optic [24–26].

the question of verifiability, directli rather than a a 
consequ of blindness, have also attract attention. thi 
problem be first studi by aharonov et al. [27], who 
consid the use of a constant-s quantum comput to 
verifi a larg device. subsequ work by broadbent [28] 
reduc the requir on the prover to mirror those 
use in the ubqc protocol. An entir distinct rout to 
verif have also emerged, which consid a classic 
user but requir multipl entangl but noncommuni- 
cat server [29,30]. surprisingly, perhaps, mani of these 
scheme be also blind, though often thi be not the aim 
of the paper. In fact, onli a few exampl of verifi com- 
put scheme exist that be not natur blind [31,32], 
and it be tempt to conjectur a fundament link between 
blind and verifiability. 
the verif method discuss abov provid a veri 

strong form of certification, amount to interact proof 
for correctness, which do not reli on ani assumpt 
about the function of the devic to be tested. from an 
experiment point of view, the first nonclass simu- 
labl evolut of quantum system will most like be 
implement by mean of nonunivers quantum simula- 
tor rather than fulli univers quantum computers. here, 
too, the problem aris of certifi the correct function 
of a devic [33] that cannot be effici simulated. 
however, in thi regime, interact proof have proven 
more difficult to construct. nonetheless, progress have be 
make in develop a rang of certif techniqu for 
variou physic systems. these includ feasibl quantum 
state tomographi of matrix product state [34], certif 
of the experiment prepar of resourc for photon 
quantum technolog [35], certif of simul of 
frustration-fre hamiltonian [36], and deriv of a 
statist benchmark for boson sampl experi [37]. 
A common featur among all blind quantum comput 

protocol and interact proof of correct for quantum 
comput be that they requir that at least two parti 
poss quantum capabilities. remov thi requir 
and allow a pure classic user to interact with a singl 
quantum server would greatli expand the practic of 
deleg quantumcomput sinc itwould remov large- 
scale quantum network a a prerequisit for verifiability. In 
the present work, we focu specif on the question of 
blind comput with a complet classic client, but 
give the histor link between progress in blind and 
verification, it be natur to expect that progress in either 
direct will like be reflect in the other. 
while it be present unknown if such a protocol 

can exist, a neg result in thi context be a scheme- 
depend imposs proof present in ref. [38]. 
there, the author consid a scenario where a classic 
user and a quantum server exchang classic inform 
in a two-step process. first, the classic client encod her 
descript of the comput use an affin encrypt 
scheme and then send all the classic encrypt data to the 

server. the server then perform a quantum comput 
use the receiv data and return the classic output to 
the client, who decrypt the result use her encrypt key. 
for thi setting, it be show that secur blind quantum 
comput cannot be achiev unless bpp ¼ bqp (i.e., 
unless a classic comput can effici simul a 
quantum computer). while thi be an interest result, it 
impos strong assumpt on the oper method of 
blind quantum comput with a classic client and 
therefor do not seem to limit further studi in thi 
direction. additionally, aaronson et al. [39] have recent 
suggest that information-theoret blind quantum 
comput with a classic client be not like to be possibl 
becaus the exist of such a scheme impli unlik 
contain between complex classes. addit 
implic that the develop of a classical-cli 
blind-comput protocol would have in complex 
theori be discuss in ref. [40]. 
here, we provid evid in the opposit direction. We 

introduc a form of deleg quantum comput use 
measurement-bas quantum comput (mbqc) a the 
underli framework. thi allow u to introduc a 
model-specif protocol that achiev a satisfi degre 
of secur by directli exploit the structur of mbqc. 
We show that the classic commun receiv by the 
parti perform quantum oper be insuffici to 
reconstruct a descript of the computation. thi insuffi- 
cienci remain even when the server be requir onli to 
identifi the comput up to pre- and post-process by 
polynomial-s classic computation, under plausibl 
complexity-theoret assumptions. We call our scheme 
classic driven blind quantum comput (cdbqc). 
the paper be structur a follows: In sec. ii, we present 

a short introduct to mbqc. In sec. iii, we describ the 
step of the cdbqc protocol. In sec. iv, we use mutual 
inform to analyz the degre of blind for a singl 
round of the cdbqc protocol. In sec. V, we introduc the 
concept of flow ambiguity, and we show how thi be use by 
the client to hide inform from the quantum server. our 
conclus be present in sec. vi. 

ii. measurement-bas 
quantum comput 

In mbqc, a comput be perform by mean of 
single-qubit project measur that drive the quan- 
tum inform across a highli entangl resourc state. 
the most gener resourc for mbqc be graph state 
[41]. A graph state be defin by a simpl and undirect 
graph, i.e., a mathemat object G ¼ ðv; EÞ compos of 
a vertex set V and an edg set E, with cardin jvj and 
jej, respectively. the vertex of the graph repres the 
qubits, while their interact be symbol by the edges. 
A graph state jgi be an n-qubit state, where N ¼ jvj. each 
qubit be initi in the state jþi ¼ 1ffiffi

then entangl with it neighbor by controlled-z gates,

ĉzi;j ¼ j0ih0ji ⊗ îj þ j1ih1ji ⊗ ẑj, where Î and Ẑ be 
the single-qubit ident and pauli-z gate, respectively. 
explicitly, jgi ¼ qði;jþ∈eĉzi;jjþi⊗n . equivalently, a graph 
state jgi can be defin by the stabil relat 
k̂vjgi ¼ jgi, with stabil [41] 

k̂v ¼ x̂v 
Y 

w∈n ðvþ 
ẑw; ∀ v ∈ V; ð1þ 

where N ðvþ denot the neighborhood of v in G. without 
loss of generality, the vertex in G can be label ð1;…; NÞ 
in the order that the correspond qubit be to be 
measured. We take thi order to be implicit in the 
definit of the graph, for example, a the order in which 
the vertex appear in the adjac matrix for G. It be also 
use to defin a specif type of graph state that will be 
use later. An n-qubit cluster state jcsin;m be the graph 
state correspond to an n ×m regular square-lattic graph 
gn;m. for such a graph, N ¼ nm. 
In the mbqc framework, give a resourc state with 

graph G, the standard procedur to perform a comput 
be to first identifi two set of qubit fi; Og on G. thi 
procedur defin an open graph gði; oþ, such that i,o⊆v 
for a give G. the set I correspond to the input set, while 
O denot the output set. In general, 0 < jij ≤ joj ≤ jvj. 
note that the input and output set can overlap. the 
complement of I be write ic, and similarly, the comple- 
ment of O be oc. We also denot by pðicþ the power set of 
all the subset of element in ic, and we defin 

oddðkþ ≔ fi∶jn ðiþ ∩ Kj ¼ 1 mod 2g ð2þ 
a the odd neighborhood of a set of vertex K ⊆ V. In 
thi work, we be onli interest in mbqc protocol 
that implement unitari embeddings. hence, for us, 
jij ¼ joj ≤ N. intuitively, the state of the qubit in the 
input set correspond to the input state of a computation. 
similarly, the qubit in the output set will contain the 
quantum inform correspond to the result of the 
comput onc all the qubit in Oc have be measured. 
In the process, the quantum inform be transform by 
the same principl that govern the gener one-bit 
teleport scheme [42,43]. 
for our purposes, we restrict the measur to be 

projectivemeasur in thexy-plan of thebloch sphere, 
denot M 

αj 
j ¼fj�αih�αjjg for qubit j, where j�αi ¼ 

1ffiffi 
2 

p ðj0i � eiαj1iþ. As a convention, we use bj ¼ 0 for the 
measur qubit collaps to jþαij and bj ¼ 1 for collaps 
to j−αij. the comput tobeperform be specifiedbothbi 
the choic of open graphgði; OÞ and by a vectorα specifi 
the measur basi αi for each qubit i. note that these be 
the measur that would be make directli on the cluster 
state if all themeasur outcomeswer zero for nonoutput 
qubits—i.e., if one be to implement the posit branch of 
the mbqc computation. importantly, by convention, the 

posit branch correspond to the target computation. In 
general, however, these base need to be updat base on 
outcom of earli measur in order to ensur the 
correct comput be performed. the descript of the 
resourc state, theorder ofmeasurements, and thedepend 
of themeasurementbas onpreviousmeasur outcom 
be collect know a a measur pattern. 
project measur be inher random in quan- 

tum mechanics, and one need a procedur to correct for 
thi randomness. We show that thi need for adapt of 
futur measur base on previou outcom be what 
prevent bob from know the protocol perfectly. not 
incidentally, it be also what circumv the no-go result 
from ref. [38]. thi be becaus onli alic know how she 
be choos to adapt futur measur base depend 
on previou measur outcomes: our observ be 
that differ choic of adapt strategi correspond to 
differ comput in general. 
the structur that determin how to recov determin- 

istic evolut from a mbqcmeasur pattern be call 
g-flow [44], from “gener quantum-inform flow.” 
rigorously, give some resourc state jgi and a measure- 
ment pattern on it, if the associ open graph gði; OÞ 
satisfi certain g-flow condit (to be describ later), 
then the pattern be runnable, and it be also uniformly, 
strongly, and stepwis deterministic. thi mean that each 
branch of the pattern can be make equal to the posit 
branch after each measur by applic of local 
corrections, independ of the measur angles. We 
use “deterministic” without ambigu to indic all these 
attributes. note also that satisfi the g-flow condit be 
a necessari and suffici condit for determinism. 
In practice, the g-flow assign a set of local pauli 

correct to a subset of unmeasur qubit after a 
measurement. see ref. [45] for the fine detail regard 
the practic of g-flow. for simplicity, in the definit 
of g-flow below adapt from ref. [44], we assum all 
qubit be measur in the xy-plan of the bloch sphere. 
the idea behind g-flow be to determin whether one can 
find a correct oper (relat to a correct set on the 
graph) that, in the case of a nonzero measur outcome, 
can revert the quantum state onto the project corre- 
spond to the zero outcome. thi be do by appli 
stabil oper on the state. the g-flow condit 
determin whether the geometr structur of an open 
graph allow for these correct after each measurement. 

definit 1. [g-flow] for an open graph gði; oþ, there 
exist a g-flow ðg;≻þ if one can defin a function g∶oc → 
pðicþ and a partial order ≻ on V such that ∀i ∈ Oc all of 
the follow condit hold: 

(g1) if j ∈ gðiþ and j ≠ i, then j ≻ i; 
(g2) if j ⊁ i and i ≠ j, then j ∉ odd(gðiþ); and 
(g3) i ∉ gðiþ and i ∈ odd(gðiþ).

031004-3 



the successor function gðiþ indic what measur 
will be affect by the outcom of the measur of qubit 
i, while the partial order≻ should be thought of a the causal 
order of measurements. the condit (g1) say that if a 
vertex j be in the correct set of the vertex i, then j should 
be measur after the vertex i. In other words, a correct 
should happen after the assign measurement. condit 
(g2) make sure that if the correct set of a vertex i be 
connect to a vertex j, and j ismeasur befor the vertex i, 
then the vertex j should have an even number of con- 
nection with the correct set of vertex i. then, vertex j 
receiv an even number of equal pauli corrections, which 
be equival to receiv none; hence, no correct can 
affect earli corrections. finally, condit (g3) ensur 
that each vertex i have an odd number of connect with it 
correct set, such that a correct be inde perform on 
i [45]. In thi sense, the g-flow condit be understood in 
term of geometr condit on the open graph. 
guid by these conditions, for cluster states, here and in 

the following, we alway adopt the same choic of vertex 
label on the graph a show in fig. 1. thi choic be 
motiv by our late goal of count how mani choic 
of open graph satisfi the g-flow condit on a give 
cluster state. sinc a vertex label correspond to a total 
order of measurement, it be easi to check that, in order to 
satisfi the g-flow conditions, for ani vertex i, the quantum 
inform can onli move toward the right, move toward 
the bottom, or stay on that vertex. furthermore, condit 
(g3) impos that the inform from a vertex cannot 
move simultan toward the right and toward the 
bottom. In order to further simplifi the process of count 
flows, we introduc an addit criterion, which be not 
strictli requir by g-flow: 

(g4) If k ∈ N ðiþ ∪ N ðjþ, and if k ∈ gðiþ, then k ∉ gðjþ. 
for gn;m, a we shall see later, it will prove easi to 
count flow satisfi (g1)–(g4) than those satisfi 

(g1)–(g3). thi process of cours onli provid a low 
bound on the number of flow rather than the exact number, 
but it will be suffici for our purposes. 
with these four criterion in place, we can defin a g-flow 

graph path, in thi restrict version of g-flow, a an 
order set of adjac edg of the graph, start from 
an element of the input set and end on an element of the 
output set, such that for each edg ij of the path, we have 
j ∈ gðiþ, with j ≻ i. then, it follow that (g4) do not 
allow the g-flow graph path to cross. To help the under- 
stand of mbqc, one could think of a g-flow graph path 
a a represent of a wire in the quantum circuit picture. 
thi intuit will be use late in thi work to count how 
mani way one could defin an open graph with g-flow for 
our choic of total ordering, which in turn provid a link to 
the idea that differ open graph with g-flow lead to 
differ quantum computations. 

iii. classic driven blind 
quantum comput 

We start from the situat where alice, the client, want 
to obtain the result of a particular quantum computation. 
have no quantum devic of her own, the quantum 
comput must have a classic output. We allow alic 
to control a probabilist polynomial-tim univers ture 
machin (i.e., a classic comput with access to random- 
ness). alic have classic commun line to and from 
bob, the server. bob have access to a univers (and 
noiseless) quantum computer. bob could help alice, but 
she do not trust him. alic wish to ask bob to perform a 
quantum comput for her in a way that bob obtain a 
littl inform a possibl about her choic of compu- 
tation. without loss of generality, we assum that the 
quantum system use in the protocol be qubit (two-level 
quantum system [46]). In general, here and in the 
following, we denot by 

ΔA ¼ fρi; ûa;mg ð3þ 

the classic descript of alice’ computation, where ρI be 
the n-qubit input state of the computation, ûa be the unitari 
emb that map ρI to the output state ρO ¼ ûaρiû†a, 
and M be the final set of measur on ρO requir to 
extract the classic output. note that we be impli that 
the input state can be effici describ classically. for 
instance, it could be a standard choic of input such a the 
n-qubit comput basi ρI ¼ j0ih0j⊗n. We also (rather 
pedantically) assum that the number of comput 
step be at most polynomi in the input size. make the 
process abstract, alice’ desir task becom equal to 
sampl the string 

p ¼ fpig ¼ πðδaþ ≔ mðûaρiû†aþ; ð4þ

where π be a map that describ the blind oper 
perform by the protocol, which output the correct 
probabl distribut fpig on the joint measur 
outcom give ΔA a alice’ deleg target computa- 
tion. An outlin of the protocol be present in protocol 1. 
let u now introduc the relev definit for the 

variabl use in the protocol and describ the step 
thoroughly. the initi step of the protocol be for bob to 
prepar the resourc state jgi that will be use to implement 
the mbqc. onc the graph state jgi be prepar by bob, the 
interact part of the protocol start with alic communicat- 
ing to bob the angl to bemeasured, one by one. becaus of 
the random introduc by the result of the project 
measurements, there exist the possibl that these angl 
must be correct base on the outcom 

b ≔ ðb1;…; bnþ ∈ zn2 ð5þ 

of alice’ would-b measurements. nonetheless, alic can 
pick a canon set of angl 

α ≔ ðα1;…;αnþ ∈ AN ð6þ 

correspond to the posit branch case where b ¼ 0. As 
discuss earlier, it be possibl that the angl for qubit jmust 
be modifi base on the outcom of the preced j − 1 
measurements, which we denot 

b<j ≔ ðb1;…; bj−1þ: ð7þ 

We account for thi adapt in depend set 

sx ≔ ðsx1;…; sxnþ ∈ zn2 ; ð8þ 

sz ≔ ðsz1;…; sznþ ∈ zn2 ; ð9þ 

which depend on theb<j and also on theg-flow construction, 
here repres by a bit string 

f ≔ ðf1;…; fmþ ∈ zm2 ð10þ 

of lengthm call the flow control bit (or just “flow bits”). 
At thi point, we still have to quantifi the valu ofm. note, 
though, that it repres the number of bit need to 
enumer all the possibl combin of input and output 
that satisfi the g-flow condit [44,47]. hence, for a fix 
total order of the measurements, it be a function of N. 
explicitly, the X and Z correct associ with the 
measur angl of each qubit j be determin by the 
depend sets: 

sxj∶ d½b<j� ×d½f� → z2; ð11þ 

szj∶ d½b<j� ×d½f� → z2; ð12þ 

where the function D denot the domain of the argument. 
without loss of generality,w choos sz1 ¼ sx1 ¼ 0 sinc there 
be no previou outcom onwhich these could depend. for a 
fix open graph gði; oþ, the form of the depend set be 
uniqu defin by the g-flow [4]. analogously, the flow bit 
f fulli specifi the depend set (a function of b). As 
such, the quantum circuit that alic intend to implement be 
specifi by the inform 

ðα; fÞ ∈ AN × zm2 ; ð13þ 

consist of N measur angl and M flow bit for 
a give graph with fix total order of measurement. 
consequently, onc the graph G be known, there exist a 
one-to-on correspond gði; oþn;m ↔ f, and we can 
accordingli denot the correspond mbqc measure- 
ment pattern a follows: 

protocol 1 cdbqc ðg;aþ: classic driven blind quantum 
computation. 

protocol parameters: 
(i) A graph G with an implicit total order of vertices. 
(ii) A set of angl A satisfi eq. (19). 

alice’ input: 
(i) A target comput ΔA implement use mbqc a 

δma ¼ fg;α; fg; 

repres a measur pattern on G compat with 
the total order of measur implicit in G, which 
describ a unitari emb ûa. the set α repres a 
sequenc of N measur angl over the graph G, with 
each angl chosen from a set A, which be also take to be a 
paramet of the protocol and be know to both parties. the 
g-flow construct f fulli determin the input state ρin, 
through the locat of the input and output qubit set on 
the graph (I and O, respectively) and the depend set 
ðsx; szþ. 

step of the protocol: 
1. state prepar 

(a) bob prepar the graph state jgi. 
2. measur 

for i ¼ 1;…; N, repeat the following: 
(a) alic pick a binari digit ri ∈ Z2 uniformli at random. 

then, use ri, sx, sz, and the function in eq. (18), she 
comput the angl α0i. alic transmit α 

0 
i to bob. 

(b) bob measur the ith qubit in the basi fj�α0iig and 
transmit to alic the measur outcom b0i ∈ z2. 

(c) alic record bi ¼ b0i ⊕ ri in b and then updat the 
depend set ðsx; szþ. If i ∈ O, then she also record 
bi in pcb . 

3. post-process of the output 
(a) alic implement the final round of correct on the 

output string by calcul p ¼ pC ⊕ szo, with szo 
the set of Z correct on the output at the end of the 
protocol.

δma ¼ ðgn;m;α; fþ: ð14þ 

explicitly, note that by choos f, alic be defin a 
uniqu choic of the input and output on the graph state 
befor the protocol begins. In line with the comput 
descript from eq. (3), we call ρI the input state on G. 
We now turn our attent to what kind of inform 

bob receiv when alic ask him to perform the mea- 
surement on her behalf. the interact part of the protocol 
consist of N steps. At each step i, alic request bob to 
measure, in the xy-plan of the bloch sphere, the ith qubit, 
accord to the total order impli by G, and he send back 
a bit for each measurement. We identifi the measur 
instruct bob receiv a a list of angl 

α0 ≔ ðα01;…; α0nþ ∈ an; ð15þ 

and we label the string of bit alic receiv from bob a 

b0 ≔ ðb01;…; b0nþ ∈ zn2 ; ð16þ 

while rememb that they be commun altern 
(α01 to bob, b 

0 
1 to alice, α 

0 
2 to bob, b 

0 
2 to alice, etc.). note 

that in the case of a dishonest bob, the string b0 do not 
need to correspond to real measur outcom but 
could have be gener by bob through some altern 
process. 
realiz thatmeasur α can just a easili be effect by 

ask bob to measur αþ π and then flip the return 
outcom bit, we introduc a uniformli random n-bit string 

r ≔ ðr1;…; rnþ ∈ zn2 ð17þ 

that alic will use to pad the angl in an attempt to conceal 
the measur outcomes. all that remain be to specifi 
how α0 depend on α. thi be specifi by the follow 
function depend [17,47,48]: 

α0 ¼ ð−1þsxαþ ðsz þ rþπ mod 2π; ð18þ 

which follow from the g-flow construct and show how 
correct chang subsequ measur angles. here, 
we have use multi-index notat to present the result 
concis a a vector. note that the depend set ðsx; szþ 
be updat by alic after each measurement. To make the 
analysi of the protocol meaningful, we construct a domain 
forα such that the domain of all validα0 be the same. thus, in 
general, 

A ¼ fð−1þxθ þ zπjθ ∈ A; x ∈ z2; z ∈ z2g: ð19þ 

also note that now 

b0 ¼ b ⊕ r; ð20þ 

where ⊕ indic addit modulo 2 for each bit. We 
can identifi the data that bob receiv dure the interact 
part of the protocol (some from alice, some from hi own 
measurements) a 

ðdata bob receivesþ ≔ ðb0;α0þ ∈ zn2 ×an: ð21þ 

the interact part of the protocol end when all the 
qubit have be measur and alic hold the binari 
regist b, deriv from b0 to account for the one-tim pad 
r. sinc alic know the output set O, whenev the ith 
qubit belong to the set of output qubits, alic save bi into 
a second binari sequenc of length joj: 

pcb ≔ ðp1;…; pjojþ ∈ zjoj2 ; ð22þ 

where pi ¼ bi, ∀i ∈ O. If bob be honest, then pcb be 
equival to pc. At the end of the protocol, thi string 
contain the classic result of the computation, up to 
classic post-processing. thi be account for by calcu- 
late p ¼ pC ⊕ szo, where szo be use to repres the final 
set of Z correct on the output qubits. clearly, the 
classic natur of the client allow u to consid onli 
quantum comput with classic output. 
In order for the protocol to have ani utility, we requir 

that the output p satisfi eq. (4), a properti know a 
correctness. the correct of thi protocol can be prove 
straightforwardly. note that the posit branch of the 
mbqc pattern δma [that is, where all the measur 
outcom happen to be equal to zero (b ¼ 0)] implement 
alice’ target comput ΔA by definition. In the circuit 
model, thi correspond to a quantum circuit that imple- 
ment the unitari ûa over the correct input state ρI and a 
final round of measur whose output be the binari 
string p [49]. below, we give a proof of the correct of 
the cdbqc protocol. 
theorem 1. [correctness] for honest alic and bob, the 

outcom of protocol 1 be correct. 
proof.—ther be onli two differ between protocol 

1 and a convent mbqc implement of δma . 
the first be the use of r to hide measur outcomes. 
the effect of r be to add an addit π to the measur 
angl on certain qubits, result in a bit flip on the 
correspond measur result b0i. however, sinc thi 
be immedi undone, it have no effect on the statist of 
the measur result obtain after decod b. 
the other differ be that the g-flow construction, and 

henc the depend sets, be onli know to alic and not to 
bob. however, thi do not affect the input state, which be 
equival to the usual case if alic be honest (i.e., if she 
correctli perform her role in implement the protocol). 
furthermore, if alic updat the measur angl 
correctli use the depend set a dictat by the 
g-flow, and bob measur them accordingly, everi branch

of δma be equival to the posit branch. then, the 
measur pattern correctli implement the unitari trans- 
format ρout ¼ ûaρinû†a. the protocol also allow alic to 
identifi the element of the output string pC in b sinc she 
know thepositionof theoutputon thegraph.hence,whenboth 
alic and bob follow the protocol, the output stringp ¼ pC ⊕ 
szo be the desir probabl distribut that follow from the 
joint measur of the correct quantum output. □ 

iv. blind analysi 

We now look at the degre of blind for a singl round 
of protocol 1. In thi setting, we consid a cheat bob 
with unbound comput power, abl to deviat from 
the protocol and follow ani strategi allow by the law of 
physics. our aim, however, be not to verifi that bob be 
inde perform the correct quantum comput a 
requested. instead, we want to quantifi the amount of 
inform that bob can access when protocol 1 be run 
onli onc (stand-alone) and compar it against the total 
amount of inform need to describ the computation. 
To complet identifi alice’ computation, bob need to 
know the descript δma . 
We identifi variabl with uppercas letter and particular 

instanc of such variabl with lowercas letters. the 
probabl of a give instanc x of a random variabl X be 
denot prðxþ, and averag over X be denot h·ix or h·i 
when there be no ambiguity. given a random variabl X, we 
callnx the number of possibl outcom for the variabl and 
nX ≔ log2nx the number of bit requir to enumer them. 
We denot the shannon entropi [50] of a random 

variabl X by hðxþ ≔ h− log2 prðxþix ≤ nx, with equal- 
iti if and onli if X be uniformli random. for two ran- 
dom variabl X and Y, their joint entropi be write 
hðx;yþ ≔ h−log2 prðx; yþix;i , and the condit en- 
tropi of X give Y be hðxjyþ ≔ h−log2 prðxjyþix;i . 
these satisfi 

hðxjyþ ¼ hðx;yþ −hðyþ: ð23þ 

the mutual inform of X and Y be 

iðx;yþ ≔ hðxþ þhðyþ −hðx;yþ 
¼ hðxþ −hðxjyþ 
¼ hðyþ −hðyjxþ; ð24þ 

which will be our main tool of analysis. intuitively, iðx;yþ 
measur how much inform Y have about X. more 
precisely, it quantifi how much the entropi of X be 
reduced, on average, when the valu of Y be known. 
becaus of the symmetri of the definition, these statement 
also hold when the role of X and Y be swapped. 
let u call the angl variabl A and the flow variabl F. 

specifi δma , in general, therefor requir nA þ nF bits. 

In addition, we use B for the eventu measur 
outcom and R for the (uniformli random) string of 
π-shift bit that be know onli to alice. In ani give run of 
the protocol, A and F be drawn from a joint prior 
probabl prðα; fþ, which be know to bob. thus, 
hða;fþ ≤ nA þ nF bits, with equal if and onli if the 
prior be uniform over F and A. note that we do not make 
ani assumpt about thi prior in what follows. 
We have see befor that a singl instanc of the data 

bob receiv at the end of protocol 1 be equal to ðg;b0;α0þ. 
In a stand-alon setting, thi be the onli data avail to 
bob from which he might be abl to gain some inform 
about the circuit chosen by alice. If thi protocol be to be 
use a a subroutin or in parallel with anoth protocol, 
then one must analyz the secur in a compos 
framework. such an analysi be beyond the scope of the 
present work and be left a an open problem. note that the 
graph be consid a paramet of the protocol and not part 
of alice’ secret. bob’ use inform at the end of a 
singl run of protocol 1 be then equal to the mutual infor- 
mation iðb0;a0;a;fþ between the variabl associ 
with the circuit ða;fþ and bob’ data ðb0;a0þ. 
In other words, we be model the leakag of 

inform a an unintent classic channel between 
alic and bob, where ða;fþ be the input of the channel 
and ðb0;a0þ be the output at bob’ side. then, the mutual 
inform tell u how mani bit of the origin mes- 
sage bob receiv on average, when averag over mani 
us of the channel. importantly, one cannot recover, from 
mutual information, what bit of the origin messag be 
pass to bob. for our protocol, the mutual inform 
satisfi the follow bound, which do not reli on ani 
comput assumpt but be entir deriv from 
inform theory. 
theorem 2. [blindness] In a singl instanc of protocol 

1, the mutual inform between the client’ secret input 
fα; fg and the inform receiv by the server be 
bound by 

iðb0;a0;a;fþ ≤ hða0þ: ð25þ 

proof.—from the definit of mutual information, we 
have 

iðb0;a0;a;fþ ¼ hðb0;a0þ −hðb0;a0ja;fþ: 
appli the inequ hðx;yþ ≤ hðxþ þhðyþ, 
togeth with the fact that hðb0þ ≤ nb0 ¼ N, to the abov 
equat yield 

iðb0;a0;a;fþ ≤ hða0þ þ N −hðb0;a0ja;fþ: ð26þ 
what remain to be show be that hðb0;a0ja;fþ ≥ N. 
thi result be prove a lemma 4 in the appendix by 
bound prðb0;α0jα; fÞ ≤ 2−n base on the full joint 
probabl for the protocol. with thi bound in place, 
eq. (25) directli follows. □ 

flow ambiguity: A path toward classic … phys. rev. X 7, 031004 (2017) 

031004-7 



the condit entropi hða;fjb0;a0þ quantifi the 
amount of inform that, on average, remain unknown 
to bob about alice’ comput at the end of protocol 1. 
As mention previously, in the case where alic choos 
the measur angl A uniformli randomli from a 
finit set, one Aj for each qubit, and she choos the flow F 
uniformli randomli from the set of all flow compat 
with the total order implicit in G, then 

hða;fþ ¼ nA þ nf: ð27þ 
In thi case, by calcul the condit entropi 

hða;fjb0;a0þ ¼ hða;fþ − iðb0;a0;a;fþ; ð28þ 
we have hða;fjb0;a0þ ≥ nF becaus of theorem 2. note 
that theorem 2 guarante zero mutual inform for a 
singl run of protocol 1 onli if nA ¼ 0, which mean onli 
one choic of measur angl for each qubit. however, 
the structur of the domain of α and α0 [see eq. (19)] 
forbid such a choice. A minim choic of angl that be 
not classic simul (via the gottesman-knil theorem 
[51]) be give by

In thi case, for each angl αj, one have nαj ¼2, so na¼2n. 
sinc hða0þ ≤ na0 ¼ na, bob gain at most two bit of 
inform per qubit measured, with thi inform 
be a nontrivi function of both α and f. 

V. applic TO cluster state 

To conclud the secur analysi of the stand-alon 
scenario, it be necessari to calcul the exact valu of nf, 
which in turn give u the valu of nF and henc the low 
bound of the condit entropi for the case of uniform 
variabl A, F a explain above. clearly, thi depend on 
the choic of G. here, we consid the case of cluster states, 
where G be take to be gn;m with implicit total order of 
vertex a illustr in fig. 1. note that M, the length of 
the bit string f, be equal to log2nf. when condit (g4) be 
included, the g-flow we consid correspond to focu 
g-flow [52]. hence, there be a one-to-on correspond 
between an instanc of a g-flow f of F and a choic of input 
and output set on the graph [52]. here, we place a low 
bound on M by count flow that satisfi condit 
(g1)–(g4). the use of the addit constraint (g4), which 
be not implicit in the definit of g-flow, impli that we be 
undercount the total number of flows; hence, 

NF ≥ #gði; oþn;m; ð30þ 
where #gði; oþn;m correspond to the number of possibl 
way one can defin an open graph that satisfi condit 
(g1)–(g4). We now show that thi quantiti can grow 

exponenti in the dimens of the cluster state such 
that nF ∝ N. 
theorem 3. for a cluster state correspond to gn;m 

with fix total order a depict in fig. 1, the number 
of differ open graph gði; OÞ satisfi condit 
(g1)–(g4) be give by

where Fi be the ith fibonacci number. 
proof.—th proof of thi theorem be somewhat involved. 

We begin by consid a set of diagon cut acrossgn;m, a 
depict in fig. 2(a). As we be consid onli those flow 
that satisfi condit (g4), there be a straightforward con- 
straint on the inform flow,which can be see by isol 
a singl cut and thevertic link byedg that the cut pass 
through [see fig. 2(b)]. In the follow discussion, we 
consid onli the vertex connect by edg through which 
a particular cut passes. becaus of the total order impos 
on the vertex of gn;m, condit (g1)–(g3) ensur that 
inform can onli pa through a cut from the left side to 
the right side and not in the revers direction. condit (g4) 
then allow exactli the set of flow where for ani vertex k on 
the right side of the cut, inform flow to k from at

number of possibl flow across each cut be indicated. (b) sever

most one of it neighbor on the left side of the cut. so, 
if i, j ∈ N ðkþ, then k ∉ gðiþ ∩ gðjþ. 
We divid the cut into three types: (i) those have one 

less neighbor vertex on the left side of the cut than on 
the right, (ii) those have one more neighbor vertex on 
the left side of the cut than on the right, and (iii) those 
have an equal number of neighbor vertex on both 
side of the cut. We label the total number of flow for each 
type a aμ, bμ, and cμ, respectively, where μ indic the 
number of neighbor vertex on the left side of the cut, a 
show in fig. 2(b). 
In order to quantifi these, we begin by note that 

Aμ ¼ a→μ þ a→μ , where a→μ denot the number of flow 
with the restrict that inform flow from the upper- 
most neighbor vertex on the left side of the cut to the 
uppermost neighbor vertex on the right side of the cut, 
and a→μ denot the number of flow where thi constraint 
be not satisfied. these quantiti can be calcul use a 
simpl recurs relation, a follows. 
here, a→μ allow precis one possibl for flow 

between the uppermost vertex of the cut, preclud 
flow from the uppermost vertex on the left side of the 
cut to low vertex on the right side. hence, the remain 
μ − 1 vertex on the left side and μ − 1 on the right side will 
be isol and ident to the situat where the cut 
partit one few vertex on each side. thus,a→μ ¼ aμ−1 ¼ 
a→μ−1 þ a→μ−1. 
calcul a→μ be a littl more involved, a there be two 

possibl to consider. the first be that no inform 
flow from the uppermost vertex on the left side of the cut 
across the cut (in which case, it be an output). In thi case, 
isol of the low vertex occur a in the analysi ofa→μ ; 
hence, there be a→μ−1 þ a→μ−1 possibl flows. In the second 
case, no inform can flow into the second uppermost 
vertex on the right side of the cut; hence, onlya→μ−1 flow be 
possible. thus, a→μ ¼ a→μ−1 þ 2a→μ−1 ¼ a→μ þ a→μ−1. these 
correspond be depict in fig. 3. 
note that a→μ and a→μ satisfi the same recurs relat 

a the fibonacci sequenc when order a ða→1 ; a→1 ; 
a→2 ; A 

→ 
2 ;…þ and start with a→1 ¼ 1 ¼ F2 and a→1 ¼ 

2 ¼ f3. It follow that Aμ ¼ f2μþ2. By similar arguments, 
we have Bμ ¼ f2μ and Cμ ¼ f2μþ1. 
It remain onli to be note that the configur of the 

inform flow across one cut be independ of the 
inform flow across other cuts; hence, the total number 
of possibl flow be give by the product of the possibl 
flow across each cut. therefore,

evalu to lead order, 

nF ≥ log2#gði; oþn;m ≈ 1.388n: ð37þ 

thi result impli that the condit entropi 
hða;fjb0;a0þ ≥ 1.388n. for the case of a comput 
chosen uniformli at random by alice, the total number 
of bit requir to entir describ her comput be 
approxim equal to 3.388n. however, bob onli 
receiv exactli 2N bit of inform from alic (the 
angl α0). from theorem 2.1 in ref. [53], it be easi to 
verifi that bob cannot decod alice’ comput entir 
with unit probability. additionally, theorem 2.4 in 
ref. [54] show that bob cannot guess alice’ comput 
with probabl great than 2−1.388n . 
To make sens of thi result, one should rememb 

that a particular determinist mbqc comput be

above. here, arrow indic inform flow, while edg 
indic the possibl of inform flow.

character by identifi an input and output set on the 
underli graph of the resourc state, togeth with an 
inform flow construction. thi structur determin 
how the quantum inform be determinist trans- 
fer via project measur from the physic 
locat of the input to the output. furthermore, onc 
the input and output system be fix on the graph, the 
flow, if it can be constructed, be unique. hence, in the 
canon approach to mbqc, the usual procedur be to fix 
the input and the output and assign a partial order of 
measur that guarante determin under a specif 
set of rules. consequently, the flow construct impos a 
total order of measurements, which must respect the 
partial one. 
here, we have revers thi point of view. As such, 

theorem 3 be base on the nontrivi observ that, for a 
give mbqc resourc state with a fix total order of 
measurements, choic of g-flow, i.e., choic of input and 
output vertex on the graph that correspond to differ 
determinist quantum computations, be gener not 
unique. nonetheless, alice’ choic of input and output 
enforc a uniqu comput among all the possibl 
choices. thi choic of g-flow be not commun to the 
server and be kept hidden by alice, who us it to updat 
the classic instruct sent to bob. thi observ 
make it possibl for a client to conceal the flow of 
quantum inform from a quantum server classic 
instruct on what oper to perform. In particular, 
sinc a larg number of other comput be still 
compat with the inform bob receives, the 
achiev blind follow from the ambigu about 
the flow of inform on the graph. furthermore, our 
protocol circumv the scheme-depend no-go theo- 
rem for classic blind quantum comput state in 
ref. [38]. here, we do not make use of ani affin 
encrypt on the client’ side, but a mention above, 
we use flow ambigu to encod a part of the client’ 
computation. As a consequ of thi encoding, protocol 
1 requir multipl round of commun between the 
client and server. thi requir be in direct contrast with 
the assumpt of ref. [38], where onli one round of 
commun be allowed. 
We can addit make two import observations. 

the first be that the circuit implement on gn;m be not 
classic simul unless bpp ¼ bqp. thi stem from 
the fact that the cluster state be univers with onli xy-plan 
measurements, a have recent be proven in ref. [55]. 
the abov bound provid an exponenti low bound on 
the number of consist flow for all cluster states. the 
second observ be that the comput correspond 
to differ choic of flow be not equivalent, even when 
classic post-process be allowed. thi can most easili 
be see by consid an example. We consid the 
simplest case of the 2 × 2 plaquett jcsi2;2. In fig. 4, 
we show an exampl of two differ choic of open 

fig. 5. list of the nine possibl gði; oþ2;2 combin 
(and associ patterns) with g-flow for the cluster state 
jcsi2;2. the arrow indic the direct of the quantum 
inform flow. note that overlap input and output set 
be allowed. all the pattern implement unitari embed on 
the input state. 

fig. 4. A 2 × 2 cluster state with measur angl 
fα; β; γ; δg. In thi example, we show how to encod two 
differ comput use a fix total order of measure- 
ment f1; 2; 3; 4g. the differ follow from the choic of 
the gði; oþ. In diagram (a), the input set be f1; 3g, and the 
output set be f2; 4g, with g-flow function gð1þ ¼ f2g and 
gð3þ ¼ f4g. the equival circuit associ with the posit 
branch of thi mbqc pattern be show below. note that ani 
final round of correct be push into the classic post- 
process of the output. In diagram (b), the input set be 
f1; 2g, the output set be f3; 4g, gð1þ ¼ f3g, and gð2þ ¼ f4g. 
similarli to (a), we show the circuit of the posit branch of 
the mbqc pattern, and the final round of correct be 
classic post-processed.

graph compat with the underli total order of 
measurements. both choic satisfi the g-flow conditions, 
and a a result, they correspond to two determinist 
mbqc patterns, i.e., two differ and well-defin 

computations. sinc in thi particular case the input state 
(ĉzjþþi) be equivalent, the differ be dictat by the 
unitari transform (specifi by the measur 
angles) that act on it. As can be see from fig. 4, the 
correspond circuit be differ and perform differ 
unitaries. becaus of the flow ambigu and the obfusca- 
tion due to the one-tim pad, a quantum server that be to 
perform the measur follow protocol 1, at the end 
of the procedure, would not have enough inform to 
exactli identifi alice’ choic of open graph. for g2;2, 
there be nine possibl flow configur a expect 
from eq. (31), which be depict in fig. 5. given ani fix 
transcript of the protocol, for each flow there exist a choic 
of α such that it be consist with the transcript. An 
exampl run of protocol 1 be present in fig. 6 for the 
g2;2 case. 
As a final comment, it be clear that there exist case 

where, for a fix graph and choic of angles, differ 
choic of flow will correspond to the same computation. 
for instance, refer to fig. 5, measur all qubit with 
the same angl would give a two-to-on correspond for 
some of the computations. however, it be reason to 
conjectur that when the angl be chosen from set of 
larg cardinality, the map will be close to one to one. 
the full character of the map be left a an open 
problem. 

vi. discuss and conclus 

our overal motiv in thi work have be to explor 
the possibl of classic driven blind quantum com- 
putation. while thi may seem an imposs task, the fact 
that multipl nonequival comput in the mbqc 
model can yield the same transcript of measur 
angl and results, even when the resourc state and 
order of measur be fixed, allow the tantal 
possibl that it may be possibl for a classic user to 
hide a comput from a quantum server. protocol 1 
make use of thi flow ambigu to provid some 
measur of hide for quantum comput chosen 
from certain restrict sets. our intent in introduc 
thi protocol be not to provid a practic cryptograph 
protocol but rather to demonstr that it be inde 
possibl to hide nonequival quantum comput 
use thi flow ambiguity. As such, we concentr on 
show that in a singl run of the protocol, the amount of 
inform obtain by the server be bounded, rather than 
introduc a compos secur definition, which be 
nontrivi give the depend of the leak inform 
on the respons of the server. 
our result provok a coupl of questions. the first and 

most obviou be whether the flow ambigu effect can be 
exploit to hide a univers set of comput even after 
the measur angl have be commun to the 
server. A second and perhap even more import question 
be whether thi phenomenon can be use a a build block 

fig. 6. illustr of an exemplari run of protocol 1. At the start 
of the protocol, alice’ comput be express a a measur 
pattern on a graph, in thi case, g2;2. thi be commun to bob, 
who prepar the initi state. the comput then proce in 
round with alic comput the relev entri of sx and sz and, 
use these togeth with ri, the measur angl α0i. the 
measur angl α0i be commun to bob, who perform 
the measur and return the result to alic a b0i. from this, 
alic computesbi asb0i ⊕ ri. thi process be repeat until all qubit 
have be measured. At the end of the protocol, for ani fix 
transcript of the commun (composedofα0 andb0), it be alway 
possibl to find a choic for α consist with the transcript for ani 
choic of f. In other words, for ani of the possibl g-flow 
configur show in fig. 5, bob can find an α that would have 
lead to the transcript he recorded, whichmean ani of those g-flow be 
possible. thi ambigu be respons for partial hide alice’ 
comput from bob.

appendix: full joint probabl for 
the protocol and condit 

entropi bound 

lemma 4. hðb0;a0ja;fþ ≥ N regardless of bob’ 
strategy. 
proof.—w construct the full joint probabl for all of 

the variabl in protocol 1 and use it to explicitli deriv 
the desir result. direct depend in the joint 
probabl will be limit by causal and the assump- 
tion that alice’ and bob’ laboratori be secur and 
free of each others’ espionage. these limit be a 
follows: 

(i) the flow bit F and ideal measur angl A 
directli depend on no other variables. they be 
input to the problem chosen by alic and can be 
correlated. 

(ii) each π-shift bit Rj in R be chosen by flip a fair 
coin; thus, it directli depend on no other variables. 

(iii) alic assign a0j base directli on the current aj, all 
flow bit F, the current rj, and ani prior decod 
bit b<j. 

(iv) each decod bit Bj directli depend onli on Rj 
(the π-shift bit) and the bit b0j receiv from bob. 

(v) each bit b0j that bob return to alic directli 
depend onli on the inform bob have on hand 
at the time (specifically,b0<j anda 

0 
≤j), a well a ani 

(classic or quantum) stochast strategi he wish 
to employ. 

with these direct-depend limitations, we can 
immedi write down the form of the full joint 
probabl for the entir protocol: 

prðb0;α0;α; f;b; rÞ 

¼ prðα; fÞ 
YN 
j¼1 

prðb0jjb0<j;α0≤jþ prðα0jjαj; f;b<j; rjþ 

× prðbjjb0j; rjþ prðrjþ: ða1þ 

furthermore, we can explicitli write sever of these 
probabilities: 

prðbjjb0j; rjþ ¼ δbjb0j⊕rj ; ða2þ 

prðα0jjαj; f;b<j; rjþ ¼ δ

gjðαj; f;b<j; rjþ 
≔ ð−1þsxj ðf;b<jþαj þ πszjðf;b<jþ þ πrj mod 2π ða5þ 

obtain from eq. (18). these hold for all j. At thi point, 
we have the most gener form of the full joint probabl 
consist with the protocol:
