the nation neurosci institut (nni[1]) and nanyang technolog university, singapor (ntu singapore) announc a 
collabor to develop innov technolog to good diagnos and treat patient with neurolog condit such a

the project for the first year of fellowship includ the develop of artifici intellig system to accur identifi type of 
traumat brain injuri from comput tomographi (ct) scan and to precis identifi tissu dure bran surgeries. 

use machin learn to diagnos intracrani haemorrhag 

traumat brain injury, commonli know a head injury, be a lead caus of disabl and death in adult below 40 year old in 
singapore. head injuri can occur after traffic accidents, falls, fights, sport and recreat injuries. everi week, the nation 
neurosci institut see 20-30 patient with traumat brain injuri be admitted. 

CT brain scan be use to check for ani intracrani haemorrhag or bleed that occur insid the skull, which could requir 
surgery. the scan need to be interpret quickli and accur by train doctor to ensur patient have the best outcomes, a 
delay of a few minut can mean the differ between a good and a poor outcome. 

the success of artifici intellig comput algorithm in the field of decision-mak in complex games, and in imag 
classif task can potenti be translat into classifi radiolog images, such a those from CT brain scans. 

In thi propos study, a machin learn algorithm will be train and appli to differenti between CT imag of differ 
pattern of intracrani haemorrhage. the aim be to develop a rapid, accur and autom process for read CT brain scan to 
reduc the time need to initi treatment. 

A machin learn approach to deep brain stimul surgeri 

parkinson’ diseas be a chronic and progress neurolog disord that primarili affect a patient’ movement and abil to 
walk. It be also associ with mental health condit such a depress and dementia. three out of everi 1,000 peopl age 50 
year and old have thi disease. 

deep brain stimul be a surgic procedur to implant a medic devic in the brain. the devic send electr impuls to 
specif target in the brain, chang brain activ in a control manner and block abnorm nerv signal that caus 
symptom such a tremor and movement difficulties. deep brain stimul have be perform routin for suitabl patient 
from the nni. 

for such procedures, a neurophysiologist us electrod to determin a target area in the brain. the neurosurgeon then implant the 
devic in that location. thi project aim to help doctor identifi the locat for the implant more precis through machin 
learning. 

from analys larg amount of data transmit by the electrodes, machin learn can discov pattern that be previous not 
appar and determin more precisely, section of the brain control critic function such a movement.

foster collabor between medic practition and engin 

thi collabor aim to groom multidisciplinari scientists, by provid student with first-hand exposur to variou aspect of 
clinic medicin by interact with neurosurgeon in the cours of their work. 

over the next three years, the collabor will foster closer work relat between medic practition and engin through 
annual fellowship and student attach programmes. 

manag by ntu’ institut for health technolog (healthtech ntu), the one-year fellowship programm will see up to two 
neurosurg resid at nni work full-tim with ntu professor on campus. each resid will receiv s$100,000 to complet 
and commercialis their projects. 

A student attach programm that span a few week will also be introduced, allow ntu engin student to work 
alongsid neurosurgeon at nni. 

associ professor Ng wai hoe, medic director of the nation neurosci institute, said, “innov occur at intersect 
of disciplines, knowledg and expertise. doctor have a deep understand of clinic need from their everyday interact with 
patients. our uniqu collabor bring these medic need to engin laboratori – an environ where imagin be 
encourag in the form of technolog advanc and capabilities.” 

professor lam khin yong, ntu’ chief of staff and vice presid for research, said, “thi collabor creat a uniqu 
multidisciplinari research environ by integr healthcar with both medic and engin expertis from ntu’ lee 
kong chian school of medicin and colleg of engineering. thi will not onli nurtur next-gener doctor arm with a 
multidisciplinari skillset to meet singapore’ healthcar needs, but also enhanc medic technolog to diagnos and treat 
neurolog condit more effectively.” 

[1] nni be the nation specialist centr and region centr for clinic referr for the manag and treatment of the neurosciences, a well a for educ and research conduct in 

the field.
