optic atom clocks, due to their unpreced stability1–3 
and uncertainty3–6, be alreadi be use to test physic 
theories7,8 and herald a revis of the intern system of 
units9,10. however, to unlock their potenti for cross-disciplin- 
ari applic such a relativist geodesy11, a major chal- 
leng remains: their transform from highli special 
instrument restrict to nation metrolog laboratori into 
flexibl devic deploy in differ locations12–14. here, 
we report the first field measur campaign with a trans- 
portabl 87sr optic lattic clock12. We use it to determin the 
graviti potenti differ between the middl of a mountain 
and a locat 90 km away, exploit both local and remot 
clock comparison to elimin potenti clock errors. A local 
comparison with a 171yb lattic clock15 also serf a an impor- 
tant check on the intern consist of independ 
develop optic clocks. thi campaign demonstr the 
excit prospect for transport optic clocks. 

the applic of clock in geodesi fulfil long-stand pro- 
posal to interpret a measur of the relativist redshift Δ νrel 
between clock at two site a the associ graviti potenti differ- 
enc Δ U = c2 Δ νrel/ν0 (ν0 be the clock’ frequenc and c the speed of 
light)11. nation geodet height system base on classic terrestri 
and satellite-bas measur exhibit discrep at the deci- 
metr level16. optic clocks, combin with high-perform fre- 
quenci dissemin techniques17,18, offer an attract way to resolv 
these discrepancies, a they combin the advantag of high spectral 
resolut with small error accumul over long distances17,19. 

A clock-bas approach to geodesi with a capabl competit 
with current techniqu requir high clock performance: a frac- 
tional frequenc accuraci of 1 × 10−17 correspond to a resolut 
of about 10 cm in height. furthermore, it be import to realiz 
that the side-by-sid frequenc ratio have to be know to determin 
the remot frequenc shift Δ νrel. take the uncertainti budget of 
optic clock for grant harbour the possibl of errors, becaus 
veri few have be verifi experiment to the low 10−17 region 
or beyond4, 6, 17,20. A transport optic clock not onli increas 
the flexibl in measur site but mitig the risk of unde- 
tect error by enabl local calibr to be performed. 

the test site chosen for our demonstr of chronometr level- 
ling11 with optic clock be the laboratoir souterrain de modan 

(lsm) in france, with the italian metrolog institut inrim in 
torino serv a the refer site. the height differ between 
the two site be approxim 1,000 m, correspond to a fraction 
redshift of about 10–13. from a geodet point of view, lsm be an 
interest locat at which to make such measurements: first it 
be locat in the middl of the 13 km long fréju road tunnel (rock 
coverag 1,700 m), and second the area exhibit long-term land 
uplift (alpin orogeny) accompani by a secular graviti potenti 
variation. furthermore, lsm lack the metrolog infrastructur 
to independ valid compon of the clock and the envi- 
ronment control on which the oper of optic clock usual 
relies. the air temperatur be high (∼ 26 °c), with fluctuat of 
sever kelvin at the transport clock, and the humid be veri 
low. work hour be also sever restrict for safeti reasons, 
a problem that be further compound dure our measur 
campaign by interrupt due to blast caus by construct of 
a new tunnel nearby. even without thi addit sourc of seis- 
mic noise, the acoust nois level in the laboratori be high. the 
select locat thu constitut a challeng but realist testb 
with practic relevance. 

the transport 87sr lattic clock be (compar with laboratori 
clocks) design to be compact, with robust optic parts12. the 
physic packag be less than 0.6 m3 in size, and we use laser bread- 
board with mechan stress-resist fibr couplers21. all com- 
ponent except the refer caviti of the interrog laser be 
rigidli mount in a car trailer (size 2.2 m × 3 m × 2.2 m), and vibra- 
tion isol be provid by rubber dampers. the trailer interior be 
temperatur stabilized, while the small volum of the trailer hinder 
air exchang and gener hot spot with more than 10 K tempera- 
ture rise. however, the optic and the physic packag be place 
apart and shield from these and be stabl to within 0.4 K after an 
initi temperatur rise of about 1 K. the transport ultrast 
refer caviti for the clock interrog laser be rigidli mount 
to endur transport12. It be place next to the trailer to avoid it 
perform be degrad by vibrat induc in the trailer’ 
air condit system. the vibrat amplitud in the trailer be a 
factor of ten larg than under typic laboratori conditions, lead 
to a correspond increas in clock instability. A refer reso- 
nator with low acceler sensit or an activ feed-forward 
system may in the futur remedi thi inconvenience22.

the Sr clock be oper in both locations, lsm and inrim, to 

elimin the need for a priori knowledg of the clock’ frequency. 
A schemat outlin of the experi be give in fig. 1. lsm and 
inrim be connect by a 150 km noise-compens optic 
fibr link (see methods). At lsm, a transport frequenc comb 
measur the optic frequenc ratio between a laser reson with 
the Sr clock transit at 698 nm and 1.542 µ m radiat from an 
ultrast link laser transmit from inrim. In thi way, the fre- 
quenci of the optic clock at lsm could be directli relat to the 
frequenc of the link laser even without a highli accur absolut 
frequenc reference. In addit to the optic carrier, the fibr link 
be use to dissemin a 100 mhz radiofrequ refer sig- 
nal from inrim for the frequenc comb, frequenc counter and 
acousto-opt modul at lsm (see methods). At inrim, a cryo- 
genic Cs fountain clock23 and a 171yb optic lattic clock15 serv a 
references. the connect between the clock at inrim and the 
link laser be provid by a second frequenc comb. 

ten day after arriv at lsm in earli februari 2016, the first 
spectrum of motion sideband on the 1s0–3p0 clock transit be 
record from the 87sr transport clock, mark the point at 
which a recharacter of the clock could begin. thi set-up 
time includ gener logistics, power and thermal of the 
equipment, instal of refer frequenc equipment, realign- 
ment of optic fibr couplings, individu test of all subcompo- 
nent and magnet field compens for load the atom into 
the lattice. the oper of the lattic clock (see methods) be 
similar to the procedur describ in previou works12. 

the transport clock oper less reliabl in the environ- 
mental condit at lsm than in initi test at ptb befor trans- 
port. vibrat caus by the tunnel blast mention earli lead 
to degrad of the light deliveri for the first cool stage of the 
magneto-opt trap (mot; see methods), which in turn lead to 
interrupt due to insuffici atom number. the low-humid 

environ also hamper the air condit in the trailer, caus- 
ing the ti:sapphir laser use to creat the optic lattic to overheat, 
further shorten the clock oper period and thu the evalu- 
ation of some contribut to the clock uncertainti budget. the 
blackbodi radiat (bbr) shift be still control to the level of 
3 × 10−17. for these reasons, dure the alloc time in the tun- 
nel simultan oper be achiev onli with the primari Cs 
fountain clock at inrim and not with the high-stabl Yb lattic 
clock. although the Yb lattic clock at inrim oper reliabl for 
the major of the time, the commerci lattic laser for the clock 
fail just befor the character of the transport clock have 
be completed. with the transport clock oper for 2.8 h 
over two day at the end of the lsm campaign in mid-march 2016, 
the instabl of the fountain clock (2.2 × 10−13 τ−1/2, where τ be give 
in seconds) pose a limit on the uncertainti of the frequenc 
measurement. We therefor appli a hydrogen maser a a flywheel24 
to reduc the statist uncertainti of the measurement: the maser’ 
frequenc be rapidli and accur calibr by the optic clock, 
and due to the frequenc stabil of the maser thi calibr be 
valid for longer period of time. thi make it possibl to extend 
the averag time to 48 h (see methods), lead to an uncertainti 
of 17 × 10−16 associ with the measur time. with system- 
atic uncertainti of the Sr and Cs clock of 2.6 × 10−16 and 3 × 10−16 
respect (see tabl 1, method and ref. 23), the frequenc of 
the Sr lattic clock at lsm be measur by the fountain clock at 
inrim with an uncertainti of 18 × 10−16 (see fig. 1). 

As note earlier, an initi frequenc comparison at a common 
graviti potenti be requir to transform a gener frequenc mea- 
surement or clock comparison into a chronometr level mea- 
surement. for thi reason, the Sr apparatu be move to inrim in 
april 2016 for local clock comparisons. there, it be directli link 
to the inrim frequenc comb. In the process, small upgrad 
be make to the set-up for the cool light distribut and the

fig. 1 | schemat represent of the measur campaign. a, for chronometr levelling, the transport 87sr optic lattic clock be place in 
the lsm underground laboratori close to the france–itali border in the fréju tunnel (top left). the clock be connect by a noise-compens fibr 
link (length 150 km) to the italian nation metrolog institut inrim in torino (red line). there, a primari Cs fountain clock and a 171yb optic lattic 
clock be oper (right). At both sites, frequenc comb be use to relat the frequenc of the 1s0–3p0 optic clock transit and the 1.5 µ m laser

thermal manag in the car trailer. with these changes, the 
avail of the Sr clock be improv significantly, allow for 
sever hour of data take per day after the initi set-up phase 
be completed. with systemat uncertainti compar to the 
first campaign and a fountain instabl of 3.6 × 10−13 τ−1/2, the total 
uncertainti be reduc by a factor of two to 9 × 10−16 (see method 
for Sr transit frequencies). In thi chronometr level dem- 
onstration, we resolv a relativist redshift of the optic lattic 
clock of 47.92(83) Hz (fig. 1), from which we infer a potenti dif- 
ferenc of 10,034(174) m2 s−2 (the number in the parenthesi be 
the 1σ uncertainti refer to the correspond last digit of the 
quot results.). thi be in excel agreement with the valu of 
10,032.1(16) m2 s−2 determin independ by geodet mean 
(see methods). though our result do not yet challeng the clas- 
sical geodet approach in accuracy, it be the first demonstr of 
chronometr level use a transport optic clock. 

with the increas reliabl of the transport Sr clock, we 
be also abl to measur it optic frequenc ratio R with the 
Yb lattic clock15 oper on the 1s0–3p0 transit at 578 nm. 
In total, 31,000 s of common oper of the two optic clock 
and the frequenc comb be achiev over a period of 7 days. 
thi optical–opt comparison (fig. 2) show much high sta- 
biliti than the optical–microwav one. consequently, the optic 
frequenc ratio measur be limit by the systemat uncer- 
tainti of the clock (tabl 1), rather than by their instability. thi 
demonstr the key advantag of optic frequenc standards: 
they be abl to achiev excel uncertainti in short averag- 
ing time even though they may oper less reliabl than their 
microwav counterparts. 

the 171yb/87sr frequenc ratio measur on differ day be 
summar in fig. 3, which also show previou measur of 
thi ratio. after averag (see methods), we determin the ratio to 
be R = νyb/ νsr = 1.207,507,039,343,338,41(34). independ mea- 
surement of particular optic frequenc ratio be import to 
check the consist of optic clock worldwide25, and be key to 
establish more accur represent of the second26 a pro- 
vide by the intern committe for weight and measur 
(cipm) a a step toward a futur redefinit of the second. To 
our knowledge, thi be the onli optic frequenc ratio that have 
be measur directli by three independ research groups27–29; 

however, our measur differ from the most accur pre- 
viou measur by two standard deviat (fig. 3), and the 
origin of thi differ will requir further investig by the 
research group concerned.

note that, even with the onli slightli improv transport Sr 
apparatu a use at inrim, chronometr level against the Yb 
lattic clock with consider improv resolut would be pos- 
sible. We expect that the transport clock with improv reli- 
abil will be abl to achiev an uncertainti of 1 × 10−17 before, for 
example, bbr-relat uncertainti pose a limit to the pres- 
ent set-up. instabl of 1 × 10–15 τ–1/2 be realist with the cur- 
rent interrog laser; low instabl will requir an improv 
refer cavity. the uncertainti will enabl height differ of 
10 cm to be resolved, which be a relev magnitud for geodesi in 
region such a islands, which be hard to access use convent 
geodet approaches. As metrolog fibr link becom more 
common, chronometr level along their paths30 will becom a 
realist prospect.

method 
oper of lattic clocks. the realiz and oper of the 171yb (I = 1/2) 
and 87sr (I = 9/2) clock be veri similar and have be present in detail12, 15,21. 
ytterbium and strontium atom be cool to microkelvin temperatur in two- 
stage mots, exploit the strong 1s0–1p1 and weaker 1s0–3p1 transit (at 399 nm 
and 556 nm for Yb and 461 nm and 689 nm for sr, respectively). the atom be then 
trap in one-dimension optic lattic oper at the magic wavelengths31 
λybmag ≈ 759 nm and λsrmagic ≈ 813 nm, which to first order give a zero differenti 
light shift between the 1s0 and 3p0 states. 

finally, the atom be prepar for spectroscopi in a singl magnet sublevel 
mf by optic pumping. As a result, shift due to cold collis and line pull be 
reduced. the two π transit from the mf = ± 1/2 sublevel in Yb (mf = ± 9/2 
in sr) be probe altern at approxim halfwidth detun so that the 
interrog laser be lock to their averag transit frequency. thi effect 
remov the linear zeeman shift. 

uncertainti of lattic clocks. here, we discu the most import uncertainti 
contribut list in tabl 1. more detail of the method use to evalu these 
uncertainti be give in ref 15,24 and 12. 

lattic light shifts. the lattic of the Yb clock be oper at νl = 394,798.238 ghz 
with a trap depth U0 = 196(4)er (er be the lattic recoil energy) and an atom 
temperatur of 7(3) µ K a determin by sideband spectroscopy32. We measur 
the linear shift near the magic wavelength while the non-linear induc lattic light 
shift can be calcul use data from ref. 27. 

for the Sr lattic clock, the typic lattic depth be about 100er a measur 
from sideband spectra32. these also yield an atom temperatur of about 3.5 µ K. 
the light-shift cancel frequenc be determin earlier; a refer reson 
serv a a wavelength refer dure the experi discuss here. the 
uncertainti of the linear lattic light shift allow for a possibl reson frequenc 
chang of 50 mhz caus by vibrat and shock dure transport and chang 
due to potenti variat of the scalar and tensor light shift caus by geometr 
chang or chang of the environment magnet field33. without transport, the 
reson frequenc stay stabl within 1 mhz for weeks, but relax dure 
transport cannot be excluded. In futur measur campaigns, a determin 
of the light-shift cancel wavelength will be make at the site of measurement. 
higher-ord light shift be calcul use the coeffici in the same 
reference. As a check, three of the measur in fig. 2 be perform with a 
deeper lattic of about 160er, which result in uncertainti for the linear lattic 
light shift and higher-ord shift of 29 × 10−17 and 1 × 10−17, respectively. No 
signific variat of the measur frequenc ratio R be observed. 

densiti shift. the densiti shift be evalu in both lattic clock by vari the 
interrog atom number. correct for chang of the atom temperatur have 
be appli for the Sr clock. the low uncertainti of the densiti shift at lsm be due 
to the low atom number and thu densiti with which the clock be oper there. 

bbr shift. the influenc of bbr on the clock frequenc have be discuss 
elsewhere3,4,34–36. temperatur of the atom environ be measur with 
calibr platinum resist thermometers. the uncertainti of the bbr shift be 
mostli relat to temperatur inhomogeneity. the repres temperatur and 
it uncertainti be deriv from the extrem temperatur found on the apparatu 
(the atom oven be treat separately12,15) follow the procedur describ in 
ref. 37 for a rectangular probabl distribution. the differ between the bbr 
correct at lsm and inrim be caus by differ temperatur insid the 
trailer, a thi temperatur depend slightli on the outsid temperature. 

other uncertainties. the uncertainti of servo error, second-ord zeeman shift 
and line pull be reduc at inrim by adjust of experiment parameters, 
which be possibl due to the more reliabl operation. 

h-maser a flywheel. A flywheel oscil with good stabil and high reliability, 
such a an h-maser, can be use to extend the averag time between a less reliabl 
system such a our Sr lattic clock and a Cs primari clock with low stability24. 
the frequenc ratio νsr/νc be thu determin from the frequenc ratio νsr/νh 
and νh/νc use dataset with differ lengths. the nois of the flywheel result in 
differ averag frequenc for these two intervals, but the addit uncertainti 
can be calculated24 if the nois be well characterized, a it often be for masers. the 
calcul reli on parseval’ theorem, and us the nois spectrum of the maser 
togeth with the fourier transform of a weight function that repres the two 
averag intervals. for the full measurement-rel uncertainty, thi extrapol 
uncertainti be combin with the statist uncertainti of the maser calibr 
by the optic clock and the maser–c clock ratio over the extend interval. We 
model the maser nois by a superposit of flicker phase nois 6 × 10−14 τ−1 
(1 × 10−13 τ−1), white frequenc nois 5 × 10−14 τ−1/2 (4.5 × 10−14 τ−1/2) and a flicker 
nois 1.7 × 10−15 (1 × 10−15) in march (may) 2016, respectively. 

graviti potenti determination. To provid an accur refer for the 
chronometr levelling, a state-of-the-art determin of the graviti (gravit 

plu centrifugal) potenti be performed, target the best possibl uncertainti 
for each clock site. spatial variat of the graviti potenti be most important; 
correspond tempor variat (mainli due to solid earth and ocean tides) be 
below 0.07 m2 s−2 for the potenti differ between inrim and lsm38. 

the static (spatial varying) graviti potenti or correspond potenti 
differ can be determin by two classic geodet methods39. the first be 
geometr level (togeth with graviti observ along the level path). 
the second (the so-cal gnss/geoid approach) us gnss posit (ellipsoid 
heights) and the result from graviti field modelling, that is, a high-resolut 
(quasi)geoid model base on terrestri and satellit graviti data. both method 
can be formul in term of either potenti or height quantities. In the follow 
discussion, metric unit base on height be gener prefer for simplicity, but 
correspond potenti valu can easili be obtain by multipli the height 
valu by an averag graviti valu (e.g. 9.81 m s–2). geometr level be accur 
at the millimetr level over short distances40, but a a differenti techniqu it can 
deliv onli potenti differ and be suscept to systemat errors, which may 
accumul to the few-decimetr level over continent distances. On the other 
hand, the gnss/geoid approach can deliv absolut potenti values; in thi case 
the uncertainti depend mainli on the qualiti of the region (quasi)geoid models, 
but the uncertainti of the gnss posit also have to be considered. 

new graviti measur be make around the clock site at inrim 
and lsm to improv the reliabl and uncertainti of the geopotenti field 
modelling. these measur includ spot check of the larg histor 
graviti databas (consist check), and the addit of new observ in 
area so far void of graviti data (coverag improvement). separ graviti survey 
be carri out around inrim and lsm, result in 36 and 123 new graviti 
points, respectively. the graviti survey includ one absolut graviti observ 
at inrim and anoth at lsm, while the remain point be observ with 
rel graviti meter (rel to the establish absolut points), with 11 graviti 
point be locat insid the fréju tunnel. map give an overview of the 
distribut of graviti observ be give on the itoc project page41. 
these new graviti observ a well a some other graviti updat 
(e.g. for germany) be integr into the terrestri graviti database, 
the start point be the version use to comput the previou european 
gravimetr (quasi)geoid, egg200816. A consist check between the new 
and exist graviti measur show no signific differ between 
the two data sets, confirm the qualiti of the entir database. however, 
a re-evalu of the combin data-set reveal some old station with 
obvious wrong positions, mainli locat in france; these station lie offroad 
and show larg discrep between station and digit elev model heights, 
and be therefor exclud from the (quasi)geoid computation. 

A new (quasi)geoid model, egg2015, be comput in a similar way to 
the previou egg2008 model, use the remove–compute–restor procedur 
and the spectral combin approach, combin a global long-wavelength 
satellit graviti model with high-resolut terrestri graviti and terrain data16. 
In addit to the new graviti measurements, enhanc includ the use of 
a fifth-gener goce global geopotenti model (goco05s)42 and a spectral 
weight scheme adapt to the goce model. the larg differ between 
the egg2015 and egg2008 input graviti valu be about 3.5 × 10−4 m s−2; for the 
output (quasi)geoid grid the larg differ be about 0.15 m. By far the larg 
differ be around the lsm site; they result from the new observ in area 
previous void of graviti data and from the remov of gross error relat to some 
point in franc with incorrect positions16. however, the maximum (quasi)geoid 
chang at the two clock site be less than 0.03 m. the uncertainti of egg2015 
be estim in the same way a for egg2008, result in a standard deviat 
of 2 cm, which hold for area with a good coverag and qualiti of the terrestri 
graviti field data, such a around inrim (best-cas scenario). however, around 
lsm the remain data gap in inaccess area and the strong spatial graviti 
field variat caus by the high mountain lead to a high uncertainti 
estim of about 4 cm. 

the final relativist redshift correct for the inrim/lsm clock comparison 
be deriv by the gnss/geoid approach, although geometr level and 
graviti measur be use to transfer the graviti potenti from the near 
gnss station to the refer marker adjac to the clock at inrim and 
lsm. the gnss/geoid approach be chosen becaus the level data for itali 
be rather old and do not includ graviti corrections43, and becaus the gnss/ 
geoid approach be not affect by systemat level errors. thi result in 
a graviti potenti differ of 10,029.7(6) m2 s−2 between the two refer 
markers, and 10,032.1(16)m2 s−2 between the actual clock posit at lsm and 
inrim, respectively. the final uncertainti of the graviti potenti differ 
between the refer marker near to the two clock posit (about 6 cm in 
term of height) includ contribut from the (quasi)geoid in the alpin region 
(approxim 5 cm, neglect correlations16), the gnss posit (1–2 cm) 
and the level connect (< 1 cm, mainli from the tunnel portal to lsm). 
the larg uncertainti for the actual clock posit be because, for conveni 
and in view of the uncertainti of the chronometr level experiment, the 
height differ between the clock locat and the correspond 
refer marker (less than 10 m apart) be determin use a simpl 
spirit level rather than by geodet levelling.

inrim–lsm frequenc transfer. the remot clock comparison be perform by 
compar the frequenc of a link laser at 1,542.14 nm, sent from inrim to lsm 
by a telecom optic fibre, with the frequenc of the clock oper in the two 
locations. two fibr frequenc comb span the spectral gap between the link 
laser and the clock interrog lasers. the comb employ the transfer oscil 
principle44, make the measur of the optic frequenc ratio immun to 
the frequenc nois of the combs. the frequenc of the link laser be stabil 
use a high-finess cavity, whose long-term drift be remov by a loos phase-lock 
to a h-maser via a fibr frequenc comb. As a result, the beat note with the comb 
remain within a small frequenc interval, facilit long-term oper and 
reduc potenti error aris from ani counter de-synchron between 
inrim and lsm17. 

the link laser use a multiplex channel in the telecom fibre. it path be 
equip with two dedic bidirect erbium-dop fibr amplifi that allow 
a phase stabl signal to be gener at lsm through the doppler nois cancel 
technique17,18. the contribut of fibr frequenc transfer to the total fraction 
uncertainti be assess to be 3 × 10–19 by loop back the signal from lsm use 
a parallel fibre. the occasion occurr of cycl slip be detect by redund 
count of the beat note at inrim. At lsm, the signal be regener by a diod 
laser phase lock to the incom radiat with a signal-to-nois ratio great than 
30 dB at 100 khz bandwidth; thi ensur robust and cycle-slip-fre operation. 

In addit to the optic reference, a high-qual radiofrequ signal 
be need at lsm to oper the Sr clock apparatu (frequenc shifter and 
counters) and the frequenc comb. given the imposs of have a gnss- 
dissemin signal in the underground laboratory, a 100 mhz radiofrequ 
signal be deliv there by amplitud modul of a second 1.5 µ m laser that 
be transmit through an optic fibr parallel to the first. At lsm, the amplitud 
modul be detect on a fast photodiode, amplifi and regener by an 
oven-control quartz oscil at 10 mhz to improv the signal-to-nois ratio. 
the inher stabil of the free-run fibr link be in thi case enough to deliv 
the radiofrequ signal with a long-term instabl and uncertainti small 
than 10-13. thi result uncertainti contribut to the optic frequenc ratio 
measur be below 1 × 10–19. 

averag of the optic frequenc ratio data. We make eight differ optic 
frequenc ratio measur with a total measur time of 15 h over a 
period of one week in may 2016 (fig. 3). the data acquir on differ day have 
differ statist and systemat uncertainties. We appli a statist analysi 
that consid the correl between the measur from the differ 
systemat shift where the covari matrix of the eight daili measur be 
use to calcul a gener least squar fit for the average25,45. We regard 
the systemat uncertainti of the clock (tabl 1) a fulli correlated, while the 
statist relat to the measur durat be uncorrelated. 

absolut frequenc of the Sr lattic clock. the chronometr level can 
be view from an altern perspective: If we assum that the convent 
measur of the graviti potenti differ be correct then we can deduc an 
averag absolut frequenc valu of 429,228,004,229,873.13(40) Hz for the Sr lattic 
clock. the accuraci of the absolut frequenc measur achiev with the 
transport clock be compar to sever recent measur with laboratori 
systems24,46–61. 

averag the previous publish valu give a frequenc of 
429,228,004,229,873.05(05) hz. togeth with the averag Yb clock transit 
frequenc of 518,295,836,590,863.75(25) Hz deriv from other references15,62–66, 
a yb/sr frequenc ratio of 1.207,507,039,343,337,97(61) can be calcul (fig. 3). 
thi averag assum that there be no correl between the differ 
measurements.
