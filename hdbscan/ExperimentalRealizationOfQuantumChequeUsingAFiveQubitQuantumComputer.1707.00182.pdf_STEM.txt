I. introduct 

We make use of the free web base interface, ibm 
quantum experi (ibm qe) [1], to experiment 
demonstr the quantum chequ transaction, propos 
by roy moulick and panigrahi [2]. python applic 
program interfac (api) and softwar develop 
kit (sdk) [3], have enabl easi write of code 
and run them on quantum processors. with fast 
access to the result of an experiment, the ibm QE 
user can commun and discu result with ibm 
research and other users. ibm QE permit a 
user easy-connect to thi cloud [4] base 5-qubit 
quantum computer, use which a number of quantum 
algorithm [5–8] and quantum comput task [9] 
have alreadi be performed. test of leggett-garg [10] 
and mermin inequ [11], quantum teleport of 
an unknown singl qubit [12] and two qubit state [13] 
have be reported. entangl assist invari 
[14], non-abelian braid of surfac code deffect [15], 
and entrop uncertainti and measur revers 
[16] have be illustrated. A comparison between 
two architectur for quantum comput [17] and 
non-destruct discrimin of bell state [18] have 
also be experiment performed. here, we explic 
experiment realiz of quantum chequ transact 
by implement the scheme on ibm interfac and find 
the accuraci of quantum state prepar through 
quantum state tomography. 
establish long distanc quantum commun

a an altern for e-pay gateway in the field of 
e-commerce. It can also be consid a the quantum 
analog of the process of electron data interchang 
(edi) [21]. recently, practic unforg quantum 
money have be experiment verifi [22, 23]. the 
experiment demonstr therefor pave the way for 
design of the physic devic for thi purpose. In 
thi scheme, effici transact can be perform by 
store quantum state in comput or smart cards, 
equip with quantum memori [24, 25]. however, 
without quantum memory, the transact can be 
stream over the quantum internet [26, 27] or the 
protocol can be run in real time, with the account 
holder physic go to the bank, collect a quantum 
chequ book, and then prepar a quantum chequ 
and issu to a vendor. the vendor commun the 
quantum chequ to the bank and withdraw money after 
a success verif of the cheque. 
the paper be organ a follows. section II describ 

the implement of quantum gate e.g., cnot and 
fredkin gate in order to design quantum circuit for 
experiment realiz of quantum cheque. section iii 
explic the concept of a quantum cheque, follow 
which, the implement be show on ibm interface. 
section V demonstr the accuraci of implement 
by perform quantum state tomography. finally, in 
section vi, we conclud by summar our work and 
point out the futur direct for further work. 

ii. design gate and some 
protocol ON ibm QE 

for the implement of a quantum cheque, one 
requir hadamard (h), cnot gate, the pauli gate (x, 
Y and Z) and phase gate (s, s†, T and T †). combin 
some of these gates, a fredkin gate can be constructed, 
which be use for the verif purpos of a quantum

cheque. It be to be note that, cnot gate be not 
access to all five qubit on the interfac of ibm, 
becaus of certain restrict on the qubits. protocol-i, 
depict in figur 1, be use to construct cnot gate 
in ani order between two qubits. similarly, protocol-ii, 
depict in figur 2, be use to swap ani two qubit on 
ibm interface. 

fig. 1. protocol-i. two equival quantum circuit 
show implement of cnot gate in ani order between 
two qubit on ibm interface. 

fig. 2. protocol-ii. posit of three cnot gate for 
qubit swapping. 

iii. quantum chequ 

A quantum chequ scheme be compos of three 
algorithms, gen, sign and verify. gen algorithm 
produc a “chequ book” and a key for the customer, 
who issu a cheque. sign algorithm creat a quantum 
chequ state, qc, and verifi algorithm check the 
valid of a cheque. A quantum chequ have mainli 
three properties, verifiability, i.e., it can be verifi by 
a bank’ main branch or ani of it act branches, 
non-repudiation, i.e, after issu a cheque, a custom 
must not be abl to disclaim it, and unforgeability, i.e., 
a quantum chequ can not be fabric or it can not be 
reused. 

A. the quantum chequ scheme 

the quantum chequ scheme can be describ by 
consid three parties, alice, bob and bank. here, 
the bank be denot a the main branch, which can 
have sever branch secur connect by a classic 
channel. In thi protocol, onli alic and bank be 
consid to be trust parties, and not necessarili the 
branches. after a chequ be issu by alice, bob go to 
bank or ani of it branch to withdraw money. 
the follow three scheme be follow for a 

success quantum chequ transaction. 
1. gen algorithm: initially, a share key, k, be 

prepar by alic and the bank. then alic give her 

public key, pk, to the bank and collect her privat key, 
sk. 
the bank prepar a set of m number of ghz states,

where 1 ≤ i ≤ m, along with the respect uniqu 
serial number s ∈ {0, 1}n. from everi ghz entangl 
state, the bank give two qubits, name |φ〉a1 and 
|φ〉a2 , and the serial number to alice, while keep the 
third qubit, |φ〉b , and other information, secretli in a 
database. 
here, {|φ(i)〉ghz}i=1:m stand for 
{|φ(1)〉ghz , |φ 

(2)〉ghz , . . . , |φ 
(m)〉ghz}. 

At the end, alic poss 
(id, pk, sk, k, s, {|φ(i)〉a1 , |φ 

(i)〉a2}i=1:m), and the bank 
carri (id, pk, k, s, {|φ(i)〉b}i=1:m). 
2. sign algorithm: alic prepar a random number 

by use a random number gener procedure, r ← 
u{0,1}l to sign a chequ of amount M and creat a 
n-qubit state by use the follow one way function 
[28], 

|ψalice〉 = f(k||id||r||m), 

where, k and id, be respect the secret key and 
the ident of alice. the symbol ‘||’ concaten two 
bit strings. 

alic also prepar m state {|ψ 
(i) 
M 〉}i=1:m 

correspond to the amount M, use the one way 
function g : {0, 1}∗ × |0〉 → |ψ〉, a 

|ψ 
(i) 
M 〉 = g(r||m ||i). 

subsequently, alic encod [29] |ψ 
(i) 
M 〉 with the 

entangl qubit, |φ(i)〉a1 after which she perform a bell 
measur on her first two qubit a show in figur 
3. 
the state of the four qubit entangl system can be 

write in the follow form,

} 

(2) 

where |ψ+〉, |ψ−〉, |φ+〉, and |φ−〉 denot four bell 
states. 
now, alic appli an appropri pauli gate oper 

on her qubit |φ(i)〉a2 , accord to the bell state 
measur outcomes:

|ψ+〉 → I |ψ−〉 → Z 
|φ+〉 → X |φ−〉 → Y 

figur 3 depict the encod procedur of quantum 
cheque, which be to be repeat m times. 
alic then us sign algorithm to sign the serial number 

s a σ ← signsk(s), and gener a quantum chequ 

QC = (id, s, r, σ,m, {|φ(i)〉a2}i=1:m, |ψalice〉) 

for bob to encash. 

fig. 3. depict the quantum circuit use to gener a 
quantum chequ state. 

fig. 4. quantum circuit for perform swap test on the two 
state |ψ〉 and |ψ′〉. 

swap test: the swap test be depict in figur 
4, where the measur of ancilla (first qubit) on a 
comput basi yield zero if the two state |ψ〉 
and |ψ′〉 be equal. In thi case, swap test be say to 
be successful. however, if the two state be different, 
then the measur of ancilla yield both |0〉 and |1〉 
each associ with some probability. for 〈ψ|ψ′〉 ≥ λ, 

the swap test be success with probabl 1+λ 
2 

2 , and 

unsuccess with probabl 1−λ 
2 

2 . It be evid that, 
for the same input states, the swap test be success with 
probabl 1 and for differ outputs, it be success 
with probabl less than 1. the effici of thi test 
can be amplifi by repeat it a larg number of times. 
3. verifi algorithm: In the verif process, 

bob produc the quantum chequ QC at ani of the 
act branch of the bank. the branch commun 
with the bank (main branch) to check the valid 
of the (id, s) pair, and a verif be run by use 
V rfypk(σ, s). As describ below, the bank proce 
with the verif process if it find (id, s) and σ to be 
valid, otherwis cancel the quantum chequ transaction. 
the bank then measur it qubit, |φb〉 in hadamard 

basi to get |+〉 or |−〉 a output and convey the result 

to the act branch. the branch appli the appropri 
pauli gate oper on |φ(i)〉a2 to retriev the unknown 

state |ψ 
(i) 
M 〉. 

|+〉 → I |−〉 → Z 

A similar procedur be follow m time to get m 

unknown state {|ψ 
(i) 
M 〉}i=1:m. the bank gener 

|ψ′alice〉 = f(k||id||r||m), and {|ψ 
,(i) 
M 〉}i=1:m = 

{g(r||m ||i)}i=1:m by use these one way functions, and 
then perform a swap test on m + 1 set of states, 

{|ψalice〉, |ψ 
′ 
alice〉}, and {|ψ 

(i) 
M 〉, |ψ 

,(i) 
M 〉}i=1:m. 

the chequ be accept if the swap test be successful, 

i.e., if 〈ψalice|ψ 
′ 
alice〉 ≥ λ1 and {〈ψ 

(i) 
M |ψ 

,(i) 
M 〉 ≥ λ2}i=1:m, 

where λ1 and λ2 be constant fix by the bank. else, 
the branch termin the transaction. 

iv. implement OF quantum 
chequ AT ibm QE 

fig. 5. ibm quantum circuit use to gener the quantum 
chequ state. 

the ibm quantum circuit for gener a quantum 
chequ state have be depict in figur 5. It be 
equival to the quantum circuit show in figur 
3. though, these two figur appear to be different, 
their equival can be check by use protocol-i, 
protocol-ii and the concept of optim of circuit. In 
figur 5, the first three qubit be in possess of alice, 
the bank contain the fifth qubit, and the fourth qubit 
remain unused. alic us one of her entangl qubit 
(2nd qubit), |φ(i)〉a1 , provid by bank, to encod the 

unknown state |ψ 
(i) 
M 〉. here, thi unknown state can not 

be gener by use the one way function, “g” (section 
iii), sinc we model onli the quantum aspect and for 
simplic onli assum the g spit out a descript of the 
follow state, that be know to the prepar devic 
but unknown to anybodi els a [12], 

|ψ 
(i) 
M 〉 = cos(π/8)|0〉+ sin(π/8)|1〉 (3) 

It can be comput by oper H, T, H and S gate 
sequenti on |0〉. As thi state be now split between 
alice’ qubit (3rd qubit) and bank’ qubit (5th qubit), 
measur the 3rd qubit in comput basis, it be 
expect to have |0〉 with probabl ≈ 0.85 and |1〉

tabl I. the tabl show the result of the outcom of 
the quantum chequ state, depict in figur 5, measur in 
comput basis. the result be obtain by both run 
and simul the experi with 1024, 4096 and 8192 
number of shots. 

for quantum chequ gener 
number of shot probabl of |0〉 probabl of |1〉

with probabl ≈ 0.15. the experiment result be 
tabul in tabl I. 

the encod procedur (a describ in section iii) 
should be do m time by use m similar quantum 
circuit (figur 5). through the ibm cloud, it be not 
possibl to creat n-qubit quantum state by use a one 
way function, “f” (section iii). so, we have take two 
initi state |0〉, and |0〉 for comparison test. 

fig. 6. ibm quantum circuit use to verifi the quantum 
cheque. It be to be note that a set of two state be to be 
take on the second and the third qubit of the abov circuit 
for check swap test. 

the quantum circuit implement on ibm interface, 
for quantum chequ verification, be illustr in figur 
6, which be equival to the circuit show in figur 4. In 
thi case, both the initi state (2nd qubit and 3rd qubit) 
be take as, |0〉. (see figur 6). It be expect to have |0〉 
with probabl 1, after measur the ancilla qubit (1st 
qubit) in comput basis. the experiment result 
be illustr in tabl ii. 

compar run result and simul result, show in 
tabl I and ii, run result be found to be less accur 
than the simul result. It be evid that applic 
of a larg number of gate increas decoher of 
a quantum state and produc more nois in the 
system. decoher and nois due to gate be the 
key disadvantag for realiz the implement of a 
quantum chequ with exact accuracy. 

tabl ii. tabl provid inform about the ancilla 
state, depict in figur 6, when it be measur in 
comput basis. the experi have be perform with 
1024, 4096 and 8192 number of shots. both run and simul 
result be illustrated.

V. quantum state tomographi 

We now proceed to carri out state tomographi to 
check how well, the quantum state be prepar in our 
experiment. We mainli consid two states, quantum 
chequ state (|φ(i)〉a2), which be to be store in the 
quantum cheque, and ancilla state, use in swap test 
(see section iii). In thi process, by compar both 
the theoret and experiment densiti matrix of a 
quantum state, the accuraci of implement can be 
tested. 
state tomographi can be explain through a singl 

qubit quantum state, |ψ〉 = α|0〉+ β|1〉. the theoret 
and experiment densiti matrix of the give state be 
give by equat 4 and 5 respectively. 

ρT = |ψ〉〈ψ|, (4) 

and 

ρE = 
1 

2 
(I + 〈x〉x + 〈Y 〉Y + 〈z〉z) (5) 

here, 〈o〉 = tr(|ψ〉〈ψ|o), where O = X, Y, and 
Z. thi expect valu can be obtain by rotat 
the quantum state along O axi and then measur in 
comput basis. thi can be evalu as, 〈o〉 = 
p(0)-p(1), where p(0) and p(1) be the probabl of 
outcom 0 and 1 respectively. 
the theoret (ρtx , ) and experiment (ρ

densiti matrix (both for run result and simul 
result) of quantum chequ state (x = q) and ancilla state

It be to be note that the abov experiment densiti 
matrix be calcul for run and simul the 
experi 8192 times. for other number of shot (1024 
and 4096), similar procedur can be appli to obtain the 
correspond densiti matrices. As mention in section 
iv, by compar the run, simul and theoret 
densiti matrices, it can be conclud that, the simul 
result provid more accur information, about the 
quantum state, a compar to the run results, which 
be alreadi mention in section iv. 

vi. conclus 

To conclude, here, we have demonstr an 
experiment procedur of quantum chequ transact 
in a quantum network environment. fredkin gate 
have be constructed, by use singl qubit and cnot

accuraci of the implementation. It be observ that the 
quantum chequ transact have be carri out with 
good fidelity.
