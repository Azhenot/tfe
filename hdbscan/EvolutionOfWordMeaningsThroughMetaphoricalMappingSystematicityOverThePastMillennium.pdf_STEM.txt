one way that languag be abl to commun a potenti infinit set of idea through 
a finit lexicon be by compress emerg mean into words, such that over time, indi- 
vidual word come to express multiple, relat sen of meaning. We propos that over- 
arch commun and cognit pressur have creat systemat direction in 
how new metaphor sen have develop from exist word sen over the histori 
of english. given a larg set of pair of semant domains, we use comput model 
to test which domain have be more commonli the start point (sourc domains) and 
which the end point (target domains) of metaphor map over the past millen- 
nium. We found that a compact set of variables, includ externality, embodiment, and 
valence, explain direction in the major of about 5000 metaphor map 
record over the past 1100 years. these result provid the first large-scal histor evi- 
denc that metaphor map be systematic, and driven by measur commun 
and cognit principles.

1. introduct 

everi natur languag face the challeng of have to express a potenti infinit rang of idea through a finit set of 
word (cf. von humboldt, 1836; chomsky, 1957; pustejovsky, 1995). one way in which languag meet the challeng of 
maintain a compact lexicon be by compress emerging, yet to be lexic ideas, into exist word forms. the most 
common form of compress in the lexicon, both in english and in other languages, be polysemy: case where a singl word 
have multiple, relat sen (e.g., breal, 1897; brugman, 1988; geeraerts, 1997; lakoff & johnson, 1980; pustejovsky, 1995; 
srinivasan & rabagliati, 2015; sweetser, 1991). one promin mechan that gener polysemi over the cours of his- 
tori be metaphor map (e.g., lakoff & johnson, 1980), wherebi new word mean be creat by map an exist 
sens of a word from it own sourc domain to anoth target domain, base on structur similar between the domains. 
for example, the english word grasp origin convey a physic action (source), a in ‘‘grasp a fruit,” and be late 
extend to express an abstract sens of understand (target), a in ‘‘grasp an idea,” thu constru idea a object 
that can be held and controlled. In the present study, we test whether there be systemat direction in how newmetaphor- 
ical sen have develop over the histori of english. that is, give a pair of semant domains, can we predict which 
s.

domain serv histor a the sourc and which a the target of metaphor mapping, base on consider of 
broader commun and cognit pressures? 

consist with the idea that metaphor sens extens be systematic, prior research (e.g., lakoff & johnson, 1980; 
sweetser, 1991) have suggest that map between semant domain tend to be asymmetric: they occur in one direct 
but not the other (e.g., for grasp, it be ‘‘action”?‘‘knowledge” but not ‘‘knowledge”?‘‘action”). however, direction in his- 
toric metaphor map have not be evalu at scale against record of histor semant change, leav open 
whether metaphor map truli reflect predict patterns. use an histor corpu of the english lexicon, we seek 
to investig – at a larg scale – the histor direct of metaphor map by test whether some domain have 
more commonli serv a the start point of histor extens (the sourc domains) while other have more com- 
monli serv a the end point (target domains). for example, in the case of grasp, the ‘‘physic action” sens first 
appear in english around 1300 ce, preced the abstract sens of ‘‘understanding” that emerg around 1600 CE (kay, 
roberts, samuels, wotherspoon, & alexander, 2015a). our analysi examin systemat in the direction of histor 
metaphor sens map in the english lexicon. 

direct of metaphor map need not be systematic: instead, the evolutionari path of mean chang could be 
vari and unpredict across words. although some words, like grasp, may have begin with a rel concret sens 
that be subsequ extend to a more abstract sense, other word may have be extend in the opposit direction, 
from abstract to concret senses. for instance, irrit initi convey an abstract sens of ‘‘anger,” a in an ‘‘irrit per- 
son” (1662 ce; kay et al., 2015a), but it be subsequ use to convey a more concrete, physic meaning, a in ‘‘irrit 
skin” (1791 ce; kay et al., 2015a). A particular word’ path could be shape by the ever-chang cultur condit and 
result commun need that have caus word to develop new mean across histori (cf. aitchison, 2001). the 
contribut factor may be variabl across word and across era of history, result in littl systemat on a larg scale. 

however, an altern possibl be that the direct of metaphor sens extens be systematic, becaus it be 
shape by endur function pressur on languag evolution. recent work in comput cognit scienc have sug- 
gest that mani aspect of languag and cross-linguist variat can be understood in term of gener design principles, 
such a the need for linguist structur to minim cognit effort and support inform commun and languag 
learn (zipf, 1949; see also kemp & regier, 2012; kirby, tamariz, cornish, & smith, 2015; piantadosi, tily, & gibson, 2011; 
regier, kemp, & kay, 2015). appli thi perspect to polysemy, systemat direction in map may result from 
languag user minim the cost associ with commun novel idea and learn a lexicon: map will tend 
to be driven by their eas of construction, their effect a commun devices, and/or their learnabl by children. 
the map should thu provid a cognit econom and henc effici devic for compress new idea into an exist- 
ing lexicon. If there be a consist set of cognit principl and process underli eas of construction, effect for 
communication, and/or learnability, recur pattern of map should aris across domain and time. 

but thi perspect say littl about what the underli constraint on the direction of metaphor map 
might be. An independ line of research, from cognit psycholog and linguistics, provid suggest about the speci- 
fics: namely, that the process that give rise to metaphor polysemi may reflect conceptu structur (lakoff, 1987; 
sweetser, 1991). one promin propos in thi vein be conceptu metaphor theori (cmt; lakoff & johnson, 1980; 
reddy, 1979), which posit that peopl reason about abstract concept – such a ‘‘understanding” – via metaphor map- 
ping from knowledg domain that be more concret and tie to bodili experi – such a ‘‘physic action.” although 
cmt be controversi a a theori of cognition, other theori also predict that concret and embodi word sen will be 
extend to more abstract sen becaus thi type of extens may be the most use for commun and learn 
(murphy, 1997; srinivasan & carey, 2010; thibodeau & durgin, 2008). for example, it could be easi to commun about 
someth abstract – for which achiev share refer be difficult – by analog refer to a more concret meaning, 
for which share refer be easier, and thi advantag may appli in word learn a well a discours processing. further, 
becaus concret and embodi mean tend to be frequent (hanley, hunt, steed, & jackman, 2013; cf. winter, thompson, 
& urban, 2014), they may be more readili retriev a sourc for mean extens by speaker who need to commun 
a new idea. 

prior research have not explicitli link the perspect of effici languag design with the studi of the cognit foun- 
dation of polysemi or metaphor mapping. We bridg thi gap by analyz direction in a larg set of metaphor 
map between sourc and target domain span 1100 years, date from old english to the present. To our knowl- 
edge, thi be the first large-scal studi to evalu the systemat of the direction in polysem metaphor map- 
ping against the record of histor chang in a lexicon. We expect that if metaphor map provid an effici 
cognit devic for compress idea into a commun and learnabl lexicon, the histor direct of chang 
through which new sen be creat for word should be highli systematic, and they should be explain by a compact 
set of variabl relev to the cognit process involv in generating, learning, and use word meanings. 

2. method 

We identifi six candid variabl from the literatur that could explain direct of metaphor map base on 
commun and cognit considerations. We use human participants’ rate of these variabl to tri to predict direc- 
tion in metaphor domain map record in the histori of english. In the following, we describe: (1) each of the 



Y. Xu et al. / cognit psycholog 96 (2017) 41–53 43 
candid variables, (2) the histor dataset of metaphor domain map we used, and (3) a survey through which we 
elicit rate of the domain on each of the candid variabl dimensions. 

2.1. candid variabl 

three of the variabl we consid a predictor be suggest by conceptu metaphor theori (lakoff & johnson, 1980; 
reddy, 1979; sweetser, 1991) and support by other perspect suggest that certain type of mean should more 
commonli serv a sourc of metaphor extens (e.g., srinivasan & carey, 2010, and thibodeau & durgin, 2008, a dis- 
cuss above; see also traugott, 1990). 

1. concret ? abstract. word sen that refer to thing perceiv through the sensori system should serv a a sourc of 
metaphor mappings, rel to one label less percept referents. 

2. embodi ? disembodied. word sen that refer to thing that be more directli experienc through our bodi should 
serv a a sourc of metaphor mappings, rel to one that label refer that be less directli experienced. 

3. external? internal.word sen that refer to entiti in the extern world should serv a a sourc of metaphor map- 
pings, rel to one that label internal, mental entities, such a emot or feelings. 

An addit three variabl be identified, base on the idea that metaphor extens tend to be commun 
expressive: 

4. animate? inanimate. word sen that refer to anim entiti may carri more express power than one refer to 
less anim entities, and may thu serv a a sourc of metaphor map to convey salient featur of target inan- 
imat entiti (silverstein, 1976; traugott, 2003). 

5. less valenc ? more valenced. If metaphorically-deriv sen aris in part becaus of their express power, deriv 
sen should be more emot valenc than origin senses. thi predict that when word sen from sourc 
domain be extended, the result sen in the target domain will have strong valenc (whether posit or negative; 
osgood, suci, & tannenbaum, 1964; ullmann, 1957; cf. holli & westbury, 2016). 

6. more intersubject ? less intersubjective. intersubject refer to the degre to which peopl experi someth 
the same way (traugott, 1989, 2003). word mean that be more intersubject (e.g. ‘‘wooden”) could be easi to 
understand and establish share label for than one that be less so (e.g., ‘‘beautiful”). they might thu serv a a sourc 
of metaphor mappings, rel to less intersubject meanings. 

some of these variabl be like to be correlated, e.g., mani of the same word mean could be external, concrete, 
intersubjective, and embodied. however, they be not identical. for example, ‘‘arm” and ‘‘table” be both highli concrete, 
but arm be more directli and viscer experienc than tables. our analysi teas apart the relationship among these 
variabl in account for metaphor map in the histori of english. 

2.2. histor dataset of metaphor map 

We obtain data from the metaphor map of english (mme) databas (kay, roberts, samuels, wotherspoon, & alexander, 
2015b), which identifi metaphor map of sen classifi by semant domain over more than a millennium. the 
mme databas be deriv from the histor thesauru of english (hte; kay et al., 2015a), which record 793,742 word 
form-sens entri a attest in the histori of english. the hte is, in turn, base on the second edit of the oxford english 
dictionari (simpson & weiner, 1989). 

all word sen in the mme databas be classifi into 415 distinct semant domain (e.g. ‘‘textiles,” ‘‘digest organs,” 
‘‘anger,” ‘‘pride”) in rough accord with the standard of semant classif adopt by the hte and oxford english 
dictionary. all semant domain from the databas be sub-field from three broader ontolog domains: I. the extern 
world; ii. the mental world; iii. the social world. section 1 includ semant domain that concern readili observ phe- 
nomena of the universe, such a the earth and sea. section 2 includ domain that concern cognit process such a per- 
ception and emotion. section 3 includ domain that concern social system such a the law and morality. each specif 
semant domain defin a categori of mean that word sen can evolv from (sourc domain) or toward (target 
domain), and a singl domain can includ multipl but distinct word senses. the construct of these domain have be 
deriv care from lexicograph data and gradual refin over a period of 40 years. for detail of domain classifica- 
tion, see work by the lexicograph of the hte (p xviii-xx, kay, roberts, samuels, & wotherspoon, 2009). 

the mme databas record metaphor map that have occur between domain and provid a sampl of word 
that exemplifi these domain mappings. our analysi examin histor metaphor map at the level of these 
semant domain – specif between pair of domain (and not at the level of individu words), evalu whether 
there have be systemat in the direction of domain-to-domain mappings. each attest domain-to-domain map- 
ping reflect the histor extens of word sen between two domains. together, these map span an 1100 year per- 
iod, from the old english period around AD 800 through to the present era, around 1950 ce. within the mme database, 
metaphor map be summar separ for the old english period (i.e., befor 1100 ce), and in 50-year step 



44 Y. Xu et al. / cognit psycholog 96 (2017) 41–53 
for the subsequ 800 years, provid 18 uniqu histor time point for our analysis. for further detail regard the 
mme database, we refer the reader to the ‘‘about the project” page provid at http://mappingmetaphor.arts.gla.ac.uk/ 
about-the-project/. 

research of the mme databas have found evid for over 10,000 metaphor domain mappings: case where 
word in one domain be consist use to describ anoth domain. some of the record of domain map do 
not contain full inform about when the map occur and what word be involved, and so they be elimin 
for purpos of our analyses. the final data set we use includ all of the approxim 5,500 record metaphor map- 
ping (download a of octob 21st, 2015, at http://mappingmetaphor.arts.gla.ac.uk/about-the-project/categories-com- 
pleted/), among 400 semant domains, that have complet information. see supplement materi for these domains. 
each entri in our data set record an attest metaphor map between a pair of semant domain that includes: 
(1) sourc domain, (2) target domain, (3) earli of period of extens between these domains, and (4) some sampl word 
that particip in thi metaphor extension. 

the databas indic the histor direct of sens extens among each pair of semant domains. three type of 
direct be recorded: (1) A? B, i.e. A be sourc domain and B be target domain; (2) A B, i.e. A be target and B be source; (3) 
A M B, i.e. a bidirect mapping. the bidirect map constitut onli a small portion of the dataset (�7.5%), so we 
focu on the direct case (4960 uniqu pair of domain-to-domain mappings) for our analyses. We examin whether 
the map direct among semant domain could be predict from empir rate of the domain along the six can- 
didat variabl dimensions, base on an on-lin survey that we describ next. 

2.3. survey for rate elicit 

We elicit rate of the 400 semant domain along the six candid variabl through an on-lin survey (see supple- 
mental materi for experiment instructions). for each variable, particip rat each of the 400 domain on a seven- 
point scale. particip first read a definit of each domain (e.g., ‘‘plant - A live thing that grow in the ground, usual 
have leaf or flowers, and need sun and water to survive”), assembl by consult the merriam-webst dictionary. par- 
ticip then rat the domain on one of the six variables. for example, for concreteness, particip select a number 
between 1 and 7, where 1 repres ‘‘highli abstract,” 7 ‘‘highli concrete,” and 4 ‘‘intermediate.” becaus of the larg num- 
ber of rate we need to elicit (400 domain x 6 variables), each particip onli rat a random sampl of 40 domain 
along a singl variabl dimension. 

our research protocol be approv by the institut review board at the univers of california, berkeley. data be 
collect from 1439 particip who self-report a nativ english speakers, use the onlin qualtric experiment plat- 
form (http://www.qualtrics.com/), dissemin via amazon’ mechan turk (https://www.mturk.com/mturk/). follow- 
ing standard protocol (oppenheimer, meyvis, & davidenko, 2009), respons be exclud from particip who do 
not respond correctli to three ‘‘catch” trial assess attent to the task (n = 94). On average, we obtain 18 rate 
(sd = 2) for each of the domain-vari questions. across all variabl and domains, the mean standard deviat of rate 
be 1.6 (sd = 0.32), indic a high level of inter-rat agreement. No substanti discrep in inter-rat agreement 
be observ across the variables. for animacy, the mean standard deviat across the differ domain rate be 
1.8 (sd = 0.4); for concreteness: mean = 1.6 (sd = 0.4); for embodiment: mean = 1.9 (sd = 0.4); for externality: mean = 1.3 
(sd = 0.5); for intersubjectivity: mean = 1.8 (sd = 0.3); for valence: mean = 1.1 (sd = 0.3). see supplement materi for 
the mean variabl rate for all 400 domains. 

3. comput analysi and result 

To evalu the hypothesi that the direction of metaphor map in histori be systematic, we perform three 
analyses: (1) We test the extent to which direct of metaphor extens record in the histor data set be pre- 
dict by rate along the six dimens describ above, either in isol or in combination; (2) We then examin 
whether the same rate can be use to identifi the semant domain that have serv a sourc vs. target of metaphor- 
ical extensions, by collaps data across time; (3) finally, we examin the most domin variabl in explain metaphor- 
ical map across time, to ass whether it explanatori power have be consist over the cours of history. next, we 
describ the comput method and result for each of these analyses. 

3.1. analysi I: predict direct of metaphor map over histori 

In the first analysis, we examin whether rate differ along the six candid variabl might account for the 
direction of metaphor map in history. that is, give a pair of domain for which metaphor map have 
be recorded, do know how each domain be rat on some variabl dimens predict which domain will be the 
source, and which the target? We perform thi analysi by first treat each variabl in isolation. We then combin 
the variabl to see if their combin could further account for the histor data. 

To examin the explanatori power of the six candid variabl individually, we creat a parameter-fre model for each 
of the variabl that predict the direct of metaphor map between a give pair of semant domain record in

hte. thi simpl model calcul the differ in averag rate of a pair of domain along the variabl dimens of 
interest. It then make a correspond predict about the direct in which mean extens should take place in his- 
tori (accord to that psycholog dimension), without requir ani adjust parameter. 

apart from the valenc model, the five other model predict that the domain with the high mean rate along a certain 
variabl will be the sourc of metaphor mapping, and the domain with the low mean rate will be the target. for 
instance, for the animaci variable, we predict the direct of map to be animate? inanimate, such that between 
ani pair of domain (a,b) record in the histor data set, the domain that be rat a more anim on averag (from 
the survey describ before) would more commonli serv a the source, and the domain that be rat a less anim on 
averag would serv a the target: 
A ¼ source; B ¼ target; iff e½animacyðaþ� > e½animacyðbþ� ð1þ 

similar model be construct for the concreteness, embodiment, externality, and intersubject variables. We con- 

struct the valenc model slightli differ becaus the underli variabl be polar (i.e. a domain can be either pos- 
itiv or negative). thu we instead calcul the absolut valu of valenc ratings. concretely, a domain rat 7 (highli 
positive) on the 7-point scale would be treat a equally-valenc a a domain rat 1 (highli negative). for thi model, 
we predict the direct of map to be: less valenced?mor valenced, such that between ani pair of domain in 
the data set, the domain that be rat a more valenc on averag would serv a the target, and the domain that be 
rat a less valenc on averag would serv a the source: 
A ¼ target; B ¼ source; iff e½valenceðaþ� > e½valenceðbþ� ð2þ 

tabl 1 specifi the predict direct of each model along with exampl map from the histor databas that 

the model success account for. 
We use 50% a the baselin repres the possibl that sourc and target be random with respect to our six vari- 

ables. the result appear in fig. 1a. overall, all model predict direct in histor map abov chance. In partic- 
ular, extern (accuraci = 73.9%) and concret (73.5%) be most accur and roughli equival to one another. 
these be follow by intersubject (60.7%), valenc (59.6%), embodi (56.7%), and animaci (52.6%). these result 
indic that histor metaphor map follow systemat and predict directions, such that between a pair of 
domains, the domain that be rat high (or low for the valenc dimension) on these variabl be more like to be the 
source, and the remain domain be more like to be the target. 

We next examin the degre of correl among the six variables, seek to understand which of these variabl 
might be redund with each other, and which variabl might be less correl and henc might offer complementari 
explanatori power to each other. fig. 1b show the pearson correl between all pair of variables. As can be seen, exter- 
naliti and concret be most strongli inter-correl (r(400) = 0.84, p < 0.001). for thi reason, we expect these 
variabl to make similar predict about map direct and for one to make littl independ contribut to 
explain the direction of metaphor map over the other. intersubject be most strongli correl with 
both extern (r(400) = 0.44, p < 0.001) and concret (r(400) = 0.47, p < 0.001) among the remain pairwis correla- 
tions. animacy, embodiment, and valenc be gener less correl with other variables. 

To take into account these pattern of inter-correlation, we investig how well the six variabl in combin predict 
the histor direct of metaphor mappings, and the extent to which each variabl contribut toward these predic- 
tions. We first formul the problem use standard logist regression. for each instanc of the 4960 domain-to-domain 
map (index by i) record in the database, we cod the direct of map – the observ to be predict 
(denot by y) – between a pair of domain (a,b) a ‘0’ if the map be A? B (i.e. domain A serf a source) and ‘1’ 
if the map be A B (i.e. domain A serf a target). We then creat a 6-dimension predictor x from the six candi- 
date variabl by take the differ in mean rate along these variabl dimens for all correspond instanc 
recorded: 
x ¼ ½e½animacyðaþ� � e½animacyðbþ�; . . . ; e½valenceðaþ� � e½valenceðbþ�� ð3þ 

If our predict about these variabl be correct, we should expect some subset of them to account well for the histor- 

ical direct of metaphor mappings, and in way consist with our propos about prefer directionality. To test 
this, we regress y against x by minim the standard logist loss function: 
lðbþ ¼ 
X 

i 

logð1þ expð�btxiyiþþ ð4þ 
here b (or beta) be a vector of weight to be determin from the data. each weight repres the rel contribut of 
each of the variabl dimens in account for the histor data, a an assess of the theoret propos formal 
in eqs. (1) and (2). for example, if a high mean rate along a variabl dimens predict a domain to be the sourc of 
metaphor map (e.g. in the case of externality), we would expect the correspond weight to be posit valu 
and significantli abov zero if the contribut of the variabl in question be substantial. In contrast, if a low mean rate 
along a variabl dimens predict a domain to be the sourc (e.g. valence), we would expect the correspond weight to 
be neg valu and significantli below zero.

To ass the degre to which the variabl in combin predict the data, we appli 10-fold cross validation, which be 
a common techniqu for evalu predict accuraci (e.g., kohavi, 1995). At each round, we held out 10% of the data for 
the model to make predict about, while fit the model use the remain 90% of the data. We repeat thi proce- 
dure 10 times, hold out a differ set of data dure each round, and comput the predict accuraci on the held-out 
sets. the mean cross-valid accuraci of the logist model be 77.1%, indic that there be a small advantag of pre- 
dict the histor data by allow the variabl to contribut simultan to explain each mapping, a compar 
to fit the data by treat the variabl in isol (recal that in the latter single-vari method, the most accur 
model be externality, at 73.9%). 

To understand the contribut of the variabl in account for the data, we visual the distribut of their weight 
from the logist regress analysi by fit the data (fig. 1c). To evalu the signific of these weights, we perform 
statist bootstrap by resampl the data 10,000 time and re-estim the weight from these bootstrap trials. 
the result indic that extern be the domin factor underli histor metaphor mappings, a it receiv the 
larg weight among the six variabl (p < 0.0001, beta = 0.436, 95% CI [0.380, 0.492]). the result also reveal that 
although embodi (p < 0.0001, beta = 0.127, 95% CI [0.078, 0.176]), valenc (p < 0.01, beta = �0.093, 95% CI [�0.164, 
�0.023]) and concret (p < 0.002, beta = 0.119, 95% CI [0.047, 0.191]) receiv small weight than externality, their 
contribut be nevertheless significant. finally, animaci (p = 0.24, beta = 0.025, 95% CI [�0.016, 0.065]) and intersubjec- 
tiviti (p = 0.121, beta = �0.065, 95% CI [�0.147, 0.017]) do not have signific weights. 



Y. Xu et al. / cognit psycholog 96 (2017) 41–53 47 
becaus the standard logist model do not incorpor variabl selection, it be possibl that the set of signific vari- 
abl we describ might contain redundancy. for example, the correl analysi we describ show that extern 
be highli correl with concreteness. To address thi issue, we perform an addit analysi by incorpor variabl 
select within logist regression, via an l1-penal sparsiti constraint. In particular, instead of minim the loss func- 
tion in eq. (4), we impos a penalti term in the minim procedure: 
fig. 2. 
variabl 
dimen 
ll1ðbþ ¼ lðbþ þ k 
X 

j 

jbjj ð5þ 
here j index the weight on the six variabl dimensions, and by sum |bj| over these dimens thi formul intro- 
duce a spars penalti on the L1 norm of the weight (henc thi penalti will shrink variabl weight toward zero if the 
correspond variabl contribut trivial or redundantli toward explain the data, effect incorpor variabl 
select in the minim procedure). k determin the rel weight between the origin loss function l(b) and 
the L1 norm and be typic a tune parameter. To probe the key variabl in a comprehens way, we examin the full 
regular path by vari the k valu systemat from 1 to 1000 in 50 equal step in the log space. 

fig. 2 show how the distribut of weight vari in the regular path we probed. the result indic the emer- 
genc of three key variabl – externality, embodiment, and valenc – which retain their weight a the k valu increased. 
At the same time, other variabl be either minim (e.g., animaci contribut trivial toward explain the data and 
henc it weight be minimal) or shrunken toward zero a a result of the sparsiti constraint (e.g., concret correl 
highli with extern and it weight tend toward zero a the k valu increased). the sign of weight on the key vari- 
abl be also inform and consist with our theoret predictions, indic that domain receiv high rate 
along extern and embodi dimens have commonli serv a sourc of metaphor mapping, wherea 
domain receiv low rate along valenc (i.e. neutral domains) commonli serv a target of metaphor mapping. 

taken together, these analysi indic that extern (or concreteness, with which it be highli correlated) play a dom- 
inant role in predict the direction of histor metaphor extension. also, these analysi suggest that externality, 
embodiment, and valenc togeth defin a rel orthogon space that help explain the direction of the major 
of record metaphor mappings. these find provid the first large-scal evid for the idea that metaphor 
sen have develop across histori in systemat and predict ways, constrain by a rel compact set of psycho- 
logic dimensions. 

fig. 3 visual trend in the histor metaphor map among the 400 semant domain in a binari matrix. each 
non-zero entri (i.e., white dot) in the matrix record the presenc of a record map between a pair of domains. To ver- 
ifi that variabl such a extern best explain the data, we take a bottom-up, data-driven approach, and appli a prin- 
cipal compon analysi to thi matrix and correl the first eigenvector – the dimens that account for the most 
variabl in the data – against the domain rate of the six variables. our independ measur of extern (r(400) 
= 0.349; p < 0.0001, bonferroni-corrected) and concret (r(400) = 0.342; p < 0.0001, bonferroni-corrected) – but not 
visual of variabl weight in the regular path of spars logist regression. posit weight indic that domain rat high along a 
dimens (e.g., externality) tend to serv a sourc in metaphor mapping. neg weight indic that domain rat low along a variabl 

ion (e.g., valence) tend to serv a target in metaphor mapping.

the mme database). 

48 Y. Xu et al. / cognit psycholog 96 (2017) 41–53 
the other variabl (p > 0.05, all bonferroni-corrected) – be significantli correl with the first eigenvector, confirm 
the domin role of these psycholog dimens in explain the direction of metaphor map in history. 
3.2. analysi ii: identifi the sourc and target domain of metaphor map 

our analysi so far have focu on metaphor map aris at differ time point in history, but the outcom of 
these diachron chang should also be reflect in more global, time-independ asymmetri a to which domain tend 
to be the sourc of metaphor extension, and which the targets. We next examin the extent to which the candid 
variabl dimens explain the source-target asymmetri of specif semant domains, by collaps data across time 
points. 

To quantifi the degre of source-target asymmetri in the metaphor map domains, we formal defin the 
asymmetri index (ai) a the differ between two probabilities: 
AI ¼ pðsourceþ � pðtargetþ ð6þ 
here, p(source) be the probabl of a domain (d) serv a a sourc of metaphor map across all time point 
(index by t) in histori (i.e., a synchron summari of ‘‘source” strength), and p(target) be the probabl of a domain be 
a target of metaphor map across time point (a synchron summari of ‘‘target” strength).

Y. Xu et al. / cognit psycholog 96 (2017) 41–53 49 
We comput these probabl on a per domain basi by sum all case of metaphor map where a domain 
serv a a sourc or target respect a record in the histor data set and normal them by the total number of 
mappings: 
fig. 4. 
domain 
pðsourceþ ¼ 
X 

iðd ¼ sourceþ= number of mappings; ð7þ 

pðtargetþ ¼ 
X 

iðd ¼ targetþ= number of map ð8þ 

It follow from thi measur of source-target asymmetri that a high posit valu of AI should indic a strong sourc 

domain, wherea a low neg valu of AI should indic a weak sourc (or strong target) domain. tabl 2 list the stron- 
gest sourc and target domain in the dataset base on the asymmetri index measur we described. 

We then comput pearson correl between each domain’ asymmetri index and it mean empir rate for each 
of the variabl dimensions. fig. 4a summar the results. rate for all variabl dimens except for those of animaci (r 
(400) = 0.09, p > 0.250) correl significantli with the asymmetri index (p < 0.01 for the five candid variables). specif- 
ically, extern (r(400) = 0.46, p < 0.001) and concret (r(400) = 0.42, p < 0.001) show the high strength of cor- 
relation, consist with their lead role in predict direct of metaphor map (see section 3.1). 
intersubject (r(400) = 0.22, p < 0.001) and embodi (r(400) = 0.13, p < 0.009) be also moder correl with 
the asymmetri indices. these result suggest that domain that be external, concrete, embodied, and share a conceptual- 
izat across peopl tend to serv a sourc of metaphor map across history. finally, valenc neg correl 
(r(400) = �0.19, p < 0.001) with asymmetry, suggest that more valenc domain tend to be target of metaphor map- 
pings, also consist with the analysi report in section 3.1. 

again take into account the inter-correl natur of the variables, we perform a multipl linear regress to esti- 
mate the rel contribut of the six variables. We expect the most import (and orthogonal) predictor rate to be 
weight the high when regress against the asymmetri indices. fig. 4b show the rel contribut of these vari- 
abl a reflect by their weights. the regress fit have a pearson r(393) = 0.42, p < 0.001. the candid variabl with the 
larg absolut weight be extern (p < 0.001, beta = 0.007, 95% CI [0.0037, 0.0093]), follow by embodi (p < 0.09, 
summari of result on identifi sourc and target domain of metaphor sens mapping: (a) account for the source-target asymmetri of

fig. 5. visual of histor metaphor map in two domains: ‘‘water” (panel A) and ‘‘mind” (panel b). arrow between domain indic 
histor direct of metaphor mapping. the domain link by arrow have serv either a sourc or target to the domain in question. (the year in 
parenthesi indic the time period of the first appear of the domain-to-domain map in history.) the domain not connect to the arrow be 
randomli chosen refer domains, a subset of the 400 domain which be show a gray dot project onto a low-dimension space via princip 
compon analysi use the empir rate for the six variables. the two princip compon correspond roughli to a concrete-to-abstract 
dimens (from right to left in the horizont dimension), and an embodied-to-disembodi dimens (from top to bottom in the vertic dimension). 

50 Y. Xu et al. / cognit psycholog 96 (2017) 41–53 
beta = 0.0019, 95% CI [�0.0002, 0.0040]) and valenc (p > 0.250, beta = �0.001, 95% CI [�0.0026, 0.0007]), although neither of 
the latter two variabl contribut significantli beyond externality. thi result provid a synchron confirm to the 
result from the analysi present in section 3.1, which found that the same set of variabl account for most of the vari- 
anc in explain metaphor map direct dure differ histor epochs. 

fig. 5 provid two concret exampl illustr the power of the extern variabl in explain the direct of 
metaphor mappings. ‘‘water” be rat a a highli extern domain (mean extern rate = 6.2 out of 7), and a 
shown, almost all metaphor map involv thi domain in our dataset consist of project from thi domain 
to other domains, exemplifi the principl that extern domain tend to act a sourc of metaphor map across 
history. In contrast, ‘‘mind” be rat a a highli intern domain (mean extern rate = 1.4), and a shown, almost all 
map involv thi domain be project from other domain to thi domain, exemplifi the principl that inter- 
nal domain tend to be the target of metaphor mappings. 

taken together, our diachron (section 3.1) and synchron (section 3.2) analysi suggest that metaphor sens exten- 
sion be highli systemat and constrain by a compact set of variables.

3.3. analysi iii: assess extern through time 

the analysi present in section 3.1 and 3.2 have indic that extern be the strong factor in explain the 
direct of histor metaphor mappings. As discuss before, extern domain could commonli provid a sourc of 
metaphor map if they be the most cognit avail and access to extend further. To further understand 
if the external? intern map be a privileg direct of semant change, we test whether extern domain have 
remain a strong sourc of metaphor map throughout history. An altern possibl be that extern be a 
strong predictor onli at the veri earli point in histori (e.g., becaus extern idea tend to be lexic earlier), such 
that extern domain have onli serv a sourc of metaphor map dure these periods. 

To distinguish between these two possibilities, we perform a time-cours analysi that examin the strength of exter- 
nal domain a sourc over times. specifically, we categor the avail domain in our data set a ‘‘external” or ‘‘inter- 
nal” depend on whether the rate of extern for each domain be high or low than ‘‘4” (the middl scale valu 
between highli extern ‘‘7” and highli intern ‘‘1”; our result obtain regardless of the exact threshold use to separ 
extern and intern domains). then, we comput the sourc probabl (describ in section 3.2) for each of the two 
group of domain at each of the avail histor time point provid in the corpus. If extern serf a a strong pre- 
dictor for metaphor map mainli due to the lexic of extern concept at the earli point in history, the 
sourc probabl for extern domain should on averag be high than for intern domains, but thi differ should 
decreas over time. On the other hand, if external? intern be a privileg direct of semant change, extern domain 
should have great sourc probabl than the intern domain across time. 

our analysi support the second possibl (see fig. 6). specifically, extern domain have significantli high sourc 
probabl than intern domain throughout the 1300-year period (joint p < 0.001, n = 18 time point with fisher’ 
method; time point with minim p < 7.71e�011, t(396) = 6.57; time point with maxim p < 0.035, t(396) = 1.81). also, 
sourc probabl for the extern domain do not differ significantli between the initi and end period (p > 0.250, t 
(476) = �0.29). 

fig. 6 show a comparison of extern domain against embodi (vs. less-embodied) and valenc (vs. less-valenced) 
domains, with result obtain via parallel analysi to those use for externality.1 In contrast with externality, embodi 
and valenc domain do not serv a sustain sourc for metaphor map across time. specifically, embodi 
domain tend to be sourc of metaphor map onli earli in histori (possibl becaus concept in these domain 
be lexic earli in time), wherea valenc domain act a weak sourc of metaphor mappings, but onli late 
in histor time. together, these observ be consist with the idea that external? intern be a privileg basi for 
metaphor mapping, with concept from more extern domain provid a mean for commun about concept from 
more intern domains. 

4. discuss 

the present studi focu on one of the key mechan through which word gain new meanings: metaphor map- 
ping. By draw on an histor record of semant chang in english, we evalu – on a larg scale – whether new 
metaphor word sen have develop in systemat directions. We discov that a compact set of variabl includ 
extern and embodi account for direction in the major of record metaphor map between 
domains, date back 1100 years. specifically, we found that, give a pair of domains, the domain with the high mean 
1 We found concret to be highli similar to externality, and we found no statist signific for animaci and intersubjectivity. for conciseness, we 
omit present these results. 



52 Y. Xu et al. / cognit psycholog 96 (2017) 41–53 
rate along these variabl will more commonli be the sourc of metaphor mapping, and the domain with the low 
mean rate will more commonli be the target. furthermore, we found that extern – the strong predictor – explain 
the direct of metaphor map throughout the histori of english, and not just for an initi period earli in english 
vocabulari development. 

our find lend strong support to the idea that the evolut of metaphor polysemi proce in systemat ways. 
the six variabl that we explor be motiv by commun and cognit considerations, draw upon theori 
of cognit and language. our analysi provid evid that the larg major of direct of metaphor extens 
over histori can be explain by a compact set of variables, which suggest that metaphor provid an effici way of com- 
press emerg mean into an exist lexicon, without requir the construct of word form de novo. our work 
thu extend previou studi about commun and cognit constraint on synchron featur of languag such a 
word length (piantadosi et al., 2011; zipf, 1949) and semant structur (kemp & regier, 2012; regier et al., 2015) to explain 
the evolut of metaphor polysemi in the lexicon (cf. blank and koch, 1999; geeraerts, 1997). the current work also 
contribut to a comprehens assess of metaphor thought by connect previou theori of metaphor such a 
the conceptu metaphor theori (lakoff & johnson, 1980; reddy, 1979) with histor data of languag chang at scale. 

In mani respects, our find – that the direction of histor metaphor sens extens be highli systemat – be 
surprising. due to the ever-chang cultur condit and result commun need that have pressur word to 
develop new sen (cf. aitchison, 2001), metaphor sens extens could have in principl be vari and unpre- 
dictabl across words. It be clear that cultur condit and commun need have shape metaphor extens 
in mani cases. for instance, mous would never have be extend to a comput accessori if the invent of the com- 
puter have not come about, nor would file or folder have be extend from object held in the hand to virtual one without 
specif cultur developments. our data demonstr that, in spite of the effect of complex and dynam cultur condi- 
tions, there be an underli regular to the direct of metaphor sens extens driven by measur communica- 
tive and cognit principles. 

our result leav open exactli whi variabl such a extern be reliabl predictor of direction in metaphor 
map across history. On the one hand, these result could be take to support theori emphas the role of metaphor 
in thought includ conceptu metaphor theory. By these accounts, idea tie to human experi and sensat provid 
anchor for think about more abstract ideas. As such, more extern (and embodied) word mean be predict to be 
well understood and richli structured, and to provid a sourc of map for idea that be more difficult to understand. 
alternatively, our result may not reveal that abstract concept be understood in term of extern and embodi concepts, 
per se, but rather, that extern and embodi word mean be easi to achiev share refer for and to learn 
(srinivasan & carey, 2010; thibodeau & durgin, 2008) becaus of their salienc and physic avail in experience. It 
be also possibl that extern mean tend to be more frequent, and may thu be easi to retriev for speaker who wish 
to commun new idea (hanley et al., 2013; cf. winter et al., 2014). relatedly, more extern concept may tend to prime 
more intern concept than vice versa, contribut to direction in languag chang (e.g., jaeger & rosenbach, 2008). 
regardless of how these issu be resolved, our find support the idea that metaphor polysemi have be shape 
by cognit and commun pressur in way that facilit the effici creation, learning, and use of newword senses. 

our work rais question for futur research in comput approach to semant chang and polysemy. first, our 
analysi examin metaphor sens extens at the level of semant domains. In the future, it would be valuabl to 
ass the systemat of sens extens at the level of individu words, which would requir a differ sourc of data. 
second, although the databas we examin be large, it be not an exhaust set of metaphor map in english lan- 
guag history. ultimately, it would be desir to have a full record of map to assess. third, we also note that the vari- 
abl rate of the semant domain that we use in our analysi be base on intuit from subject live in the 
present era, a oppos to in the past. although we see no reason for whi thi would be the case, in principl these semant 
domain could have be perceiv differ in the era in which metaphor extens be creat (e.g., in term of 
their externality, embodiment, etc.). futur analysi could confirm the valid of the rate we obtain by seek other 
converg form of histor evidence. 

more broadly, our analysi focu onli on the direction of metaphor mappings, and whether some domain 
more commonli serv a sources, and other more commonli a targets. however, our find leav open how speaker 
decid which concept from sourc domain to employ when they wish to commun about a new idea in a target domain 
(e.g., zhang, geeraerts, & speelman, 2015): for example, what lead speaker to the choos the physic action mean of 
grasp – a oppos to some other extern and embodi word mean – to commun about the comprehens of 
ideas? address thi problem would presum requir in-depth knowledg about structur similar between con- 
cept in differ domain and their retriev probabilities, to help explain which map be possible. addit work 
be also requir to explor whether the principl that underli metaphor sens extens can be appli to explain other 
mechan of word sens extension, such a metonymi and semant chain (e.g., lakoff, 1987; ramiro, malt, & 
srinivasan, & xu, 2017; xu, regier, & malt, 2016), and whether model that be success in predict english data fare 
a well in predict semant evolut in other languages. the latter be particularli import for support the claim 
of gener cognit and commun principl a driver of systemat sens extension. finally, it will also be import 
to understand the socio-cultur factor that explain the rise or fall in commun need for differ semant domains. 
the current work provid an empir approach for further explor into the evolut and natur of word meaning.
