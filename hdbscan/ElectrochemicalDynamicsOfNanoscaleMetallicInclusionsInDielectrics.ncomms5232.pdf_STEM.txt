nanoscal metal inclus in or on solid-st dielectr be an integr part of modern 

electrocatalysis, optoelectronics, capacitors, metamateri and memori devices. the 

properti of these composit system strongli depend on the size, dispers of the 

inclus and their chemic stability, and be usual consid constant. here we 

demonstr that nanoscal inclus (for example, clusters) in dielectr dynam 

chang their shape, size and posit upon appli electr field. through systemat in situ 

transmiss electron microscopi studies, we show that fundament electrochem 

process can lead to univers observ nucleat and growth of metal clusters, even for 

inert metal like platinum. the cluster exhibit divers dynam behaviour govern by 

kinet factor includ ion mobil and redox rates, lead to differ filament growth 

mode and structur in memrist devices. these find reveal the microscop origin 

behind resist switching, and also provid gener guidanc for the design of novel devic 

involv electron and ionics.

he abil to control and manipul metal inclus (for 
example, individu metal clusters) insid a solid-st 
medium will greatli expand the function and creat new 

class of materi (for example, metamaterials) and devic for 
electronic, magnetic, photonic, chemic and optoelectron 
applications1–6. such abil have be demonstrated, for 
example, with scan tunnel microscopi tools1. however, 
manual manipul use scan tunnel microscopi be 
slow and inefficient, and not device-friendli compar with 
method such a use local electr fields. indeed, devic base 
on the field-driven migrat of metal inclus (such a resist 
switch or memrist devices)7–9 have attract broad interest 
recent and have show great potenti a a disrupt 
technolog for a number of applic includ nonvolatil 
memory10–13, logic14–16 and neuromorph computing17. In 
these devices, the resist switch be normal attribut to 
filament format caus by the movement of metal inclus 
in the insul dielectr film9,10,18–20. attempt to 
microscop studi the filament growth process have be 
carri out use scan probe microscopy15,21 and high- 
resolut transmiss electron microscopy19,20,22–24 techniques. 
for example, a recent experi reveal differ filament 
growth modes20 and show that filament format can be 
achiev in the form of metal nanoclusters. however, a critic 
question be rais regard the fundamental, microscop 
origin of the growth and migrat of the nanoclust insid 
dielectrics25, and whether the differ and seemingli contradict 
experiment result can be reconcil within the same theoret 
framework. 

here we directli reveal the microscop origin of the dynam 
growth and migrat process of metal nanoclust in 
dielectr and show that the field-driven migrat be a univers 
behaviour, even for inert metal such a pt. We show the differ 
migrat mode can be explain in the electrochem model 
framework, driven by both thermodynam and kinet factors. 
specifically, we show that in convent insul the metal 
cluster can be treat a bipolar electrod (bpes), and can 
dissolv from their origin locat and nucleat and redeposit 
at new posit closer to the counter electrod in a process 
driven by the compet electrochem process occur at 
the two polar sides. We show thi fundament process can be 
use to explain the divers filament growth mode observ 
experimentally, and predict and verifi the growth mode at 
differ limit cases, therefor reconcil the differ 
experiment result obtain earli within a gener 
theoret framework10,20,22. By tune kinet factors, we 
further show differ nanoclust dynam can be observ in 
the same device, lead to the transit between differ 
filament growth modes.

dynam migrat of metal nanoclusters. In situ transmiss 
electron microscopi (tem) studi be first conduct on bulk 
sampl consist of individu metal nanoclust emb in 
the bulk of a dielectr film. thi approach enabl detail 
analysi and track of individu cluster and ensur the 
migrat occur insid the bulk of the film. By trace the 
dynam motion of the same nanoclust under electr field in an 
in situ tem setup for differ materi system (ag, cu, pt, ni), 
we success reveal fundament atomic/ion dynam that 
be univers applicable. 

the experiment strategi be illustr in fig. 1a–d, use Ag 
nanoclust a an example. An array of Ag nanoclust be 
emb insid the sio2 film by anneal a stack sio2/ag/ 
sio2 structur with a b1-nm-thin Ag layer. inert Au electrod 

be then deposit to appli electr field across the sio2/ag/ 
sio2 stack (see methods). sio2 be select a the dielectr layer 
in thi studi becaus it be the most import dielectr materi 
in the semiconductor industri and be also wide use for other 
devic includ memrist devices18,26,27. success focu 
ion beam (fib) lift-out, patterning, and thin process be 
subsequ perform to prepar an array of au/sio2/ag 
nanoclusters/sio2/au devic with individu top electrod 
and share bottom electrod for cross-sect tem studi 
(fig. 1b–d). dure in situ tem analysis, the top Au electrod of 
a devic be contact by a movabl W probe, wherea the bottom 
Au electrod be ground (fig. 1d). figur 1e show a tem imag 
of one of the emb Ag nanoclust along it [011] zone axis, 
with the correspond fast fourier transform result 
display in fig. 1f, which clearli reveal the crystallin face- 
center cubic structur of the Ag cluster. 

when an electr field be applied, evolut and migrat of 
the emb Ag nanoclust can be regularli observed, a 
show in fig. 1g–l (also see supplementari movi 1). the 
nanoclust have diamet of B5 nm and the appli voltag 
be 3 V correspond to an electr field of b0.8 MV cm� 1. 
notably, at locat 1 (mark by the upper arrow) dynam 
interact between a pair of Ag nanoclust be observed. As 
show in fig. 1g–i, the cluster on the left (upstream in the 
direct of the electr field) be gradual dissolv and merg 
into anoth cluster on the right side (downstream), result in 
an overal movement of Ag cluster along the direct of the 
appli electr field. similarly, cluster 2 (mark by the middl 
arrow) and 3 (mark by the low arrow) be also gradual 
dissolved. cluster 2 disappear (fig. 1k) and left a void in the 
film a show in fig. 1j,k. additionally, a cluster 3 be dissolv 
a new cluster, name cluster 4, emerg nearby, a mark by the 
low circl in fig. 1k,l. 

these behaviour have be repeatedli observ in differ 
devices. figur 1m–p show the interact between anoth pair 
of Ag nanoclusters, and illustr the gradual dissolut of 
the origin cluster upstream and the nucleat and growth 
of anoth cluster downstream. the origin Ag cluster be 
complet dissolv and left a void behind in the origin posit 
(mark by circl in fig. 1p, see supplementari movi 2), and 
effect growth along the field direct be achieved. 

the dynam evolut of metal nanoclust reveal by 
in situ tem can be consist explain in the theoret 
framework of electrochem redox process in bpe with 
strong influenc from kinet effects. under an electr field insid 
the dielectric, the metal nanoclust can be treat a 
bpes25,28,29, with an effect cathod (d–) face the field 
direct and an effect anod (dþ ) on the opposit side, a 
show in fig. 1q. In thi model, agþ ion will be gener from 
the anod side of the cluster via electrochem oxid 
processes. the agþ ion will drift along the electr field and 
becom reduc when they reach a cathod (for example, the 
cathod side of anoth Ag cluster downstream). In the current 
experiment setup, there be no Ag suppli to the first Ag cluster 
upstream, so it experi onli net oxid and thu gradual 
dissolves. the creat agþ ion can be reduc and deposit onto 
the second nanoclust downstream. If oxid on the anod 
side of the 2nd nanoclust be suppress (due to, for example, 
kinet limit discuss later), the 2nd nanoclust will 
experi net growth. As a result, the first cluster merg into the 
2nd nanoclust downstream, result in an effect cluster 
displac along the electr field, a show in fig. 1q–s. It be 
worthwhil note that charg neutral need to be maintain 
in the nanoclust after the gener of agþ ions. the possibl 
process involv reduct of anoth agþ ion at the cathod 
side of the bpe, escap of the trap electron, or through

anoth reaction process (for example, reduct of moistur 
or proton27). In addition, the redox and migrat process of a 
specif cluster be determin by the local electrochem and/or 
structur environ sens by the cluster and be affect by 
the film inhomogen and electr field distribution, so the 
cluster dynam be stochast in nature. for example, out of the 
five Ag cluster show in fig. 1g–i, the three mark cluster 
migrat to differ new locat at differ times, while the 
other two cluster do not undergo appar oxid process 
within the measur time frame. 

We note the format of the 2nd nanoclust insid the 
sio2 film requir first a nucleat process, that is, the initi 

format of a critic nucleus. thi process can be regard a a

electr and mechan properti of the oxid matrix. As a 
result, the nucleat process be spatial select instead of be 
homogenous, a show in fig. 1 and supplementari movi 1–4. 
If nucleat could not proceed, the agþ ion can reach the Au 
counter electrod and becom reduc there. thi appear to be 
the case for cluster 2 in fig. 1g–l. however, a signific geometr 
chang may not be observ in thi case due to the much larg 
volum of the electrode. 

these analysi show that kinet factor (for example, the 
interplay between the redox rate at the cathode/anod side of 
the bpe, nucleat rate and ionic migrat speed) of the 
electrochem redox reaction and ionic drift strongli influenc 
the dynam of the metal nanoclusters. the evolut of the 
shape and size of a cluster can be determin by the competit 
between the oxid and reduct rate on the cathod and 
anod side of the bpe, which can be describ a 

dvi

/ gired�giox ð2þ 

where Vi be the volum of cluster i, and giox (G 
i 
red) be the oxid 

(reduction) rate for the Ag atom (ions) on the anod and 
cathod side of cluster i, respectively. 

for two neighbour cluster (i and i� 1) with small distance, 
we can approxim the ion exchang a 

gire ¼ gi� 1ox ð3þ 
account for the conserv of the Ag material. In system 
with more cluster interact electrostatically, the differ 
growth rate will be affect by the distanc between the clusters, 
their rel posit to each other and their sizes. these factor 
account for the electr field strength and the overal evolut of 
the system (for example, the conduct filament in a memrist 
device20). 

In light of the abov understandings, the experiment result 
that the cluster upstream merg into their counterpart down- 
stream, for example, cluster 1 and 3 in fig. 1g–l and the cluster 
in fig. 1m, can be explained. figur 1m–p show simul 
result use equat (2–3) by assum giox ¼ 0 for the 2nd 
nanoclust (methods). the simul confirm the experimen- 
tal observ (fig. 1m–p). other behaviour can also be 
expect from equat (2), a will be elabor later. As the 
electr field be continu applied, the cluster split and 
merg process can be repeated, result in an effect 
displac (movement) of the cluster along the electr field 
(fig. 1s) toward the counter electrode. sinc sio2 be an 
amorph insul rather than a homogen electrolyte, the 
condit for ion migrat and nucleat be inhomogen 
and depend strongli on the local microstructure, electr field 
distribution, electrochem environ and presenc of 
defects, a observ in fig. 1g–p. 

We have extens studi the behaviour of differ metal 
systems, includ activ metal such a Ag and Cu a well a 
inert metal such a Ni and pt. the volum of the sourc materi 
be also vari systematically. among these materials, Ag and Cu 
be wide recogn a the materi of choic for the format 
of metal filament and most commonli use in resist memori 
devices9,10,12,18. compar with ag, in situ tem studi on Cu 
have show essenti similar results. As display in fig. 2a–f, 
after appli a voltag of 6 V, 3 Cu cluster be found to have 
nucleat and grown between the emb Cu sourc and the 
counter Au electrod (fig. 2b, supplementari movi 3). As the 
size of the newli form cluster 1–3 grow larger, these cluster 
also becom oxid (fig. 2c–f), sinc the polar strength 
of the cluster (p) be proport to the cluster radiu (r), 
that is, p¼e � r(cosy� cosl) (where y and l be angl use to 
defin the posit on the cluster surface)25. the electro- 

chemic process of the cluster thu enter a second stage 
and giox4g 

i 
red applies. while cluster 1 and 2 be gradual 

dissolved, cluster 3 underw anoth splitting-merg 
process and grow into cluster 4 that be even closer to the 
counter electrode. the dynam behaviour of cluster 3 and 4 
highlight the rapidli evolv kinet of the bpes, includ 
gioxogir dure initi growth (fig. 2b), and subsequ 
transit to giox4g 

i 
red dure the dissolut process 

(fig. 2c–f). significantly, these process lead to a step-by-step 
movement of the metal inclus along the electr 
field direction, and reveal the microscop natur of the 
format and dissolut process of conduct filament in 
dielectrics. 

In general, giox and G 
i 
red can be impact by mani factor such 

a materi properties, local electr field, the amount of avail 
atoms/ion and charg compensation. As a result, complex 
electrochem dynam be expected, which could in turn lead 
to significantli differ filament growth behaviour that explain 
the contradict report in the literature10,20,22,25. for example, 
in our experiments, the Pt cluster that be form after the first 
nucleat process (fig. 2g) be never found to be dissolv 
again within the time frame of the in situ experiments, probabl 
due to the low giox for the newli form Pt clusters. In anoth 
case for Ni clusters, persist reduct of Ni ion (suppli from 
the larg Ni source) onto the cathod side of an exist Ni cluster 
lead to a backward growth toward the Ni source, a show in 
fig. 2i–l (also see supplementari movi 4). sinc the volum of 
the Ni sourc be hardli changed, the deposit of the Ni ion 
lead to a backward connect between the nanoclust bpe and 
the Ni sourc (fig. 2n). It should be note that the backward 
growth in thi case be still differ from the convent 
electrochem metal (ecm) model10,12,18, a the 
reduct process do not initi from the counter electrod 
but instead from a bpe insid the dielectric. As a result, the 
filament will form an extens of the anod instead of the 
cathod a predict by the ecm model. 

We have investig dozen of devic base on differ 
materials, and found it to be univers true that the appar 
movement of metal nanoclust be alway along the direct 
of the electr field (fig 1 and 2). differ electr fields, 
however, be requir for the migrat of differ metal within 
the measur time frame of sever minutes, a show in 
fig. 2h for ag, cu, Ni and pt. the dissolution/nucl of 
emb Ag cluster insid sio2 be found to be the easiest, 
typic requir an electr field of o1 MV cm� 1, while the 
electr field requir for Cu movement be slightli high but 
roughli in the same level. In contrast, the more inert Ni and Pt 
cluster requir much high electr field of 3–5 MV cm� 1. the 
differ electr field requir for the cluster migrat reflect 
the electrochem activ of the differ metal and thi 
observ explain whi Ag and Cu be more suitabl for metal 
filament-bas memrist devices9,10,12,18. In general, the eas of 
displac of nanoclust show a tendenc to increas a a 
function of the polariz of the half-cel reaction, that is, the 
agþ /ag redox reaction be typic consid in liquid 
electrolyt a ideal non-polarizable, wherea the polariz 
increas in the seri cu-ni-pt. moreover, ni- and pt-ion 
have high charg number and sizes, and their diffus in 
solid be suppress in contrari to ag- and cu-ion be well 
know a one of the most mobil ion in solids.

nanoclust can be use to design and tune the oper of 
novel electr devices. for example, memrist devic be base

from the migrat of discret metal nanoclust natur 
explain the filament growth dynam in memrist devices. 
specifically, the differ filament growth mode observ 
experimentally20,22 can now be reconcil in the same theoret 
framework. In a simplified, qualit model, the filament growth 
dynam may fall into four differ regim depend on the 
kinet factors. when the ion mobil (m) and the redox rate Gi 

be high and homogen (case a), the ion can reach the inert 
electrod without agglomerating, thu avoid nucleat within 
the insul film so filament growth initi from the inert 
electrode, and the larg amount of ion suppli (due to high gi) 
lead to an invert cone-shap filament12,18 with it base at the 
inert electrod interface, a schemat show in fig. 3a. thi be 
in agreement with the filament growth in convent ecm 
devices, and correspond to materi system with high ionic 
conduct (that is, larg amount of ion and high ion 
mobility). An experiment proof for case a be the in situ tem 
observ on devic base on cu–get electrolyte22. In 
contrast, in the other extrem of low and inhomogen m and 
low Gi (case b, fig. 3b), the ion can pile and reach the critic 
nucleat condit insid the dielectr and further filament 
growth be fulfil by cluster displac via the repeat 
splitting-merg process show in fig. 1. An experiment 
exampl be the filament growth in amorph si, where 
the filament be initi from the activ electrod and grow 
toward the inert electrod a discret nanoclusters20. thi case 

correspond to materi system with veri low ionic conductivity. 
instead, if the ion mobil be low while the redox rate be high 
(case c), nucleat can occur insid the dielectr while larg 
amount of atom can be deposit onto the cathod side of the 
nuclei, lead to gap fill show in fig. 3c. thi case 
correspond to observ in fig. 2i–l. after a connect 
between the nucleu and the activ electrod be made, the process be 
repeat thu again lead to an effect forward growth 
toward the inert electrode. finally, if the ion mobil m be high 
while the redox rate Gi be low (case d), nucleat onli occur at 
the counter electrod but the limit ion suppli mean reduct 
predomin occur at the edg with high field strengths, thu 
lead to branch filament growth toward the activ electrode, 
a show in fig. 3d. thi case correspond to the experiment 
observ in sputter sio2 films20, whose open structur and 
high defect densiti result in high m than evapor sio2. the 
differ experiment observ can thu be fulli account 
for in thi gener framework base on fundament 
electrochem processes. In general, the ion mobil in a 
give dielectr m determin the nucleat site and the 
direct of the filament growth, while the redox rate 
gidetermin the ion suppli and the geometri of the filament. 
By tune these kinet factors, differ growth mode and 
filament geometri can be potenti control in a systemat 
fashion. In practice, the local m and gican be affect by 
variat in the local defect density, defect energi profil and

local electrochem potenti so differ migrat mode may 
be observ simultan in the same system. 

To experiment verifi the theory, we perform in situ tem 
studi in actual resist memori structures. the devic consist 
of a ag/sio2/w structur with an evapor sio2 film cover a 
W probe. compar with sputter sio2, the evapor sio2 
here have less defect and low m, therefor thi system in gener 
fall into the low m, low Gi regime. the devic be directli form 
insid the tem column by connect a high-pur Ag wire with 
a movabl W probe coat with the sio2 film (fig. 4a, methods). 
repres result for a devic with a b40-nm-thick sio2 
film be show in fig. 4b–e (also see supplementari movi 5). 
the first visibl filament growth in the sio2 film be the 
appear of sever Ag cluster near the Ag electrod after 
B3 min (fig. 4b). thi be in agreement with the nucleat of 
metal nanoclust in fig 1 and 2. these cluster then behav a 
bpe dure subsequ growth. As expected, over time these 
cluster move closer to the inert electrode, follow the 
splitting-merg process discuss earli (fig. 1m–p) and 
correspond to case b. due to the high concentr of agþ 

ion near the Ag electrod and therefor the high probabl to 
overcom the nucleat barrier, more Ag cluster will be 
nucleat near the Ag electrod insid sio2 and the repeat 

nucleat and growth lead to the filament shape a observ 
fig. 4d. As predict for case b, thi growth mode lead to a 
conic shape filament (fig. 4d,e) with it base at the ag/sio2 
interfac and expand toward the inert electrode. such growth 
direct be in contrast to the convent ecm growth model 
for solid electrolytes10,18 but can be explain by the gener 
framework discuss above. the overal growth of the filament 
can be then character by the step-by-step movement of 
Ag cluster compon driven by the electrochem kinetics, 
a illustr by fig. 4f–j (more detail can be found in 
supplementari note 1). 

additionally, a featur reminisc of a void be observ in 
the sio2 film at the interfac region in fig. 4d,e, after larg 
amount of Ag atom have pass through. the void format be 
a clear sign of plastic deform of the dielectr film due to 
increas mechan stress that be introduc into the sio2. 
similar void have also be observ for the case of discret 
nanoclust (for example, fig. 1j–l,p). apart from facilit fast 
ion diffusion, the void (channels) provid space for continu 
movement of Ag cluster in a bootstrap fashion a show in 
fig. 4d,e. As the exist Ag cluster move away toward the inert

filament growth toward the inert electrode. the observ of 
the void channel format and the dynam step-by-step 
filament growth process will be fundament import for 
the understand and optim of memrist devic 
operations. 

analys the filament growth dynam also reveal effect 
that can have signific practic implic for devic 
operations. for example, fig. 5a show current–tim (i–t) 
depend of a ag/sio2/w devic with a limit Ag sourc by 
reduc the contact area between the Ag electrod and the sio2 
film. the correspond dynam filament growth tem imag 
be show in fig. 5b–f (also see supplementari movi 6). the 
devic be initi in a high-resist state and no filament 
growth be observed. At b100 s, an abrupt resist chang be 
observ correspond to the format of conduct chan- 
nel(s) insid the electrolyt (the dark region within the sio2) a 
show in fig. 5c,d. the filament formation, however, requir the 
consumpt of the Ag electrod which serf a the agþ ion 
supply. notably, in fig. 5a it be found that the current drop 
spontan after the initi filament formation. close exam- 
inat of the tem record reveal that the current drop be 
due to the deplet of the Ag sourc (the Ag electrode) at the ag/ 
sio2 interfac (fig. 5e,f) lead to the breakag of the contact. 
thi find particularli be of critic signific for memrist 
devic oper a the devic be scale toward the 10 nm 
range. the deplet of electrod be less of a concern for large- 
scale devic with a virtual infinit Ag reservoir compar with 
the volum need to form the filament (see supplementari 
fig. 1, supplementari movi 7, supplementari note 2). however, 
the consumpt of the electrod materi be no longer neglig 
when the devic size be push close to the scale limit, for 
example, where the electrod size be compar with the filament 
size. for example, supplementari fig. 2 and supplementari 
movi 8 show that when the devic size shrink to 30–40 nm, the 
immedi contact to the filament at the Ag electrode/sio2 
interfac can be lose after the initi filament growth, even though 
overal electr contact appear to be intact. 

the broken electr contact can be cure by refil the 
gap at the Ag electrode/sio2 interfac when posit voltag 
be continu appli on the Ag electrod (fig. 5h,i, 

supplementari movi 9). the surfac diffus of atom from 
the bulk of the Ag electrod into the gap be believ to drive thi 
process, mediat by inhomogen electr field distribut 
around the gap31. figur 5j show the electr field distribut 
through a multiphys simul (methods). A highli 
nonuniform electr field distribut be reveal and notic 
high electr field intens be see in the vicin of the nanogap, 
consist with the observ that Ag atom migrat toward 
the nano-gap region and refil the gap over time (see 
supplementari fig. 3, supplementari note 3). 

finally, we show that differ growth mode can coexist in the 
same devic when the growth dynam can be properli tuned, a 
show in fig. 6. after an initi growth period character by 
the step-by-step bootstrap growth mode (fig. 6b–h, also see 
supplementari movi 10), the Ag cluster suddenli transform 
into a much larger, domin filament in fig. 6i, accompani by 
a significantli increas in current of 41ma (fig. 6a). here the 
newli form filament have a much wider base on the W cathod 
side and grow backward toward the Ag electrode, and be much 
more solid, impli a transit to the convent ecm 
growth mode show in fig. 3a. the structur of the new, solid 
filament be analys use high-resolut transmiss electron 
microscopy, where (111) plane of element Ag be clearli 
resolv (fig. 6j) suggest the filament correspond to a 
crystallin Ag wire. the transit to the ecm mode (with high m 
and gi) can be explain by the increas of the devic 
temperatur due to the format of the origin filament, lead 
to significantli increas m and Gi (ref 18,32). the increas in 
agþ ion mobil mean that the ion have a much high 
probabl to reach the W cathod instead of pile insid the 
oxid through nucleation, a the increas temperatur retard 
stabl nucleu formation33. the combin of these effect 
suppress the step-by-step cluster growth but enhanc the rate 
of direct agþ reduct at the W cathode, lead to the 
convent ecm growth.

the cluster interact and format process be strongli 
affect by kinet factor lead to differ shape and growth 
mode of the cluster that can be observ experimentally. four 
type of metal system and two type of devic structur be 
studied, and base on these extens experiment observations, 
we suggest a gener framework govern the electrochemi- 
cal dynam of the metal clusters. the nanoclust be found 
to act a bpe under electr field, with their dissolut and 
nucleat process mediat by the compet electrochem 
reaction on both sides. By control the kinet factor 
includ ion mobil and redox rates, differ growth mode 
can be achiev and verifi experimentally. thi framework well 
explain the appar contradict experiment observ 
of filament growth in memrist devices, and provid critic 
insight into the principl of devic operations. our qualit 
model may help to develop a more quantit and microscop 
model for electr field-induc nanoion base on two main 
kinet factors, ion mobil and redox rate. these find can be 
readili expand to materi and devic system where control- 
ling the metal inclus dynam (or avoid such) be critic 
and will have signific theoret and practic impacts. 

method 
in situ tem. the in situ tem experi be carri out use a nanofactori 
scan tunnel microscopi platform insid a jeol 3011 tem oper at 
300 kv. for sampl with emb metal clusters, the bottom electrod be 
grounded, while the top electrod be individu address by the movabl W 
probe, control by a piezomotor in the nanofactori system. for the ag/sio2/w 
devices, the specimen be prepar by deposit a conform sio2 film on a W 
probe (bruker), and the probe be then mount on the moveabl end of a single- 
tilt tem holder. A high-pur Ag wire (99.99%, goodfellow) be fix on the 
other end of the tem holder, serv a the activ electrode. the ag/sio2/w 
devic structur be form insid the tem column when contact be achiev 
between the probe and the Ag wire. dure in situ experi on both type of 
devices, electr signal be appli to the devic and measur through 
a low-nois keithley 4200 semiconductor character system. the movi be 
record simultan with the electr measurements. 

prepar of fib samples. the tem specimen with emb ag, cu, Ni and 
Pt metal nanoclust be prepar by fib. first, Au film (400 nm) with a nicr 
adhes layer (20 nm) be deposit on sio2/si substrat by electron beam 
evaporation, serv a the bottom electrodes. afterwards, a sio2 layer with a 
thick of b20 nm be evaporated, follow by the evapor of thin ag, cu, 
Ni or Pt metal layers. A second sio2 layer with a similar thick of b20 nm be 
then evaporated. the sampl be then subject to rapid thermal anneal 

process in ar. the metal layer form nanoclust emb in the sio2 film 
dure anneal when the metal film be thin enough (b1 nm). afterwards, a 100- 
nm thick Au film be evapor to form the top electrode. the tem specimen 
be then prepar out of these sampl by success fib lift-out, pattern and 
thin processes. the devic be design in such a configur that all the 
devic in the same sampl have individu top electrod while share the bottom 
electrode. the lift-out, pattern and thin process be conduct on a 
dual-beam fib system (fei helio nanolab 650 fib workstation). dure fib 
patterning, low-energi gaþ mill with extrem care be use to obtain high- 
qualiti and thin tem specimen in order to reduc the project effect caus by 
cluster distribut in the Z direction. 

prepar of sampl on W probes. silicon dioxid film be deposit on W 
tip in high vacuum at a low evapor rate of 0.01 nm s� 1 by electron beam 
evaporation. the sio2 film thick be adjust in the rang of 10–50 nm. the 
sampl be check by tem, and the sio2 film be found to be fulli 
conformal. 

simulations. electr field simul be perform use a comsol multi- 
physic packag base on finit element analysis. simul on cluster movement 
dynam via split and merg process be perform use a custom 
matlab code base on equat (2–3) by assum giox ¼ 0 for the nanoclust 
downstream. the two interact nanoclust be model by perfect sphere 
with a constant total volume, and the maximum distanc between the two spheric 
surfac (from the leftmost posit on the left sphere to the rightmost posit on 
the right sphere) be assum fix when their diamet vari dure the elec- 
trochem oxid and reduct processes.
