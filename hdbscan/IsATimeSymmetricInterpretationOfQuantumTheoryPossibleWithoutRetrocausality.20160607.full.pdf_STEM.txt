huw price have propos an argument that suggest 
a time symmetr ontolog for quantum theori 
must necessarili be retrocausal, i.e. it must involv 
influenc that travel backward in time. one of 
price’ assumpt be that the quantum state be 
a state of reality. however, one of the reason 
for explor retrocaus be that it offer the 
potenti for evad the consequ of no-go 
theorems, includ recent proof of the realiti of the 
quantum state. here, we show that thi assumpt 
can be replac by a differ assumption, call 
λ-mediation, that plausibl hold independ of 
the statu of the quantum state. We also reformul 
the other assumpt behind the argument to place 
them in a more gener framework and pin down the 
notion of time symmetri involv more precisely. We 
show that our assumpt impli a timelik analogu 
of bell’ local causal criterion and, in do so, 
give a new interpret of timelik violat of bell 
inequalities. namely, they show the imposs of a 
(non-retrocausal) time symmetr ontology. 

1. introduct 
price [1] give an argument to the effect that ani time 
symmetr ontolog for quantum theori must involv 
retrocaus (influenc that travel backward in time). 
price’ argument be base on analys an experi 
where a singl photon be pass through two polar 
beamsplitt in sequence.

one of price’ assumptions, which he call realism,1 be realli an assumpt of the realiti of 
the quantum state. briefly, he assum that the usual forwards-evolv polar vector of a 
photon emerg from a polar beam splitter be a real physic properti of the photon. thi be 
an assumpt of the realiti of the quantum state becaus the polar vector be isomorph 
to the part of the quantum state that describ the polar degre of freedom. price us 
this, togeth with hi other assumptions, to argu that there must also be a backward evolv 
polar vector come from the second beam splitter that be orient along it measur 
direction, and henc there be retrocausality. 

the realiti of both forward and backward evolv state impli by price’ argument 
occur in the transact interpret of quantum theori [2,3] and be reminisc of the two 
state vector formal of aharonov and collabor [4,5]. indeed, if we interpret the two state 
vector in the formal a a descript of reality, rather than just a conveni mathemat 
way of re-express the predict of quantum theori in situat of pre- and post-selection, 
then thi theori satisfi price’ assumptions. 

however, one possibl respons to price’ argument be to simpli deni the realiti of the 
quantum state, in favour of the ψ-epistem view, which say that the quantum state be not a 
physic properti of a system, but rather someth more akin to a probabl distribution, such 
a a liouvil distribut in statist mechanics. In other words, it describ our knowledg 
about the quantum system rather than be an intrins properti of an individu system. 
If we do not believ that the forward evolv state vector be a state of reality, then neither 
price’ argument nor the two state vector formal provid evid that we should view 
the backward evolv state vector a a state of reality. the ψ-epistem view provid 
natur explan for mani quantum phenomenon that be otherwis puzzling, such a the 
indistinguish of quantum state and the no-clon theorem, which have be discuss in 
detail elsewher [6,7]. although sever recent result [8–20] (see [7] for a review) cast doubt on 
the viabil of the ψ-epistem view, all of these result assum that there be no retrocausality, 
so allow for retrocaus be a potenti appeal way of save the ψ-epistem view. 
becaus of this, it would be prefer not to rule out ψ-epistem theori a priori when make 
an argument for retrocausality. 

the first aim of thi paper be to construct an altern to price’ argument, which do not 
assum the realiti of the quantum state. thi turn out to be possibl use a differ assumpt 
that we call λ-mediation, which plausibl hold independ of the statu of the quantum state. 
briefly, it say that ani correl between a prepar and a measur make on a system 
should be mediat by the physic properti of the system. there be a close parallel between 
the relationship between price’ argument and our and the relationship between the einstein– 
podolsky–rosen (epr) argument and bell’ theorem. In fact, our assumpt impli a timelik 
analogu of bell’ local causal condition. It be well know that sequenc of measur 
make on the same system can violat bell inequalities, the signific of which have long 
be debat [21–33]. our argument provid a new spin on this—tempor bell violat 
can be view a proof of the imposs of a time symmetr ontolog (unless we allow 
retrocausality). 

the second aim of thi paper be to clarifi and extend the scope of the other assumpt behind 
price’ argument. like bell’ theorem, we be aim for a result that be independ of the detail 
of quantum theory, so that we can say whether or not a give oper theori allow for a time 
symmetr ontology. In order to do this, we have to replac one of price’ assumptions, which he 
call discret by a broader principl that can be formul at thi level of generality. do 
so clarifi the precis notion of time symmetri that be at stake in the argument. 

In particular, an obviou object to both price’ and our argument be that unitari evolut 
accord to the schrödinger equat be time symmetric, in the convent sens of time 
symmetri of dynam laws. therefore, an interpret like everett/many-world [34–36], 
in which a unitarili evolv quantum state be the entir ontology, be time symmetr without

requir retrocausality. the same be true of interpret that supplement thi pictur with 
addit variabl that also evolv under time symmetr equat of motion, such a de 
broglie–bohm (dbb) theori [37–40]. hence, a direct infer from the convent notion of 
time symmetri to retrocaus be out of the question. 

In price’ version of the argument, these theori be rule out by discreteness. thi say that 
if a photon be detect at one of the output port of a polar beamsplitt then noth come 
out of the other port of the beamsplitter. thi assumpt be need so that a photon exit a 
beamsplitt and then be detect can be treat a the time revers of insert a photon into 
a beamsplitt through a definit port. everett and dbb violat thi assumpt because, when a 
photon exit a beamsplitter, there be branch of the quantum state that exit along each of the 
ports. these repres what will becom differ world in everett, and they be empti wave 
that do not contain a particl in dbb. 

We also note that there be some tension between the discret and realism assumptions. 
realism requir that the quantum state of the system should be real while it be travel between 
the two beamsplitters. If thi be true, then it would be natur to requir that the quantum state 
exit the second beamsplitt should also be real, even though thi be not strictli requir by 
realism. however, thi would contradict discreteness. the tension be remov if we allow for ψ- 
epistem models, sinc then the branch of the quantum state that exit the port of the beamsplitt 
on which the photon be not detect need not correspond to anyth real.2 

In our view, the symmetri between prepar and measur in quantum theori be 
the main motiv for discreteness, so we prefer to base our version of the argument on the 
former, a it make it clearer that the argument involv a differ notion of time symmetri than 
the convent one. discret itself would be difficult to formul at the level of gener 
we be tri to achiev in ani case. It be know that sequenc of quantum experi 
can be describ by a retrodict formal [42–45], in which quantum state be associ 
with measur outcom and be evolv backward in time to preparations, which be 
in turn describ by what we normal think of a ‘measurement’ operators. the symmetri 
in question be that the retrodict formal be mathemat ident to the convent 
predict formalism, in which quantum state be evolv forward in time from prepar 
to measurement, so everi quantum experi have a kind of time reverse, in which the role 
of the predict and retrodict oper be exchanged. A simpl exampl follow from the 
observ that |〈φ |ψ〉|2 = |〈ψ | φ〉|2. consid two experiments, the first of which consist of 
prepar one state uniformli at random from a complet orthonorm basi {|ψn〉}, and then 
measur in anoth orthonorm basi {|φm〉}. In the second experiment, the order be reversed, 
so that a state be prepar uniformli at random from {|φm〉} and then measur in the basi 
{|ψn〉}. becaus |〈φm |ψn〉|2 = |〈ψn | φm〉|2, the joint probabl of obtain |ψn〉 and |φm〉 be the 
same in both experiments. hence, the predict probabl of obtain |φm〉 give that |ψn〉 be 
prepar in the first experi be the same a the retrodict probabl of have prepar |φm〉 
give that the measur outcom be |ψn〉 in the second experiment. our time symmetri 
assumpt say that thi symmetry, which be a symmetri of the oper predict of 
quantum theory, should be take serious a a fundament symmetri and, therefore, also 
impos at the ontolog level. We formul thi assumpt rigorously, independ of the 
detail of quantum theory, and base our argument on it. note that time symmetri be differ 
from the usual notion of time symmetri of dynam laws, and neither everett nor dbb satisfi 
the former. 

given this, one might question whether time symmetri be realli necessary. however, our 
assumpt do bear a famili resembl to the assumpt behind other no-go theorem 
that be often regard a reasonable. In particular, spekkens’ notion of non-contextu say 

2in ani case, the relev time symmetri do not requir discreteness. briefly, if we allow that the vacuum may be repres 
by a probabl distribut over more than one ontic state then there be someth non-trivi that enter both port of the 
first beamsplitt when we insert the photon along a definit port. then, have someth exit both port of the second 
beamsplitt need not prevent the necessari time symmetry. see [41] for an explan of quantum interfer along these 
lines.

that experiment procedur that be oper indistinguish ought to be repres in 
the same way at the ontolog level [46]. time symmetri could be motiv by a principl 
that extend thi to say that a symmetri of the oper predict ought to also hold at the 
ontolog level. spekkens’ principl be then just the special case where the symmetri be ident 
of oper predictions. while one might quibbl about appli thi principl to everi 
possibl symmetri of the oper predictions, some of which may be accidental, it seem 
reason to appli it to fundament symmetries, and time symmetri be pretti fundamental. 
We therefor think that it be surpris that a convent realist (non-retrocausal) interpret 
cannot satisfi time symmetri and that the fact that everett and dbb do not be a genuin 
defici of those theories. 

the remaind of thi paper be structur a follows. In §2, we outlin sever notion of time 
symmetri and explain how the notion use in thi paper differ from the convent one. 
section 3 introduc our oper formal for prepare-and-measur experiments. section 4 
formal defin our oper notion of time symmetri and show that quantum theori 
satisfi it. section 5 and 6 mirror thi structur at the ontolog level. section 5 introduc 
our main assumpt about realist model of oper theories, includ No retrocaus 
and λ-mediation, and §6 defin our notion of ontolog time symmetry. section 7 explain our 
time symmetri assumption, which be that oper time symmetri should be reflect at 
the ontolog level. section 8 contain our main results. section 8a prof that model satisfi 
our assumpt must obey bell’ local causal condit for timelik experiments. section 8b 
give a simpl exampl of how quantum theori violat this, and §8c show that there be an 
isomorph between spacelik and timelik experiments, which allow u to port all exist 
result about violat of bipartit bell inequ with entangl state to the timelik context. 
In §9, we compar our assumpt with price’ and reformul the logic of hi argument in 
our framework. section 10 explain whi dbb and everett do not satisfi time symmetry, but 
thi do not conflict with their dynam time symmetry. section 11 discu the relat of 
our main result with spekkens’ notion of prepar contextu and discu the relev 
of experi that have recent be conduct to test this. In §12, we conclud by discuss 
which assumpt ought to be give up in the light of our results. 

2. time symmetri 
the usual notion of time symmetri use in physic be a symmetri of the dynamics, wherein there 
be a one-to-on correspond between solut to the equat of motion and solut to the 
modifi equat obtain by replac t with −t. however, thi be not the onli notion of time 
symmetri worth considering. We start from the more inform idea that time symmetri be the 
inabl to tell whether a video of a physic process be run forward or backwards, and note 
that thi can be formal in sever differ ways. 

first of all, it matter if one realli mean an actual video, which can onli captur thing that 
be observable, or whether the video be mere a conceptu stand in for a complet record of 
everyth that exists. We call the former kind of time symmetri an oper time symmetri and 
the latter an ontolog time symmetry. our argument make use of both kind of time symmetri 
and be base on the assumpt that one should take an oper symmetri a evid for an 
ontolog one. We formal oper time symmetri in §4, after introduc our oper 
formal in §3, and we formal ontolog time symmetri in §6, after we have introduc the 
ontolog framework in §5. 

second, it make a differ whether one be onli interest in whether a give video be possibl 
in both time directions, or whether there be a process that make it equal like in both time 
directions. A smash glass spontan reconstitut itself be not imposs accord to the 
law of physics. accord to the usual notion of dynam time symmetry, a spontan 
reconstitut glass be a possibl solut to the equat of motion whenev an unbroken glass 
smash into piec is. however, a spontan reconstitut glass be vastli less likely, give 
the low entropi initi condit of the universe. In the light of this, we can consid a strong

notion of time symmetri in which we also demand that the probabl of occurr should 
be the same in both time directions. thi holds, for example, for system that be in thermal 
equilibrium. It be thi strong notion of time symmetri that we will be consid here. Of 
course, the univers a a whole do not display such time symmetry, and we will not be assum 
that it does. however, it be possibl to construct experi that have thi time-symmetri at the 
oper level. our main assumpt will be that, if thi be the case, the same symmetri ought 
to hold at the ontolog level a well. 

3. oper formal 
We will be discuss experi consist of three stages, a prepar P, a transform 
T and a measur M (figur 1). each prepar and measur have an input, which be 
under the control of the experimenter, and an output, which they do not directli control, i.e. 
the output may be correl with the inputs, but the experiment do not have ani further 
control over the output other than via choos the inputs. As an example, in price’ argument, 
both the prepar and measur devic be polar beam splitter and, in both cases, 
the input be the choic of angl at which to orient the beamsplitter. for the measurement, the 
output be which output port of the beamsplitt the photon be detect on. for the preparation, the 
output be the choic of which input port to insert the photon into the beamsplitt from. note here 
that our distinct between input and output should be thought of a the distinct between 
control and uncontrol variabl and do not necessarili repres the order in which 
thing happen to the photon. the photon be insert into the input port befor it encount 
the beamsplitt orient at a certain angle. nonetheless, the angl be our ‘input’ and the port 
be our ‘output’ becaus the former be control by the experiment and the latter be not. the 
choic of input port be in principl control by the experiment but, in the specif set-up 
use by price, it be not actual control by them, but rather by a third party, which price call 
the ‘demon of the left’. for thi reason, it be import not to think of the input a consist of 
everyth that be in principl control by the experiment and the output a everyth 
that be in principl uncontrollable, but rather the input be the variabl that they actual control 
and the output be variabl that they do not actual control, even if some of them be in 
principl controllable. To make the argument work, it be necessari to place constraint on what 
the experiment controls. We shall return to the reason and justif for thi in §4. 

although, in price’ argument, the output of the prepar repres someth that 
happen to the photon befor the input, it be import to note that the input be alway chosen 
befor the output. the experiment decid how to orient the beamsplitt and then the ‘demon 
of the left’ choos on which port to insert the photon. In general, we should think of prepar 
and measur a black-box devices, which have a set switch that allow the experiment 
to choos the input and a pointer or screen that subsequ display the output. regardless of 
what be happen insid the black box, the oper act of choos the input alway happen 
befor the output be displayed, so, in a non-retrocaus theory, the input can causal influenc the 
output but not vice versa. 

the final piec of the set-up be the transformation, which just repres the dynam of 
the system between prepar and measurement. In price’ example, thi be trivial a the

polar degre of freedom do not evolv a it pass between the two beamsplitters, but 
we will consid what happen when dynamics, which may includ decoher and loss to 
the environment, be add to the picture. 

An oper theori specifi a set P of possibl preparations, a set M of possibl 
measur and a set T of possibl transformations. In general, a theori may includ differ 
type of systems, e.g. in quantum theori we have photons, atoms, etc., that have differ degre 
of freedom and be describ by hilbert space of differ dimensionality. therefore, not everi 
preparation, transform and measur need be compat with one another, e.g. it do 
not make sens to use a devic for measur the energi of an atom to measur the polar 
of a photon. We call a tripl (p, M, T) of preparation, measur and transform that be 
compat with each other an experiment. for everi experi (p, M, t), the oper theori 
must also specifi a predict of the probabl of the output variabl of P and M, give the 
choic of input variables. We write these probabl a ppmt(a, b | x, y), where x be the input of P 
and a be it output, and y be the input of M and b be it output. 

for example, in quantum theory, a prepar P be associ with a hilbert space ha, a set 
of (unnormalized) densiti oper {ρaa|x} on ha—on for each choic of x and a—such that the 
ensembl averag densiti oper ρa|x = 

∑ 
a ρaa|x be normal tr(ρa|x) = 1. the prepar 

procedur start with the experiment choos x. the prepar devic then gener a 
classic variabl a with probabl distribut p(a | x) = tr(ρaa|x), output a and prepar the 
system in the correspond (normalized) state ρaa|x/p(a | x), which be subsequ fed into the 
transform device. 

A measur M be describ by a set {eb|yb} of posit operator-valu measur (povms) 
on a hilbert space hb—one povm for each choic of y. thi mean that for each (y, b), eb|yb be a 
posit operator, and for all y, 

∑ 
b eb|yb = ib, where IB be the ident oper on hb. 

A transform be describ by a complet positive, trace-preserv (cpt) map E from the 
densiti oper on the input hilbert space hin to the densiti oper on the output hilbert 
space hout. We allow hin and hout to differ becaus the transform may involv discard 
part of the system into the environ or add ancillas. 

A tripl (p, M, T) be an experi onli if hin =ha and hout =hb, in which case we write the 
cp-map a eb|a. 

for such an experiment, by the born rule, quantum theori predict the probabl 

ppmt(a, b | x, y) = tr(eb|ybeb|a(ρaa|x)). (3.1) 

4. oper time symmetri 
definit 4.1. An experi (p, M, T) have an oper time revers if there exist anoth 

experi (p′, m′, t′), where P′ have the same set of input and output a M, M′ have the same set 
of input and output a P, and 

pp′m′t′ (b, a | y, x) = ppmt(a, b | x, y) (4.1) 
An oper theori have oper time symmetri if everi experi have an oper 

time reverse. 

for each run of an experiment, consid a record of the input and output of the prepar 
and measur (x, a, y, b). the experi be repeat an arbitrarili larg number of time with 
each choic of input and the record be present to a third party, without tell them what the 
preparation, measur and transform actual is. We also give them the same record 
with the order of prepar and measur variabl revers (y, b, x, a). if, know the 
theory, they cannot tell which be the true record and which be the revers one, then the theori 
have oper time symmetry. 

one might think that input and output also ought to be swap in the revers record. 
however, recal that our notion of input and output do not directli relat to time ordering, but 
be rather to do with control versu uncontrol variables. for a preparation, all variabl be

in principl controllable, so the specif of which variabl be input and which be output 
be fairli arbitrari at thi stage. however, we shall be particularli interest in experi in 
which the experiment have the same degre of control over a measur a they do over a 
preparation, in which case the distinct between control and uncontrol variabl will be 
the same in both the true record and the time revers one. 

note that, we be not assum that everi experi ought to have an oper time 
reverse. At thi point, it be just a definition. In fact, it would be unnatur to impos thi for the 
simpl reason that it be possibl to send a signal forward in time, but not backward in time. 
formally, we expect an oper theori to satisfy∑ 

b 

ppmt(a, b | x, y) = 
∑ 

b 

ppmt(a, b | x, y′), (4.2) 

for all y and y′, so that the output of the prepar cannot be use to infer ani inform about 
the input of the measurement, but there be no reason whi the output of the measur should 
not contain inform about the input of the preparation, so we do not expect∑ 

a 
ppmt(a, b | x, y) = 

∑ 
a 

ppmt(a, b | x′, y), (4.3) 

to hold in gener for x �= x′. If it do not hold, then equat (4.2) prevent the experi from 
have an oper time reverse. 

however, we do not believ that the lack of oper time symmetri be a fundament 
asymmetri of physics, but be rather a consequ of the thermodynam arrow of time. 
specifically, an oper descript of an experi is, by definition, a descript of the 
experi from the point of view of the experimenter. the experiment have a subject arrow 
of time. thi mean that she can rememb the past but not the future, and also that her past seem 
fix but her futur seem open and unpredictable. It be usual thought that the subject arrow 
of time be a consequ of the thermodynam arrow becaus both memori and control consum 
a suppli of extern low entropi systems. for example, turn a knob from an initi unknown 
posit to a definit set be an erasur process, which increas entropi by landauer’ 
principl [47]. 

becaus of this, an experiment typic have more control over the prepar than the 
measurement, but there be reason to believ that thi be an emergent, rather than fundamental, 
asymmetry. hypothetically, if it be possibl for the experiment to have a subject arrow 
of time point in the opposit direct to the arrow of time use to describ the rest of the 
experiment, then presum they would be abl to control the measur outcom to the 
same degre that we can control the preparation. 

In order to identifi the fundament oper time symmetries, we want to factor out thi 
emerg asymmetri in some way. one way of do thi would be to simul full control over 
the measur outcom by allow post-selection. although we could do thing thi way, 
post-select significantli complic the analysis. for our purposes, it be suffici to instead 
restrict the experimenter’ control over the prepar procedure, so that she cannot send signal 
forward in time. do thi play the same role a the ‘demon of the left’ in price’ argument. 

definit 4.2. A prepar P be no-signal if, for all M ∈M and T ∈ T such that (p, M, T) be 
an experiment, ∑ 

a 
ppmt(a, b | x, y) = 

∑ 
a 

ppmt(a, b | x′, y), (4.4) 

for all x and x′. 
pn denot the set of all no-signal prepar in an oper theory. the no-signal 

sector of an oper theori be the oper theori in which P be restrict to pns. 
note that the no-signal sector of an oper theori need not be oper time 

symmetric. however, it be in both quantum theori and classic probabl theory. thi be 
therefor a non-trivi time symmetri that our present physic law obey, which be differ from 
the convent notion of time symmetr dynam laws.

proof. first, note that a quantum prepar be no-signal iff the ensembl averag state 
be the same for all inputs, otherwis there would be a measur that predict differ 
probabl for differ prepar inputs. therefore, we can defin ρA = ρa|x, which be 
independ of x. 

given an experi (p, M, t), where P be no-signalling, we have to defin an oper 
time revers (p′, m′, t′) that predict the same probabilities. To do this, we make use of quantum 
version of bayes’ rule, a describ in [45]. 

specifically, let ρaa|x be the state associ with P, let eb|yb be the povm element associ 
with M and let eb|a be the cpt map associ with T. We first defin the povm element ea|xa 
associ with M′ via 

ea|xa = ρ−1/2a ρaa|xρ 
−1/2 
A . (4.5) 

thi should be understood a an equat on the subspac supp(ρa) of ha, so that ρA have a well- 
defin inverse. It be easi to check that these oper be posit and 

∑ 
a ea|xa = isupp(ρa). If we 

want HA to be the hilbert space associ with m′, then the oper ea|xa may be extend 
by add an arbitrari povm on the orthogon subspac to them. alternatively, we can just let 
supp(ρa) to be the hilbert space of m′. 

next, it be conveni to defin the ensembl averag state at the output of the transform 
a ρB = eb|a(ρa). then, we can defin the state associ with P′ a 

ρbb|i = ρ1/2b eb|ybρ 
1/2 
B . (4.6) 

It be easi to check that these oper be posit and 
∑ 

b ρbb|i = ρb, so the ensembl averag be 
a normal densiti operator. 

finally, we defin the cpt map associ with T′ a 

ea|b( · ) = ρ1/2a e†b|a(ρ 
−1/2 
B ( · )ρ 

−1/2 
B )ρ 

1/2 
A , (4.7) 

where e†b|a be the adjoint of eb|a, i.e. the uniqu map that satisfi tr(mae 
† 
b|a(nb)) = 

tr(nbeb|a(ma)) for all oper MA on HA and all oper NB on hb. the map ea|b should 
be understood a a map from densiti oper on supp(ρb) to densiti oper on ha, and we 
can extend it to HB arbitrarili if necessary. the choi–jamiołkowski isomorph [48,49] can be 
use to verifi that thi be a well-defin cpt map, a be do in [45]. 

with these definitions, it be straightforward to verifi that 

pp′m′t′ (b, a | y, x) = tr(ea|xaea|b(ρbb|y)) 
= tr(eb|ybeb|a(ρaa|x)) = ppmt(a, b | x, y), 

a required. � 

5. ontolog formal 
So far, we have onli be discuss the oper predict of a theory. We now wish to 
consid the possibl that the system have some real physic properti between prepar 
and measur that be respons for mediat ani correl between the two. 

there be a standard framework for discuss this, know a the ontolog model framework 
[50]. We think that thi be a well-motiv framework, but becaus the ontolog model 
framework implicitli assum that there be no retrocausality, and the necess of retrocaus be 
precis the point at issue, we will break thing down into four more primit assumptions, so 
that the role of the no retrocaus assumpt can be see more clearly. thi will also facilit 
a comparison with price’ assumpt in §9. 

We will use influenc diagram (a gener of bayesian network that allow for decis 
nodes) [51] to illustr our assumptions, but familiar with such diagram be not assumed.

assumpt 5.1 (single-world). realism: the system have some physic properties, a 
specif of which be call it ontic state, denot λ. ontic state take valu in a (measurable) 
set Λ call the ontic state space.3 

On each run of an experiment, the oper variabl (input x and y, and output a and 
b) and the ontic state λ each take a definit value. our uncertainti about these variabl can be 
describ accord to classic probabl theory. 

the idea here be that λ repres properti of the system that exist, but may not be 
directli observable. for example, in a classic experi in statist mechanics, we may onli 
have oper access to variabl describ the macrostate; such a pressure, volum and 
temperature; and the ontic state would be the microstate, i.e. a specif of the posit 
and momentum of each particle. the idea be that perhap the way in which we can manipul 
a quantum system be limit in a similar way. 

the exact ontic state may be unknown to the experimenter, but it be in principl knowable, 
even if we cannot actual construct an experi that would reveal it. It be for thi reason that 
we consid the use of classic probabl to be part and parcel of the definit of realism. 
becaus λ take a specif valu in each run of experiment, you can in principl resolv a bet on 
it valu and it have a definit rel frequenc in a sequenc of runs, so howev you prefer to 
interpret probabl theory, the standard argument for it use apply. although it be sometim 
posit that quantum theori should be understood in term of a non-standard probabl theory, 
we have yet to see an interpret of such a theori that be realist in character. 

our realism be singl world becaus we assum that the full specif of the ontolog 
includ definit valu for the oper variables, e.g. measur outcomes. thi rule 
out everett/many-worlds. however, adopt everett/many-world be not actual a way out 
of our no-go theorem becaus it do not have the kind of time symmetri we be interest in. 
therefore, it be possibl that the argument present here be generaliz to interpret that 
involv multipl worlds, but we do not know how to do thi yet. 

assumpt 5.2. free choice: the experi can be describ by a condit probabl 
distribut ppmt(a, b, λ | x, y). We assum that the experiment be free to choos x and y, howev 
they like. 

what we mean by free choic of x and y be that the experiment can set the probabl 
p(x, y) for the input in ani way that she likes, so that the joint probabl be ppmt(a, b, λ, x, y) = 
ppmt(a, b, λ | x, y)p(x, y). all possibl combin of input can be test in a mani run a she 
likes.4 In the languag of influenc diagrams, x and y be decis nodes, repres by squar 
in figur 2. In particular, x and y have no direct causes, i.e. no parent in the graph. 

definit 5.3. given an experi (p, M, t), a specif of an ontic state spaceλ togeth 
with a condit probabl distribut ppmt(a, b, λ | x, y) be call an ontic extens of the 
experiment. the ontic extens be requir to reproduc the predict of the oper theori 
upon margin over λ, i.e. 

∫ 
Λ 

ppmt(a, b, λ | x, y) dλ= ppmt(a, b | x, y). (5.1) 

We denot an ontic extens by (p, M, t,λ), leav the probabl implicit. 
A choic of ontic extens for each experi in an oper theori be call an ontic 

extens of the theory. 

realism and free choic be assum in the vast major of work on realist approach to 
quantum theory. We shall, therefore, tend to just assum that experi have ontic extensions, 
rather than mention these two assumpt explicitly. 

3we adopt ‘physicists’ rigour’ and ignor measure-theoret complic here. they can be handl along the line of the 
treatment in [7]. 
4for this, it be suffici to choos x and y independ and uniformli at random, a be do in an ideal bell experiment.

λ-mediation. 

for the remaind of thi section, we will concentr on a singl experi (p, M, t), so we 
will drop the subscript on the probabl distributions. 

assumpt 5.4. No retrocausality: all non-input variabl should be condit 
independ of input variabl in their future, give a specif of all the variabl in their 
past. 

the possibl causal depend that be compat with no retrocaus be illustr in 
figur 2. our assumpt can be understood a say that p(a, b, λ | x, y) should obey the causal 
markov condit with respect to thi diagram. 

In more detail, a gener condit probabl distribut p(a, b, λ | x, y) can be 
decompos a 

p(a, b, λ | x, y) = p(b | a, λ, x, y)p(λ | a, x, y)p(a | x, y). (5.2) 
the No retrocaus assumpt impli that we should have p(a | x, y) = p(a | x) and p(λ | 

a, x, y) = p(λ | a, x). the first of these two condit say that there be no signal from futur 
to past, which we expect the oper theori to obey in ani case. the second be the more 
substant assumption, often call measur independence, and we expect thi to be violat 
in a theori with retrocausality. the no retrocaus assumpt impli that the probabl can 
be decompos a 

p(a, b, λ | x, y) = p(b | a, λ, x, y)p(λ | a, x)p(a | x). (5.3) 
assumpt 5.5. λ-mediation: the ontic state λ mediat ani remain correl between 

the prepar and the measurement, i.e. p(b | a, λ, x, y) = p(b | λ, y).5 

In the languag of influenc diagrams, the arrow from a and x to b be eliminated, and we be 
left with the causal structur illustr in figur 3. 

the λ-mediat assumpt be realli just part of the definit of what we mean by an ontic 
state. the properti of the system be suppos to be the caus of the correl between 
prepar and measurement. If there be other causal link between them, e.g. a telephon 
wire, then we be not realli do an experi on the system alone, but on the system in 

5in fact, our main result can be deriv under the weaker assumpt that the ontic state λ and the prepar input x 
mediat ani remain correl between the prepar output and the measur output, i.e. p(b | a, λ, x, y) = p(b | 
λ, x, y). however, we see no good reason to allow a direct causal connect from x to b while disallow a causal connect 
from a to b.

combin with someth else. If there be no such links, but we still allow correl that 
be left unexplain by the ontic state, then we do not realli have a realist model. 

togeth with No retrocausality, thi assumpt impli that the probabl can be 
decompos a 

p(a, b, λ | x, y) = p(b | λ, y)p(λ | a, x)p(a | x). (5.4) 

definit 5.6. An ontic extens of an experi that satisfi No retrocaus and 
λ-mediation, i.e. it probabl decompos accord to equat (5.4), be call an ontolog 
model of the experiment. 

for comparison with other work, note that p(λ | a, x) be usual call the epistem state of 
the system and p(b | λ, y) be call the respons function of the measur device. normally, when 
prove theorem about realist account of quantum theory, the ontolog model framework be 
simpli assum at the outset. here, we see that it be base on sever non-trivi assumptions. 

note that we need to state the No retrocaus assumpt befor we could even 
formul λ-mediation. In a theori with retrocausality, we would want to retain some notion 
that correl between prepar and measur be caus by the ontic properti of the 
system, but we have no licens to infer condit independ from thi if causal loop be 
possible. therefore, λ-mediat would have to be replac by someth else. what thi might 
be will be discuss in futur work. 

6. ontolog time symmetri 
our notion of ontolog time symmetri can be formul without assum No retrocaus 
or λ-mediation. thi be fortunate, a it be someth we might wish to preserv in a retrocaus 
theory. nonetheless, it be worth paus to think about the role of λ in an ontolog model in 
order to understand how to formul ontolog time reversal. 

for a classic system, λ be often take to be the phase space point occupi by the system, 
but thi do not complet pin it down. We could take λ to be the phase space point 
immedi after the preparation, immedi befor the measurement, or even let λ(t) be the 
entir trajectori through phase space between prepar and measurement. given knowledg 
of the transform T, which in thi case be a specif of the hamiltonian of the system, 
each of these choic be suffici to screen off the prepar from the measurement. there be 
mani other choic besid these, such a specifi ani part of the phase space trajectory, or 
dispens with phase space entir and specifi the configur space point at two differ 
times. each of these choic would be equival and suffici for prove our main result, a the 
screen off properti be the main requirement. 

thus, in a gener ontolog model, we expect there to be multipl equival way 
of specifi the ontic state. however, they each have differ implic for how to 
construct the time revers of an ontolog model. for example, if λ be a specif of the 
properti of the system just after the preparation, then it should be thought of a a specif 
just befor the measur when we take the time reverse, and the direct of the momentum 
should be reversed. If it be the entir trajectory, then we also need to revers the time direct 
of λ(t) when we take the time reverse. In addition, it be convent to allow other one-to-on 
transform when we take a time reverse. for example, the usual notion of time revers in 
quantum theori involv map a quantum state |ψ〉 to it complex conjug |ψ∗〉, so a similar 
transform of the ontic state should happen in an ontic model in which the quantum state part 
of the ontology. for these reasons, we should not expect that the ontic state λ or even it state space 
Λ be invari under time reversal. instead, there should be a one-to-on map between the 
λ’ in the two differ experiments. 

although an ontic extens need not be an ontolog model, we still want to conceiv 
of the ontic state a the same sort of thing in general. thus, we should allow a one-to-on 
correspond between λ’ when we take the time revers of an ontic extension.

definit 6.1. In an ontic extens of an oper theory, the ontic extens (p, M, t,λ) of 
an experi (p, M, T) have an ontolog time revers if there exist anoth experi (p′, m′, t′), 
with ontic extens (p′, m′, t′,λ′), where P′ have the same set of input and output a M, M′ have 
the same set of input and output a P, there exist a one-to-on map f :λ→λ′, and 

pp′m′t′ (b, a, f (λ) | y, x) = ppmt(a, b, λ | x, y). (6.1) 
An ontic extens of an oper theori be ontolog time symmetr if everi experi 

have an ontolog time reverse. 

clearly, an ontic extens of an oper theori can onli be ontolog time symmetr if 
the oper theori be itself oper time symmetric, sinc we can obtain the oper 
predict just by margin over λ. 

remark 6.2. It be also true, mathemat at least, that if the ontic extens of an experi 
have an ontolog time reverse, then there also exist an extens in which f be the identity. We 
can construct such an extens from an arbitrari one by identifi the ontic state space of 
the time revers pair of experi and set pp′m′t′ (b, a, λ | x, y) in the new extens to the 
valu of pp′m′t′ (b, a, f (λ) | y, x) in the old extension. physically, these two extens may tell veri 
differ stori about what happen between prepar and measurement, but mathemat 
we can alway assum that f be trivial without loss of gener and will do so in what follows. 

7. the time symmetri assumpt 
We be now in a posit to state our main assumption. 

assumpt 7.1. time symmetry: An ontic extens of an oper theori satisfi time 
symmetri if, whenev an experi (p, M, T) have an oper time reverse, the extens 
(p, M, t,λ) have an ontolog time reverse. 

In particular, an ontic extens of an oper time symmetr theori must be 
ontolog time symmetric. 

the idea of thi be that the most natur explan for an oper time symmetri in a 
theori be that it be a reflect of an ontolog time symmetry. note that an experi might 
have an oper time revers for trivial reason if it onli record highli coarse-grain 
inform about the true ontic state of affairs. for example, suppos that the input of our 
prepar and measur consist of choos the posit of a tabl in a room and the output 
consist of count the number of plate on the table. suppos that all of the transform we 
can do involv move the tabl around violent so that some of the plate fall to the ground 
and be smashed. thi be a fundament time asymmetr theori (at the level of probabilities), 
but the asymmetri might not show up at the oper level if some of the transform also 
involv bring new plate from the kitchen and place them on the table. We would not expect 
the oper time symmetri of thi theori to be reflect in the ontolog description, a we 
know that there be plate be smash but none be unsmashed. 

the reason whi thi exampl be problemat be that the prepar and measur that 
we can do be onli give u access to highli restrict inform about the ontic state. In 
particular, we be not be allow to look at the floor to see if there be ani smash plate 
there. the oper time symmetri be an accident consequ of our restrict access, rather 
than a reflect of a fundament symmetry. 

however, if the no-signal sector of an entir physic theori be oper time 
symmetr then the time symmetri assumpt seem much more well founded. recal that 
restrict to the no-signal sector be mere design to factor out the subject arrow of 
time of the experimenter, which we do not believ to be a fundament asymmetry, but be rather 
a consequ of the thermodynam arrow. if, after do this, there be absolut noth you 
can do to determin the time direction, then thi seem like ground for posit a fundament

time symmetry. It be onli in thi situat that we want to posit the time symmetri assumption. 
theorem 4.3 show that thi be precis the situat for quantum theory. 

8. main result 
In thi section, we will be discuss a singl experi and it time reverse, which, due to 
definit 4.1 and 6.1, and remark 6.2, can be take to have the same ontic state space Λ and 
the same probabl distribution. for thi reason, we can drop the subscript P, M, T on the 
probabl distribution. 

(a) main theorem 
our main theorem show that an ontolog model (i.e. an ontic extens satisfi No 
retrocaus and λ-mediation) of an experi that satisfi time symmetri must obey a 
tempor analogu of bell’ local causal condition. 

theorem 8.1. let (p, M, T) be an experi that have an oper time reverse. If it ontic extens 
satisfi No retrocausality, λ-mediat and time symmetri then 

p(a, b, λ | x, y) = p(a | x, λ)p(b | y, λ)p(λ). (8.1) 
To understand the role of λ-mediation, it be help to first see what we can prove without it. 

lemma 8.2. let (p, M, T) be an experi that have an oper time reverse. If it ontic extens 
satisfi No retrocaus and time symmetri then 

p(λ | x, y) = p(λ), (8.2) 
p(b | λ, x, y) = p(b | λ, y) (8.3) 

and p(a | λ, x, y) = p(a | λ, x). (8.4) 
proof. By No retrocausality, the probabl decompos a 

p(a, b, λ | x, y) = p(b | λ, x, a, y)p(λ | a, x)p(a | x). (8.5) 
use bayes’ rule, we have 

p(λ | a, x) = p(a | λ, x)p(λ | x) 
p(a | x) . (8.6) 

substitut thi back into equat (8.5) give 

p(a, b, λ | x, y) = p(b | λ, x, a, y)p(a | λ, x)p(λ | x). (8.7) 
sum over a and b then give p(λ | x, y) = p(λ | x). By time symmetry, we also have the 
decomposit 

p(a, b, λ | x, y) = p(a | λ, x, y, b)p(λ | b, y)p(b | y), (8.8) 
and appli the same argument to thi give p(λ | x, y) = p(λ | y). we, therefore, have p(λ | x, y) = 
p(λ | x) = p(λ | y), but thi mean that it cannot depend on either x or y, so p(λ | x, y) = p(λ). 

substitut thi into equat (8.7) and sum over b give 

p(a, λ | x, y) = p(a | λ, x)p(λ). (8.9) 
divid both side by p(λ | x, y), which be equal to p(λ), give 

p(a | λ, x, y) = p(a | λ, x), (8.10) 
a required. appli the same argument to the time-revers decomposit will then give 

p(b | λ, x, y) = p(b | λ, y). (8.11)

proof of theorem 8.1. In the context of a spacelik bell experiment, equat (8.2) be know a 
measur independence, and equat (8.3) and (8.4) be know a paramet independence. these 
conditions, togeth with 

p(b | a, λ, x, y) = p(b | λ, x, y), (8.12) 
which be know a outcom independence, be know to impli bell’ local causal condit 
[52–54]. however, in the timelik context, equat (8.12) be an instanc of λ-mediation. In fact, 
we have the strong condit that p(b | a, λ, x, y) = p(b | λ, y), so thi combin with lemma 8.2 
impli equat (8.1). 

for completeness, we repeat the proof that these condit impli local causal here. 
An ontic extens that satisfi No retrocaus have decomposit 

p(a, b, λ | x, y) = p(b | a, λ, x, y)p(λ | a, x, y)p(a | x). (8.13) 
By the bayes’ rule argument use in proof of lemma 8.2, we can rewrit thi a 

p(a, b, λ | x, y) = p(b | a, λ, x, y)p(a | λ, x, y)p(λ | x). (8.14) 
By measur independence, we have p(λ | x) = p(λ). By paramet independence, we have 
p(a | λ, x, y) = p(a | λ, x). By outcom independence, we have p(b | a, λ, x, y) = p(b | λ, x, y) and then by 
paramet independ we have p(b | λ, x, y) = p(b | λ, y). substitut all thi into equat (8.14) 
give 

p(a, b, λ | x, y) = p(b | λ, y)p(a | λ, x)p(λ), (8.15)

(b) exampl of a quantum violat 
equat (8.1) be incompat with some experi in the no-signal sector of quantum

of quantum theori can have an ontic extens satisfi No retrocausality, λ-mediat and 
time symmetry, and which cannot. specifically, give an initi ensembl averag state ρa, and 
a cpt map eb|a, when can all experi consist of prepar an ensembl decomposit of 
ρa, appli the transform eb|a, and measur a povm on hb, have an ontic extens 
satisfi these assumptions? It turn out that thi question be equival to ask when a 
bipartit state ρab on the tensor product HA ⊗ HB admit a local hidden variabl theory, which be 
a question that have be studi extens in the literatur [57]. 

To see this, we again make use of the formal describ in [45]. given a channel eb|a, 
we can defin a bipartit oper ρb|a on HA ⊗ hb, know a a condit state, via the 
choi–jamiołkowski isomorph a follows: 

ρb|a = IA ⊗ eb|a′ (|φ+〉〈φ+|aa′ ), (8.22) 

where A′ be a system with the same hilbert space a A, |φ+〉aa′ = 
∑ 

j |jj〉aa′ and IA be the ident 
superoper on ha. thi be an isomorph becaus the action of the cpt map can be recov 
via 

eb|a(ma) = tra(ρtab|ama ⊗ ib), (8.23) 

for ani oper MA on ha, and where TA be partial transpos in the |j〉 basis. 
one can then defin a bipartit state on HA ⊗ HB via 

ρab = (ρ1/2a ⊗ ib)ρb|a(ρ 
1/2 
A ⊗ ib). (8.24) 

thi state have ρA = trb(ρab) a it reduc state, and the action of eb|a on supp(ρa) can be 
recov by invert equat (8.24) and then appli equat (8.23). We can thu consid 
thi a an isomorph between pair (ρa, eb|a) and bipartit state ρab. although the action 
of eb|a outsid supp(ρa) be not recov by the invers transformation, it be irrelev for 
determin the probabl for experi with ensembl averag state ρa, so we will get a 
true isomorph of the experiment probabilities. 

specifically, for ani set of ensembl decomposit of ρA into state ρaa|x and ani set of 
povm eb|yb on hb, it be straightforward to check that 

trb(eb|ybeb|a(ρaa|x)) = trb(ea|xa ⊗ eb|ybρab), (8.25) 

where ea|xa be defin in term of ρA and ρaa|x via equat (4.5). We can convers take ani 
povm on ea|ax and invert equat (4.5) to obtain ensembl decompositions. the r.h.s. of thi 
equat repres the predict for local measur make on the bipartit state ρab. 
appli to thi experiment, equat (8.1) be just bell’ local causal in it origin context of 
spacelik epr-typ experiments. thus, a state-cp map pair (ρa, eb|a) admit an ontic extens 
satisfi No retrocausality, λ-mediat and time symmetri exactli when the predict for 
local measur on ρab admit a local hidden variabl theory. 

9. price’ argument 
As give in [1], price’ argument be base on three assumptions, which he call realism, time 
symmetri and discreteness. there be also unstat background assumptions, which be equival 
to our realism and free choic assumptions. sinc these be common to both arguments, we will 
leav them implicit in what follows. 

price summar hi argument a 

realism + time symmetri + discret �⇒ retrocausality.

................................................... 

To give thi a similar logic form to our result, thi could be rewrit a 

No retrocaus + realism + time symmetri + discret �⇒ contradict 
(with quantum theory) 

As note in §1, price’ realism assumpt be an assumpt of the realiti of the quantum state. 
In our terminology, an ontic extens of a quantum experi be call ψ-ontic if, in the case 
where the state ρaa|x be pure, i.e. ρaa|x = p(a | x)|ψa|x〉〈ψa|x|a, the distribut p(λ | a, x) and p(λ | 
a′x′) have disjoint support whenev |ψa|x〉〈ψa|x| and |ψa′|x′ 〉〈ψa′|x′ | be distinct.6 An extens that 
be not ψ-ontic be call ψ-epistemic. We call the assumpt that an extens should be ψ-ontic, 
the ψ-ontolog assumption. 

As discuss in §1, price’ discret assumpt be need to argu that a photon exit a 
beamsplitt and then be detect on one of the output port be the time revers of a photon 
be insert into a beamsplitt along a definit input port. thi guarante that the oper 
time revers use in price’ argument can be identifi a a true time reverse. hi time symmetri 
assumpt be then that thi time revers should be an ontolog time revers a well. In fact, 
price’ experi be it own oper time reverse, i.e. P′ = P, M′ = M and T′ = T, so he onli 
need to appli the assumpt in thi case. note that, if we time revers the densiti oper and 
povm from the experi we describ in §8b use equat (4.5) and (4.6), we do not obtain 
the same experiment. however, thi experi have more than one oper time revers 
becaus we can appli a unitari U to the state and it invers U† to the povm element without 
chang the oper predictions. By do this, we can rotat the state and measur 
back to the origin ones, and we see that the origin experi be inde it own oper 
time reverse. thus, we could restrict the time symmetri assumpt to experi that be their 
own time revers in our argument a well, although we see no good reason for do so. In ani 
case, our time symmetri assumpt play an equival role to the conjunct of discret 
and time symmetri in price’ argument. 

replac price’ realism, discret and time symmetri assumpt with our ψ-ontolog 
and time symmetri assumptions, the logic of price’ argument becom 

No retrocaus + ψ − ontolog + time symmetri �⇒ contradict 
(with quantum theory). 

note that price’ argument do not requir λ-mediation, but we consid thi a more reason 
assumpt to make than ψ-ontology, sinc ψ-epistem retrocaus theori be of interest. In 
fair to price, he do point out that retrocaus ψ-epistem model be possibl and give an 
example. however, a explain shortly, withoutψ-ontology, the experi consid by price 
also have a non-retrocaus ψ-epistem model, so hi argument be not suffici to show that such 
model should be retrocausal. 

We can reconstruct the logic of price’ argument in our framework, with an even simpler 
experi than he uses. consid an experi that have no measurement, i.e. formal the 
input and output variabl of the measur can take onli one possibl value, so we can drop 
y and b from our probabl distribut and repres the ‘measurement’ by the trivial single- 
outcom povm ib. the prepar have a binari input and output. all that realli matter for the 
argument be that the ρaa|x’ be four distinct pure states, but for definit we will use a qubit 
and the follow four quantum state 

ρ0a|0 = 12 [0] ρ1a|0 = 12 [π ] (9.1) 
and 

ρ0a|1 = 12

By the ψ-ontolog assumption, the four probabl distribut p(λ | a, x) each have disjoint 
support. thi mean that the two distribut p(λ | x) also have disjoint support becaus 

p(λ | x) = 
∑ 

a 
p(λ | a, x)p(a | x), (9.3) 

so, for a fix x we have a convex combin of two distribut and henc supp(p(λ | x)) = 
∪asupp(p(λ | a, x)), which be disjoint for differ valu of x. In particular, thi mean that λ and 
x be not independent, i.e. p(λ | x) �= p(λ). 

now consid the oper time revers of thi experiment. By No retrocaus it ontic 
extens must satisfi p(λ | x) = p(λ) becaus x be now the measur input and λ be in it 
causal past. however, by time symmetry, these probabl must be the same a in the origin 
experiment, so we have a contradiction. 

the intuit behind thi argument be that if the quantum state be real in the origin 
experiment, in the sens of disjoint support for the p(λ | a, x)’s, then the p(λ | a, x)’ must still have 
disjoint support in the ontolog time reverse. thi impli that the retrodict states, evolv 
backward from the measur to the preparation, must also be real, which contradict No 
retrocausality. 

if, follow price, we onli want to appli the time symmetri assumpt to experi 
that be their own oper time reverse, then we can add a measur to the end of the 
experiment, with povm element 

e0|0b = [0] e1|0b = [π ] (9.4) 

and 

e0|1b = 
[π

. (9.5) 

use equat (4.5) and (4.6), it be easili check that thi be it own oper time reverse. 
thi be a tempor version of the epr experi and be the exampl that price actual uses. 
however, the reason for thi experi would be exactli the same a above. one reason for 
prefer thi version be that, without the No retrocaus assumption, time symmetri and 
ψ-ontolog now impli that both the usual forward evolv quantum state and the backward 
evolv retrodict state must be real in the same experiment. however, the contradict do 
not depend on have thi extra featur (see tabl 1 for a summari of the assumpt and 
experi involv in the two version of price’ argument, and our argument). 

To conclud thi section, we note that, without the ψ-ontolog assumption, the experi 
just describ have a veri simpl ontolog model, i.e. an ontic extens satisfi No 
retrocaus and λ-mediation. thi be just the spekkens’ toy theori [6], regard a an 
ontolog model for qubit prepar and measur in the eigenst of pauli operators. 

specifically, suppos that the ontic state space Λ consist of two bits, λ0 and λ1. We set the 
epistem state p(λ0, λ1 | a, x) = 12 δλx,a, where δ be the kroneck δ-function, and the respons 
function p(b | λ0, λ1, y) = δλy,b. In addition, p(a | x) = 12 for thi experiment. thi give the joint 
probabl 

p(a, b, λ0, λ1 | x, y) = p(b | λ0, λ1, y)p(λ0, λ1 | a, x)p(a | x) = 14 δλy,bδλx,a, (9.6) 

which reproduc the oper predict upon margin over λ0 and λ1. In addition, 
thi distribut be invari under the exchang of (a, x) with (b, y), so the oper time 
reverse, which be the same experi in thi case, be model by the same distribution, so time 
symmetri be satisfied. 

thi model be ψ-epistem as, for example, the distribut p(λ0, λ1 | a = 0, x = 0) and p(λ0, λ1 | 
a = 0, x = 1) both assign probabl 12 to the ontic state λ0 = 0, λ1 = 0. It does, however, satisfi λ- 
mediat becaus it be an ontolog model. thi show that ψ-ontolog be essenti for price’ 
argument, but not well justifi for the exampl he uses.

10. time symmetri in de broglie–bohm and everett 
In §1, we mention that both dbb theori and the everett/many-world interpret satisfi the 
convent notion of time symmetri of dynam laws, but they be not counter-exampl to 
our argument becaus time symmetri be a differ notion. 

the case of dbb be the easi to deal with becaus it satisfi all of our assumpt 
other than time symmetry. consid an experi perform on a spin- 12 particle, where 
the prepar and measur be of the spin. the prepar prepar pure state |ψx|a〉 
and the measur be in orthonorm base |φb|y〉 (one basi for each valu of y). suppos 
that the posit state |Ψ (r)〉 remain uncorrel with the spin between the prepar and 
measur so that |Ψ (r)〉 be the same for all choic of x and a. In dbb, the ontic state of thi 
system consist of two pieces: the quantum state |Ψ (r)〉 ⊗ |ψa|x〉 and the posit R of the particle, 
i.e. λ= (|ψ (r)〉 ⊗ |ψa|x〉, r). the quantum state evolv accord to the schrödinger equation, and 
the posit evolv accord to the guidanc equation, both of which be symmetr under 
the replac of t with −t7. sinc the posit state be the same for all the experi we be 
considering, and henc the posit R be alway distribut in the same way, the violat of time 
symmetri be entir due to the spin state. 

sinc thi theori be ψ-ontic, it be suscept to the argument give for the exampl in the 
previou section. namely, give that p(λ | x) depend on x (i.e. the spin part of the quantum state 
be either |0〉 or |π〉 if x = 0, and either |π/2〉 or | − π/2〉 if x = 1), λ, which includ the spin state, be 
necessarili differ for each choic of x. time symmetri then impli that λ should depend on 
the measur choic a well, but it do not a the quantum state onli depend on the choic 
of preparation, and the distribut of posit be the same for all experiments. 

As show by price’ argument, a ψ-ontic theori need to includ a backward evolv 
retrodict state, in addit to the usual predict state, in it ontolog in order to satisfi time 
symmetry. for example, the transact interpret [2,3] and the two state vector formal 
[4,5], interpret realistically, both posit such state and satisfi time symmetry. 

the reason whi thi do not conflict with the dynam time symmetri of dbb be that 
oper time symmetri and dynam time symmetri disagre on what be the time revers 
of an experiment. To see this, it be use to look at the dynam time revers of a prepar 
and measur experiment. In order to exhibit dynam time reversal, it be necessari to treat 
the prepar and measur devic quantum mechanically, a dynam time symmetri 
onli hold when we do not appli the measur postul of quantum theory. In ani case, 

7we also have to replac the quantum state with it complex conjugate, but our argument work for state that onli have real 
amplitudes.

................................................... 

thi be how measur be suppos to be handl in dbb, a the measur postul be 
understood a effect rule that appli when there be suffici decoher in the posit basis. 

To do this, we introduc four system in addit to the spin- 12 particl S. the prepar 
devic have an input, describ by a physic devic such a a switch, which we label X. X can 
be in one of sever orthogon state |x〉x correspond to the differ choic of prepar 
input. the output be describ by a devic such a a pointer, which we label system A, with 
orthogon state |a〉a correspond to the output. importantly, both X and A be macroscop 
system with the differ |x〉x state have almost no overlap in posit and similarli for the 
|a〉a states. the measur devic be also describ by two macroscop systems, Y and B, 
describ it input and outputs, with macroscop distinct orthogon state |y〉i and |b〉b. 
prior to the experiment, the system be in the state |x〉x ⊗ |0〉a ⊗ |y〉i ⊗ |0〉b ⊗ |0〉s, the import 
point be that the prepar and measur input be set accord to the choic of the 
experimenter, and the spin- 12 particl and output system be in fix states. 

the prepar can then be describ by a unitari oper uxas, which onli act on X, A 
and S a 

uxas|x〉x ⊗ |0〉a ⊗ |0〉 = |x〉x ⊗ 
∑ 

a 

1√ 
p(a | x) |a〉a ⊗ |ψa|x〉. (10.1) 

similarly, the measur can be describ by a unitari oper vybs, which onli act on Y, 
B and S a 

vybs|y〉i ⊗ |0〉b ⊗ |ψ〉 = |y〉i ⊗ 
∑ 

b 

|b〉b ⊗ [φb|y]|ψ〉. (10.2) 

uxa map state in which A and S be uncorrel to an entangl superposit of differ 
S state correl with the valu of A, and similarli vyb map state in which B and S be 
uncorrel to an entangl superposit of differ S state correl with the valu of B. 
their dynam time rever u†xa and V 

† 
yb do the opposite, map these correl state to 

unentangl ones. thus, although prepar and measur be oper time rever 
of one another, they be not dynam time rever of one another, but rather both oper 
have the same sort of form. the dynam time revers of a measur would be a kind of 
prepar in which we be allow to initi place the system in a superposit of differ 
prepar outputs, rather than one in which a take a definit value. 

the case of everett/many-world be a littl more subtle, as, unlik dbb, it do not satisfi 
the ‘singl world’ part of our (singl world) realism assumption, so it do not fit into the 
framework we have use to prove our result. therefore, to make the argument that many-world 
do not satisfi time symmetri in rigor detail, one would first have to reformul time 
symmetri in a framework that allow experi to have multipl coexist outcom at the 
ontolog level. nonetheless, even without do this, the intuit idea of time symmetri be 
still clear: experi that be oper time rever of one anoth ought to be time rever 
at the ontolog level. becaus many-world posit the unitari evolut of the usual forwards- 
evolv quantum state a it entir ontology, it be ψ-ontic and do not satisfi time symmetri 
due to the lack of an ontic backward evolv state. however, thi do not contradict dynam 
time symmetry, which work the same way a in dbb. 

for most no-go theorems, such a bell’ theorem and result about contextuality, the move 
to a many-world framework complet evad the conclus of the theorem. It is, therefore, 
intrigu that thi move do not help to evad our result. 

reader who be happi with dynam time symmetri may be inclin to reject our time 
symmetri assumpt at thi point. however, the conceptu idea of time symmetry—that you 
cannot tell the differ between a video play forward and play in reverse—i more 
fundament than ani particular mathemat formal of it. In a theori in which the 
oper predict be probabilistic, and in which there be no univers agreement about 
ontology, there will be sever differ formal of time symmetry. although dynam 
time symmetri be the tradit notion, it do not have a uniqu claim to captur the basic 
concept. even if one do view dynam time symmetri a more fundament than oper

time symmetry, the latter be still a symmetri that exist in quantum theory, and it lack an 
explan in theori that reject our time symmetri assumption. 

11. relat to spekken contextu 
spekkens’ variant of non-contextu state that experiment procedur that be oper 
equivalent, in the sens of predict the same probabilities, should be repres the same way 
in an ontolog model [46]. In particular, two prepar procedur that alway yield the same 
probabl for everi measur should correspond to the same epistem state, or probabl 
distribution, over the ontic states. thi be know a prepar non-contextuality. 

In the present context, when we consid the ensembl averag over output of a no-signal 
preparation, the oper probabl obey p(b | x, y) = p(b | x′, y) = p(b | y) for all x, x′, which 
be just the no-signal condition. therefor in a prepar non-contextu ontolog model, 
we must have p(λ | x) = p(λ | x′) = p(λ). In our main theorem, we deriv thi a a consequ of 
time symmetri instead. 

In quantum theory, no-signal prepar correspond to differ ensembl decom- 
posit of the same densiti oper ρa, so prepar non-contextu say that, in an 
ontolog model, ρA should be repres by the same probabl distribut over λ, 
regardless of which ensembl decomposit be use to prepar it. 

spekkens’ show that no ontolog model can satisfi thi instanc of prepar non- 
contextu for a particular set-up involv decomposit of the maxim mix state 
of a qubit into six pure state [46]. It have also be show that thi instanc prepar non- 
contextu impli tempor bell inequalities, such a the chsh inequ we use here [25]. 
these result can therefor be use a altern proof of the imposs of an ontolog 
model satisfi time symmetry. 

these prepar contextu result have be demonstr experiment [25,58], so 
these experi can also be view a demonstr of our result. however, we would like 
an experiment confirm to be independ of the detail of quantum theory, which rais 
some import issues. 

first, our time symmetri assumpt be onli suppos to be appli to experi in the no- 
signal sector of an oper theory. without assum a background theory, like quantum 
theory, there be realli no way of verifi that a prepar be no-signalling. thi be because, 
although everi measur we have so far manag to perform might reveal no signal from 
the preparation, there could alway be some novel measurement, which we have not figur out 
how to do yet that would yield a signal. test of prepar contextu face a similar issue, 
which be that two prepar procedur cannot be show to be oper equival by 
experi alone. If we be will to make addit assumptions, such a the assumpt that 
the measur we can do be tomograph complete, then it be possibl to devis robust 
test of prepar contextu that do not suffer from thi problem [59], and these test could, 
in the same way, be use a robust test of our main result. 

however, we also think that the time symmetri assumpt should onli be appli to 
theori that have an oper time symmetr no-signal sector, in order to avoid the kind 
of accident time symmetri discuss in §7. thi be truli imposs to verifi experimentally, a 
it would involv test everi possibl no-signal experiment. therefore, while experiment 
robust test of some form of prepar contextu can also be view a test of our result, 
we think that the main signific of our result be in the context of a specif theory, which may 
or may not be quantum, but be know to be oper time symmetr on theoret grounds. 

12. discuss and conclus 
We have show that there be no ontic extens of quantum theori that satisfi No 
retrocausality, λ-mediat and our time symmetri assumption, i.e. the requir that an 
oper time symmetri should impli an ontolog one. requir an ontic extens can

be broken down into two assumptions: realism and free choice. our main result show that at 
least one of these five assumpt must be give up. 

realism and free choic be part and parcel of what be normal meant by a realist theori 
and be share by mani no-go theorems, such a bell’ theorem. their statu here be no differ 
from in these other contexts. propon of copenhagenish interpret deni that ontic state 
exist at all, so they would give up on realism. sinc our intent be to investig realist 
interpretations, we need not discu thi option further here. however, one can potenti 
also give up realism by deni that it be actual requir for a realist interpretation. for 
example, sinc our realism be single-world, the everett/many-world interpret do not 
satisfi it, but everett/many-world be not time symmetr in the sens we be interest in, so 
adopt it do not solv the problem. still, it be possibl that a differ interpret that 
involv multipl world might exist that do have an appropri time symmetry. anoth 
option be to adopt a non-standard logic or probabl theory. while thi idea be appealing, the 
interpret of such theori be usual operational, and a compel realist underpin be 
current lacking. 

In our view, the idea that ontic state be respons for correl between prepar and 
measurement, which be the idea behind λ-mediation, be also a core featur of a realist theory. It 
encod the idea that ontic state be suppos to explain what we see in experiments. If we be 
contempl give up No retrocausality, then it be not entir clear how to formul thi 
assumption, a condit independ of past and futur variabl give λ be not a reason 
condit in a theori where λ can be causal affect by thing both in it past and in it future. 
nonetheless, some semblanc of the idea that prepar and measur be correl 
becaus of λ need to be retain in a retrocaus theory, and it be a challeng for propon 
of retrocaus view to formal thi in a meaning way. 

thi leaf u with time symmetri and No retrocaus a the most reason 
assumpt to give up. both of these assumpt can be view a special case of the idea 
that an ontic extens should not be fine tuned, which make it difficult to make a clear choic 
between them. 

loos speaking, a no fine tune assumpt mean that, when the oper predict 
have a specifi property, e.g. a symmetry, we postul that the underli realist theori should 
also have the same property. for example, the oper predict of quantum theori do 
not allow u to send signal into the past, so we posit that there be no causal influenc from 
futur to past in the underli theory. thi be the No retrocaus assumption. similarly, the 
oper predict of quantum theori obey a certain kind of time symmetry, so we also posit 
thi symmetri for the underli theory. thi be our time symmetri assumption. 

No fine tune assumpt be extrem common in no-go theorem for quantum theory. for 
example, spekkens’ non-contextu assumption, i.e. procedur that be oper ident 
should be ident in the underli theory, be of thi type, a be paramet independ in bell’ 
theorem, i.e. we cannot send signal superluminally, so our choic of measur should not 
affect anyth at the other wing of the experi superlumin either.8 

No fine tune assumpt seem reason because, if a give properti hold in the 
underli theory, then we can accept that properti a a fundament physic principle. for 
example, that there be no causal influenc from futur to past might be accept a such a 
principle. then, the explan for whi the properti hold at the oper level be just by 
appeal to that principle. for example, if there be no causal influenc from futur to past at all, 
then obvious there must be no signal from futur to past. 

however, when a properti hold operationally, but not ontologically, then it cannot be becaus 
of a fundament physic principle. instead, there be a tension that cri out for explanation. for 

8see [60] for a detail discuss of thi in the case of bell’ theorem. the assumpt in bell’ theorem can also be motiv 
directli from physic reasoning, e.g. invok special relativity, without ani appeal to the oper predict of quantum 
theory. one might likewis be abl to provid physic motiv for both time symmetri and No retrocaus that do 
not appeal to their oper counterparts. We set asid such motiv in our discuss and focu on the fine tune 
narr becaus we believ that narr enabl the clearest comparison of the two assumptions.

example, if there actual be influenc from futur to past then whi be it that we cannot use 
those influenc to send a signal? 

thi can onli happen if the probabl describ our ignor of the true ontic state be 
fine tuned. for example, if there be retrocaus influenc in the theory, but no signal into the 
past, then the correl between the oper variabl and the ontic state must be set in 
such a way that the possibl of signal will be exactli wash out upon margin over 
the ontic state. 

note that we expect our oper experi to onli reveal coarse-grain inform 
about the ontic state, e.g. consid the classic exampl in which the ontic state be the microstate, 
but the oper degre of freedom onli probe the macrostate. however, we do not expect 
our experi to be so coars grain that they complet miss key featur of the underli 
ontology. for example, in statist mechan we can in fact detect mani properti of the 
ontolog by observ the small statist fluctuat they cause, a in brownian motion. 
therefore, if there be retrocaus influences, one would expect to be abl to use them in some 
way to signal, even if thi be not a straightforward a by directli observ the ontic state. If not, 
there be an explanatori gap that need filling. 

sinc both No retrocaus and time symmetri be no fine tune assumptions, the case 
for each of them be equal compelling. however, there be at least three possibl way of deal 
with a fine tuning, which be appropri in differ circumstances, and can help to shed light 
on which one of them must go. 

(i) We can accept them a brute facts. 
(ii) We can look for an altern framework that be not fine-tuned. 

(iii) We can explain them a emergent. 

the first option be to just accept that the fine tune be a predict of our physic theory, 
and leav it at that. If the ontolog descript be play ani explanatori role at all, then it 
be go to differ from the oper descript in at least some respects, some of which will 
be mere accidents. therefore, thi might be an appropri respons if we be look at some 
rather specif and convolut properti of the oper predict that do not seem close 
connect to fundament physic principles. however, both time symmetri and the lack of 
signal into the past seem like gener featur of our physic world, which deserv a good 
explan than this. 

the second option be to say that the fine tune do not actual exist in nature, but be rather 
an indic that one of our other assumpt be wrong. onc we discard the, perhap implicit, 
faulti assumption, we will be abl to find a theori with no fine tunings. In the present context, 
it be not complet out of the question to discard realism so that we can retain some version 
of both No retrocaus and time symmetry, but, a we have discussed, it be challeng to 
conceiv of a realist framework that do not assum realism. 

thi bring u to the third option, which be emerg fine tunings. As an exampl of this, 
consid a univers that be in thermal equilibrium everywher at a fix temperature. thi 
univers contain mani fine tunings, e.g. it be not possibl to send a signal into the futur 
in thi universe, let alon the past. the underli statist mechan descript say that 
there be possibl non-equilibrium state in the theori that do not have thi property, so the 
probabl seem fine tune in order to prevent signal into the future. however, in thi 
case, we have a dynam explan of the fine tuning. If the univers do start in a non- 
equilibrium state, then the dynam will, with high probability, eventu evolv the univers 
toward equilibrium. thi is, of course, a perfectli legitim explan of whi we might see an 
appar fine tuning. 

If we accept thi kind of explanation, then we also have to accept that the fine tune be not 
base on a fundament physic principl and be like to have be violat somewher in the 
univers at some point, e.g. in the earli univers shortli after the big bang, befor the analogu 
of the equilibr process have time to take hold. It be difficult to see how thi could happen for

time symmetry, which seem like a fundament physic symmetry, but much easi for No 
retrocausality. 

recal that the veri definit of the subject arrow of time be that we can rememb the 
past, which seem fixed, but the futur seem open and manipulable. If signal into both 
the past and the futur be commonplace, then there would be no definit subject arrow of 
time, and arguabl no possibl for subject experience. there be good reason for believ 
that thi arrow be necessarili align with the thermodynam arrow of time, and we alreadi 
believ that the thermodynam arrow be emergent, to be explain by the initi condit of 
the universe, rather than a fundament principl of physics. It be therefor plausibl that the 
possibl of signal into the past in a univers with retrocaus would be wash out by 
the same process from which the thermodynam arrow emerges. 

In other words, give that we alreadi need an asymmetri in the boundari condit of the 
univers in order to account for the thermodynam arrow of time, it seem plausibl that thi 
same asymmetri could be use to explain whi there be signal into the future, but no signal 
into the past, in a univers with retrocausality. 

We conclud that the most plausibl respons to our result, other than give up realism, 
be to posit that there might be retrocaus in nature. At the veri least, thi be a concret and 
littl explor possibl that hold the promis of evad almost all no-go theorem in the 
foundat of quantum theory, so it should be investig further.
