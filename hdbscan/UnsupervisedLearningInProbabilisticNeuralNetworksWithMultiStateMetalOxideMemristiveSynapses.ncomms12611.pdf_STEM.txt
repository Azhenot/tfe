In an increasingli data-rich world the need for develop comput system that cannot 

onli process, but ideal also interpret big data be becom continu more pressing. 

brain-inspir concept have show great promis toward address thi need. here we 

demonstr unsupervis learn in a probabilist neural network that util metal-oxid 

memrist devic a multi-st synapses. our approach can be exploit for process 

unlabel data and can adapt to time-vari cluster that underli incom data by sup- 

port the capabl of revers unsupervis learning. the potenti of thi work be 

showcas through the demonstr of success learn in the presenc of corrupt 

input data and probabilist neurons, thu pave the way toward robust big-data processors.

P 
lastic synapt connect be a key comput element 
of both the brain and brain-inspir neuromorph 
systems. outnumb neuron by approxim 1,000 

to 1 in the human brain1, synapsi have to perform their main 
function, name interconnect neural cell via an often 
modifi coupl strength (a weight), within extrem tight 
volum and power budgets. the desir to build and oper 
larg neural network with vast amount of synapsi have render 
the task of creat similarli effici and yet practic 
implement artifici synapsi a high priority. 

A major rout toward that goal have be the develop of 
hardwar synaps analogues, which have tradit reli on 
commerci avail complementari metal-oxid semiconduc- 
tor technologies2–5. however, the visionari idea of the earli day 
of the field of memristor research6,7 have lead to a differ 
approach: the exploit of the intrins electr properti of a 
larg and divers group of emerg nanoelectron devic 
exhibit the phenomenon of resist switching, nowaday also 
refer to a memrist devices8–10. the scalability11, 
threshold input voltag time-integration12, multi-level 
storage13, simpl two-termin structure, potenti for low 
power operation14 and back-end-of-lin integration15 featur 
demonstr thu far in variou memrist devic technolog 
attract studi in the field of memrist synapses. 

So far, the potenti of memristor to act a ersatz synapsi have 
be studi through simulation16–21 and the demonstr of in- 
silico learn rule implementation, most notably—but 
not exclusively—that of spike timing-depend plastic 
(stdp)22 gener by appropri electr memristor bias 
schemes23–27. other advanc includ the emul of basic 
heterosynapt plastic in multi-termin memrist devices28, a 
well a the demonstr of stdp by exploit the intern 
dynam of memristors, albeit in volatil devic (that is, devic 
that do not retain their memori state for long period of time, for 
example, 1 day)29,30 and effort toward the integr of 
memristor with neuromorph circuits31. more recent the first 
exampl of practical, small-scal artifici neural network (ann) 
oper with memrist synapsi have be demonstrated, all 
use deterministic, supervis learn techniques. these includ 
ref. 32, where learn be implement use a variant of the 
perceptron learn rule (the manhattan updat rule), and ref. 33, 
where phase-chang memori (pcm) rather than metal-oxid 
technology-bas memristor be use to demonstr learn in 
a hopfield network use hebbian learning. finally, the first large- 
scale neural network use pcm technolog be demonstr by 

ibm34, where a modifi back-propag rule be use in a 
three-lay ann. 

In thi work we exploit the gradual, multi-level switch 
characterist of metal-oxide-bas memristor (supplementari 
note 1, includ supplementari tabl 1 and supplementari 
fig. 1) for demonstr unsupervis learn in a probabilist 
neural network. our work consolid the current state 
of art in single-compon synaps emul (for example, 
ref 20,23,24,26,30) and advanc the field of oper 
memristor a hardwar synaps emul in practic neural 
network (for example, ref 27,32). particularly, we demonstr 
in a neural network use memristor synapses: first, pattern 
classif in a probabilist neural network; second, 
unsupervis learn achiev through the implement of 
a winner-take-al (wta) network; third, revers learning, an 
often neglect but essenti aspect of truli flexibl and use 
learn system and fourth, the exploit of the intrins 
properti of our memristor to success allow the neural 
network to encod condit probabl without ani special 
input signal waveform engineering. 

result 
weight-depend stdp in tio2-bas memristors. stdp be 
one of the most wide studi plastic rule for spike neural 
networks. In it pure form it reli on the premis that the rel 
time between pre- and post-synapt spike event be the major 
determin of both the direct (potentiation/depression) and 
the magnitud of synapt weight changes. recent the hard- 
ware-friendly, pulse-bas bias scheme show in fig. 1a–c have 
be propos a a possibl method for implement stdp in 
memristor-bas synapses17,18,35. the memristor’ resist state 
(conductance) be interpret a the equival of a synapt 
efficaci (weight). To implement plastic events, the scheme 
exploit the inher capabl of some memrist devic to act 
a threshold voltag time-integrators, that be to chang their 
resist state a a function of input voltage, so long a it 
magnitud exce a certain threshold (the switch threshold). 
when the pre-synapt neuron spikes, a prolong low-voltag 
puls be appli across the memristor. thi puls be by itself 
unabl to induc ani resist switch (fig. 1a). spike of the 
post-synapt neuron, on the other hand, lead to the applic 
of a brief, biphasic, bipolar puls (fig. 1b) that caus the 
memristor to undergo long-term depress (ltd). concurr 
pre- and post-synapt termin spike caus the memristor to

sens the superposit of the pre- and post-synapt spike 
waveform and therebi undergo long-term potenti 
(ltp; fig. 1c). 

We fabric tio2-bas devic (see methods) and studi 
their behaviour dure exposur to train of stdp events. each 
devic under test (dut) be expos to four block of events, 
each consist of 2,400 individu events: ltd-induc post- 
onli events; ltp-induc combin pre- and post-events; ltd 
event again; and finally, plasticity-neutr pre-ev only. 
figur 1d show typic measur result from our prototyp 
dut for all mention electr bias schemes. first, we 
observ that the stdp rule be follow throughout the entir 
test, includ the plasticity-neutr of pre-onli event 
(confirm by experi where pre-onli event be appli 
at the high-conduct boundari of the dut’ oper 
range—supplementari fig. 2). next, we observ the mark 
depend of chang in resist state on the run resist 
state (dut conduct g) for both ltp and ltd (fig. 1e). such 
depend of conduct chang on the actual memrist 
state have commonli be observ in memristors, includ both 
metal-oxide25 and phase-change36 implementations. In super- 
vise learn rules, such a the perceptron rule, thi properti be 
undesir a updat independ of memrist state be 
required32. here we particularli leverag thi properti to enabl 
for the first-tim unsupervis learn in a practic network, in 
a manner similar to the work present previous in ref. 37 that 
be base on simul of pcm models. 

the experiment result in fig. 1d,e suggest that the stdp rule 
be implement can be describ for each plastic event by 

Dg ¼ post � f þ ðgþ � pre� f � ðgþð Þ ð1þ 
where pre and post be binari valu indic whether a 
pre- or post-spik have occur in the give event, respectively, 
whilst fþ (g) and f� (g) be function that captur the influenc 
of dut conduct on ltp and ltd strength 
(also see supplementari note 2 and supplementari fig. 3).

plot dg/g versu g for both ltp and ltd reveal that our 
solid-st synaps featur inher self-stabil plastic 
(fig. 1e): at high conduct levels, further increas in 
conduct (ltp) becom progress smaller. similarly, at the 
bottom end of the conduct scale ltd induct becom 
increasingli ineffective. the gradual and monoton depend 
of weight chang on the run valu of weight be an essenti 
featur for memori model of unsupervis learning. If a 
stochast data stream that trigger ltp and ltd with 
probabl p and (1� p), respectively, be fed into the dut, we 
can expect it conduct to converg toward a uniqu 
equilibrium point. In other words, the memrist synaps should 
be abl to encod and store in it resist state the condit 
probabl p(pre|post¼ 1) that a give postsynapt spike be 
preced by a presynapt spike at the synaps within a short time 
interval. for instance, consid a memrisitv synaps that be 
expos to stdp event that consist of a mixtur of 90% ltp 
event and 10% ltd events. We can expect the dut 
conduct to eventu stabilis close to the upper boundari 
of the dut’ resist state oper range. 

memristor synapsi can encod condit probabilities. We 
experiment test the theoret predict that condit 
probabl can be encod and store in the resist state of a 
memristor. We perform four measur run on the same 
test device. each run consist of 10 block of plastic event 
(104 event per block, that is, 105 event per run, blue dot in 
fig. 2). individu plastic event be randomli chosen to be 
ltp event with probabl pltp and ltd event with probabl 
1� pltp, where the probabl of an ltp event be fix within 
each block. In run 2 and 4, pltp be 95%, 85%, ..., 5% for block 
1–10, respectively, that is, the probabl of ltp event be 
decreas after each event block. In run 1 and 3, the same ltp 
probabl be tested, but in random order (supplementari 
tabl 4 and supplementari note 3). At the end of each block the 
final resist state of the memristor be measur (averag of 25 
read-out after the end of each block). 

the result of the experi be show in fig. 2. after a burn- 
in phase, dure which the memristor gradual reach it

we obtain consist converg point for the remain 
three run (3 � 105 events) and a clear map between ltp/ltd

attempt to extrapol memristor behaviour by exponenti

104 event seem insuffici to achiev converg give the 
choic of bias paramet (supplementari note 5). We believ 
that thi could be potenti address a more realist 
memristor model appear. thus, we can conclud that tio2 
memristor-bas synapsi appear to be abl to practic support 
the encod of condit probabl p(pre|post¼ 1) in 
their resist states. 

probabilist neural network with memristor synapses. the 
abil of individu memristor to encod condit prob- 
abil can be leverag for the implement of self-adapt 
spike neural networks. In particular, wta networks38 have 
repeatedli be propos for hardwar implementations39–42, 
motiv in part by the fact that wta structur play an 
import role in cortic inform processing43. recent 
rigor analysi reveal that wta network consist of 
stochast spike neuron subject to weight-depend 
stdp be capabl of perform probabilist infer that 
essenti carri out cluster of input patterns. while a 
number of differ type of wta network have be 
considered35,44–47, optim paramet adapt be in ani case 
accomplish by weight-depend stdp rule of the form 
Dw / post � ðpre � f ðwþþ, that is, by rule similar to the 
memristor-impl plastic rule from equat (1). 

To test whether memristor-bas synapsi can perform 
adequ a compon of wta networks, we implement 
a wta network that consist of two stochast spike neuron 
with four input each. all four input synapsi to one wta 
neuron be implement by tio2-bas devices, while the 
synapsi to the other neuron be implement in softwar 
(fig. 3a). thi hybrid network allow u to directli compar 

software-simul synapt connect with memrist 
synapsi in the same set-up and with exactli the same inputs. 
It also allow u to directli manipul the softwar synapsi 
and studi the influenc on memrist plasticity. 

the 2-neuron probabilist wta network be implement on 
an in-hous develop instrument board for memristor 
devic characterization48. the two artifici neurons, wta later 
inhibit and synapsi feed one of the neuron be all 
implement in softwar on the board’ microcontrol unit. 
dure each experi run 1,200 four-bit pattern be 
present to the network at the input y ¼ ðy0; y1; y2; y3þ. 
determin the valu of y begin by randomli and 
equiprob draw a pattern to be present from a set of 
prototyp test pattern (in our case 0110 and 1001). next, each bit 
in the select pattern be flip with a probabl of 10% so that 
the network be present with noisi instanti of the 
prototyp patterns. the result gener input vector be then 
multipli by the weight vector of both neuron and translat 
into membran potenti values, one for each neuron, a per 
equat (3): 

uiðy; tÞ ¼ yiðtþþwiðtþ � yðtþ ð3þ 

where ui(y,t) denot the membran potenti for neuron i dure 
event t, yi(t) an adapt excit term that homoeostat 
regul neuron activ and wi the weight vector from input y 
to neuron i. the symbol ? repres the dot product operator. 
importantly, whilst Ui repres the membran potenti of 
neuron i for the purpos of drive it fire behaviour, it do 
not directli translat to a physic voltag valu to be appli to 
all synaps termin (pre or post) it be connect to. neuron 
fire event be instead translat into appropri pre- or post- 
type voltag waveform that be use to bia the affect 
memristor synapses. the homoeostat term yi(t) have be use 
befor for memristor learning17 and have be theoret 
justifi in ref. 44 for unsupervis learn in probabilist 
wta networks. By reduc the propens to fire for neuron 
that show high averag response, homoeostasi ensur that both 
neuron particip in the wta competit over the long run 
(detail in method section).

By definition, at everi event exactli one of the neuron win

softwar synapses, weight be updat through a simpl stdp

the same a for their softwar counterparts, but the ltp and ltd 
event be translat into puls voltag stimul and therefor 
the magnitud of weight chang be inher set by each

ize in supplementari tabl 3. 

result from a wta network experi (run no. 1) be 
show in fig. 3. both hardwar and softwar synapt weight wij 
be initi close to 0 (see method section) and subsequ 
the network be allow to react to the incom pattern freely. 
accord to theoret wta models, unsupervis synapt 
adapt through stdp should lead to a cluster of input 
such that each neuron be preferenti activ by one of the 
prototyp pattern and noisi variat of it. figur 3 demon- 
strate thi behaviour in our set-up with memrist synapses. 
the special evolut in fig. 3b show how after a brief 
initi phase of uncertainti where the neuron be approxim 
equal attun to both pattern and none can claim domin 
over either pattern (approxim first 20–30 samples), the 
hardwar synaps neuron develop a clear prefer for pattern 
0110 (special S approach � 1). similarly, we can use the 
weight of softwar and hardwar synapsi at each trial to plot 
comput membran potenti for each neuron in respons to 
each pattern. thi be show in fig. 3c where we observ how at 
the begin of the run neither neuron have ani intrins 
prefer for ani pattern (that be independ of the neuron– 
neuron interact through the wta); thi onli start develop 
afterwards. the robust of these experi be confirm 
by repeat the experi three time in total. result from all 
three run be summar in supplementari fig. 6 and 
supplementari note 6. 

examin the evolut of weight valu throughout the run 
(fig. 3d) we observ that the hardwar synaps weight 

experi noisi and slow drift from their initi values. To 
quantifi thi the evolut of each weight over trial be fit to 
an exponenti function and the s.d. of the residu be then 
computed. thi yield estim of both the nois level and the 
overal weight chang for each synaps over the trial (for full 
result see supplementari note 7 and supplementari fig. 7). the 
softwar synapsi concurr experi similarli imperfect 
drift toward their final state. for comparison, see supplementari 
fig 8 and 9 in the case where softwar synapsi be noise-free. 
these result be confirm by fig. 3e,f where we see a

pattern differ from 0110 in onli one posit (0110d) on the 
one hand (purpl shading) and 1001 with 1001d (pattern 
differ from 1001 in onli one position) on the other hand 
(green shading) toward the end of the experi versu the 
beginning. specifically, at the begin of the run pattern 1001 
and 1001d caus the neuron that ultim assign itself to them 
(softwar synapse) to fire onli approxim 56% of the time 
whilst similarli the hardwar synaps neuron respond to it 
correspond pattern (0110 and 0110d) approxim 77% of 
the time. In contrast, at the end of the run classif accuraci 
increas to 100% for both neurons. thus, the wta network 
success segreg the prototyp pattern despit the presenc 
of noise. thi result be achiev in a fulli unsupervis manner. 
An exampl case of how the same test evolv when softwar 
synaps imperfect be suppress be show in supplementari 
note 8 and supplementari fig 8 and 9. 

finally, to demonstr that the wta network be capabl of not 
onli learn a pattern but also if demand forget and 
relearn it, a further set of experi be conducted. thi 
consist of two further, consecut wta learn run (run 
no. 2 and 3) immedi follow the main run from fig. 3 
(bi the end of which we recal the memristor synapsi have 
special their neuron to pattern 0110). At the begin of 
each of these addit run the softwar synapsi be 
initi such that the network special acquir dure 
the immedi preced learn run be revers (hardwar 
synapsi be left unchanged). under these circumst the 
memristor-bas synapsi be expect to respond by flip 
their intrins prefer to the opposit pattern. result be 
show in fig. 4. 

In the case of the first addit run, the softwar synapsi 
be initi in such way a to instantli revers the prefer 
pattern-to-neuron map outcom of the previou learn 
session and start the learn run with the softwar synapse, 
rather than the memristor synaps neuron more respons to 
pattern 0110. such initi should induc the memristor 
synapsi to attempt special on pattern 1001 instead. the 
top half of fig. 4 show that thi be inde the case: at the end of 
the run the hardwar synaps neuron have lose it intrins 
prefer to pattern 0110 and begin switch to 1001 a 
evid by the membran potenti plot (fig. 4b), which 
allow the softwar neuron to consolid it domin of 
0110 (fig. 4a). simultaneously, the softwar synaps weight 
remain rel static around their extrem values, a 
initialized. the second addit run similarli initi the 
softwar synapsi appropri to guid the memristor 
synapsi to re-speci on pattern 0110. thi success 
occur a evid by fig. 4f–j and confirm by addit 
run show in supplementari fig. 10 and supplementari note 
9. In both cases, the fire count histogram (fig. 4d,e,i,j) show 
how the initi classif prefer of each neuron becom

chang in both softwar and hardwar synaps weight with

discuss 
In thi work we demonstr that metal-oxide-bas synapsi 
with inherent, gradual, self-limit switch properti be 
capabl of learn and re-learn of input pattern in an 
unsupervis manner within a probabilist wta network. key 
to the learn process be the memristors’ capabl of encod 
condit probabl of the expect input signal within their 
resist states. As a notabl consequ of the probabilist 
learn scheme, ubiquit (and unavoidable) noisi chang in 
the resist state be continu counterbal by the 
ongo align of present weight with futur present 
inputs. 

thi studi be perform on tio2-bas devices, which have 
histor be one of the signific metal-oxid system use 
in memrist devices49. In previou work, we have identifi that 
these devic support multi-level switching50, the emul of 
short- and long-term plasticity20,30, and bidirect gradual 
switching51, which we can reliabl detect use our tailor-mad 
instruments48 even at low off/on resist state ratios. A brief 
discuss on the electrochemistri behind our devic be includ 
in supplementari note 10. endur and retent data on our 
devic be show in supplementari fig 11 and 12. here we 
build on our previou result for demonstr a memristor- 
based, system-level application. the present concept may 
extend to other memristor technolog base on differ metal- 
oxid such a hfo2 and ta2o5 that have show great promis 
toward memori applications. 

for the purpos of thi work, our prototyp be oper 
under low voltag conditions, that be close to their threshold 

voltag (supplementari tabl 2, 3). importantly, the devices’ 
threshold voltag be not rigidli fixed, but rather depend on 
stimulu waveform shape, a well a the initi memori state of 
the devices. for example, the threshold voltag depend on 
square-wav puls durat be show in the supplementari fig. 
13. As a result, the voltag amplitud of the pre-waveform, a 
show in fig. 1a–c, be import a it determin the voltag 
contrast between: first, the super-threshold peak in the preþ post 
waveform and the sub-threshold peak in the post-onli waveform 
and second the pre-onli waveform and the post-onli peak. larger 
contrast mean that spuriou drift effect induc by threshold 
voltag variabl can be mitig more effectively. thi reduc 
the risk aris from unwant plastic caus by repeat pre- 
puls without ani post-response, a well a unwanted, 
concurr dut resist state disturb by both the peak 
and the trough of the post-waveform. 

consid futur implement of practic memristor- 
base system we note the following: first, the downscal of the 
memristor compon itself a a memori storag element be 
alreadi compar favour to mainstream technolog 
(for example, static random access memory—sram), a 
memristor in the 10 nm� 10 nm¼ 100 nm2 rang have alreadi 
be demonstrated11. sram scale be project to becom 
difficult at below 50,000 nm2 even under favour process 
variabl conditions52 (but note 1t-sram technology53). even 
though the perform of memristor devic be also know to be 
impact by downscaling, through, for example, increas access 
wire resistance, the advantag over sram be expect to 
dominate. furthermore, we note that memristor can pack

more than 1 bit/storag element in a non-volatil manner whilst 
sram be pure digit and volatile. second, at the array level, the 
pack densiti of memristor can be in-principl increas by 
the develop of high densiti three-dimension crossbar 
arrays54, where back-end integr selector elements55 could 
mitig the well-known sneak path problem56. third, at the 
peripher circuit level the trade-off between memristor 
function and circuit complex need to be studi more 
in-depth. standard squar puls gener (for write) and sens 
amplifi (for read), also use in convent memori systems, 
might suffic if memristor be to be treat a binari data storag 
elements. more complic circuit capabl of gener 
multipl voltag level (write) and read absolut resist 
valu will be, however, need for multi-st operation; a 
compromis between high bit resolut oper and 
requir silicon real estat for peripher circuits. finally, the 
challeng of interfac with analogu hardware-bas artifici 
neuron have to be considered. optim oper will be 
achiev if the artifici neuron output spike of the form 
exhibit in fig. 1a–c and all the voltag involv be within the 
headroom requir by the artifici neuron circuitry. If the former 
condit be not met, then each neuron will need to be equip 
with a suitabl output waveform-shap circuit at the moder 
cost of 1 per neuron. thi can be expect to be a rel minor 
inconveni if the waveform involv be simpli variabl 
durat squar waves; easili obtain via digit clock signals. 
If the latter condit be not met, then addit suppli rail will 
have to be introduc on-chip and the output waveform-shap 
circuit will requir level shifter of voltag difference-rel 
level of complexity; yet the cost will remain at the 1 per neuron 
level. notably, in thi work bias condit be individu 
tailor for each memrist synapse, a result of device-to-devic 
variabl that be expect to becom increasingli challeng 
with downscaling. improv in control over fabric and 
electroform condit be need to counterbal that 
effect and deliv memristor that oper under suffici 
uniform bias condit to use a single, non-programm 
waveform-shap circuit for all devic in practic systems. 

the wta architectur use in thi studi can be see a a 
simplifi version of cortic layer 2/3 where parvalbumin- 
posit interneuron provid feedback inhibit to pyramid 
cell (see, for example, ref 44,46,47,57,58 for similar models). 
recent experiment data on the connect dynam in cortic 
circuit suggest that synapt modif in the cortex be 
stochast (for example, ref 59–61). thi be of particular 
relev to our studi a our result demonstr wta 
architectur be particularli robust against the noisi synapt 
plastic exhibit by our memrist prototypes, also note 
through simul in ref. 17. In addition, the theoret 
framework introduc in ref 62,63 indic that stochast 
plastic may even have advantag comput properties, 
in that it perform bayesian infer on optim circuit 
parameters, suggest that the inher stochast properti of 
memristor could even be benefici to learning. 

In our experiments, the prototyp pattern 1001 and 0110 be 
present a noisi version where each compon be 
independ invert with a probabl of 10%. hence, the 
present pattern for prototyp 1001 includ pattern 0001, 
1000, 1101 and 1011. these pattern be denot by 1001d 
(analog noisi version of 0110 be denot by 0110d). In 
particular the noisi version 1101 and 1011 show signific 
overlap with the other prototyp 0110 sinc they includ one of 
their two non-zero bits. our result (see, for example, fig. 3e,f) 
show that the system be veri robust to such pattern overlap sinc 
those neuron that special on the prototyp also respond to 
the correspond d pattern after learning. for the current 

set-up, we do not use pattern overlap in the prototyp pattern 
becaus of their veri low dimensionality. the theori for wta 
network and experi from comput simul (see, for 
example, ref. 47) show that such overlap pose no difficulti for 
the circuit for high-dimension inputs. hence, we do not expect 
ani addit hardwar cost to account for pattern overlap due 
to the inher robust of wta circuit to such pattern sets. 

In the wta experiments, the hebbian-typ synapt plastic 
rule be complement with a homoeostat plastic rule, which 
regul the intrins excit of the neurons. notably, 
homoeostat intrins plastic onli add a bia to the neuron 
membran potenti and, thus, do not affect a neuron’ rel 
fire prefer to differ input patterns. It also influenc the 
emerg synapt weight configur onli indirectli by 
ensur that all wta neuron maintain a long-term averag 
fire rate and therebi modul the success of ltp/ltd 
plastic signals, which the memristor synapsi observe. while 
homoeostat intrins plastic have be proven mathemat 
to harden robust of unsupervis learn in stochast wta 
circuits, it implement in neuromorph design be possible, 
for example, via a local accumul circuit per neuron. notably, 
homoeostat contribut to the overal membran potenti 
dure learn (fig. 3) be significantli small than synapt 
contribut a depict in supplementari fig. 14. 

In conclusion, in thi work we have demonstr for the first 
time that individual, solid-st memristor can emul 
complex, weight-depend plasticity, includ unsupervis 
classification, forget and relearning, within an experi- 
mental wta network setting. thi pave the way toward 
real-tim on-nod process of big, unstructur data; an 
enabl technolog for address the challeng aris 
from the volum of data gener by the internet-of-th 
revolution. 

method 
devic fabric and preparation. for all experiments, tio2-bas micro- 
metre-scal devic be use use a metal–insulator–met structure. the 
process flow start by thermal oxidis a 6 inch silicon wafer to creat a layer 
that serf a an insul medium. then, three major step be realiz to 
obtain the bottom electrode, activ layer and top electrod consecutively. each 
step consist of optic lithography, materi deposit and liftoff process. the 
10 nm platinum layer be deposit for top electrod and bottom electrod by 
electron beam evaporation, whilst 25 nm tio2 be deposit by reactiv mag- 
netron sputtering. these fabric step result in a metal–insulator–met 
stack of pt(10 nm)/tio2(25 nm)/pt(10 nm); devic use with slight variat 
for mani other purpos in our group27,51. befor use, all devic be 
electroform use posit polar (top electrod at high potenti than 
bottom electrode) puls voltag ramps. A seri resistor be use a a current- 
limit mechan in all cases. typic electroform voltag be in the 
rang of 7–8 V. 

wta network set-up. In the wta network, neuron fire with probabl pi a 
determin by the abstract membran potenti ui(y,t) accord to equat (3) 
and (4). the network respons in turn trigger plastic of the hardwar and 
softwar synapses, a well a of the excit yi. for the wta network set-up, 
we henc have to defin three quantities: the plastic rule of softwar synapses; a 
function that map the memristor conduct valu g to abstract weight w in 
equat (3) (conduct to weight map function); and the plastic rule of the 
excit yi. the plastic rule of hardwar synapsi be inher control by 
the memristors.

ad realist imperfect in softwar synaps function. On top of thi 
ideal, theoret framework we have add two mechan of softwar synapt 
weight corrupt to good match the memristors’ own noisi and variabl beha- 
viour. under thi more realist framework we make a distinct between the true, 
underli weight wij and the a measur weight, includ measur nois vij. 
the first weight corrupt mechan reflect the memristors’ cycle-to-cycl var- 
iation, which in our case manifest itself a variabl conduct jump give 
ident stimulu and initi conduct conditions. thi be model by add a 
switch variabl term wvar drawn from a gaussian distribut with ssw¼ 0.04

evid in the supplementari fig. 7, where the evolut of individu synapt 
weight dure an ann learn trial be plotted. 

the second weight corrupt mechan introduc a degre of measur 
nois in the softwar synapses, that is, allow the system to use a slightli distort 
weight valu without caus ani chang in the underli valu of wij. As such, at 
everi time step, the weight valu use to comput neuron membran potenti 
and by extens contribut to deciding, which neuron fire to each present

where wmn be an add measur nois term drawn from a gaussian

determin by estimating/quantifi the measur nois in our devic and 
adjust the softwar so a to behav slightli more stochast than the 
memristor (supplementari tabl 6). 

homoeostat plasticity. furthermore, to facilit robust learn we use a 
homoeostat plastic mechan for the excit yi. At the begin of each 
learn experi (initi learn only, thi do not appli to revers learn 
experi where continu of yi be maintained), the yi be initi at 0. then, 
befor each time step t the excit be updat accord to

with learn rate zy¼ 0.03. the homoeostat plastic rule (13) make sure that 
both neuron will particip in the competit and fire, on average, equal often: if 
a neuron fire on averag dure one half of the time steps, the valu of it yi will 
remain approxim stable. otherwise, it yi will slowli increas (if the neuron fire 
rarely) or decreas (if the neuron fire frequently). the rule (13) defin the plastic 
rule of the excitability. notabl thi homoeostasi rule be veri similar to the one use 
in ref. 17 where although specif detail be not given, the spike frequenc of all 
neuron be period assess and an equival to the yi term be adjust 
accordingly. In thi work thi procedur take place at everi trial, which may allow 
finer and more respons homoeostat control. the behaviour of thi plastic rule 
be describ in ref. 44. 

memristor paramet extraction. for the wta experiment, the paramet in 
equat (10) must be individu determin for each memristor. To thi end, the 
conduct oper rang of each devic be extract in the set-up of fig. 1d 
befor the wta experiment. the paramet a and b be then implicitli defin 
by directli map two conduct point glow and ghigh to abstract weight 
valu � 2.2 and þ 2.2, respectively. the valu for glow and ghigh for each devic 
be show in supplementari tabl 3. the numer valu for all initi and final 
weight dure the wta experi be provid in supplementari tabl 5 for 
both softwar and memrist synapses. 

network initi procedures. the experiment run correspond to fig. 3 
(and similar, confirm run includ in the supplementari material) requir all 
weight to be initi a close to 0 a possible. for the hardwar synapsi thi be do 
through the memristor-handl instrument (supplementari fig. 15) by manual 
appli a suitabl number of squar wave puls on each device. We do not seek to 
autom thi process at thi stage. for the softwar synapses, the initi underli 
weight wij be set to 0, but then corrupt by measur nois befor use a
