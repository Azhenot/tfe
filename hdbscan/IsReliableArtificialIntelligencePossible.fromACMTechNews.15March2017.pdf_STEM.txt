14.03.17 - In the quest for reliabl artifici intelligence, epfl scientist marcel salathé argu that AI technolog should be openli available. He will 
be discuss the topic at thi year’ edit of south by south west on march 14 in austin, texas. 

will artifici intellig (ai) chang the natur of work? for epfl theoret biologist marcel salathé, the answer be invari yes. To him, a more fundament 

question that need to be address be who own that artifici intelligence? 

“we have to hold AI accountable, and the onli way to do thi be to verifi it for bia and make sure there be no deliber misinformation,” say salathé. “thi be not

possibl if the AI be privatized.” 

AI be both the algorithm and the data 

So what exactli be ai? It be gener regard a “intellig exhibit by machines”. today, it be highli task specific, special design to beat human at strateg 

game like chess and go, or diagnos skin diseas on par with doctors’ skills. 

On a practic level, AI be implement through what scientist call “machin learning”, which mean use a comput to run specif design softwar that can 

be “trained”, i.e. process data with the help of algorithm and to correctli identifi certain featur from that data set. like human cognition, AI learn by trial and error. 

unlik humans, however, AI can process and recal larg quantiti of data, give it a tremend advantag over us. 

crucial to AI learning, therefore, be the underli data. for salathé, AI be defin by both the algorithm and the data, and a such, both should be publicli available. 

deep learn algorithm can be perturb 

last year, salathé creat an algorithm to recogn plant diseases. with more than 50,000 photo of healthi and diseas plant in the database, the algorithm 

us artifici intellig to diagnos plant diseas with the help of your smartphone. As for human disease, a recent studi by a stanford group on cancer show 

that AI can be train to recogn skin cancer slightli good than a group of doctors. the consequ be far-reaching: AI may one day diagnos our diseas 

instead of doctors. If so, will we realli be abl to trust it diagnosis? 

these diagnost tool use data set of imag to train and learn. but visual data set can be perturb that prevent deep learn algorithm from correctli 

classifi images. deep neural network be highli vulner to visual perturb that be practic imposs to detect with the nake eye, yet caus the AI 

to misclassifi images. 

In futur implement of ai-assist medic diagnost tools, these perturb pose a seriou threat. more generally, the perturb be real and may 

alreadi be affect the filter inform that reach u everi day. these vulner underscor the import of certifi AI technolog and monitor it 

reliability.
