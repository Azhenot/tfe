thi paper present a platform combin an invers electromagnet design comput method 
with addit manufactur to design and fabric all-dielectr metadevices. As oppos to 
convent flat metasurface-bas devic that be compos of reson build block result 
in narrow band operation, the propos design approach creat non-resonant, broadband (δλ/λ up 
to >50%) metadevic base on low-index dielectr materials. high-effici (transmiss >60%), 
thin (≤2λ) metadevic capabl of polar splitting, beam bending, and focu be proposed. 
experiment demonstr be perform at millimeter-wav frequenc use 3d-print devices. 
the propos platform can be readili appli to the design and fabric of electromagnet and 
photon metadevic span microwav to optic frequencies. 

convent optic element that control the polarization, phase and amplitud of electromagnet (em) radi- 
ation such a lenses, polarizers, beamsplitters, and mirror be typic engin at a scale much larg than 
the wavelength. within the last two decades, signific amount of research have be devot to understand 
light-matt interact and design novel materi and electromagnet devic with subwavelength features. 
metamaterials, and more gener materi compos of nanostructur with subwavelength featur size, have 
emerg a a viabl platform to manipul electromagnet radiat in unconvent manners1,2. In particu- 
lar, photon crystals3 and negative-index materials4 have be use to achiev sub-diffract lensing5–7. more 
recently, metasurfaces8–10 have gain substanti interest due to their abil to perform optic function 
such a lensing11, holograms12,13 and beam shaping14 within an extrem thin layer. although the abil to con- 
trol phase, amplitud and polar use subwavelength-thick metasurfac be a promis rout toward 
build miniatur optic devices, they suffer from sever drawback prohibit their potenti in replac 
convent bulk optic elements. initi metasurfac design util plasmon metal that exhibit high opti- 
cal loss and thu be of rel low efficiency15. lossi metal have be replac with high-index dielectr 
materi like amorph silicon16, but such metasurfac often reli on mie-typ reson that result in a nar- 
row wavelength rang of operation14,17. 

typic metasurfac design start with identif of an optic reson with a well-defin geometr 
shape, such a triangles18, rectangles12,19, ellipses14 or v-antennas8,15. phase inform be then calcul for 
variou geometr paramet such a radius, width, orientation, etc.16. the number of degre of freedom in 
the design of these shape be veri limited, which make it difficult to optim both effici and bandwidth of 
metadevic while achiev full control of the polarization. here, we use an invers electromagnet method20–26 
to design high-effici (>60%), broadband (δλ/λ > 25%), dielectric-bas thin (≤2λ) electromagnet meta- 
devic overcom the aforement limitations. invers design open up the entir design space to enabl 
metadevic with increas and enhanc functionalities. In order to demonstr the feasibl of our invers 
design approach, we use addit manufactur to print a low-loss polym into a complex geometr pattern. 
We demonstr the design, fabric and character of wavelength-scal metadevic for bending, polar- 
izat split and focu of EM radiat at millimeter-wav frequencies. 

design method 
first, we design two meta-gr to behav a polar beamsplitt for normal incid free-spac radi- 
ation. As illustr in fig. 1a, those devic bend parallel and perpendicular polar to opposit diffrac- 
tion orders. We also design a meta-gr that bend both polar to the same diffract order (fig. 1b).

finally, we propos a ~λ-thick flat metalen (fig. 1c) that convert a normal incid plane-wav into a focus- 
ing cylindr wave. 

We use the objective-first algorithm22,27,28 in which the electromagnet wave equation: 

E w emin (1)e, 
2ε∇ × ∇ × −ε 

be treat a an optim problem. thi nonlinear optim be decompos in two subproblems, where 
each variabl (ε and E) be fix while linear optim be perform on the other variable, altern and iter- 
atively, and where boundari electromagnet field distribut reprent the desir behavior be constraint of 
the model. there be no gener method to find the optimum solut of (1), but the propos method converg 
most of the time toward solut that satisfi desir function with accept performance. An on-chip 
wavelength splitter22 and an optic diode29 have be success demonstr use such invers electromag- 
netic design approach. 

figur 1. schemat for the invers electromagnet approach for design free-spac metadevices. the 
desir optic function be defin by a set of input and output condit at the boundari of the design 
space. A polar splitter (a) be a grate that convert normal incid plane wave of parallel and 
perpendicular polar into two differ diffract orders. A bend devic (b) convert a normal 
incid plane wave into the same diffract order. A flat metalen (c) be a devic that convert a plane wave 
into a cylindr wave converg to a chosen focal point.

bend and polar split be achiev use meta-gr that convert an input plane wave to an 
output plane wave with a differ diffract order than m = 0, with period boundari condit along the 
x-axis. for metalenses, we aim to focu an input plane wave at a desir focal distance; hence, the output be chosen 
to be the field of a cylindr wave center in the desir focal point, follow the equat (approxim at 
larg r): 

E r E r ikr( ) exp (2)z z0 
1 
2= − 

where r be the distanc from the focal point. metalens do not perform like a grating; therefore, we set the bound- 
ari condit of a perfectli match layer (pml) along the x direction. the design be two-dimensional, which 
correspond to metadevic with infinit height along z. In practice, the fabric devic be ≈10λ thick. 

experiment section 
design and fabrication. inverse-design metadevic be fabric use addit manufacturing, com- 
monli call 3d-printing. thi bottom-up approach allow the fabric of veri complex devic with a larg 
aspect ratio. furthermore, 3d-print be an incred scalabl method, with resolut rang from 100 nm to 
1 mm30–32, allow the fabric of electromagnet devic for applic from the visibl to the millimeter- 
wave and microwav regimes33–36. here, we demonstr the propos devic in the millimeter-wav regim 
(f > 30 ghz) use high impact polystyren (hips) and a consum grade 3d-printer base on fuse deposit

model for the fabrication. the materi be chosen for it low cost and veri low attenu in the microwav to 
millimeter-wav region, with a loss-tang measur to be δ < .tan 0 003 over the 26–38 ghz band. In thi band, 
the real part of the dielectr constant of hip n2 3( 1 52)ε′ ≈ . ≈ . , which be then use a a constraint in our algo- 
rithm to design binari devic make of air (ε = 1) and hip (ε = 2.3). becaus of the low index, the phase differ- 
enc between the input and output be approxim proport to the effect thick of the polymer. 
therefore, in order to allow a 2π phase shift between a part full of polym and a part full of air, the devic thick- 
ness need to obey:

the sampl (distanc > 100λ) in order to produc a plane wave perpendicularli incid on the input surface. 
the devic be surround by radar absorb materi to prevent reflect from the surroundings. for the

(11.5 mm) and 38 ghz (7.9 mm). for the lenses, the output power be map along the axial plane on the right 
side of the devic use a probe antenna attach to a x-i stage. the measur start around 1 cm to the right 
of the devic due to technic limit of the setup, which be the reason whi the experiment intens map 
be truncat when compar to the simul maps.

result 
meta-gratings. first, we demonstr a free-spac polar splitter. the propos metadevic (fig. 2a) 
deflect a normal incid plane-wav polar along y (parallel) and z (perpendicular) direct into m = +1 
and m = −1 diffract order respect with high effici and over a broad bandwidth. the width be chosen 
to be ~2λ to reach desir phase chang a explain in the experiment section. the periodicity, L along y be 
determin by the deflect angl θ of the desir diffract order m (here m = ±1 for all devices), follow the 
grate equat L msinθ λ= . We design and optim the metadevic for an oper frequenc of 33 ghz 
(free space wavelength of λ = 9.1 mm) and a deflect angl of θ = ±30°, for which L = 1.8 cm. the inverse-de- 
sign algorithm gener a binari refractive-index distribut of dielectr and air that be then print with 
dimens of 2 cm × 7.2 cm × 8 cm. A photograph of the 3d-print metadevic be show next to the comput- 
er-gener pattern in fig. 2a, which show the high fidel of the 3d-print method. 

We measur the far-field angular transmiss through the fabric metadevic to verifi the predict polariza- 
tion split behavior. figur 2B plot the simul and measur power distribut at 33 ghz. We observ that a 
plane wave with parallel polar be bent at an angl θ = +30°, wherea the perpendicular polar be deflect 
with an angl of θ = −30°. the total power transmit by the metadevic at 33 ghz be measur to be 76% for the 
parallel polar and 54% for the perpendicular polarization, which be low than the simul valu of 90%. the 
discrep be like due to structur imperfect in the fabric devices, the finit number of period in the print 
structur a well a an imperfect plane-wav input. the reject ratio, defin a the ratio between the peak intens 
and the maximum intens outsid the main peak, be experiment found to be 5.2 dB and 7.0 dB for the parallel and 
perpendicular polarizations, respectively, which be close to the simul valu of 6.6 dB and 9.3 db, respectively. 

We perform full-field electromagnet simul to calcul the electromagnet properti of the meta- 
device. We plot the vertic fields, i.e. Hz for parallel polar (fig. 2c) and Ez for perpendicular polar 
(fig. 2d), at 33 ghz. the spatial field distribut provid a clear pictur of how the EM wave propag insid 
the metadevice. In metasurfac base on reson geometr elements, the phase chang be due to the interact 
of the incom plane-wav to a strong mie reson mode14, which typic result in a rel narrowband 
operation. here, the phase chang do not stem from the interact with a specif reson mode, but rather 
due to light propag insid the dielectr structure, with a larg phase shift of 6π in a part fill with dielec- 
tric (ε = 2.3) than a 4π shift in a part mostli void (ε = 1.0). the polar split be a result of the differ 
phase-chang respons of the devic to differ polar owe to it complex dielectr shape. 

figur 4. comparison between the perform of the inverse-design devic (A to C) and a blaze grate 
(D to F) optim to bend electromagnet radiat by 30° independ of the polarization. the simul 
far-field intens be repres for angl from −80° to 80° and for frequenc from 26 ghz to 38 ghz for 
perpendicular (b,e) and parallel (c,f) polarizations. As can be seen, the inverse-design metadevic transmit 
a much low power to undesir grate order (23% for perpendicular polar and 18% for parallel 
polarization) than the blaze grate (47% for perpendicular polar and 51% for parallel polarization). 
simul reject ratio at 33 ghz be 10.1 dB and 12.4 dB for the inverse-design bend device, compar 
to 6.6 dB and 3.8 dB for the triangular grate for perpendicular and parallel polar respectively.

although we choos 33 ghz to be the frequenc to optim for high effici in our inverse-design algorithm, 
we observ broad oper bandwidth that span a rang of frequenc from 27 to 38 ghz, for a rel bandwidth 
δλ/λ ≈ 33%, which be enabl by the inverse-design method favor non-reson dielectr structures. figur 2 plot

In order to demonstr the versatil and flexibl of the inverse-design approach, we design and fabric 
two addit metadevic that bend the millimeter-waves. the first one be a polar splitter with a bend

angl of +/−15° (fig. 3a). similar to the 30° splitter, thi devic present a gradient of dielectr fill fraction along 
the y-direct with a larg period (L = 3.5 cm) in order to favor a small bend angle. the simul and 
measur angular far-field transmit power be plot for both polar at 33 ghz in fig. 3b. the measur 
reject ratio for the 15° splitter be 8.2 dB and 10.6 dB for parallel and perpendicular polar respectively. 
the devic have a dielectr fill fraction with a similar profil to that of a bend devic toward the +15° dif- 
fraction order. the polar split be due to the coupl of perpendicular polar to a reson wave 
propag along the y-direct insid the device, which rever the bend direction. thi explain the low 
bandwidth of the devic for perpendicular polarization, from 31 to 37 ghz (a rel bandwidth of 18%), compar 
to a veri larg bandwidth for the bend behavior of parallel polarization, from 22 to 44 ghz (data not shown). the 
designs, simul field and broadband far-field data be show in figur S1 in the supplementari information. 

In addit to polar beam-splitter, we also design and realiz a polarization-independ bend 
devic (fig. 3c) which bend both polar to the same diffract order. simul and experiment 
result of the far-field power at 33 ghz be show in fig. 3d, show veri good agreement between the theori 
and experiment. the designs, simul field and broadband far-field data be show in figur s2. although 
polarization-independ bend of EM radiat can be achiev with a triangular blaze grate (fig. 4d), 
such grate deflect signific amount of power to high diffract orders, a show in fig. 4e,f. On averag 
from 26 to 38 ghz, the inverse-design devic reduc the amount of power sent into undesir diffract 
order by a factor of 2.8 for parallel polar and 2.0 for perpendicular polar when compar to a 
blaze grate of similar thickness, which can be see on the far-field power in fig. 4b,c. the bend to the first 
diffract order extend to 44 ghz with high effici (data not shown), which correspond to a rel band- 
width of 55%, but signific power be diffract to high order for larg frequencies. 

metalenses. next, we propos and design flat metalens use the inverse-design algorithm and boundari 
condit a illustr in fig. 1b. We design and fabric two differ metalens with focal length of 
2λ and 15λ, respectively. both len be optim and scale for oper around 38 ghz (λ = 7.9 mm). the 
first metalen be 1.5-cm wide, 10-cm long, the second be 2.5-cm wide and 15-cm long and both be 10-cm tall. A 
pictur of each devic be show with the computer-gener design in fig. 5. 

the electromagnet behavior of both devic be simul with a perpendicularly-polar incom plane 
wave. the electric-field intens profil for the short-rang and long-rang metalens be plot in fig. 5a,b, 
respectively. We also perform a 2D scan of the transmit power behind the metalens use a millimeter-wav 
probe antenna posit at z = 5 cm. the measur spatial intens distribut in the x-i plane for the short-rang 
and long-rang len be provid in fig. 5c,d, respectively. the simul and measur spatial-intens dis- 
tribut close match. As expected, the first devic focu EM radiat 1.5 cm (~2λ) away from the devic 
wherea the second device’ focal point be locat 12 cm (~15λ) away. the full-width-at-half-maximum (fwhm) 
of the focu radiat for both devic be 0.5 cm and 1.1 cm a show in fig. 5e,f, respectively, correspond 
to practic numer apertur (nas) of 0.8 and 0.36 respectively, close to the theoret valu of 0.82 and 0.53, 
respectively. the propos devic also show broadband focu behavior from 28 ghz to 40 ghz. We provid the 
measur and simul intens profil for oper at 30 ghz in figur s3. 

conclus 
We have present a platform combin an invers electromagnet design algorithm with addit manufactur 
for the design and fabric of novel millimeter-wav metadevices. the propos methodolog can be gener 
to ani photon devic where the desir electromagnet behavior can be defin in term of input and output field 
distributions. although we design and demonstr metadevic in the millimeter-wav region, due to the scalabil- 
iti of maxwell’ equations, similar devic can be design to oper in ani wavelength from visibl to microwav 
frequenc provid that low-loss dielectr materi can be addit fabric with subwavelength featur sizes. 
the present platform address the need for rapid versatil design and prototyp of compact, low-cost, low-loss, 
and broadband compon that can then be easili integr into complex electromagnet systems.
