orange, and pink] in the illustr on the left. In the graphic on the right, those neuron be map to spike neuron in an ibm 

truenorth chip. the spike neuron be connect by gridlik “synapses” to other neuron in the same core, and to a row of 

inputs. those input can gener spikes, which be then process by the neural network. 

tini spikes: 

the spike neuron be a differ beast. imagin a node sit on a circuit and measur whatev 

spikes—in the form of electr pulses—ar transmit along the circuit. If a certain number of spike 

occur within a certain period of time, the node be program to send along one or more new spike of 

it own, the exact number depend on the design of the particular chip. unlik the binary, 0-or-1 option 

of tradit cpus, the respons to spike can be weight to a rang of values, give neuromorph 

someth of an analog flavor. the chip save on energi in larg part becaus their neuron aren’t 

constantli firing, a occur with tradit silicon technology, but instead becom activ onli when 

they receiv a spike signal. 

“when we look at how 
neuron comput in the 
brain, there be concret 
thing we can learn” 

A neuromorph system connect these spike 

neuron into complex networks, often accord to 

a task-specif layout that programm have 

work out in advance. In a network design for 

imag recognition, for example, certain 

connect between neuron take on certain 

weights, and the way spike travel between these 

neuron with their respect weight can be make 

to repres differ objects. If one pattern of 

spike appear at the output, programm would 

know the imag be of a cat; anoth pattern of 

spike would indic the imag be of a chair. 

within neuromorphics, each research group have come up with it own design to make thi possible.

there be no consensu on what neuromorph system would actual do, except to 

somehow be use in brain research. In truth, spike chip be someth of a solut look for a 

problem. help, though, arriv unexpectedli from an entir differ part of the comput world. 

In the earli days, 

start in the 1990s, artifici intellig research make a number of theoret advanc involv 

the design of the “neural networks” that have be use for decad for comput problem solving, 

though with limit success. , with the univers of california, 

irvine’ neuromorph machin intellig lab, say that when combin with faster silicon chips, 

these new, improv neural network allow comput to make dramat advanc in classic 

comput problems, such a imag recognition. 

emr neftci (http://nmi-lab.org/people/) 

thi new breed of comput tool use what’ come to be call deep learning, and in the past few years, 

deep learn have basic take over the comput industry. member of the neuromorph research 

commun soon discov that they could take a deep-learn network and run it on their new style of 

hardware. and they could take advantag of the technology’ power efficiency: the 

, which be the size of a postag stamp and hold a million “neurons,” be design to use a tini fraction 

of the power of a standard processor. 

truenorth chip 

(http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/hardware/how-ibm-got-brainlike-efficiency-from-the-truenorth-

those power savings, say neuromorph boosters, will take deep learn to place it couldn’t previous 

go, such a insid a mobil phone, and into the world’ hottest technolog market. today, deep learn 

enabl mani of the most wide use mobil features, such a the speech recognit requir when you 

ask siri a question. but the actual process occur on giant server in the cloud, for lack of suffici 

comput horsepow on the device. with neuromorph on board, say it supporters, everyth could 

be comput locally. 

which mean that neuromorph comput has, to a consider degree, hitch it wagon to deep 

learning’ star. when ibm want to show off a killer app for it truenorth chip, it 

that classifi images. much of the neuromorph commun now defin success a

those run by google, and late for mobil phone and other small, power-sensit applications. the 

former be consid the easi engin challenge, and neuromorph optimist say commerci 

product for server farm could show up in a few a two years.

deep-learn system—known a 

—can easili be handl with 16-bit and even 

8-bit cpu components, a oppos to the 32- and 

64-bit circuit of an advanc desktop processor. 

In fact, most deep-learn system use tradit silicon, especi the graphic coprocessor found in 

the video card best know for power video games. graphic coprocessor can have thousand of 

cores, all work in tandem, and the more core there are, the more effici the deep-learn network.

So chip compani be bring out deep-learn chip that be make out of veri simple, tradit 

components, optim to use a littl power a possible. (that’ true of google’ 

, the chip 

the search compani announc last year in connect with it own deep-learn efforts.) put 

differently, neuromorphics’ main competit a the platform of choic for deep learn be an advanc 

gener of what be essenti “vanilla” silicon chips. 

tensor process unit 

(http://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/computing/hardware/google-details-tensor-chip-powers) 

some compani on the vanilla side of thi argument deni that neuromorph system have an edg in 

power efficiency. , a stanford 

electr engin professor and chief scientist at nvidia, say that the demonstr perform 

with truenorth use a veri earli version of deep learning, one with much less accuraci than be possibl 

with more recent systems. when accuraci be take into account, he said, ani energi advantag of 

neuromorph disappears. 

william J. dalli (http://cva.stanford.edu/billd_webpage_new.html) 

“peopl who do convent neural network get result and win the competitions,” dalli said. “the 

neuromorph approach be interest scientifically, but they be nowher close on accuracy.” 

indeed, research have yet to figur out simpl way to get neuromorph system to run the huge 

varieti of deep-learn network that have be develop on convent chips. 

, at the center for appli scientif comput at the lawrenc 

livermor nation laboratory, say hi group have be abl to get neural network to run on truenorth 

but that the task of pick the right network and then success port it over remain “a challenge.” 

other research say the most advanc deep-learn system requir more neurons, with more 

possibl interconnections, than current neuromorph technolog can offer. 

brian van essen

must tackl these problem with a small pool of talent. the march 

conference, the field’ flagship event, attract onli a few hundr people; meet associ with deep 

learn usual draw mani thousands. ibm, which declin to comment for thi article, say last fall that 

truenorth, which debut in 2014, be now run experi and applic for more than 130 user 

at more than 40 univers and research centers. 

the neuromorph commun 

By contrast, there be hardli a web compani or univers comput depart on the planet that isn’t 

do someth with deep learn on convent chips. As a result, those convent architectur 

have a robust suit of develop tools, along with legion of engin train in their use— typic 

advantag of an incumb technolog with a larg instal base. get the deep-learn commun 

to switch to a new and unfamiliar way of do thing will prove extrem difficult unless neuromorph 

can offer an unmistak perform and power advantage.

again, that’ a problem the neuromorph commun openli acknowledges. If the present at the 

march confer frequent refer to the challeng that lie ahead for the field, most of them also 

offer suggest on how to overcom them. 

the univers of waterloo’ eliasmith, for example, say that neuromorph must progress on a 

number of fronts. one of them be build more-robust hardware, with more neuron and 

interconnections, to handl more-advanc deep-learn systems. also needed, he said, be theoret 

insight about the inher strength and weak of neuromorph systems, to good know how to 

use them most productively. To be sure, he still believ the technolog can live up to expectations. “we 

have be see regular improvements, so i’m encouraged,” eliasmith said. 

still, the neuromorph commun might find that it current symbiot relationship with deep learn 

come with it own hazards. for all the recent success of deep learning, plenti of expert still question 

how much of an advanc it will turn out to be.

, director of

however, there be a meta-issu hover over the neuromorph community: research don’t know 

whether the spike behavior they be mimic in the brain be central to the way the mind works, or 

mere one of it mani accident by-products. indeed, the surest way to start an argument with a 

neuromorph research be to suggest that we don’t realli know enough about how the brain work to 

have ani busi tri to copi it in silicon. the usual respons you’ll get be that while we certainli don’t 

know everything, we clearli know enough to start. 

It have often be note that progress in aviat be make onli after inventor stop tri to copi the

the knock against neuromorph comput be that it’ stuck at the level of mimic flap wings, an
