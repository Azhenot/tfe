organism collect charge-lattic interact be elucid by first-principl theory, 

synchrotron investigations, ab initio molecular dynam simulations, and in situ environ- 

mental breath studies. We implement a learn algorithm inspir by the conduct 

relax behavior of perovskit that natur incorpor habituation, and demonstr 

learn to forget: a key featur of anim and human brains. incorpor thi elementari 

skill in learn boost the capabl of neural comput in a sequential, dynam

habituation, one of the primari univers learningmechanisms, can be simpli defin a the decrement inrespons to repeat stimuli. habitu be see a the 
simplest learn form exhibit by organisms, like sea slugs1 and 
fruit flies2, to more complex live forms, such a rat and 
humans3, 4, and be fundament to how an organ respond and 
adapt to it environ therebi increas it chanc of 
survival. habitu can help animals, for instance, to focu on 
import stimulu for novelti detect and thu can be view a 
an integr part of attent and learning5, 6, and have recent 
be demonstr in the single-cel non-neur organ 
physarum polycephalum, commonli know a the slime mold7. 
In non-neur organisms, habitu be manifest by a chang 
in global shape of the system (fig. 1a). In more complex organ- 
ism that poss a nervou system, habitu have be show 
to result from the decreas releas of chemic transmitt at 
synapt terminals1, 8. thi chang the weight of certain neural 
connections, a mechan know a synapt plasticity. 

the perovskit oxid compound smnio3 (sno) be a frame- 
work of tilt nio6 octahedron where sm3+ ion occupi 12-fold 
oxygen coordin site and balanc the charge9. hydrogen 
dope from the environ into lattic use catalyt 
electrod occur in a revers manner lead to massiv 
nonlinear chang in electron properties10, 11. accompani by 
incorpor of a proton, an electron can be inject into an 
unoccupi Ni eg orbital. strong coulomb interact exist in 

eg orbit gener a larg transport gap via strong correl 
effects12, 13. As show in fig. 1b, after first exposur to H2 
(environment stimulu 1), a signific fraction of Ni be reduc 
to ni2+, manifest by electron localization. On chang 
the environ (in thi case by air exposure) for a short period 
of time follow by re-exposur to h2, addit proton 
be incorpor into sno, but with slow kinetics, and 
keep diminishing. while the perovskit mimic habituation, the 
vari conduct due to the correl interact show 
inher plastic that can emul biolog synapsi of neural 
organ that be capabl of more complex functionalities. base 
on thi discovery, we design a learn mechan we term 
adapt synapt plastic (asp) that augment tradit 
neural system with the key abil of learn to forget for robust 
and continu learn in a dynam evolv environ 
(supplementari fig. 1).

molecular dynam simul of proton migration. We use 
ab initio molecular dynam (aimd) to studi the mechan of 
proton migration. We found that even at room temperature, the 
dopant hop from an oxygen atom to a neighbor one within 
nio6 octahedron (fig. 2e). the proton be initi bound to atom 
O1 (fig. 2e, i) at a distanc of approxim 2.83 Å away from 
the O2 atom. the proton first rotat about the O1 atom (fig. 2e, 
i–iii), while be bound to O1 until the o2-h distanc be lower 

to approxim 1.72 Å (fig. 2e, iii). thi rotat process be 
associ with an energi barrier of 0.27 ev, which be low than 
the typic activ barrier for H+ migrat encount in 
proton conduct perovskit (e.g., in the canon y-dope 
bazro3, ΔE ~0.46 ev24). onc the proton come into the vicin 
of O2 atom (fig. 2e, iii), it hop over, and bind to O2 atom with 
a neglig energi penalti of 0.046 eV (fig. 2e, iii–v). the proton 
migrat between neighbor O atom be visual in a video

learn to forget with asp. the conduct relax 
observ from fig. 2b due to collect effect allow u to use the 
organismoid’ behavior to modul synapt plastic for 
memor and forgetting. asp blend nonassoci 
habitu behavior with time-bas correl learn that 
help in retent and gradual adapt to new inputs, a well 
as, evok competit across neuron to learn distinct patterns. 
We seamlessli integr weight decay with tradit synapt 
plastic and modul the leak rate use the tempor dynam 
of pre- and post-synapt neuron to realiz habituation. 
while the tempor correl help in learn new input 
patterns, the retent of old data and gradual forget be

while the connect (or neurons) correspond to recent

discuss 
habitu be refer to a diminish of respons to a fre- 
quentli repeat stimulu in the organism biolog literature26. 
We explain the principl further in thi section to enabl a 
gener platform for materi design, and illustr the experi- 
mental envelop and dynamics. To achiev plastic in the per- 
ovskite, we vari the environ dynam without allow 
the system to achiev equilibrium. for instance, if we simpli 
expos the perovskit at 50°c to hydrogen indefinitely, the 
resist will increas to a self-limit valu and satur over 
a period of sever hours. instead, we perturb the system well 
befor satur and then re-expos to the environ befor 
complet revers to the origin state. In thi manner, the 
environ be dynam modul over appropri time 
scale quit similar to studi conduct on organisms. the 
perovskit retain memori of the previou exposur sinc not all 
of the dopant have left the lattic and be therefor continu 
modified, lead to diminish response. the perovskit 
nickel show larg nonlinear chang in conduct upon 
electron dope due to strong correl in the partial fill eg 
Ni orbitals, enabl the mimicri of environment plasticity. 
other materi that show nonlinear chang of function 
properti in respons to extern stimulu may be consid to 
further investig similar organism behavior. similarly, for 
reversibility, weak bind of the dopant to the lattic and escap 
back into the environ be important. the time scale in our 
experi be chosen, in part, to be in the rang of experiment 
studi in biology, and be also close to what be note for decis 
make in ant colonies, bees, and relat speci where envir- 
onment chemic trace (i.e., diffus of ga or scent over 
sensori distances27, 28) be use for forag food or collect 
locomot to illustr proof-of-principle. As a comparison, the 
respons of neural connect in the brain be of the order 
of millisecond and electron memori be of the order of 
sub-microseconds. To mimic such faster time scales, instead of 
vari the gas-phas speci in an environment chamber 
(like we have do at a synchrotron beamline), one can use thin 
film solid or liquid electrolyt interfac with the perovskit or 
other materi system and rapidli move protons, oxygen, 
lithium, or other ion into and out of the habitu material. 
sinc ion be charg and electron can be revers anchor 
to the partial fill d-orbitals, electr field can be use to 
oper these devic that can be integr onto circuits29–31. 
the vari conduct of the perovskit organismoid indic 
an inher plastic that can be use for creat artifici neural 
systems. thi motiv u to design asp that incorpor 
habitu with tradit spike-tim correlation-bas 
learning. It be implement by modul the exponenti leak 

rate of the weight base on the signific of the incom 
inputs, and be critic for learn to forget in a dynam 
environment. As explain in supplementari note 4, thi model 
be also compat with other class of oxide-ion devic that 
incorpor filamentari switch or spin-bas devices. 

the abil to learn task in a sequenti fashion be crucial to the 
develop of neural systems. In sequenti learning, dure the 
train process no inform be re-pres to the network. 
such continual/sequenti learn pose particular challeng for 
neural network due to the tendenc for knowledg of previous 
learnt task(s) (e.g., task A) to be abruptli lose a inform 
relev to the current task (e.g., task B) be incorporated. 
thi phenomenon, term catastroph forgetting19, 32, 33, occur 
specif when the network be train sequenti on multipl 
task becaus the weight in the network that be import for 
task A be chang to meet the object of task B. 

typically, snn use stdp to modifi the synapt weight for 
unsupervis learn of inputs. however, memori persist be 
a promin problem that have be well-docu with stdp 
a it impli that ani pre/post spike pair can modifi the synapse, 
potenti eras past memori abruptli lead to catastroph 
forgetting19, 32, 33. here, we note specif that catastroph 
forget will occur onli when consid sequenti learn of 
tasks. 

In our experi with mnist digit recognition, we show 
each class/digit sequenti therebi creat a dynam learn 
environ (refer to method for details). present the digit 
one-by-on sequentially, i.e., first all the imag for digit 0 fol- 
low by digit 1, and so on, can be treat a a dynam learn 
environment. No particular digit instanc or class be re-shown to 
the network. thus, even with proper stdp tune and slow 
learn rate, we cannot still unlearn the alreadi learnt digits, 
when new pattern be show to the network. thi result in 
overlap of represent a see in fig. 3 and supplementari 
fig. 10. the decay mechan incorpor with asp (util 
habituation) in turn help in unlearn or forget the pre- 
viousli learnt data to learn new pattern without ani overlap. 

furthermore, in order to prevent catastroph forget in 
stdp-learnt snns, the network be gener re-train with both 
the new and the old inform (alreadi learnt) when the

growth of epitaxi perovskit oxid thin films. laalo3 (001) singl crystal 
be use a substrat for epitaxi growth of sno thin film by magnetron 
co-sputt of metal nickel in direct-curr mode (at power of 75w) and 
samarium target under radio-frequ mode (at power of 150w) in 5 mtorr of 
argon and oxygen mixtur flow at rate of 40/10 standard cubic centimet per 
minut (sccm). the as-sputt sampl be then transfer into a custom-built 
high-pressur vessel and anneal under 100 bar of pure oxygen at 500 °C for 24 h 
in a tube furnace.

brookhaven nation laboratory. all data be collect use horizont 
polar light and a vertic scatter geometry, with photon energi tune near 
the ni-l3 absorpt edge. the probe geometri be illustr in supplementari 
fig. 7a. the pristin sno thin film be pattern with Pt stripe and hydrogen be 
intercal to yield electron-dop region h-smnio3 (h-sno) of width 0.1 mm. 
the magnet scatter signal be measur by a two-dimension charge-coupl 
devic (ccd) posit 33 cm from the sample, while the x-ray absorpt be
