artifici muscl hold promis for safe and power actuat for 
myriad common machin and robots. however, the design, fab- 
rication, and implement of artifici muscl be often lim- 
ite by their materi costs, oper principle, scalability, and 
single-degree-of-freedom contractil actuat motions. here we 
propos an architectur for fluid-driven origami-inspir artifici 
muscles. thi concept requir onli a compress skeleton, a 
flexibl skin, and a fluid medium. A mechan model be devel- 
ope to explain the interact of the three components. A fabri- 
cation method be introduc to rapidli manufactur low-cost arti- 
ficial muscl use variou materi and at multipl scales. the 
artifici muscl can be program to achiev multiaxi motion 
includ contraction, bending, and torsion. these motion can 
be aggreg into system with multipl degre of freedom, 
which be abl to produc control motion at differ rates. 
our artifici muscl can be driven by fluid at neg pres- 
sure (rel to ambient). thi featur make actuat safer 
than most other fluidic artifici muscl that oper with posi- 
tive pressures. experi reveal that these muscl can contract 
over 90% of their initi lengths, gener stress of ∼600 kpa, 
and produc peak power densiti over 2 kw/kg—all equal to, or 
in excess of, natur muscle. thi architectur for artifici muscl 
open the door to rapid design and low-cost fabric of actua- 
tion system for numer applic at multipl scales, rang 
from miniatur medic devic to wearabl robot exoskeleton 
to larg deploy structur for space exploration. 

artifici muscl | origami | actuat | robot | soft robot 

artifici muscl (1, 2) be a long-sought class of actuatorsfor applic in industri robots, wearabl devices, and 
medic instrument (3–10). numer transduct method 
have be proposed, includ the use of thermal energy, elec- 
tric fields, and pressur fluids. shape-memori alloy (smas) 
can gener a larg contractil stress (>200 mpa) when they 
be heat abov their (solid-state) phase transit temperatur 
but at the cost of hysteresi and slow cycl time (11). low-cost 
polym fibers, such a a twist fish line and sew thread, 
have be demonstr to gener impress larg stress 
up to 140 mpa (4.5% stroke) and signific tensil stroke up 
to 49% (1 mpa load). similar to smas, thi twist fiber-bas 
muscl be thermal driven; thus, it energi convers effici 
be low (<2%) rel to natur muscl (40%) (12). electroac- 
tive polym (eaps), either ionic (13) or dielectr (14–16), be 
wide investig materi for build artifici muscl due to 
their rel high effici (≈30%), light weight, and struc- 
tural complianc (elast modulu <1 mpa) (1, 17). polymer- 
base actuat have materi properti that close mimic mus- 
cle and can produc substanti deform in the presenc 
of an extern electr field (18, 19). however, often extrem 
high voltag (typic >1 kV for dielectr elastom actua- 
tors) or hermet encapsul (in the case of ionic polymer– 
metal composites) be requir (13), pose barrier to practic 
applications. electr driven hydrogel be abl to produc 
revers actuat at small scale (20), howev their respons 
be rel slow (from second to hours) compar with other 
artifici muscl (1, 21). phase-chang materi (both liquid– 

ga and solid–liquid transitions) have be use to build electri- 
calli driven elastomer artifici muscl (22, 23). these mus- 
cle exhibit veri promis perform in term of high strain 
(up to 900%) and high stress (up to 29 mpa), while their energi 
effici be similar to sma and their actuat speed be 
rel slow. 

fluid-driven actuat be the most wide use artifici 
muscl due to their simplicity, larg actuat stress and defor- 
mation, high energi efficiency, and low cost (24–28). the 
mckibben actuat be one of the most popular fluidic artifici 
muscl (29, 30). A linear contract and larg forc can be 
produc when a posit fluidic pressur be appli to a bladder 
insid an anisotrop outer mesh. thi kind of artifici muscl 
can be driven either pneumat or hydraulically. however, a 
high-pressur (>100 kpa) fluid be need where the pressur be 
determin by the constitu materi properti and desir 
forc and displacement. relat actuat such a pouch motor 
(31) and peano muscl (32, 33) have a simpl planar architec- 
ture compar with the standard mckibben actuator. these arti- 
ficial muscl can gener both linear contract and torsion 
motion at a rel low air pressur (10 kpa). the contrac- 
tion ratio of these muscl be limit to ∼36% due the cylin- 
drical geometri of their inflat membranes. vacuum-actu 
muscle-inspir pneumat structur (vamps) be elastomer 
actuat that exhibit similar revers behavior and mechani- 
cal perform a those of natur skelet muscl (34). pla- 
nar linear contract and torsion motion can be gener by 
vamp through the buckl of their elastomer beam caus 

signific 

artifici muscl be flexibl actuat with capabl sim- 
ilar to, or even beyond, natur muscles. they have be 
wide use in mani applic a altern to more 
tradit rigid electromagnet motors. numer studi 
focu on rapid design and low-cost fabric of artifici 
muscl with custom performances. here, we present an 
architectur for fluidic artifici muscl with unpreced 
performance-to-cost ratio. these artifici muscl can be pro- 
grame to produc not onli a singl contract but also 
complex multiaxi actuation, and even control motion 
with multipl degre of freedom. moreover, a wide vari- 
eti of materi and fabric process can be use to 
build the artifici muscl with other function beyond basic 
actuation.

oper offer great safety, compactness, and robust 
compar with other fluidic artifici muscl driven by posit 
pressure, yet the maximum actuat stress (65 kpa) and contrac- 
tion (45%) that vamp can gener be limit by the neg 
pressur (vacuum) and the buckl strength of their elastomer

architectur allow u to program artifici muscl with multiax- 
ial complex motion a well a control motion at differ 
rates. these artifici muscl be fast, powerful, and energi effi- 
cient, and they can be fabric at multipl scale use a varieti 
of materi at veri low cost (fig. 1 A and b). 

principl of oper and model 
our artifici muscl system consist of three fundament com- 
ponents: a compress solid skelet structure, a flexibl fluid- 
tight skin, and a fluid medium. In thi system, the skin be seal a 
a bag cover the intern components. the fluid medium fill 
the intern space between the skeleton and the skin. In the ini- 
tial equilibrium state, the pressur of the intern fluid and the 
extern fluid be equal. however, a the volum of the intern 
fluid be changed, a new equilibrium be achieved. A pressur dif- 
ferenc between the intern and extern fluid induc tension 
in the flexibl skin. thi tension will act on the skeleton, drive 
a transform that be regul by it structur geometri (fig. 
1C and movi s1). 

A simplifi mechan model be develop to describ the 
interact of the three compon of the artifici muscl (si 
appendix, fig. s1). In thi model, each structur void on a skele- 
ton be abstract a two connect rigid plates/beams. thi con- 
nection be model a a compress spring (stiffness: ks) for the 
void with two parallel plates/beams. If the void have two hing 
plates/beams, then the hing can be model a a torsion spring, 
or a two cantilev springs, with an initi open angl and 
a bend stiff k . the skin be model a a massless, flex- 
ible, and nonstretch membran between two plates/beams,

form a cylindr void. thi membrane’ geometri be approxi- 
mat a a parabol surface, and the skin’ elong and bend- 
ing deform be both neglect in thi model. If the intern 
pressur pin be low than the extern pressur pout (a neg 
pressur difference, ∆P < 0), the membran deform inward 
toward the void. under tension, the void will be driven to con- 
tract. In thi study, we focu primarili on neg pressure-driven 
artifici muscl due to their larg contract ratio and eas 
of fabrication. the membrane’ tension force, T , be produc by 
the pressur differ ∆P . thi forc be estim base on the 
laplac law a T = ∆P × R × W , where R be the radiu 
of curvatur of the membran and W be the width of the void. 
base on our model, the void’ force–contract interact can 
be predict use the principl of virtual work. We valid thi 
model by experi with a group of linear zigzag-typ actu- 
ators. the result show that our model could predict the output 
forc and free contract with maximum error of∼7% and 11% 
(at ∆P = −70 kpa), respectively. the detail for the theoreti- 
cal model and the experiment valid be describ in 
SI appendix. given thi accuraci of prediction, our model can be 
use to design the artifici muscl to desir performances. 

fabric method and materi choic 
As show in fig. 1D and movi s2, fabric of the propos 
artifici muscl follow three basic steps: construct of the 
deform skelet structure, prepar of the outer skin, and 
then assembl and sealing. the skeleton can be a spring, an 
origami-lik fold structure, or ani solid structur with hing 
or elast voids. To construct the skeleton with a give design,

a number of differ fabric techniqu can be used, such 
a 3D printing, machining, casting, forming, and even manual 
folding. onc the skeleton and skin be prepared, the skeleton 
be enclos by seal the skin. the seal process be dictat by 
the skin materi and can includ heat-pressing, gluing, welding, 
zippering, and sewing. It should be note that if a posit pres- 
sure be use to drive the artifici muscle, then the skin need to 
be fix at specif locat on the skeleton to produc tension 
to deform the skeleton (si appendix, fig. S3 a–c and movi s4). 
for the neg pressur case, the skin–skeleton fixat step be 
not necessary, a the skin will be tightli confin onto the skele- 
ton’ surface. 

use thi fabric method, a wide varieti of materi 
can be use to construct artifici muscl for particular appli- 
cations, deform patterns, and force-displac require- 
ment (fig. 2, movi s5, and SI appendix, fig. s7). the mate- 
rial use for construct the skeleton need to have a certain 
rigid to support the axial compress forc from the skin 
tension. although an artifici muscl can still work even after 
it skeleton be buckled, the contract ratio and forc produc- 
tion will be substanti reduced. We experi with two 
vacuum-driven muscl with differ wall thick of their 
skeleton (1 mm and 3 mm, respectively). A 20% reduct 
in block forc and a 50% decreas in free contract be 
observ after the thinner skeleton be buckl at −70 kpa (si 
appendix, fig. S4 A, D, and g). for the case of discret folds, the 
skeleton’ hing have to be compliant to allow the desir struc- 
tural transformation. for repeat actuation, skeleton elas- 
ticiti be also requir to bring the skeleton back to it initi 
configur after each actuation. To enhanc fluid circul 
and avoid jamming, the skeleton should have sever channel 
through it structure. 

fig. 3. variou basic actuat motion and programm pseudosequenti actuat with multipl degre of freedom. (a) A 19 cm-long linear zigzag 
actuat contract to a compress structur shorter than 2 cm. the 1D contract ratio be ∼90%. (b) A 2D origami skeleton use the miura-ori pattern 
(area: 11 × 10 cm2) can contract to a dens bar-shap structur (area: 9 × 1 cm2). the 2D area contract ratio approach 92%. (c) A 3D “magic- 
ball” origami use the water-bomb pattern (radius: 3.5 cm) contract to a compact cylindr structur (radius: 0.9 cm; height: 6.5 cm). the 3D volum 
decreas 91% after thi contraction. (d) bend motion can be achiev by use an asymmetr beam structur a the skeleton. (e) use a flasher 
origami pattern a the skeleton, the actuat rotat more than 90 degre around it center, and it 2D surfac contract by 54% simultaneously. (f) A 
complex out-of-plan motion combin torsion and contract can be program through a 2D miura-ori origami pattern with select fold weakened. 
(g) three finger on a robot hand be actuat at differ rate use a singl control of the intern air pressure. the skelet structur of thi robot 
hand be 3D print from nylon. differ hing strength insid the structur void be design for these three fingers, which produc significantli differ 
bend stiffnesses: ks1(red) < ks2(green) < ks3(blue). the bend stiff of each finger determin it own bend angl at a certain intern pressur 
level. (h) A bottl of water be gripped, lifted, and twist by a single-channel vacuum-driven robot arm. the robot arm have a modular structur includ 
a cup-shap gripper and a cylindr lifter. the gripper us a polyest magic-bal origami a it skeleton, while a much stiffer compress spring (302 
stainless steel) be use a the lifter’ skeleton. when the intern pressur decreas smoothly, the grip motion will alway start first, then the lift and 
twist motion start late a the intern pressur reduc further. 

In general, the skin must be resist to both the fluid insid 
and outsid of the skin. however, to demonstr the flexibil- 
iti in materi choic for these artifici muscles, a pva-bas 
actuat can be fulli dissolv in hot water (≈ 70 ◦c) within 5 
min (fig. 2C and movi s5). flexibl be also requir to allow 
easi bend dure actuation. An ideal inextens thin film 
materi can avoid undesir elong and bend deforma- 
tion on the skin when a pressur be applied. such skin deforma- 
tion will reduc the system’ perform and make the actua- 
tion difficult to control. In the comparison show in SI appendix, 
fig. S4 F and I, a linear actuat with 0.24 mm tpu-bas skin 
(tensil modulus: 25 mpa) produc ∼60% less contractil forc 
compar with use an actuat with 0.34 mm nylon fabric skin 
(tensil modulus: 460 mpa). suffici skin tensil strength must 
be maintain to effect transfer the tension forc induc 
by the fluidic pressure. In addition, the skin materi have to be 
amen to a conveni seal method. 

the choic of the fluid depend on the work environ 
and perform requirements. In addition, the fluid medium 
have to be compat with the materi use in the skeleton, skin, 
and seal process. In our current study, we focu on use the 
avail fluid surround the artifici muscle. In thi case, the 
intern fluid and the extern fluid be homogeneous, although 
use a differ intern fluid be also possibl for the artifici 
muscle. As demonstr in SI appendix, fig. s3d and movi 
s5, a 1 kg weight can be easili lift in the air by a cylindr 
muscl use water a the intern fluid (flow rate: 80 ml/min). A 
fluid with low viscos be ideal for achiev a rapid and energy- 
effici actuation. air be the most access fluid for make a 
lightweight artifici muscle, and the surround water can be 
directli use for actuat in an underwat environ (fig. 
2D and movi s5).

A varieti of jamming-bas mechan have be success- 
fulli develop for univers gripper (37, 38) and stiffness- 
tunabl robot (39–41). similar granular materi or layer 
structur can be use in foam to enhanc the function 
of stiff tune and object manipul (e.g., rigidifi when an 
object be grasped). these be appeal featur give the com- 
patibl with the foam concept both in term of structur and 
materi and with the use of neg pressure. 

programm motion 
A varieti of motion can be achiev by program the geom- 
etri of the skeleton (si appendix, fig. S8 and movi s6). 
assum the fluid pressur be constant everywher within the 
skin, the skeleton’ shape transform be determin by a com- 
binat of the contract from each individu structur void. 
ident void can be distribut over the skeleton use differ- 
ent arrang for gener variou synchron contrac- 
tions. A 90% linear contract can be produc by an origami 
skeleton use a symmetr zigzag geometri (fig. 3a). A skele- 
ton use a standard miura-ori origami pattern be abl to gener- 
ate a 2D surfac contract (92% contract ratio) when a vac- 
uum be appli (fig. 3b). A 3D skeleton use the water-bomb 
origami pattern can transform a spheric structur to a cylindri- 
cal structur (91% contract ratio) (fig. 3c). use an asym- 
metric arrang of the voids, a bend motion can be pro- 
duce on a beam-shap skeleton (fig. 3d). A flasher origami 
skeleton can gener a rotat (>90◦) and a 54% contract 
simultan use a singl vacuum suppli (fig. 3e). 

In addit to the programm arrang for ident 
voids, void with differ hing stiff can also be use 
to achiev differenti contractions. thi principl can gener 
asymmetr out-of-plan motions. for example, a 2D miura-ori 
origami skeleton with some hing weaken can realiz a 
complex motion that combin both torsion and contract 
(fig. 3f). furthermore, if the hing or connect stiff 
k be significantli distinct, then a control pseudosequen- 
tial motion can be gener by the artifici muscl (movi 
s6). for example, three finger on a robot hand (fig. 3G 
and SI appendix, fig. s8g), with a bending–stiff ratio 
ks1 : ks2 : ks3 ≈ 1 : 2 : 3, can be actuat at differ rate use 
a singl pressur control. In a second example, a pneumat- 
ical driven robot arm can first grip an object, then lift 
and twist the grip object. thi pseudosequenti multiax- 
ial manipul be achiev by a singl control pressure. In 
thi case, the gripper’ plastic skeleton (polyester, elast mod- 
ulu ≈5 gpa) be much more compliant than the metal skeleton 
(302 stainless steel, elast modulu ≈190 gpa) in the “arm” 
(fig. 3H and SI appendix, fig. s8h. although thi motion be 
not strictli sequential, we believ sequenti motion be possi- 
ble, if the respons be tune to be nonlinear, for exampl use 
a group of distinct snap-through hing integr into the 
skeleton (42, 43). 

perform character 
We character the forc and contract perform of 
the propos artifici muscl through a seri of quasi-stat 
experiments. A group of linear zigzag actuat with nylon skin 
be fabric with differ fold angl of their skeleton (si 
appendix, figs. s1e and s2i). A block forc of ∼428 N be 
gener use a regul −90 kpa vacuum supply. thi indi- 
cate that thi nylon-bas linear artifici muscl can provid 
an actuat stress of ∼600 kpa (approxim six time great 
than the sustain stress of mammalian skelet muscle) (1). 
the peak free-contract ratio be ∼50% without prestretch-

ping-pong ball (weight≈ 2.5 g, volume≈ 33.5 cm3). the actuat be primar- 
ili make of polyest sheet (skeleton thickness: 0.254 mm; skin thickness: 
0.038 mm). (b) It can lift object sever order of magnitud more massiv

formanc in load-lift tests. the actuat can lift a 1 kg load to 5.5 cm 
within 0.2 s (c). thi indic an averag power densiti of ∼1.04 kw/kg. A 
peak power densiti over 2 kw/kg be obtain dure the 2 kg load-lift 
test (d). 

our experiments, be neglig compar with an air cylin- 
der (si appendix, fig. S2 D and f), enhanc control 
when use the muscl either a a forc sourc or to control dis- 
placement (si appendix, fig. S5 C and d). To character the 
dynam perform includ power density, energi conver- 
sion efficiency, and bandwidth, we perform a group of load- 
lift experi use a polyester-bas lightweight artifici 
muscl (fig. 4A and movi s7). thi 10 cm-long linear actuat 
be fabric within 10 min, with materi cost less than $1. 
thi actuat weigh 2.6 g, and it can lift a 3 kg object within 0.2 s 
use a −80 kpa vacuum. the open-loop control bandwidth of 
thi actuat be ∼1.1 Hz (with a 0.5 kg load; see SI appendix, 
fig. s5e). the peak output power densiti obtain from our 
experi be over 2 kw/kg (fig. 4C and SI appendix, fig. 
s6e; the weight of the pressur sourc and associ plumb- 
ing be not included), more than six time the peak power 
densiti of mammalian skelet muscl (0.3 kw/kg) (1). the 
mechanical-to-mechan energi convers effici of the 
actuat be ∼23% (1 kg load, pneumat driven) and 59% 
(0.5 kg load, hydraul driven) in our load-lift experi 
(si appendix, fig. s6d). however, the electrical-to-mechan 
energi effici be ∼2% to 5%, when miniatur electr 
vacuum pump be includ into the system (si appendix, fig. 
s6c). We should note that the actuat use for characteri- 
zation have not be optim for force, displacement, band- 
width, or energy/power. our experiment result reveal that 
the propos artifici muscl be powerful, fast, and energi 
efficient. 

conclus 
In thi study, we have demonstr a concept of foams. these 
muscl can be easili make from a larg varieti of materials, and 
they be abl to gener powerful, efficient, and programm

multidimension actuation. thi techniqu allow u to quickli 
program, fabricate, and implement actuat system for veri 
specif work environ at multipl scales, such a activ 
metamateri (44), miniatur surgic devic (45, 46), wearabl 
robot exoskeleton (47), transform architecture, a well a 
deep-sea manipul (48) and larg deploy structur for 
space explor (49, 50). the use of neg pressur offer 
a safer way of actuat for foam compar with artifici 
muscl driven by highli pressur fluids. thi be a promis 
featur for futur applic in wearabl devic and human– 
robot interactions. 

materi and method 
the block forc and free contract be obtain use a univers test- 
ing machin (instron 5544a, instron corporation). A laser displac sen- 
sor (lk-031 and lk-2001, keyenc corporation) be use to measur the 

skin deform (si appendix, fig. S1 F and g). the muscle’ load-lift 
motion be record by a camera and then analyz (speed and height) 
use image-analyz softwar in each test. A laser cutter be use to 
cut thin-sheet skeletons, and most of the other skeleton be built by 3D 
printer use differ materi (e.g., nylon, tpu, etc.). A varieti of thin- 
sheet materials, such a tpu, pvc, polyester, and tpu-coat nylon fabric, 
be use to make the skins. the major of the skin be directli seal 
by an impuls heat sealer (aie-410fl, american intern electric, inc.) 
use proper seal time for the differ skin materi (si appendix, 
tabl s1). more detail can be found in SI appendix.
