regression-bas algorithm have show to be good at denois mont carlo (mc) render by leverag it inexpens by-product 
(e.g., featur buffers). however, when use higher-ord model to handl complex cases, these techniqu often overfit to nois in the 
input. for thi reason, supervis learn method have be propos that train on a larg collect of refer examples, but they use 
explicit filter that limit their denois ability. To address these problems, we propos a novel, supervis learn approach that allow the 
filter kernel to be more complex and gener by leverag a deep convolut neural network (cnn) architecture. In one embodi of 
our framework, the cnn directli predict the final denois pixel valu a a highli non-linear combin of the input features. In a second 
approach, we introduc a novel, kernel-predict network which us the cnn to estim the local weight kernel use to comput each 
denois pixel from it neighbors. We train and evalu our network on product data and observ improv over state-of-the-art 
MC denoisers, show that our method gener well to a varieti of scenes. We conclud by analyz variou compon of our 
architectur and identifi area of further research in deep learn for MC denoising.
