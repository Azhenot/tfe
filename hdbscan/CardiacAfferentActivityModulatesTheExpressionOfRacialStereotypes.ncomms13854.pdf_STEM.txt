neg racial stereotyp tend to associ black peopl with threat. thi often lead to the 

misidentif of harmless object a weapon held by a black individual. yet, littl be 

know about how bodili state impact the express of racial stereotyping. By tap into 

the phasic activ of arteri baroreceptors, know to be associ with chang in the 

neural process of fear stimuli, we show activ of race-threat stereotyp synchro- 

nize with the cardiovascular cycle. across two establish tasks, stimulu depict black or 

white individu be present to coincid with either the cardiac systol or diastole. 

result show increas race-driven misidentif of weapon dure systole, when bar- 

oreceptor affer fire be maximal, rel to diastole. importantly, a third studi examin 

the posit black-athlet stereotyp associ fail to demonstr similar modul 

by cardiac cycle. We identifi a body–brain interact wherein interocept cue can mod- 

ulat threat apprais and racial bia behaviour in context-depend ways.

We seem more 'racist' when expos to alarm pictur dure activ part of heartbeat cycle... OK and then :) 



R 
ecent statist from usa reveal that black american be 
more than twice a like to be unarm when kill dure 
encount with polic a white people1. thi be a strike 

exampl of how implicit stereotyp in physiolog arous 
context may influenc behaviour even among those who do not 
conscious endors them. notably, laboratori research have 
replic thi pattern among univers students2 and polic 
officers3,4, demonstr that peopl be more like to 
misidentifi harmless object a weapon when associ with a 
black individual5 and be more prone to ‘shoot’ unarm black 
targets2–4. 

At the neural level, research have show that the mere 
percept of black individu may trigger a pattern of neuro- 
physiolog respons consist with rapid activ of the 
threat-signal system, such a increas activ in the 
amygdala6 and enhanc startl potentiation6,7. Of interest, two 
studi have explor the effect of anxieti in the express of 
black-threat associ and found that high cortisol reactiv to 
stress may exacerb vigil for racial threat cues8 and reduc 
the abil to control stereotyp behaviour9. these studi hint to 
an influenc of alter state of psycho-physiolog arous 
on racial bia behaviour, especi in relat to anxieti 
and alter pattern of physiolog respons (for example, 
ref 10–12). however, the physiolog affer mechan that 
underpin the feedback of physiolog state to the brain be 
typic overlooked. one contribut factor to thi oversight be 
the rel difficulti in character the mechan through 
which bodili state interact with percept and cognition, 
becaus it be methodolog challeng to disentangl affer 
‘body-to-brain’ effect from effer ‘brain-to-body’ respons or 
arousal-rel mental states13,14. 

one promin channel of bodi and brain commun be 
that convey by baroreceptors, pressur and stretch-sensit 
receptor within the heart and surround arteries. within each 
cardiac cycle, burst of baroreceptor affer activ encod the 
strength and time of each heartbeat be carri via the vagu 
and glossopharyng nerv affer to the nucleu of the solitari 
tract15. thi repres the major mechan for fast and short- 
term regul of blood pressure, through which increas in 
blood pressur trigger a parasympathetic-medi reflex slow 
of the follow heartbeat and induc sympatho-inhibitori 
peripher vasodilatation13,15,16. importantly, thi be also the 
princip rout that commun to the brain the dynam state 
of the heart, enabl the represent of cardiovascular arous 
within viscerosensori brain regions, and influenc ascend 
neuromodul system implic in emot and 
motiv behaviour17. becaus arteri baroreceptor be 
activ by the arteri puls pressur wave, their phasic 
discharg be maxim dure and immedi after the cardiac 
systole, that is, when the blood be eject from the heart, and 
minim dure cardiac diastole, that is, between heartbeats18,19. 
capit on this, recent develop experiment paradigm 
propos that it be possibl to explor the impact of thi 
interocept signal on psycholog process by time the 
brief present of stimulu to the differ phase of the cardiac 
cycle. In particular, it be observ that when certain categori 
of stimulu be present dure systol versu diastole, stimulu 
process be enhanc or attenuated. thi be typic take a 
evid that concurr baroreceptor fire modul brain– 
bodi interact across a varieti of psycholog domains, 
includ the process of sensory20,21 and painful18,22 stimuli, 
and cognit process such a short-term23 and long-term24 

memory. Of particular interest for the present study, previou 
research use thi experiment approach found that the neural 
represent of certain emot stimuli, such a fear facial 
expressions, be co-modul with baroreceptor signals25,26. In 

particular, the detect and apprais of fear face be enhanc 
at systol and diminish at diastole, when the central repre- 
sentat of cardiovascular arous is, respectively, maxim and 
minimal. At the neural level, these baroreceptor-rel effect in 
the process of threat stimulu be thought to be associ with 
chang in the engag of brain system involv in 
emot process and autonom regul includ the 
amygdala and the insula19,26,27. 

thus, thi experiment approach allow the present 
of stimulu in discret yet short-term physiolog context 
(baroreceptor activ or quiescence) to individu the pote- 
ntial influenc that heart-to-brain signal have on cognit and 
behaviour without induc the subject experi of alter 
cardiovascular arousal17. here, we appli thi strategi to 
investig how the cardiac cycl modul the process 
(studi 1) and behaviour express (studi 2) of racial 
stereotypes. On the basi of the know effect of cardiac cycl 
in fear processing17,26, we expect that racial stimulu present 
at systole, compar with those present at diastole, would be 
associ with great racial bia when activ threat-rel 
stereotyp (studi 1 and 2) but not when associ with 
posit racial stereotyp (studi 3). 

result 
cardiac effect in weapon identif task. In studi 1, we 
use the weapon identif task (wit)5, a task design to 
ass the implicit stereotyp of black individu a dangerous. 
particip be requir to make fast discrimin between 
imag of handgun or tool prim with pictur of black or 
white individuals’ face (fig. 1). becaus face percept acti- 
vate semant knowledg associ with each group categori 
(for example, black-threat), the presenc of racial bia be typic 
reflect by improv identif of handgun and reduc 
identif of tool when preced by black prime compar 
with white primes5,9. We time the present of the prime to 
coincid with the systol (that is, b300 m after the r-wave) or 
diastol (that is, b500 m after the r-wave) phase of the cardiac 
cycle. thi show that affer cardiac activ influenc 
the express of racial bias, a demonstr by the signi- 
ficant three-way interact prime (black/white)� object 
(tool/weapon)� cardiac cycl (systole/diastole) on a repeat 
measur anova (n¼ 30) on accuraci rates, f(1,29)¼ 36.58, 
po0.001, z2¼ 0.56. the interact prime� object be also 
significant, f(1,29)¼ 24.69, po0.001, z2¼ 0.46, replic the 
overal racial bia pattern typic observ in thi task. break 
down the interact accord to object type confirm thi 
effect in the identif of both tool (f(1,29)¼ 19.36, 
po0.001, z2¼ 0.40) and weapon (f(1,29)¼ 14.13, P¼ 0.001, 
z2¼ 0.32). plan comparisons, use two-tail pair t-test 
(n¼ 30), reveal good identif of weapon (t(1,29)¼ 5.06, 
po0.001, cohen’ d¼ 0.92) after black (versu white) prime 
and tool (t(1,29)¼ 8.44, po0.001, cohen’ d¼ 1.54) after white 
(versu black) prime at systol but not at diastol (tso0.71, 
ps40.45, cohen’ dso0.13; fig. 1). In other words, the 
process of racial cue when the central signal of cardiac 
activ be maxim (at systole), compar with when it be 
minim (at diastole), result in an increas in stereotyp errors. 
importantly, the cardiac cycl modul of prime effect be 
depend on semant associ between the prime and the 
object, sinc black face present at systol diminish the 
identif of tool yet improv the identif of weapons. 
We also carri out analysi on accuraci accord to the signal 
detect theori (sdt)28 to explor how the abil to discri- 
minat between tool and weapon (d0) and bia in respons 
tendenc (c) vari accord to prime type and cardiac cycle.

for that, we calcul separ d0 and C index a a function of 
prime and cardiac cycl and enter them into separ prime 
(black/white)� cardiac cycl (systole/diastole) repeat meas- 
ure anova (n¼ 30). analys on d0 index reveal that 
neither the interact nor the main effect be signific 
(fs(1,29)o0.93, ps40.34, zs2o0.031). conversely, both the 
interact prime� cardiac cycl (f(1,29)¼ 42.01, po0.001, 
z2¼ 0.59) and main effect of race (f(1,29)¼ 20.25, po0.001, 
z2¼ 0.41), but not the main effect of cardiac cycl (f(1,29)¼ 0.06, 
P¼ 0.82, z2o0.01), be found to have signific effect in 
C. together, sdt result confirm that cardiac cycl do not 
influenc object discrimin per se (d0) but enhanc the 
respons bia (c) a a function of prime type. 

accord to theori of implicit cognition29,30, perform 
in thi task be a product of differ sub-process that can be 
categor a automatic, that is, the activ of racial asso- 
ciations, and controlled, that is, the abil to detect a correct 
respons and overcom automat associations. use the perfor- 
manc dissoci procedur (pdp)5,30, we be abl to comput 
independ estim of these sub-process and explor the 
effect of cardiac cycl in each of them. for that, index of 
automat and control process be enter into separ 
repeat measur anova (n¼ 30) with prime (black/white) 
and cardiac cycl (systole/diastole) a within-subject factors. 
interestingly, an effect of cardiac cycl be observ in automat 
(f(1,29)¼ 28.13, po0.001, z2¼ 0.49) but not in contro- 
lled process (f(1,29)¼ 0.91, P¼ 0.35, z2¼ 0.03), such that 

present prime at systol lead to enhanc activ of racial 
stereotypes. In other words, a control behaviour fail due to 
the need to provid time-constrain decisions, automat 
associ influenc behaviour, particularli when prime 
be present at systole. conversely, neither the interact 
of prime� cardiac cycl (automatic: f(1,29)¼ 0.35, P¼ 0.56, 
z2¼ 0.01; controlled: f(1,29)¼ 2.0, P¼ 0.17, z2¼ 0.06) nor the 
main effect of prime (automatic: f(1,29)¼ 2.29, P¼ 0.14, 
z2¼ 0.07; controlled: f(1,29)¼ 1.16, P¼ 0.29, z2¼ 0.04) be 
significant, suggest a similar influenc of cardiac cycl on the 
automat process of black-weapon and white-tool associa- 
tions. It should be note that the seemingli unexpect associa- 
tion white-tool be in fact a consequ of contextu contrast 
effect typic observ in evalu prim tasks31. that is, 
give the predomin associ black-threat in thi task, non- 
threaten object are, by contextu contrast, associ with 
white face lead to a respons pattern reflect the

ntialli arm individual. In each trial, particip be present 
with a photo of a white or black male hold either a gun 
or a harmless object in hi hand. particip be requir to make 
the time-constrain decis to ‘shoot’ or ‘not to shoot’ base 
on whether the person be hold a gun or anoth object, respec- 
tively. typically, particip be more like to shoot unarm 
black individu than unarm white individuals2–4. By time 
the onset of stimulu present to coincid with cardiac systol 
or diastole, we test the influenc of affer cardiovasc- 
ular inform on the express of racial bia (fig. 2). 
similarli to studi 1, the three-way interact object (weapon/no 
weapon)� race (black/white)� cardiac cycl (systole/diastole) on 
the repeat measur anova (n¼ 30) on accuraci rate be 
found to be significant, f(1,29)¼ 5.40, P¼ 0.027, z2¼ 0.16, 
confirm the effect of cardiac cycl on racial bia decision- 
making. the prime� object interaction, f(1,29)¼ 4.38, P¼ 0.045, 
z2¼ 0.13, be also significant, replic the overal racial bia 
pattern typic observ in thi task. separ analysi on the 
cardiac cycle� race interact for each object type reveal that 
the phase of the cardiac cycl modul racial bia respons

risons, use two-tail pair t-test (n¼ 30), further reveal that 
particip ‘shot’ more often unarm black target than white 
target when the stimulu be present at systole, t(1,29)¼ 3.02, 

P¼ 0.015, cohen’ d¼ 0.55, but not at diastole, t(1,29)¼ � 0.46, 
P¼ 0.71, cohen’ d¼ 0.08 (fig. 2). thus, in line with studi 1, 
present stimulu dure period of enhanc represent of 
cardiac activ be associ with increas salienc of racial cues, 
lead to an increas likelihood of shoot ‘unarmed’ black 
individuals. however, cardiac cycl do not modul racial bia on 
arm trials, f(1,29)¼ 1.08, P¼ 0.31, z2¼ 0.04 (main effect of race: 
f(1,29)¼ 0.80, P¼ 0.38, z2¼ 0.03; main effect of cardiac cycle: 
f(1,29)¼ 0.02, P¼ 0.88, z2o0.01). while we have predict cardiac 
cycl to modul behaviour respons to arm target a well, 
these result be not surpris a thi task may be less sensit to 
the detect of cardiac cycl effect over racial cue in the ‘armed’ 
condit for at least two reasons: (i) task instruct encourag 
particip to provid a ‘shoot’ respons (see ‘methods’ section) 
lead to gener high accuraci in ‘armed’ trials. cardiac 
cycl effect may be less like to be observ when perform 
approach cell levels; (ii) in these trial an object 
threaten stimulu be present independ of the target’ race 
which may further hinder the observ of the expect bia in 
activ of racial threat stereotyp by cardiac cycle. 

We also carri out sdt analysi by submit d0 and C

(n¼ 30), fail to identifi differ between condit 
(ts(1,29)o2.04, ps40.11, cohen’ dso0.38) and therefor these 
result should be interpret with caution. No signific 
interact nor main effect in respons criterion a a function 
of race and cardiac cycl (fs(1,29)o3.02, ps40.093, zs2o0.10) 
be found. the appar contrast result between ‘c’ and 
main analysi in accuraci rate should be explain by the fact 
that, a discuss above, perform approach cell level in 
the ‘armed’ conditions. that is, while d0 and C index 
simultan consid decis in both ‘armed’ and ‘unarmed’ 
conditions, baroreceptor effect be onli found to modul race 
bia in ‘unarmed’ trials. 

In condit of rel ambigu and/or when act under 
pressure, such a when a polic offic need to make a split- 
second decis of whether to shoot or not, contextu cue may 
have a strong influenc on judgment and behaviour. although 
seemingli irrelev for the discrimin between a weapon 
and a harmless object, social (for example, black versu white 
individuals) and contextu (for example, dark alley versu rich 
neighbourhood) cue may shift perceptu judgment and 
increas the probabl of perceiv the situat a threating32. 
likewise, emot state of anger33, anxieti and sustain state

relat stimuli34 and influenc racial bia behaviour8,9. We 
extend these observ by demonstr the discret power of

wherein preconsci fluctuat in interocept affer

relat behaviour. importantly, our result identifi for the first 
time, bottom-up body-to-brain correl for racial bia 
behaviour. thi repres a clear departur from the tradit 
approach that do not differenti affer from effer effects. 
that is, past studi measur physiolog respons to racial 
stimulu or use anxieti enhanc techniqu that, although 
elicit state of bodili arousal8,9, do not disentangl the discret 
modulatori effect of affer bodili signal from that of anxiety-

the critic physiolog condit be like to reflect rapid 
neural signal cardiovascular states, allow u to observ 
within-particip fluctuat in the express of racial bia and 
explor the influenc that body-to-brain signal may have on 
social threat process and intergroup biases.

we time the present of prime to coincid with the systol

black) faces. however, cardiac cycl do not modul thi bia in 
either case (fs(1,29)o1.05, ps40.31, zsso0.035; fig. 3). 
analys of d0 reveal that neither the cardiac cycle� prime 
interact (repeat measur anova, n¼ 30) nor the main 
effect be signific (fs(1,29)o0.51, ps40.48, zs2o0.02). 
conversely, an effect of prime (f(1,29)¼ 9.38, P¼ 0.005, 
z2¼ 0.24) could be observ in respons bias, show that 
black prime induc a great tendenc to provid the sport- 
object response. neither the main effect of cardiac cycl 
(f(1,29)¼ 2.1, P¼ 0.149, z2¼ 0.07) nor the interact be 
signific (f(1,29)¼ 1.18, P¼ 0.29, z2¼ 0.04), confirm that 
cardiac cycl do not modul racial bias. thus, togeth these 
studi show that cardiac cycl effect on the express of 
implicit racial bia be not the same across all social stereotyp (see 
supplementari note 1 for a statist comparison between studi 
1 and studi 3). importantly, the fact that prime in studi 3 
induc a robust behaviour bia confirm that the result 
report in studi 1 and 2 do not reflect a gener baroreceptor 
effect over pure perceptu or inhibitori processes37,38 but instead 
depend on the contextu and semant content of the activ 
associations. 

black-threat and black-athlet stereotyp differ in sever 
ways, but perhaps, most significantli they differ in term of 
valenc and salienc of the associ emotions. thi might be the 
key for the differ result observed. the impact of incom 
interocept inform on the activ of semant and 
affect reaction should depend on the relev that bodili 
state of arous have in the express of the associ emot 
and conting behaviour response. In condit of high vigil- 
ance, such a when discrimin between a weapon and a 
harmless object, the feedback of bodili state may be particularli 
inform in guid behaviour. convers the positive, and 
presum motiv less relevant, stereotyp black-athlet 
may reli to a lesser extent on bodili information. thi be in line 
with previou research show preferenti baroreceptor-rel 
modul in the process of certain emot categories, 
notabl fear17,26. We suggest that those form of bia associ 
with strong emotional, or motivational, content may be parti- 
cularli sensit to feedback of cardiovascular arousal, a reveal 
by the potenti of effect within the cardiac cycle. 

discuss 
there be a grow consensu that the continu dynam 
cortic represent of intern bodili states, such a the one 
convey by cardiac affer signals, shape emot and set the 
foundat for a sens of self a the basi for subject 
experience13,14,39–43. It be also believ that preconsci short- 
term fluctuat in baroreceptor activ provid the physio- 
logic context through which body–brain effect can modul 
the process of, and subsequ neurophysiolog respons 
to, sensory18,20–22 and emotional25,26 stimuli. here, by synchro-

investigate, without induc sustain state of psycho- 
physiolog arousal, how the process of complex social 
stimulu and associ behaviour consequ may chang in 
condit in which the represent of cardiac activ in the

causal relationship between baroreceptor fire and racial 
bia behaviour be difficult to confirm empirically, our result 
suggest that thi interocept mechan may constitut a 
channel for body-to-brain influenc in the process of

arteri baroreceptor signal be carri by cranial nerv 
X and XI directli to the nucleu of the solitari tract, which in turn 
have proxim connect with region such a the thalamu and 
the amygdala. the observ of the enhanc activ 
of a neg racial stereotyp by cardiac affer inform 
be like to be underpin by function chang in these region 
and in particular within the amygdala, a centr alreadi implic 
in baroreceptor effect on the process of salient19 and 
fear stimuli17,26. moreover, specif amygdala nucleu play central 
role in cod the salienc and associ relev of 
perceptu stimuli44–46, particularli in the context of threat 
processing, includ the modul of attent to fear-relev 
stimuli, fear condit and regul of autonom state 
of fear and anxiety47,48. amygdala nucleu be also engag in 
out-group face perception, threat detect and learn of social 
fears49,50. interestingli however, amygdala activ to racial 
out-group stimulu be modul by the social-cognit goal and 
the presenc of threat-rel cues51,52. thus, the observ 
exagger of racial bia in a highli salient, threat-rel 

context be like to be mediat through modul of amygdala 
respons by interocept signal origin in phasic 
arteri baroreceptor activity. In other words, in the context of 
alert to threat-signal stimuli, amygdala respons to 
relev environment cue may be modul by the strength 
and qualiti of the cardiac signals. 

anoth possibl parallel mechan relat to the know inhi- 
bitori effect of cardiovascular baroreceptor fire on activ 
within high order cortic region includ dorsolater pref- 
rontal cortex, via influenc on thalamocort gating, reduc 
the abil to inhibit prepot responses38. the implic 
would be that baroreceptor activ would increas the express 
of racial stereotyp by compromis the abil to overcom 
undesir automat responses. while these mechan be 
not mutual exclusive, two piec of evid favour the tent 
explan of enhanc activ of semant associ 
mediat by amygdala. first, our pdp analysi pinpoint an effect 
over automat but not control processes. second, black- 
athlet stereotyp also activ prepot respons but these 
be not modul by cardiac timing. futur studi may help to 
elucid thi further.

with studi 1, thi effect be not modul by cardiac cycle. togeth with the result from studi 1, studi 3 show that cardiac cycl effect in the

diastol but such interpret should be do with caution. the 
experiment approach use here compar rel contribut 
of the central represent of cardiovascular arous in the 
process of certain social stimulu by tap into the extrem 
of ongo fluctuat of baroreceptor activ which co-vari 
with the cardiac cycle. past research on cardiac time argu for 
the rel natur of baroreceptor effect (for example, 
ref 26,38), that is, a rel enhanc of fear process at 
systol and an inhibit at diastole26. garfinkel et al.26 also 
show that the rel inhibit of fear process at diastol 
be particularli evid among low anxieti individuals, and 
suggest that the diminish inhibit of threat process in 
anxiou individu may reflect a mechan contribut to the 
exacerb of fear signal in anxiety. while we have not 
measur anxieti level among our participants, we specul that 
a similar mechan may be at play here. inhibit of racial bia 
at diastol may reflect a mechan through which the signal 
of threat by member of a social group be attenuated. It be know 
that anxieti and sustain state of arous impact and exacerb 
intergroup biases10–12. without inhibitori mechan such a 
the one propos here racial associ would be more like to 
escal over time, promot anxieti and reduc the abil to 
control racial bias. thi account be consist with current 
amygdala-centr model of learn and express of avers 
social associations49,50, accord to which the amygdala nucleu 
serv two main functions: (i) form and store associ between 
somatosensori state and represent of particular stimulu 
(for example, black individuals); (ii) and mediat the physio- 
logic respons to the associ stimuli. our result build up on 
thi by suggest the influenc of the rel strength or 
weak of affer cardiac sensat in the flexibl enhan- 
cement and suppress of amygdala respons to conditio- 
ned stimuli. however, further research be need to determin 
how interocept signal contribut to the promot of anxieti 
in intergroup interactions. 

lastly, while the present research focu on threat-rel 
processes, we have no reason to believ that these associ 
between cardiac cycl and the potenti of social associ 
be specif to race or fear processing. indeed, we predict the 
extens of these effect to other social groups/stereotyp 
associ with substanti affect or motiv relevance. 
We suggest thi may be an import body-to-brain mechan 
affect the process of salient social signal and subsequ 
action accordingly. In line with current account highlight the 
predict inferenti natur of the brain, the (mis)percept of a 
gun or an object be a consequ of prediction-bas percept 
shape by previou social associ and concurr bodili 
signal (53). futur research should investig the neural 
underpin of these effects, a well a the function correl 
and the appar inhibit of neg racial bia in condit of 
quiescent baroreceptor firing. To the extent that thi body-to- 
brain mechan can be use a an intervent to acceler 
unlearn of fear or threat-rel stimuli, our result may have a 
substanti impact in the develop of train intervent in 
profession set where neg stereotyp may play a 
crucial role.

participants. In studi 1, data be collect from 32 (24 females; mean age¼ 21.8, 
s.d.¼ 4.4) white healthi volunteers. data from two particip be exclud from 
analysi due to incorrect use of respons key or noisi electrocardiogram (ecg)

ecg recording. three dispos ecg electrod be place in a modifi lead I 
chest configuration: two electrod be posit underneath the left and right 
collarbon and anoth on the participant’ low back on the left side. the 
ecg signal be record with a powerlab 8/35 (powerlab, adinstruments, 
http://www.adinstruments.com/) use labchart 8 pro software. the sampl rate 
be 1,000 Hz and a hardwar band-pass filter (bio amp 132) between 0.3 and 
1,000 Hz be applied. heartbeat be detect onlin with a hardwar base 
function (fast output response), which identifi the ecg r-wave with a delay 
small than 1 m (www.adinstruments.com/) by detect when the amplitud 
exce an individu defin threshold. intern lab report use thi method 
confirm that the softwar present the stimulu receiv the transistor-transistor 
logic (ttl) puls signal a heartbeat and be abl to process it within o2 ms. 

becaus our design includ the present of a mask/background imag up 
to 600 m befor the prime/target pictur onset, and therefor previou to the 
refer r-wave, the time of occurr of the refer heartbeat have to be 
predicted. thi be achiev with a custom-mad software, implement in matlab 
(matworks, http://uk.mathworks.com/), base on the time of the three preced 
r-waves. the reliabl of thi predict method be test by measur 
a-posteriori the time distanc between stimulu onset and the previou r-wave. the 
histogram of cumul frequenc of stimulu onset (ms) rel to the r-wave 
peak for each cardiac cycl condit be display in fig 1–3b. despit the high 
predict power of our method, some overlap between systol and diastol trial 
be present. To address thi issue, trial be re-cod accord to the actual 
stimulu onset. follow previou literature, the systol period be defin a 
200–400 m after the r-wave (for example, ref 18,26,54), which be the period of 
maxim represent of baroreceptor affer activ and when cardiac cycl 
effect be typic observed. diastole, the remain period of the cardiac cycle, 
be defin a 450–800 m after the r-wave. stimuli present between 400 and 
450 m be exclud a the 400–450 m window repres a challeng for the 
accur classif of systole/diastole. for example, physiologically, the 
present of a stimulu at 395 m should not be too differ from anoth 
present at 405 m but with thi classif method they be expect to have 
opposit effects. trial in which stimulu be present after 800 m or between 
0–200 m after the r-wave be also exclud to avoid the possibl that target 
onset (which follow immedi primes) partial overlap with the systol 
period. across the three studi percentag of exclud stimulu be small than 
10.5%. 

studi 1. weapon identif task. stimuli consist of black and white photo 
adapt from5,55. prime be photo of a black or white male face with neutral 
expression55. twelv black and 12 white model be used. target stimulu 
consist of a photo of a handgun or a tool (for example, wrench, pliers). six 
differ tool and handgun be used. present time be adapt to 
allow synchron with the cardiac cycle. the prime be present for 200 m 
with the onset time to coincid either with the end of the systol phase (that is, 
b300 m after the r-wave) or dure the diastol period (that is, b500 m after 
the r-wave). immedi after, the target be present for 150 ms. these 
present time be adopt so that prime be present at systol or 
diastol and target onset occur outsid the critic systol period. thi allow 
u to investig the effect of baroreceptor activ in the activ of racial 
stereotyp and not in the process or respons to threat-rel objects. befor 
the prime and after the target a mask be present for 600 and 300 ms, 
respectively, independ of cardiac cycl condition. A fixat cross in the centr 
of the screen be display between trials. inter-tri interv consist in the 
(variable) time period necessari to detect four heartbeat and predict the time of 
the subsequ cardiac cycl dure which the stimulu would be presented. 
participants’ task be to press the ‘i’ key, with their right hand, if the target be a 
weapon and the ‘e’ key, with their left hand, if the target be a tool. they be 
instruct to be a fast and accur a possibl and be told that failur to 
provid an answer within 500 m would lead to a feedback warn ‘pleas tri to be 
quicker’. nevertheless, to allow reaction time analyses, respons latenc up to 
650 m be collected. respons key associ with weapon and tool be not 
counterbal across participants. thi may not be ideal, a it may lead to an 
unbalanc use of the domin hand to identifi one of the target and influenc 
the abil to quickli respond to weapon versu tools. nevertheless, give the 
within-participant-and-target natur of our effect of interest, it should have no 
influenc on the observ behaviour pattern relat to cardiac cycl effects. 
A total of 264 trials, 33 per condition, be present in a fulli random order. 
half-way through the task, particip be ask to rest for at least two minutes. 
In order to familiar particip with the stimulu and task procedures, two 
practic block be administered. In the first practic block, compris of 12 trials, 
no prime be present and no time limit be give for target identification. the

second practic block consist of 12 trial in which prime and the respons time 
limit be introduced. 

accuraci rate (that is, on-tim correct respons divid by the number of 
trials) be analys both through standard analysi of variance, that is, prime 
(black/white)� object (tool/weapon)� cardiac cycl (systole/diastole) anova, 
and accord to sdt. In the sdt analyses, separ d0 and C index be 
estim a a function of prime and cardiac cycl and enter into separ prime 
(black/white)� cardiac cycl (systole/diastole) anovas. ‘hit rates’ be defin 
a the percentag of correct respons to weapon and ‘fals alarms’ a the 
percentag of incorrect respons to tools. 

We have also use the pdp to estim the contribut of automat 
(pdp-automatic) and control (pdp-control) process to perform in thi 
task. pdp-control index be estim separ for black and white prime 
condit by subtract error rate on stereotyp incongru trial (black-tool 
and white-weapon, respectively) from accuraci on stereotyp congruent trial 
(black-weapon and white-tool, respectively). pdp-automat index be 
comput by divid error rate on stereotyp incongru trial by the respect 
reciproc of pd-control scores5. cardiac cycl effect be explor by estim 
these index separ for trial at systol and diastole. 

all P valu from post hoc comparison be correct use the newman–

(supplementari fig. 2). pleas refer to onlin supplementari inform for: 
(i) analysi refer to participant’ individu interocept accuracy56 

(supplementari note 2) and (ii) a figur show the distribut of stereotyp

studi 2. first person shooter task. stimuli consist of pictur take from2,3 
depict white and black male individu hold a handgun or anoth object 
(for example, mobil phone, wallet). particip be instruct to act a a polic 
offic and ‘shoot’ the target by press the key ‘i’, with their right hand, if he have 
a gun and ‘not to shoot’ him by press the ‘e’ key, with their left hand, if he do 
not have a gun. respons key associ with weapon and tool be not 
counterbal across participants. each trial begin with the present of a 
background imag (for example, a street, a park) for 400–500 m after which the 
target imag be superimpos for 200 ms. the present of the target be time- 
lock to coincid with systol (that is, b300 m after the r-wave) or diastol 
(that is, b500 m after the r-wave). unlik previou research with thi task, we do 
not present a random number of background befor the target onset due to time 
constrain link with the synchron with heart timings. A fixat cross be 
present on the centr of the screen for the entir inter-trial-interval. the task 
compris a total of 180 trial (23 per condition) but onli 148 differ pictur 
be used, mean that 32 pictures, randomli select for each participant, be 
present twice. stimuli to be present at systol and diastol be also randomli 
select for each participant. half-way through the task, particip be ask to 
rest for at least two minutes. the task includ two block of practic trials, 
compris by 12 trial each. the imag present be differ from those use 
in the experiment task. No time limit be give for respons in the first practic 
block. In the second block the respons time limit be introduced. 

particip be told that if they fail to make a key press within 650 m they 
would receiv the feedback ‘pleas tri to be quicker’. nonetheless, to allow reaction 
time analyses, respons up to 1,000 m after target onset be collected. 
particip be award and deduct point on the basi of their perform 
(shoot arm targets: þ 10 points; not shoot unarm targets: þ 5 points; 
shoot unarm targets: � 20 points; not shoot arm targets: � 40 points; 
fail to give an answer within 650 ms: � 10 points). these payoff be 
implement to partial simul the payoff matrix experienc by polic offic 
on the street2. they be also told that the 3 best player from the entir pool of 
particip would be award a reward (d20–first place; d10–second place; 
d5–third place). accuraci feedback and updat total of point be provid after 
each trial (see supplementari method 1 for further details). 

accuraci rate (that is, the ratio between on-tim correct respons and the 
number of valid trials) be analys both through standard analysi of varianc 
and accord to sdt. here, ‘hit rates’ be defin a the percentag of correct 
respons in the ‘shoot’ condit and ‘fals alarms’ a the percentag of error in 
the ‘don’t shoot’ condition. P valu from post hoc comparison be correct 
use the newman–keul method. 

particip also carri out the implicit associ test55 to measur how 
perform in the fpst relat to gener implicit attitud toward black 
individu (see supplementari note 3). pleas refer to onlin supplementari 
inform for: (i) analysi of reaction time (supplementari fig. 4) and 
(ii) a figur show the distribut of stereotyp error across particip at 
the differ phase of the cardiac cycl (supplementari fig. 3b) 

studi 3. sport-fruit identif task. procedur and experiment design be 
equival to that of studi 1 with the except of the target stimulu used. here, 
particip have to discrimin between pictur of fruit (for example, apple, 
grapes, cherries) and sport-object (for example, basketbal ball, weights, skate- 
board)35. thi task tap into the stereotyp of black individu a athletic35,36. ten 

black and white pictur of each stimulu categori be used. the ‘e’ and ‘i’ key 
be assign to fruit and sport-rel objects, respectively. 

As in studi 1, accuraci rate (that is, on-tim correct respons divid by the 
number of trials) be analys both through standard analysi of varianc and 
accord to sdt. In the sdt analyses, ‘hit rates’ be defin a the percentag of 
correct respons to sport-object and ‘fals alarms’ a the percentag of incorrect 
respons to fruits. 

analys of reaction time reveal equival result (supplementari fig. 5). 
pleas refer to onlin supplementari inform for a figur show the 
distribut of stereotyp error across particip at the differ phase of the
